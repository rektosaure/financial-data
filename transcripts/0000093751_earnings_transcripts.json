The only authorized broadcast of this call will be housed on the State Street website.\nNow I would like to hand the call over to Elizabeth Lynn.\n\nElizabeth Lynn\n\nExecutive VP & Global Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us.

Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our view should change.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Ron.\n\nRonald Philip O’Hanley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, State Street Corporation\n\nThank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to welcome John Woods to his first earnings call with State Street. John brings deep and additive expertise to our leadership team, and we're excited about the perspective he adds.\nTurning to our results. I'll begin with our third quarter highlights before turning it over to John, who will walk you through our financial results in greater detail. Slide 2 of our investor presentation highlights the strength of our third quarter results with quarterly earnings per share of $2.78 increasing 23% year-over-year. Our strong financial performance reflects disciplined execution against our strategic priorities and our ability to effectively capitalize on the constructive market environment in the quarter.\nWe continue to demonstrate good business momentum and consistent delivery of improved financial performance. For example, 3Q marked our seventh consecutive quarter of positive total operating leverage, excluding notable items as we delivered total revenue growth of 9%, a pretax margin of 31% and return on tangible common equity of 21%. These metrics highlight our ability to drive profitable growth by executing our growth strategy and continuing the transformation of our operating model. Investor demand, new technology and a changing regulatory environment are creating new opportunities for us and our clients.\nAlongside our robust third quarter financial performance, we remain focused on advancing product innovation and enhancing our capabilities to better serve our clients and accelerate growth in key strategic areas. For example, as I'll outline shortly, we launched a series of strategic initiatives and new product capabilities in the third quarter, all designed to position State Street for sustained long-term growth.\nIn Investment Services, we delivered strong year-over-year servicing fee growth and ended the quarter with a record $51.7 trillion in AUCA. We recorded 1 new alpha mandate another alpha client went live in 3 quarter -- in 3Q. State Street has long been a leader in technology-driven innovation Today, our investment services team is building on that legacy by developing the tools and client capabilities that will empower our clients to succeed in an evolving market. For example, in the digital assets ecosystem, State Street already provides fund administration and accounting services for digital assets today.\nAs we look ahead, we are strategically positioning State Street to be the bridge between traditional and digital finance as well as the connection point between digital asset platforms. To that end, we are excited about the forthcoming launch of our digital asset platform which will enable tokenization of assets, funds and cash for institutional investors. As the wealth market expands globally, we have noted the importance of building upon our front-office wealth trading and portfolio construction capabilities at Charles River to further access this growing revenue pool.\nWe achieved a key milestone of our well services strategy in 3Q with the announcement of a strategic partnership and minority investment in Apex fintech solutions. Through this partnership, State Street will leverage Apex's digital custody and clearing platform to expand our well services offerings in support of the high-growth wealth management industry. The partnership will deliver a differentiated, fully digital, globally scalable custody and clearing solution and experience for wealth advisers and self-directed wealth platforms as well as their clients around the world.\nAs a result, this partnership will significantly strengthen State Street's investment servicing capabilities and build on our existing foundation to deliver the industry's first truly global digital wealth custody solution. The third quarter also marked an important milestone for State Street Investment Management, which reported record quarterly management fee revenue as period-end AUM climbed to a record $5.4 trillion just 1 quarter after surpassing the $5 trillion mark for the first time.\nWe continue to innovate at pace, further strengthening our investment management capabilities to drive growth across several strategic focus areas. For example, we launched 11 select fighter premium income ETFs, enabling investors to tap into sector-specific opportunities with enhanced income potential. Elsewhere, by broadening our suite of actively managed target maturity ETFs, we further strengthened our capabilities in fixed income solutions, which remains a key strategic priority.\nImportantly, the third quarter provided several compelling examples of how our partnerships with some of the world's leading investment firms are expanding and strengthening our client capabilities, positioning us for future growth. For example, in continued partnership with Apollo, we made further progress in expanding access to private markets with the launch of PRSD, an actively managed short-term bond ETF and which combines exposure to investment-grade public and private credit. We also launched the Euro-denominated AAA CLO UCIT ETF in partnership with Blackstone, building on our successful track record together which includes actively managed high income and senior loan ETFs.\nFinally, in Europe, we entered a strategic partnership with an Lanshempan Investment Management that will drive further innovation across our respective investment offerings in this key strategic region. State Street markets continued to see the results of his efforts to deepen client relationships delivering strong year-over-year revenue growth in both securities finance and FX trading services.\nAs a testament to the strength of our markets franchise and the value we deliver to clients, we're proud that State Street was recognized with 8 category wins in Euromoney Magazine's 2025 FX awards, doubling our achievements from 2024. These industry recognitions are strong endorsements of our continuous effort to deliver best-in-class trading and financing solutions, technology platforms and research to our clients globally.\nTurning to our balance sheet. Our solid financial position has enabled us to return nearly $1.5 billion in capital to shareholders year-to-date through common share repurchases and dividends, including $637 million in the third quarter. As previously announced, we were pleased to increase State Street's quarterly per share common stock dividend by 11% to $0.84 in 3Q. We remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders.\nBefore I conclude my prepared remarks, I'd like to take a moment to extend my gratitude to Mark Keating for his outstanding leadership during his tenure as Interim Chief Financial Officer. Mark stepped into the role during a pivotal time and provided invaluable stability and leadership as we navigate the transition period. Mark will continue to play an important role in shaping our long-term financial strategy and driving enterprise-wide initiatives working closely with John.\nTo conclude, the third quarter marked several strategic and performance milestones for State Street, reinforcing the effectiveness of our strategy. We delivered our seventh consecutive quarter of positive total operating leverage, excluding notable items, a clear indicator of sustained momentum. Our continued improving financial performance is supported by a range of tangible proof points that highlight how we are expanding product capabilities and driving innovation across the firm. These efforts continue to position us for future growth and long-term value creation for our shareholders.\nWith that, let me hand the call over to John, who will take you through the quarter in more detail.\n\nJohn F. Woods\n\nVice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)\n\nThank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 3. As Ron mentioned, we delivered strong third quarter financial results that reflect healthy business momentum and consistent execution, driving EPS growth of 23% year-over-year to $2.78. Total revenue increased 9% year-over-year to approximately $3.5 billion and included fee revenue growth of nearly 12%, excluding notable items. Fee revenue growth was broad-based, supported by active client engagement and met a constructive market environment.\nServicing fees were up 7%, management fees increased 16% and FX trading services and securities finance revenues were collectively up 17%, excluding notable items year-over-year. Expenses increased approximately 5% year-over-year to $2.4 billion as we continue to prudently manage our expense base while also funding key strategic initiatives and technology investments to support future growth. Taken together, our strong third quarter performance delivered substantial fee and total operating leverage of over 600 basis points and over 300 basis points, respectively, year-over-year and excluding notable items. Our pretax margin expanded approximately 270 basis points to 31%, while our return on tangible common equity was approximately 160 basis points higher at 21% compared to the year ago period. Turning now to Slide 4.\nServicing fees increased 7% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher average market levels, net new business and the impact of currency translation. AUC reached a new record of $51.7 trillion, increasing 10% year-over-year, driven by higher period end market levels and strong client flows. We achieved nearly $50 million in servicing fee revenue wins in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to approximately $250 million.\nWe remain intensely focused on driving servicing fee revenue growth particularly in core back-office solutions and private markets, which together account for the vast majority of both our third quarter and year-to-date wins. Our pipeline remains healthy and well diversified and we are on track to meet our full year target of $350 million to $400 million. This momentum is reflected in our third quarter servicing fee revenue backlog of approximately $400 million, up roughly 40% from the prior year.\nInstalling our backlog remains a top priority as we focus on delivering consistent organic servicing fee growth in the quarters ahead. Additionally, we reported on new alpha mandate win with another client going live in the quarter. As Ron noted, we recently finalized a strategic partnership and minority investment in Apex fintech solutions. This partnership will expand our wealth services offering through Apex's digital custody and clearing platform and supports the long-term growth of our investment servicing business. Turning to Slide 5.\nWe Management fees increased 16% year-over-year to a quarterly record of $612 million, primarily driven by higher average market levels and net inflows. Assets under management increased 15% year-over-year to a record $5.4 trillion, supported by higher period end market levels and client inflows. Net inflows totaled $26 billion for the quarter, reflecting solid momentum across ETFs, cash and institutional index fixed income.\nIn ETFs, our U.S. low-cost suite continued to gain market share, achieving record flows in the quarter. Our gold ETF suite further strengthened its market leadership, reaching a record AUM of approximately $145 billion. This strong performance reflects both robust inflows and supported by our expanded distribution globally as well as elevated spot prices. As Ron mentioned, innovation remains a cornerstone of our investment management growth strategy.\nIn the third quarter, we launched 39 new products including an expansion of our select sector suite and new alternatives exposures. These initiatives broaden the capabilities available to clients and support organic net new asset growth. We are encouraged by the robust performance of our investment management business in the third quarter, which delivered a pretax margin of approximately 36%, up nearly 600 basis points from the prior year quarter. Turning to Slide 6.\nState Street Markets delivered strong third quarter results with solid year-over-year growth in both FX trading services and securities finance. Our markets franchise is strategically positioned to support both our investment services and investment management businesses, delivering integrated value across the entire franchise. FX trading revenue increased 16% year-over-year, excluding prior period notable items. While FX volatility was relatively muted, client volumes increased 11% year-over-year with strong growth across all of our trading venues. Securities finance revenues increased 19% year-over-year driven by robust balance growth across both agency lending and prime services. In Agency Lending, third quarter performance benefited from increased assets on loan and specials activity while in Prime Services, our targeted client engagement supported solid revenue growth for the quarter. Moving to Slide 7.\nSoftware and processing fees increased 9% year-over-year. Front office software and data revenue increased 14% year-over-year, driven by higher on-premises renewals growth in professional services and continued expansion of software-enabled revenue as we converted and implemented more clients onto our cloud-based SaaS platform. In turn, annual recurring revenue increased by approximately 13% year-over-year to approximately $400 million in the third quarter. Our front office revenue backlog remains healthy, increasing 45% year-over-year and reinforcing our confidence in the future growth of this business. Moving to Slide 8.\nNet interest income of $715 million was down 1% year-over-year. This performance reflects an 11 basis point decline in the net interest margin to 96 basis points, primarily driven by lower average short-end rates and deposit mix shift, partially offset by the reinvestment of securities portfolio cash flows at higher yields and higher interest-earning assets supported by higher deposit balances. On a sequential basis, net interest income declined 2%, primarily due to a reduction in the interest earning assets resulting from lower deposit balances compared to elevated second quarter levels as well as lower average short-end rates. These factors were partially mitigated by the reinvestment of securities portfolio cash flows at higher yields, along with continued client-driven loan growth which contributed to an improvement in interest-earning asset mix supporting a stable net interest margin on a linked-quarter basis. Turning to Slide 9.\nExpenses increased approximately 5% year-over-year, primarily driven by continued investments in technology and strategic initiatives, higher revenue-related costs and the impact of currency translation partially offset by continued productivity savings. Compensation-related costs were well contained, increasing 2% year-over-year in the third quarter. This increase was primarily driven by higher salaries and benefits and the impact of currency translation partially mitigated by a reduction in head count, including from ongoing operating model transformation and process improvements.\nInformation Systems and communications expense increased 12% year-over-year, primarily due to ongoing investments in platform modernization and resiliency, AI tools, enhanced data delivery and improved user experience as well as higher client implementation activity and volumes. In parallel, we continue to advance our productivity and optimization initiatives, generating approximately $125 million in year-over-year savings during the quarter. These efforts have delivered approximately $370 million of savings year-to-date, keeping us firmly on track to achieve our full year savings target of $500 million. Our ongoing productivity and other savings initiatives have enabled us to deliver both fee and total operating leverage while also creating capacity to invest strategically in growth areas such as well services, alpha, private markets, AI and process automation. Moving to Slide 10.\nOur standardized CET1 ratio was 11.3% at quarter end, up approximately 60 basis points quarter-over-quarter reflecting capital generated from earnings and a decline in risk-weighted assets coming off of the elevated FX volatility of the prior quarter. We returned $637 million of capital to common shareholders during the third quarter, consisting of $400 million in common share repurchases and $237 million in declared common stock dividends for a total payout ratio of 79%. As Ron noted, in the third quarter, we were pleased to increase our per share quarterly common dividend by 11% to $0.84.\nTo wrap up, let's turn to our outlook, which, as a reminder, excludes notable items. Building on our strong year-to-date performance and a constructive market environment, we now expect 2025 total fee revenue growth in the 8.5% to 9% range, an improvement to our prior outlook of at or slightly above the 5% to 7% range. We expect full year NII to be down slightly relative to last year's record performance.\nTurning to expenses. With our improved outlook for fee revenue, full year expense growth is now expected to be roughly 4.5%, up from our prior outlook of the upper end of the 3% to 4% range, reflecting ongoing investments in technology and strategic initiatives along with higher revenue-related costs. Importantly, we continue to generate significant positive fee and total operating leverage this year. And given where we are in the year, our full year outlook implies that for the fourth quarter, fee revenue will be flat to down slightly quarter-over-quarter, reflecting a normalization in other fee revenue from an elevated 3Q while suggesting a sequential increase in NII.\nAnd on expenses, our updated full year outlook suggests that expenses will be up slightly in 4Q compared to the prior quarter. Finally, we continue to target a total payout ratio of approximately 80% for 2025, subject to market conditions and other factors while also deploying capital to support our clients drive organic growth and fund strategic investments. In conclusion, our third quarter results reflect the strength of our execution and the resilience of our strategy. driving consistent business momentum and delivering meaningful fee and total operating leverage. On a personal note, I'm excited to be partnering with Ron and the rest of the State Street management team and I'm very optimistic about the opportunity ahead of us at State Street as we aim to build upon the strong results we've achieved year-to-date. And with that, operator, we can now open the call for questions."

Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Ron O'Hanley, will speak first. Then Mark Keating, our interim CFO, will take you through our second quarter 2025 earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, investors.statestreet.com.\nAfterwards, we'll be happy to take questions.

Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our view should change. With that, let me turn it over to Ron.\n\nRonald Philip O’Hanley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, State Street Corporation\n\nThank you, Liz, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we begin, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the devastating floods in Texas. Our thoughts are with those who have tragically lost their lives and with the people and communities who have been affected by this event.\nNow turning to the second quarter. In a period characterized at times by significant financial market volatility driven by geopolitical and economic uncertainty, our strong 2Q results demonstrate the powerful and diversified nature of our franchise by advancing and leveraging our deep capabilities in technology and investment services, markets and investment management. We Continued to strategically position State Street as our clients' essential partner and executed on our purpose to help create better outcomes for the world's investors and the people they serve.\nDisciplined execution of this strategic approach is delivering positive results, including accelerating financial performance and strong business momentum. For example, on a year-over-year basis, our 2Q results marked the fourth consecutive quarter of positive fee operating leverage and the sixth consecutive quarter of positive total operating leverage, excluding notable items.\nNew business was strong as we generated [indiscernible] record quarter for sales and investment services, surpassed $5 trillion in AUM at State Street Investment Management and generated record FX trading volumes in 2Q. This positive momentum reflects the strong strategic operating and technology foundation we have built over the past several years to support the long-term growth of our businesses.\nAs we work to build on this progress, we remain focused on disciplined execution against our strategy, delivering consistent growth for our shareholders and maintaining operational excellence in the service of our clients.\nTurning to Slide 2 of our investor presentation. I will cover our second quarter highlights before Mark takes you through the quarter in more detail. Beginning with our financial performance. Reported earnings per share were $2.17 as compared to $2.15 in the year ago period. Excluding notable items, which Mark will speak to, fee and total revenue increased 12% and 9% year-over-year, respectively. We delivered positive fee and total operating leverage, increased pretax margin to nearly 30% and achieved a 19% return on tangible common equity, while EPS increased 18% year-over-year, all excluding notable items.\nTurning to our business momentum. Within Investment Services, we delivered a very strong sales performance this quarter securing over $1 trillion in new AUC/A asset servicing wins and generated $145 million of related new servicing fee revenue wins, including 2 new State Street Alpha mandates. With this continued good sales performance, we remain confident in our ability to meet our full year servicing fee in wins target of [ $350 million to $400 million ] for a second consecutive year.\nSecond quarter marked an important milestone for our asset management business, which we rebranded State Street Investment Management. This new name reflects our commitment to investing in our relationships, innovation and in the future. Among other benefits, this new brand name reinforces our One State Street approach that aims to leverage collaboration across our firm, expand product offerings and deepen relationships with our clients.\nThis moment for our investment management business came as period-end AUM exceeded $5 trillion for the first time. Quarterly net inflows were over $80 billion, and we continued to gain market share in the strategically important U.S. low-cost ETF market segment. The second quarter also offered further evidence of the strength and depth of our ETF franchise as our U.S. ETFs led the industry in trading volume, surpassing $4.6 trillion in total volume for the quarter, ranking #1 in equity, #1 in commodities and among the top 3 in fixed income.\nState Street markets is seeing the results of its efforts to deepen client relationships and in Q2, clearly demonstrated its ability to support clients through volatile periods with deep liquidity and trading expertise, while also providing important diversification to our revenue profile. Amid a constructive environment for our markets business, we saw significant year-over-year increases in both FX trading and security finance revenues driven by higher client volumes.\nOur FX trading business recorded its best quarter since 2020 and security finance revenues rose to the highest level since 2019. Turning to our balance sheet. Our strong financial position enabled over $500 million in capital return in the second quarter and over $800 million year-to-date. Our financial strength was further underscored by the results of the Federal Reserve's annual stress test in June, subsequent to which we were pleased to announce our intention to increase State Street's quarterly per share common stock dividend by 11% to $0.84 beginning in the third quarter, subject to approval by our Board of Directors.\nAs we look ahead, we remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders, subject to market conditions and other factors. Turning to our operational efficiency. We have a well-established track record of expense discipline. This continues to be supported by a proven ability to generate productivity savings to fund investments in our business, which in turn is driving revenue growth and operating leverage.\nFor example, over the last 3 years, we have generated over $1 billion of expense savings, largely from productivity initiatives, and we anticipate that number will increase to over $1.5 billion by year-end as we continue to progress well against our $500 million expense savings target in 2025. Importantly, as we look further ahead, the next generation of our operating model transformation remains our priority and a key opportunity to add even more value for clients and shareholders.\nThe charge [indiscernible] second quarter illustrates this opportunity as we drive further operational efficiency and unlock productivity gains over time, supported by AI and continued platform scaling. To conclude, our first half results build meaningfully on 2024. The second quarter included a number of strategic and platform milestones for State Street, offering tangible proof points that our strategy is delivering, reflected in the continuing improvement in our financial performance and the strong momentum we're seeing across our businesses.\nThese results underscore the strength of our franchise and the disciplined execution of our strategy by our teams. As we look ahead, we have strong conviction in our strategy and in our ability to serve our clients well, underpinned by our distinctive value proposition, financial strength and the next generation of our technology and operational transformation.\nWith that, let me hand the call over to Mark, who will take you through the quarter in more detail.\n\nMark R. Keating\n\nExecutive VP & CFO of Investment Services\n\nThank you, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Picking up on Slide 3. Before turning to our second quarter financial results, let me briefly walk you through the notable items we recognized this quarter. Notable items totaled $138 million pretax or $0.36 per share, primarily driven by a $100 million repositioning charge associated with our ongoing operating model transformation. This action relates to the severance of approximately 900 employees and as we noted in June, is expected to drive expense savings mostly in 2026 with a payback period of roughly 4 to 5 quarters.\nWe also recognized roughly $40 million of notable items related to a rescoping of an alpha client contract along with a few smaller items as detailed on the slide.\nTurning to Slide 4. Excluding notable items, second quarter EPS grew a robust 18% year-over-year to $2.53 a share. Total revenue increased 9% and fee revenue increased 12% year-over-year, each excluding notable items, reflecting strong business momentum across the business. Expenses increased 6% year-over-year, excluding notable items. Approximately half of the year-over-year increase was driven by a combination of higher performance and revenue-related costs associated with the more constructive revenue environment in the second quarter and to a lesser extent, the unfavorable impact of currency translation.\nThe remaining increase primarily reflects continued investments in the franchise, including technology and infrastructure. This performance enabled us to deliver meaningful fee and total operating leverage, 526 basis points and 241 basis points, respectively, excluding notable items. Accordingly, our pretax margin expanded to nearly 30%, while ROTCE was approximately 19% excluding notable items.\nTurning now to Slide 5. AUC/A reached a record $49 trillion, up 11% year-over-year, driven by higher period end market levels and client flows. AUM also reached a new record in the second quarter, increasing 17% year-over-year to over $5 trillion reflecting higher period end market levels and positive net inflows. Key market indicators reflected the dynamic operating environment in the second quarter, with higher period end market levels and elevated FX volatility across both developed and emerging markets.\nAgainst this backdrop, our markets business performed well, supported by record quarterly FX volumes as we help clients navigate a shifting market landscape, which I'll speak to in more detail shortly. Turning to Slide 6. Servicing fees increased 5% year-over-year, supported by higher average market levels, net new business, improved client activity and the favorable impact of currency translation. We were encouraged by the strong sales momentum in our Investment Services business this quarter, with $145 million of servicing fee revenue wins.\nThese wins were well distributed across regions with key new mandates in Europe and North America and are closely aligned with our strategic priorities, particularly in core back office solutions and private markets. Installations progressed steadily and as expected during the quarter. Onboarding our $441 million of [ to be ] installed servicing fee revenue, the highest on record remains a key priority as we aim to drive consistent, sustainable servicing fee growth.\nIn addition, we reported 2 new Alpha mandates representing $380 billion of our AUC/A wins this quarter. Our interoperable front-to-back Alpha platform remains a key enabler in deepening and expanding client relationships. Moving to Slide 7. Management fees increased 10% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher average market levels and the benefit of prior period net inflows.\nFor the quarter, net inflows totaled $82 billion, driven by solid performance across ETFs and institutional. In ETFs, we saw healthy inflows across the product set, including U.S. low-cost, gold, SPY and U.S. fixed income. Our U.S. low-cost offering achieved continued market share gains in the quarter, reflecting the strength of our strategic positioning in this segment.\nAs Ron noted, the market volatility in the second quarter further highlighted the deep liquidity of State Street Investment Management's ETF franchise, which led the industry in U.S. ETF trading volumes. In our institutional business, we delivered a record $68 billion of quarterly net inflows driven by continued momentum in retirement, including our strategically important U.S. defined contribution business.\nOverall, we were pleased with the strong performance of our investment management business in the second quarter, which generated a pretax margin of approximately 33%.\nTurning now to Slide 8. FX trading revenue increased 27% year-over-year, excluding notable items. This strong performance was driven by record client volumes with solid activity across our trading venues, reflecting heightened FX volatility in the quarter. Securities finance revenues increased 17% year-over-year, with strong balanced growth across both agency lending and prime Services.\nWithin our prime services business, fee revenue increased 29% year-over-year, supported by higher balances and continued momentum in client engagement.\nMoving to Slide 9. Software and processing fees increased 19% year-over-year in the second quarter, excluding notable items. Front office software and data revenue increased 27% compared to the prior year quarter, excluding notable items. This strong performance was primarily driven by higher on-premises renewals, largely associated with CRD wealth clients. In addition, software-enabled and professional services revenues increased 10% year-over-year, excluding notable items, reflecting continued momentum in SaaS client conversions and implementations.\nWe are pleased with our ongoing success in transitioning clients to our cloud-based SaaS platform with annual recurring revenue increasing by approximately 10% year-over-year to $379 million in the second quarter. Moving to Slide 10.\nNet interest income of $729 million was down 1% year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of lower average short-end rates and changes in deposit mix. These headwinds were partially offset by continued loan growth and securities portfolio repricing. On a sequential basis, NII increased 2% supported by growth in non-U.S. deposit balances, securities portfolio repricing and loan growth, partially offset by the impact of lower average short-end rates.\nAs detailed on the right of the slide, the average balance sheet size expanded relative to 1Q driven by a 7% increase in average deposit balances. The sequential increase in average balances was partly a reflection of the more uncertain macro backdrop that we observed early in the quarter, which moderated through May and June. We remain committed to supporting our clients with our strong, highly liquid balance sheet. Looking ahead, while we expect deposit balances to remain somewhat elevated relative to our expectations coming into the year, we do anticipate that balances will continue to moderate over the coming months and quarters subject to market conditions.\nTurning to Slide 11. Expenses increased 6% year-over-year, excluding notable items, as I mentioned earlier. Compensation-related costs were up 7% year-over-year, excluding notable items, mainly reflecting higher performance-based costs and the impact of currency translation, while total headcount was down slightly. Information systems and communications expense increased 11% year-over-year, excluding notable items, as we continue to invest in technology and infrastructure to modernize our platforms while enhancing data delivery and user experience.\nAt the same time, we continue to execute on our productivity and optimization savings initiatives, which generated over $150 million in year-over-year savings during the quarter. Year-to-date, these efforts have delivered approximately $250 million of savings towards our $500 million full year target. Our ability to consistently generate productivity and optimization savings reflects the intense work of recent years and is a key enabler of strategic investment fueling technology modernization, supporting revenue growth and helping us drive 6 consecutive quarters of positive operating leverage, excluding notable items.\nWe expect the repositioning actions taken in the second quarter to build on this momentum and support the continued transformation of our operating model in the quarters and years ahead. Moving to Slide 12.\nOur capital and liquidity levels remain strong, enabling us to continue supporting our clients as we look ahead. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio of 10.7% was down approximately 30 basis points from the prior quarter. Risk-weighted assets increased approximately $8 billion from the prior quarter, reflecting growth in our lending and securities finance businesses as well as higher volumes and volatility in our FX trading business.\nThe LCR for State Street Bank was a robust 136% in the quarter. Capital return increased to $517 million during the quarter, consisting of $300 million of common share repurchases and $217 million in declared common stock dividends for a total payout ratio of 82%. As Ron noted, following our strong performance in this year's Federal Reserve stress test, we also announced our intention to increase our first year quarterly common dividend by 11% in 3Q, subject to Board approval.\nLooking ahead to the second half of the year, we continue to expect a progressive cadence of common share repurchases, targeting a total payout ratio of approximately 80% for 2025. In summary, we are encouraged by our second quarter and first half results, which highlight our ability to execute on our strategy, driving sustained business momentum while delivering positive fee and total operating leverage, excluding notable items.\nWith that, let me turn to our improved full year outlook, which as a reminder, excludes notable items and remains subject to significant variability given the current economic and geopolitical environment. Over the first half of 2025, we have demonstrated our ability to drive sustainable growth across our core businesses. Given this strong performance, plus the current more constructive market environment and the anticipated impact of currency translation, we now expect 2025 total fee revenue growth in the 5% to 7% range, which is an improvement to our prior 3% to 5% full year outlook.\nWe expect full year NII to be roughly flat to last year's record performance, with the potential for some variability driven by global monetary policy and changes in deposit mix and levels, which are difficult to predict. With our improved revenue expectations, full year expense growth is now expected to be roughly 3% to 4%, up from our prior full year outlook of 2% to 3%, reflecting higher revenue-related costs as well as expectations of a negative impact from currency translation.\nAnd importantly, we continue to expect to generate both positive fee and total operating leverage this year. And with that, operator, we can now open the call for questions."

Today's call will be hosted by Elizabeth Lynn, Head of Investor Relations at State Street. [Operator Instructions] Today's discussion is being broadcasted live on State Street's website at investors.statestreet.com. This conference call is also being recorded for replay. State Street's conference call is copyrighted and all rights are reserved. This call may not be recorded for rebroadcast or distribution in whole or in part without the express written authorization from State Street Corporation. The only authorized broadcast of this call will be housed on the State Street website. Now I would like to hand the call over to Elizabeth Lynn.\n\nElizabeth Lynn\n\nExecutive VP & Global Head of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you all for joining us. With me today are State Street's Chief Executive Officer; Ron O'Hanley, Chief Financial Officer; Eric Aboaf; and Investment Services CFO, and as we announced this morning, incoming Interim CFO, Mark Keating.\nOn today's call, Ron will provide an overview on 2024 performance and milestones achieved. Eric will then walk through the fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings results in detail. And both Eric and Mark will provide our 2025 outlook, after which we'll be happy to take questions.\nToday's presentation is available on the Investor Relations section of our website, investors.statestreet.com. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that today's presentation will include results presented on a basis that excludes or adjusts 1 or more items from GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measure are available in the appendix to our presentation. In addition, today's call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those statements due to a variety of important factors, such as those referenced in our discussion today and in our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section in our Form 10-K. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change. With that, let me turn it over to Ron.\n\nRonald Philip O’Hanley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, State Street Corporation\n\nThank you, Liz, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge the terrible wildfires devastating parts of Los Angeles. Our thoughts are with all those impacted by this terrible event, including our colleagues and clients, as well as the brave first responders working to protect the impacted communities.\nTurning now to our quarterly investor presentation. Our fourth quarter results represent a strong close to a strong year for State Street. We entered 2024 with a clear set of strategic priorities aimed at driving revenue growth, improving our sales performance, strengthening our market position and enhancing our operating model. We executed well against these objectives, enabling us to serve our clients and deliver strong financial performance and continued business momentum for our shareholders. These results included both positive fee and total operating leverage, pretax margin expansion and higher earnings growth, illustrating the power of our franchise and the effectiveness of our strategy.\nThe foundation for our strong business performance in 2024 was laid in prior years, building upon the significant strategic investments we have made in our capabilities and our client value proposition to be our clients' essential partner and lead with service excellence. These actions have positioned State Street to compete better and win.\nTurning to Slide 2 and beginning with our financial highlights. I am particularly pleased with our improved revenue performance. Full year fee and total revenue increased 7% and 9%, respectively. Excluding notable items, fee revenue, NII and total revenue each increased by a solid 6% year-over-year in 2024. Year-over-year, each revenue line contributed positively, including double-digit growth in management fees, FX trading services and front office software and data revenues, while we also delivered a second consecutive year of record NII.\nFull year EPS was $8.21 as compared to $5.58 in 2023. Excluding notable items, EPS growth was up 13% year-over-year. Pretax margin expanded by more than 100 basis points, while full year return on average tangible common equity was a robust 19%. Turning to our strong business momentum in 2024. Our key business performance indicator, including wins, clearly illustrate the effectiveness of our strategy and positioning State Street to effectively serve our clients, compete better and gain share. 2024 was an important year of business growth and significantly improved sales performance, which sets us up well as we look forward to drive further fee revenue growth in 2025 and beyond.\nIn Investment Services, we generated very strong AUC/A wins of over $2.3 trillion in 2024, including $1.1 trillion of wins in Q4. Full year new servicing fee revenue wins were $377 million, including $154 million in Q4. The strength of our sales performance in the fourth quarter were underpinned by a large strategic and multiregional win with an APAC asset owner. With the strong fourth quarter sales performance, we achieved our goal of $350 million to $400 million of new servicing fee revenue wins in 2024.\nState Street Alpha brings together the full depth and breadth of our servicing and software solutions and is a clear competitive advantage for State Street's Investment Services business. Our strong full year sales performance in 2024 demonstrates the strength of this compelling value proposition as a tangible proof point of the more than $2.3 trillion of new AUC/A wins in 2024. Alpha accounted for approximately 50% of those wins. All told, we won 7 new Alpha mandates in 2024, including 2 new mandates in Q4, achieving our goal of 6 to 8 new Alpha clients last year.\nOur Investment Management franchise had another strong year of strategic progress, with both 4Q and full year management fees achieving record levels. We continue to strategically broaden Global Advisors product and distribution capabilities, which has positioned the business for future growth and from which we are already realizing the early benefits of these strategic actions. We generated $146 billion of net new assets in 2024, including $64 billion in 4Q. This equates to over 3% organic AUM growth for the second year in a row, well above the 2% target we laid out early last year. ETF inflows were a record in 2024, with record flows in our strategically important U.S. low-cost ETF suite, as well as in the EMEA region, gaining market share in both. We also had the highest number of ETF launches in Global Advisors history last year and announced innovative partnerships with a number of market leaders aimed at leveraging our SPDR franchise to expand investor access to new investment opportunities.\nIn addition, Global Advisors made a host of key strategic investments, most notably in Envestnet, a leading provider of integrated technology, data and wealth solutions. This investment consistent with State Street's wealth services strategy will enhance our access to the independent wealth advisory and high net worth distribution channels, driving future growth.\nBuilding on a record year of inflows in 2023, our cash business generated an aggregate $32 billion of full year inflows, while our institutional business also has had a positive year on inflows, with U.S. defined contribution, again, continuing to drive inflows with $28 billion in 2024. Turning to our markets and financing franchise. Despite lower daily average FX volatility in 2024, FX trading services generated double-digit revenue growth, supported by strong and growing client volumes.\nTurning to our balance sheet. Our markets and financing franchise delivered strong loan growth in support of our clients, contributing to record NII performance in 2024 and supporting fee growth in private market servicing. Our strong balance sheet position enabled us to return $2.2 billion of capital to shareholders last year, including common share repurchases and a 10% increase in our quarterly common dividend per share. As we look ahead, we remain focused on consistently returning capital to our shareholders and are targeting a payout of about 80% of earnings in 2025, subject to market conditions and other factors.\nFinally, 2024 was also an important year for our transformation as we continue to focus on core operating model improvements to enhance our client and colleague experience and generate increased productivity. We made a number of key investments in operational simplification, automation and technology modernization. These actions contributed to the approximately $500 million of year-over-year productivity savings that we achieved in 2024, in line with our target. The majority of these savings are recurring and will enable us to continue to increase our investments in Alpha, custody, private markets and asset management distribution to drive the sales and momentum to power our next wave of growth.\nFurther, excluding notable items, these transformation efforts supported the approximately 200 basis points of both positive fee and total operating leverage in 2024, even as underlying expenses increased by 4% year-over-year, driven in part by higher revenue-related costs.\nIn summary, our fourth quarter results represent a strong close to a strong and important year for State Street. Good execution against a clear set of strategic priorities enabled us to support our clients better and deliver strong financial results. Our strategic actions have positioned State Street to compete better and win, as evidenced by the accelerating business momentum we generated from start to finish in 2024.\nAs you know, last October, we announced that our CFO of 8 years, Eric Aboaf, will be departing State Street in February. At that time, we launched a formal search process to identify a successor, which is progressing very well and as planned. This morning, we announced that Mark Keating, EVP and CFO for Investment Services, will serve as our interim CFO following Eric's departure next month while our search for a permanent CFO continues. Mark is a 30-year State Street finance veteran who has worked in almost every area of our business across 3 continents. As the executive finance leader within our largest segment, Mark has been instrumental in supporting our transformation efforts, driving revenue growth initiatives, and he brings deep operational expertise, a partnership mindset and team building focus. Once again, I want to thank Eric for his leadership and wish him well in his new role. With that, let me hand the call over to Eric, who will take you through the quarter in more detail.\n\nEric Walter Aboaf\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, State Street Corporation\n\nThank you, Ron. Before I begin my review of our financial results, let me briefly discuss some of the notable items we recognized in the fourth quarter on the right panel of Slide 3. Fourth quarter notable items collectively totaled $58 million pretax or $0.14 a share, and were largely driven by an acceleration of expenses associated with certain prior period deferred incentive compensation awards to allow our compensation program to be more competitive with peer practices. Notable items this quarter also included an FDIC special assessment release and some other small items.\nOur fourth quarter results are the culmination of the important work we accomplished throughout 2024 and reflect broad-based fee growth across the entire franchise, up 13%, higher NII, up 10%, and continued capital returns. As detailed on the left panel of the slide and excluding notable items, in the fourth quarter, we also achieved a pretax margin of about 30% and an ROE of over 13%, while year-on-year EPS growth was a robust 27%.\nOn a full year 2024 basis and excluding notable items, we were pleased to deliver strong revenue growth of 6%, both positive fee and total operating leverage of about 200 basis points each and a pretax margin of approximately 28%, contributing to strong EPS growth of 13% and an ROE of roughly 12% for the year. Our 2024 results demonstrate the strong momentum we're seeing across our various businesses and provide a strong step off as we move into 2025.\nTurning now to Slide 4, as detailed on the left panel of the slide. Period-end AUC/A and AUM both increased nicely year-on-year in the fourth quarter, supported by the market tailwinds and positive client flows. On the right panel of this slide, we detail some of the key market indicators that impact our business. Most of the market drivers, global equity markets, bond markets, FX volatility and industry flows are up year-on-year, which we have successfully monetized in the form of revenue growth this quarter.\nTurning to Slide 5. We saw good momentum continue in our Investment Services business this quarter with strong sales and strong installations. On a year-on-year basis, servicing fees increased 6%. The quarterly performance reflected higher average market levels and net new business, partially offset by pricing headwinds, lower client activity and a previously disclosed client transition. The impact of that previously disclosed client transition was a headwind of roughly 1 percentage point to year-on-year growth, while lower client activity, including the asset mix shift into cash, was still a slight headwind to the year-on-year growth, though now abating as clients put more money to work.\nAs Ron mentioned, we were pleased with the meaningful progress we achieved in our Investment Services business during 2024. With our strong performance in 4Q, we comfortably met our annual servicing fee sales goal of $350 million to $400 million in 2024. In addition, our strategically important private markets business, which continues to be a key growth driver, increased 15% year-on-year in 4Q and represents approximately 9% of full year 2024 servicing fees. Taken together, we are encouraged by the strategic progress we're making in our Investment Services business.\nMoving to Slide 6. In the fourth quarter, management fees increased 20% year-on-year to a record $576 million, primarily reflecting higher average market levels and quarterly net inflows of $64 billion. As Ron mentioned, in 2024, we delivered organic AUM growth of over 3% for a second year in a row as we continue to drive incremental net inflows through the expansion of our distribution and product capabilities.\nProduct innovation continues to be a strategically important growth driver for Global Advisors. In the fourth quarter, we launched 3 new ETFs, bringing our full year total to 24 new launches. Efforts such as these broaden our product capabilities and have contributed to the strong organic AUM growth we have achieved. So taken together, we are quite pleased with the strong performance of our Investment Management business in the quarter, which generated a pretax margin of approximately 32%.\nTurning now to Slide 7. Fourth quarter FX trading revenues increased 17% year-on-year as investor confidence and increased FX volatility drove double-digit increases in client volumes across most of our trading venues. Securities finance revenues increased 22% year-on-year in 4Q, primarily driven by strong prime services performance as we put another $2 billion of risk-weighted assets to work to support our clients. Agency lending volumes grew 25% year-on-year in 4Q as we continue to engage with our clients even though U.S. equity specials activity and spreads remained muted.\nMoving on to software and processing fees. Fourth quarter revenues were up 9% year-on-year, mainly driven by higher front office software and data revenue associated with CRD, which is described in greater detail on the following slide. Turning to Slide 8 now. Front office software revenues increased 10% year-on-year in 4Q, with our software-enabled and professional services revenues up a robust 25%. We continue to have very solid momentum in the front office, as evidenced by the record quarterly new bookings of $48 million in the quarter and over $70 million for the year.\nAs Ron noted, we reported 2 additional Alpha mandate wins in the quarter, bringing our full year wins to 7. Importantly, all 7 of these mandates either included the back office as a component of mandate or were built upon an existing back-office relationship, consistent with our goal of prioritizing our sales mix towards faster time to revenue products. State Street Alpha continues to be an important differentiator for our business. And in 2024, a substantial portion of servicing fee and AUC/A wins were driven by Alpha.\nMoving to Slide 9. 4Q NII increased 10% year-on-year to $749 million as higher investment portfolio yields and higher loan growth more than offset continued deposit rotation. On a sequential basis, NII increased 4%, primarily driven by higher deposit balances, with average noninterest-bearing deposits increasing $2 billion, as well as healthy loan growth. As detailed on the right panel of this slide, we benefited from very strong average deposit growth this quarter as we saw more cash in the banking system and higher assets under custody, as well as typical fourth quarter seasonality. In addition, our continued focus on client engagement also helped to contribute to this strong growth, consistent with prior quarters.\nAverage total deposits were up 15% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on-quarter, and 4Q marked our fifth consecutive quarter of sequential growth in average deposits. Our strong deposit performance, together with our targeted management actions throughout 2024, were the principal drivers of the improvement in our NII performance relative to our expectations at the beginning of last year.\nI'd also note that we modestly shortened our investment portfolio duration in the early part of the quarter in anticipation of rising [ long in ] rates, and this mitigated the AOCI impact on our capital, which I'll come back to shortly. Turning to Slide 10. As we calibrated our expense base to the more constructive revenue environment in the fourth quarter, we generated positive operating leverage of 4 percentage points, excluding notable items. And in 4Q, revenue-related costs, including performance-based incentive compensation, represented 3 percentage points of the 8% year-on-year increase in total expenses, excluding notable items. Employee benefits contributed to another percentage point.\nAs we continue to invest in our business for future growth, we remain intensely focused on maintaining expense discipline. Outside of performance-based incentive compensation and employee benefits expenses, our fourth quarter compensation expense was roughly flat year-over-year. And as detailed on the bottom left of the slide, our pro forma headcount actually fell by an additional 4% year-on-year as we continue to benefit from our ongoing organizational simplification and process improvement initiatives.\nWe continue to drive sustained productivity improvements through the transformation of our operating model and other savings initiatives in 4Q, totaling approximately $500 million of productivity savings in 2024, thereby meeting the target we set at the beginning of the year. This allowed us to self-fund roughly $375 million in incremental business and technology investments, including those that will drive further revenue growth.\nMoving to Slide 11. Our capital levels remain well above regulatory minimums, allowing us to put our balance sheet to work in support of our clients. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio of 10.9% was down approximately 70 basis points quarter-on-quarter. RWAs increased roughly $5 billion sequentially, largely due to the impact of the appreciating U.S. dollar on our FX trading business. In addition, we saw good volumes and utilization in our lending and prime services businesses, which also contributed to the RWA increase.\nWe are pleased to deliver another quarter of increased capital return with common share repurchases of $550 million, up from $450 million in the prior quarter. Part of this came from our strong earnings generation, and part from our active AOCI management, which I mentioned earlier. In total, we returned $770 million of capital to our shareholders in the fourth quarter, equivalent to a total payout ratio of 106%. And for the full year, we returned $2.2 billion of capital to shareholders for a total payout ratio of 87%.\nTurning to Slide 12. Let me first share some of the macro assumptions underlying our current view for the full year. We expect global equity markets to be up 5% point-to-point in 2025, which equates to the daily average being up approximately 8% year-on-year. Our interest rate outlook for 2025 broadly aligns the forward curve as of the end of 2024, which I would note continues to move. In addition, we expect to see a modest increase in volatility. With that as an economic backdrop, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark to walk through expectations for 2025.\n\nMark Keating\n\nGeneral Manager-Investor Relations, Nufarm Ltd.\n\nThank you, Eric and Ron, for the introduction, and good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be on the call today. I am excited by the opportunity ahead of us at State Street as we aim to build upon the strong results we achieved in 2024.\nNow turning back to Slide 12. Based on the macro assumptions that Eric laid out for the full year and excluding notable items, we currently expect fee revenue will be up approximately 3% to 5%. This includes a headwind of nearly 1 percentage point of servicing fee revenue from the previously disclosed client transition weighted toward the second half of the year.\nTurning to NII. Based on our current assumptions, we expect NII to be roughly flat for the full year, with a range from up low single digits to down by a similar amount in percentage terms. Of course, the path of NII is subject to global monetary policy and deposit mix and levels, which are difficult to predict.\nWe currently expect that the 2025 expense growth rate will moderate relative to 2024, with expenses, excluding notable items, expected to be up approximately 2% to 3%. Importantly, we expect continued productivity savings will enable us to once again self-fund incremental growth investments in our business this year. One final point. With the outlook for a stronger U.S. dollar, we expect currency translation to have an unfavorable impact on fee revenues, but a favorable impact on expenses worth roughly 1 percentage point each on fee revenues and expenses.\nSo stepping back, given our positive outlook for fee revenue growth, together with continued expense discipline, we currently expect to achieve another year of positive fee operating leverage, excluding notable items. I would also note that we see a path to delivering positive total operating leverage excluding notable items in 2025, contingent mainly upon NII coming in roughly flat or slightly better, which is market dependent, and we will have more to say as we move through the year. Lastly, we expect an effective tax rate at or just above 22% for the full year. And with that, let me hand the call back to Eric.\n\nEric Walter Aboaf\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, State Street Corporation\n\nThank you, Mark. As this is my final earnings call, I want to take a moment once again to say how much I've enjoyed my 8 years at State Street, and that it's been a privilege to work with Ron, the leadership team, and the thousands of fellow employees that I've had the pleasure of collaborating with. At this point, I'm leaving things in the good hands of Mark and the whole finance team. And finally, I'd like to thank all of our analysts and shareholders. I've appreciated your engagement, your candor and your support over the past 8 years. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.\n\nRonald Philip O’Hanley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, State Street Corporation\n\nThank you, Eric. As we look ahead to 2025, we are intensely focused on a set of strategic priorities to deliver for our clients, shareholders and people. These are: one, driving revenue growth by sustaining the solid broad-based growth and momentum we are seeing across our businesses; two, further advancing operational excellence to deliver enhanced productivity and client service; and three, continuing to develop an even higher performance and culture, employee experience and destination for talent.\nTo conclude, we are encouraged by the strategic and financial progress we made in 2024, and we look forward to continuing that progress as we move into 2025. Operator, we can now open the call for questions."

Today's discussion is being broadcast live on State Street's website at investors.statestreet.com.\nThis conference call is also being recorded for replay. State Street's conference call is copyrighted, and all rights are reserved. This call may not be recorded or rebroadcast or distribution in whole or in part without the express written authorization from State Street Corporation. The only authorized broadcast of this call will be housed on the State Street website.\nNow I would like to introduce Liz Lynn, Global Head of Investor Relations at State Street.\n\nElizabeth Lynn\n\nExecutive VP & Global Head of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Ron O'Hanley, will speak first; then Eric Aboaf, our CFO, will take you through our second quarter 2024 earnings presentation, which is available for download on the Investor Relations section of our website, investors.statestreet.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to remind you that today's presentation will include results presented on a basis that excludes or adjusts one or more items from GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measure are available in the appendix to our presentation.\nIn addition, today's call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those statements due to a variety of important factors such as those factors in our discussion today and in our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change.\nNow let me turn it over to Ron.\n\nRonald Philip O’Hanley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, State Street Corporation\n\nThank you, Liz, and good morning, everyone.\nBefore we begin today's discussion, I want to acknowledge the assassination attempt on former President Trump. It was a horrible active violence that has no place in our democracy and must be condemned. We are relieved the former President was not seriously harmed, and we are saddened by the tragic loss of innocent life and injury that resulted from this senseless action. Each victim was a participant in our democratic process, which makes this an act -- which makes this act and a front to all. We extend our thoughts and condolences to all those impacted. At this time, we hope for unity and respect in our country. This agreement can and must sit along civility and a commitment to an even better America.\nNow turning to the second quarter. Earlier today, we released our financial results, which represented sustained momentum as we delivered good year-over-year fee and total revenue growth in both 2Q and for the first half of the year, along with continued expense discipline. This resulted in modest positive total operating leverage, pretax margin of almost 29%, and a return on equity of nearly 12% in the quarter.\nWe also continue to take important steps in the transformation and simplification of our operating model as we successfully consolidated our second operations joint venture in India in the quarter. These actions will enable State Street to continue to improve client experience and will unlock further productivity savings in the years ahead.\nIn May, the transition to T+1 settlement was a significant event for global investors. Importantly, it presented State Street with an opportunity to demonstrate our position as an essential partner to our clients. Our role in successfully assisting clients through this transition reinforced our value to clients and underscore the depth of our operational capabilities.\nThe financial market context in 2Q was mixed, while daily average global equity market levels continued to move higher and equity markets again reached new all-time highs in the second quarter, gains continue to be narrowly concentrated in a few names. Meanwhile, fixed income markets struggled in 2Q as geopolitical risk continued, economic data generally remained robust and investors priced in more gradual cycle of rate cuts, even as the ECB delivered its first rate cuts since the pandemic. Through this market backdrop, we remain focused and successfully executed against our key strategic priorities.\nTurning to Slide 2 of our investor presentation, I will review our 2Q highlights before Eric takes you through the quarter in more detail. Beginning with our financial performance. Second quarter EPS was $2.15 as compared to $2.17 in the year ago period. The durable nature of our business was evident in the quarter as year-over-year strength in management fees, FX trading and NII more than offset a previously disclosed client transition that negatively impacted servicing fee revenues, helping to drive revenue growth of 3%. We also remain focused on tightly managing our cost base. While continuing to make investments in our businesses, 2Q total expenses increased by less than 3% year-over-year, supported by our ongoing productivity efforts.\nTurning to our business momentum. While you can see -- which you can see in the middle of the page, we continue to execute well against our strategy, making progress in a number of key areas aimed at generating further fee revenue growth, which gives us confidence in our positioning as we look ahead. Within asset services, we generated AUC/A wins of $291 billion, which was well distributed regionally and included more than $200 billion of faster to install back-office custody in line with our targeted sales strategy.\nEncouragingly, roughly 1/4 of the AUC/A wins this quarter came from an Alpha mandate in the APAC region. The win is a large new client for State Street, covering a broad set of our services, including the back office. This mandate is another proof point that Alpha is an attractive client value proposition globally. Alpha creates a clear competitive advantage for State Street that strategically positions us to deepen existing client relationship, and as demonstrated this quarter, win new long-term client relationships in turn, helping to drive future growth. This ongoing new business performance coupled with an anticipated increase in installations positions us well for future servicing fee growth.\nServicing fee revenue wins amounted to $72 million, up from $67 million in the first quarter. This is the fourth quarter in a row of strong servicing fee revenue wins totaling over $330 million over the last 12 months. Our pipeline is strong and we remain confident in our ability to achieve our increased servicing fee revenue sales goal of $350 million to $400 million this year.\nAt Global Advisors, buoyed by higher average equity markets, 2Q management fees were $511 million, an increase of 11% year-over-year, with AUM reaching a record $4.4 trillion at quarter end. While GA experienced aggregate net outflows in the quarter, it was largely driven by a limited number of client rebalancings.\nEncouragingly, we continue to make progress in a number of key strategic focus areas. For example, total net ETF inflows amounted to $6 billion, benefited from continued market share expansion in U.S. low-cost equity ETFs. Regionally, we also saw SPDR gain market share in EMEA.\nElsewhere, Global Advisors announced the planned strategic investment in Envestnet, a leading provider of integrated technology, data and wealth solutions. This investment, consistent with State Street's wealth services strategy, will enhance Global Advisors' access to the independent wealth advisory and high net worth distribution channels driving future growth.\nNII performance was strong driven by a number of targeted management actions over the last year to support NII growth. These include increased engagement with our clients to offer them financing and cash solutions resulting in higher deposit, loan and sponsored repo balances, while we also carefully expanded our investment portfolio in 2Q. These actions have contributed to 3 quarters in a row of sequential NII and revenue growth as well as positive total operating leverage in 2Q.\nOur balance sheet remains strong, enabling over $400 million of capital return in the second quarter and over $700 million year-to-date. Our financial strength was evident with the release of the Federal Reserve's annual stress test results in June. Subsequently and consistent with our commitment to return capital to our shareholders, we were pleased to announce our intention to increase State Street's quarterly common stock dividend by 10% to $0.76 per share beginning in the third quarter, subject to approval by our Board of Directors. As we look ahead, we remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders this year, subject to market conditions and other factors.\nTo conclude, our strong start to the year continued in the second quarter. We delivered both fee and total revenue growth, which supported a modest total operating leverage year-over-year and a return on equity of nearly 12% in the quarter, all while continuing to make significant investments in our business, controlling expenses and returning capital to our shareholders. I am pleased with the progress we are making to drive better business momentum and sales performance as we execute against the sharpened revenue strategy. We recorded another Alpha mandate win in the quarter, which demonstrated the clear advantage this strategy brings to our organization by delivering a large and completely new client relationship to State Street. We already have good line of sight into 3Q and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our goals of 6 to 8 new Alpha clients and $350 million to $400 million of servicing fee revenue wins this year.\nAnd with that, let me hand the call over to Eric, who will take you through the quarter in more detail.\n\nEric Walter Aboaf\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, State Street Corporation\n\nThank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 3, we reported EPS of $2.15 for the quarter as compared to $2.17 in the second quarter a year ago. EPS was slightly lower year-on-year, but would have been positive growth were it not for an $18 million reserve release last year. .\nAs Ron noted, we delivered 3% revenue growth year-over-year, reflecting both higher net interest income, up 6%, as well as higher fee revenues, up 2%, which supported modestly positive total operating leverage in the quarter. The second quarter's strong performance contributed to an encouraging first half of the year with both positive fee and positive total operating leverage on a year-to-date basis, excluding notable items relative to the prior year period.\nTurning now to Slide 4. Period end AUC/A and AUM again increased to record levels, largely supported by market tailwinds. As you can see on the right panel of the slide, market indicators related to our trading business remained challenging in the quarter, but we were pleased to see improved client volumes across our FX trading venues, which I will discuss shortly.\nTurning to Slide 5. Servicing fees declined 2% year-on-year as higher average equity market levels and net new business, excluding our previously disclosed client transition, were more than offset by pricing headwinds and lower client activity and adjustments, including the asset mix shift into lower earning cash and cash equivalents. The impact of the previously disclosed client transition was a headwind of approximately 2 percentage points to year-on-year growth, while lower client activity and adjustments, including the asset mix shift into cash was a headwind of approximately 1 percentage point on year-on-year growth.\nIn addition, we saw the pace of quarterly installations track below expectations in 1Q and 2Q. We do, however, anticipate a pickup over the next few quarters as our higher level of recent sales begin to onboard.\nSequentially, servicing fees were up 1%, reflecting higher average equity market levels and client activity as transaction volumes tick back up, and we saw clients start to put cash back to work. We generated $72 million of servicing fee revenue wins in 2Q and more than $330 million over the last 4 quarters, with the vast majority in back office, consistent with our strategy to prioritize faster installing custody mandates. At period end, we had $276 million of servicing fee revenues to be installed and $2.4 trillion of AUC/A to be installed.\nMoving to Slide 6. Management fees were up 11% year-on-year, primarily reflecting our higher average market levels and net inflows from prior periods, partially offset by the impacts of our strategic ETF repricing initiative, which we believe is starting to pay off in both volumes and revenues. Sequentially, the benefit of higher average market levels was offset by net flows and lower performance fees.\nWe are pleased with the steady growth we are delivering in Global Advisors. In the second quarter, we continue to expand the breadth of our offerings through the launch of new funds as we continue to broaden our product range and geographies. Our investment management business had healthy pretax margin of 32% in the second quarter, up 3 percentage points year-on-year, and up 8 percentage points quarter-on-quarter.\nNow turning to Slide 7. As I noted, we saw a very nice uptick in client activity in our markets business with higher volumes across our major FX venues. This helped to drive FX trading revenue growth of 11% year-on-year, though volatility remain needed with compressed margin.\nSecurities finance revenues also benefit from higher balances on both agency lending and prime services. However, our U.S. special activity was subdued in the quarter, which impacted margins and contributed to the year-on-year decline in securities finance revenues.\nMoving to software and processing fees. Second quarter performance continued to benefit from strong client engagement with CRD, though the cadence of on-premise renewals negatively impacted year-on-year performance, which is shown in greater detail on the following slides.\nOn Slide 8, as you can see, software-enabled and professional services revenues increased 17% in the quarter, and we expect these revenues to represent a greater proportion of our front office software and data business over time as we transition another 20 clients from on-premise to more durable SaaS model over the last year. As we outlined in May, we believe our software business can be a significant revenue growth driver for State Street, potentially reaching $1 billion in annual revenues over the next 5 years.\nIn addition, we are pleased with the continued momentum we're seeing in Alpha. We reported an additional Alpha mandate win, and 2 mandates went live in 2Q, bringing the total number of live mandates to 23 at quarter end. As Ron mentioned, this quarter's Alpha win represents a brand-new 10-year relationship with a large APAC client. We view long-term Alpha mandates like this are a key benefit of our differentiated Alpha strategy.\nTurning to Slide 9. NII was stronger than expected this quarter, up 6% year-on-year and up 3% sequentially to $735 million as higher investment portfolio yields and higher loan growth more than offset continued deposit mix shift in both periods. In addition, on a quarter-on-quarter basis, we proactively increased our investment portfolio balances at higher yields, which benefited NII.\nLooking at the strong quarterly performance relative to our expectations in early June, we did see an inflow of valuable noninterest-bearing deposits in mid-June and again in late June as clients geared up for the holiday weekend, although I would note that we did see some reversal during the first week of July.\nSimilarly, NII also benefited from higher interest-bearing balances due to our client engagement efforts as well as better spreads in volumes within our sponsored repo business as more clients join the program. Average deposits increased 7% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter. We would expect to continue to operate at this higher level of deposit balances as we look to the back half of the year.\nTurning to Slide 10. Year-on-year expense growth was contained to less than 3%. In the second quarter, we continued to invest in the business while also delivering productivity benefits in 2 key areas. The first is associated with our decision to consolidate 2 operations joint ventures in India late last year in this quarter. The year-on-year savings associated with these 2 JV consolidations are approximately $20 million in the quarter, excluding integration costs.\nSecond, we benefited from our ongoing organizational process improvements and initiatives, including streamlining and delayering staff functions to increase our management span of control, which enabled us to lower our head count on a pro forma basis, including the JVs by 5 percentage points year-on-year as detailed on the bottom left of the slide. Together, these actions helped to drive down compensation and benefit costs by 2% year-on-year in the second quarter and facilitate our ability to reinvest in our franchise.\nThe combination of the JV consolidations along with our ongoing initiatives,serves as a catalyst and importantly, gives us confidence as we continue to deliver on our strategy to simplify our global operating model with meaningful benefits expected to build over time, including more productivity saves as well as an ability to better serve our clients and invest for the future.\nMoving to Slide 11. As you can see, our capital levels remain strong and comfortably above the regulatory minimums. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio of 11.2% was slightly higher from the prior quarter as capital generated from earnings was partially offset by continued dividends and share repurchases as well as higher RWAs as we support our clients which in turn drove higher fees and NII. We returned over $300 million in the first quarter to shareholders followed by $400 million through common share repurchases and dividends in the second quarter as we have tried to strike the right balance between our capital return goals and the support of our clients.\nLooking ahead to the back half of the year, we have announced a planned 10% per share quarterly common dividend increase on the heels of a strong performance under this year's CCAR starting in 3Q and subject to Board approval. In addition, our intention is to accelerate the pace of quarterly buybacks relative to the first half of the year. However, given the more modest level of repurchase activity so far this year, the full year payout ratio for 2024 will likely be closer to the 80% to 90% range in line with our medium-term targets.\nIn summary, we are pleased with our second quarter and first half results, which demonstrate our ability to execute against our strategy to drive sustained business momentum while delivering positive total operating leverage, excluding notable items.\nWith that, let me cover our improved full year outlook, which I would highlight, continues to have the potential for variability given the uncertain economic and political environment we're operating in.\nIn terms of our current macro assumptions, as we stand here today, we are assuming global equity markets are flat to second quarter end for the remainder of the year. Our rate outlook broadly aligns with the current forward curve as of quarter end, while we expect both FX market volatility and specials to remain muted.\nGiven our strong start to the year and higher average market levels, we now expect that total fee revenue will likely be in the range of up 4% to 5% on a full year basis, somewhat better than our prior expectations for roughly 4% year-on-year growth.\nTurning to NII. Given our 2Q performance along with the continued benefit of management actions we have taken to support NII growth this year, we now expect full year NII will be up slightly year-over-year, which is also better than our previous guide of down roughly 5% on a full year basis.\nFinally, given these improved top line expectations, full year expenses are likely to be somewhat higher than our prior outlook of up 2.5% this year. We now expect expenses, excluding notable items to be up about 3% this year given the expected revenue-related costs. Importantly, given this improved outlook, we now expect to deliver both positive fee operating leverage and positive total operating leverage for the full year excluding notable items.\nAnd with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.\n\nRonald Philip O’Hanley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, State Street Corporation\n\nThank you, Eric. Operator, we can open it up for questions."

Please go ahead.\n\nIlene Fiszel Bieler\n\nHead-Fixed Income Investor Relations, Citigroup, Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us.\nOn our call today, our CEO, Ron O'Hanley, will speak first; then Eric Aboaf, our CFO, will take you through our first quarter 2024 earnings slide presentation, which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, investors.statestreet.com.

Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them, even if our views change.\nNow let me turn it over to Ron.\n\nRonald Philip O’Hanley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, State Street Corporation\n\nThank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone.\nEarlier today, we released our first quarter financial results. We had a strong start to the year with our results demonstrating the breadth of our client franchise, the efficacy of our strategy and our focus on execution. We reported both fee and total revenue growth, all while continuing to invest meaningfully in our business and controlling underlying expenses. Excluding notable items, we delivered both positive fee and total operating leverage as well as solid EPS growth in Q1 relative to the year ago period.\nThe first quarter was an important milestone. We have detailed our strategic priorities for 2024, including the growth initiatives we are undertaking across each of our business areas as we continue to both invest in our capabilities and also target further productivity gains. Guided by our purpose to help create better outcomes for the world's investors and the people they serve, our 4 strategic priorities are aimed at continuing to extend our competitive advantage while delivering positive fee operating leverage, excluding notable items in 2024.\nThese 2024 priorities are: growing fee revenue; extending our leadership in our markets in financing and global advisers franchises; enhancing and optimizing our operating model; and continuing to differentiate our business through innovative client solutions and technology-led capabilities to support business growth.\nWe remain intensely focused on executing against these strategic priorities, particularly in a dynamic operating environment in which financial market expectations continue to change significantly. For example, as inflation remains elevated and economic data continued to be robust, investors push back their expectation for the timing of central bank rate cuts and treasury yields increased during the first quarter. Despite this, global equity markets performed strongly and volatility remained muted with many indices setting records as fears of a hard economic landing ceded and optimism surrounding the potential economic benefit from artificial intelligence continued in Q1.\nTurning to Slide 3 of our investor presentation. I will review our first quarter highlights before Eric takes you through the quarter in more detail.\nBeginning with our financial performance, 2024 started strongly. Year-over-year, we produced both positive fee and total operating leverage as well as good EPS growth, excluding notable items. First quarter EPS was $1.37 or $1.69, excluding a notable item related to the increase to the FDIC special assessment.\nUnderlying year-over-year EPS growth was supported by total fee revenue growth and continued common share repurchases, which more than offset the impact of lower NII on total revenue. Underlying expenses continue to be well controlled, supported by our ongoing productivity efforts, with first quarter expenses increasing just 1% year-over-year, excluding notable items, even as we have increased the level of investments in our business.\nTurning to our business momentum, which you can see on the middle of the slide, we continue to make progress across our client franchise and generating better fee revenue growth. Within asset services, AUC/A increased to a record $43.9 trillion. We generated asset servicing AUC/A wins of $474 billion in Q1, supported by key wins in both North America and Europe. Servicing fee revenue wins totaled $67 million. After hitting our full year sales target of $300 million in 2023, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our increased servicing fee revenue sales goal of $350 million to $400 million in 2024.\nOur priority to grow fee revenue this year is underpinned by a strategy of leading with service excellence and driving stronger back-office sales differentiating with our State Street Alpha and private markets platforms. Our 2 new Alpha mandate wins this quarter demonstrate our ability to execute on the strategy while also showcasing the clear competitive advantage and differentiation that Alpha creates for our business.\nFor example, both Alpha mandate wins this quarter include back-office services, which can install quickly allowing us to realize revenue faster. Further, one mandate is our second alpha for private markets win, a key growth area for us. Encouragingly, both of these Alpha wins were takeaways from a key competitor with one of the wins having no existing services with State Street prior to becoming an Alpha client and the other a shared client that will now consolidate back office with State Street.\nWithin markets and financing, even as low FX volatility created a headwind for the industry in the first quarter, we attracted higher FX client volumes, both sequentially and year-over-year, supported by our market-leading and wide-ranging FX trading solutions. In FX, we are pleased to see higher client volumes and the 8% Q-over-Q fee revenue growth.\nWe also expanded our markets franchise. Within outsourced trading, we continue to expand our product capabilities and geographical reach, completing the acquisition of CF Global Trading in Q1.\nGlobal Advisors performed well, buoyed by higher equity markets, the strategic actions we have taken to position our asset management business for growth and the benefits of the strong finish and step-off point at year-end 2023. 1Q 2024 management fees of $510 million are the highest since the first quarter of 2022.\nWhile GA experienced total aggregate outflows in Q1, this was driven by the impact of a large but expected single client redemption within the institutional business. We saw continued momentum in the defined contribution business driven by our target date franchise.\nEncouragingly, we saw cash net inflows of $9 billion in the quarter, the fourth consecutive quarter of positive net inflows of our cash business. ETF AUM reached a record $1.4 trillion at quarter end, with GA continuing to gather net inflows and expand market share within U.S. low-cost ETFs.\nNow let me spend a moment on our continuing productivity efforts. We have a detailed set of initiatives across our business aimed at creating cost efficiencies and lasting productivity improvements. Regarding our ongoing operating model transformation, which forms an important part of these productivity initiatives, as you know, we are streamlining our operating model in India, and last quarter, we consolidated our first operations joint venture in the country. I am pleased to note that the consolidation of our second operations joint venture in India closed on April 1.\nCombined, these 2 consolidations will propel the continued end-to-end transformation of our global operations and enable State Street to unlock productivity savings in the years ahead as we simplify our operating model.\nBefore I conclude my opening remarks, I would like to touch on our continuing balance sheet strength. Total capital return amounted to $308 million in the first quarter, consisting of common share dividends and share repurchases. I would highlight that we have returned a substantial amount of capital to our shareholders in recent quarters, with total capital return over the last 6 quarters equivalent to almost 30% of State Street's total market cap at quarter end.\nAs we pivot to a more normalized level of capital return this year, as we have outlined previously, it remains our intention to return approximately 100% of earnings in 2024 in the form of common share dividends and share repurchases, subject to market conditions and other factors.\nTo conclude, we have delivered a strong start to the year as demonstrated by both sequential and year-over-year total fee revenue growth, encouraging business wins, strong underlying expense discipline and continued capital return. As we look ahead, we remain highly focused on the execution of a set of clear strategic priorities for 2024. These strategic priorities are backed by detailed action plans aimed at driving growth across each of our business areas.\nUnderpinning this execution is a set of business investments, paired with a comprehensive set of productivity initiatives, aimed at driving longer-term improvements in our operating model efficiency and effectiveness and generating positive fee operating leverage in 2024.\nNow let me hand the call over to Eric, who will take you through the quarter in more detail.\n\nEric Walter Aboaf\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, State Street Corporation\n\nThank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 4, I'll begin my review of our first quarter financial results, which included a $0.32 EPS impact from an additional FDIC special assessment as described within the notable items table on the right of the slide.\nAs Ron noted, we produced a strong start to the year. On the left panel, you can see that total fee revenue was up both sequentially and year-on-year. Relative to the year ago period, we delivered robust management fee growth, higher front office software and data revenue and servicing fee growth, while underlying expenses were well controlled. As I mentioned during the first quarter, we recorded a provision for credit losses of $27 million, largely due to 2 CRE names.\nAll told, we generated both positive total and fee operating leverage relative to the year ago, excluding notable items. We also delivered solid year-on-year EPS growth of 11%, excluding notable items, which was supported by the continuation of our share buybacks in the first quarter.\nTurning now to Slide 5. We saw period-end AUC/A increased by 17% on a year-on-year basis and 5% sequentially to a record level. Year-on-year, the increase in AUC/A was largely driven by higher period end market levels net new business and client flows. I would note that we have seen a mix shift into cash and cash equivalents worth an estimated 1 to 2 percentage points of total AUC/A versus a year ago. Quarter-on-quarter, AUC/A increased primarily due to higher period end market levels and client flows.\nGlobal Advisors period end AUM also increased to a record level, up 20% year-on-year, largely reflecting higher period end market levels and net inflows and up 5% sequentially, primarily due to higher period end market levels. At the right center of the slide, the market volatility indices provide a useful indicator of client transactional activity that drives servicing fees, spreads in FX trading and special activity in agency lending.\nTurning to Slide 6. On the left side of the page, you'll see first quarter total servicing fees up 1% year-on-year, primarily from higher average market levels, partially offset by pricing headwinds, a previously disclosed client transition and lower client activity and adjustments, including changes in certain client asset mix into lower earning cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the pace of installation started slower than we expected in the first quarter.\nLet me dimension some of these items for you. As I've told you before, the impact of the previously disclosed client transition was a headwind of approximately 2 percentage points to year-on-year growth. In addition, lower client activity and adjustments, including the client asset mix shift to cash was also a headwind of approximately 2 percentage points of year-on-year growth this quarter, some of which we believe is cyclical.\nSequentially, total servicing fees were up 1%, primarily as a result of higher average market levels, partially offset by lower client activity and adjustments, including the changes to certain asset mix and pricing headwinds.\nOn the bottom of the slide, we summarized some of the key performance indicators of our servicing business. In the first quarter, we generated $67 million of servicing fee wins, nicely spread across both North America and Europe. As you recall, solid sales in North America like this was one of the goals that we had described at a conference last fall.\nIn addition, we had $291 million of servicing fee revenue to be installed at quarter end up $71 million year-on-year and $21 million quarter-on-quarter. We also had $2.6 trillion of AUC/A to be installed at period end.\nTurning now to Slide 7. First quarter management fees were up 12% year-on-year, primarily reflecting higher average market levels and net inflows from the prior periods, partially offset by the impact of a strategic ETF product suite repricing initiative. Relative to the prior quarter, management fees were up 6% due to similar reasons, partially offset by lower performance fees.\nAs you can see on the bottom-right of the slide, following record inflows in 4Q '23, our investment management franchise remains well positioned with momentum across each of its businesses. In ETFs, the overall flows were relatively flat in first quarter, our SPDR portfolio, U.S. low-cost suite, achieved continued market share gains driven by net inflows of $13 billion.\nIn our institutional business, we saw first quarter net outflows of $19 billion, primarily driven by a single client. That said, we saw continued momentum in the U.S. defined contribution area with record AUM of approximately $730 billion.\nLastly, in our cash franchise, we saw first quarter net inflows of $9 billion, the fourth consecutive quarter of positive net flows into cash.\nTurning now to Slide 8. First quarter FX trading services revenue was down 3% year-on-year, but up 8% sequentially. Relative to the year ago period, the decrease was mainly due to lower spreads associated with the subdued FX volatility, partially offset by higher volumes as client engagement increased across nearly all of our FX venues. Quarter-on-quarter, the 8% revenue increase primarily reflects higher volumes with particular strength in our EM business as well as higher direct FX spreads.\nFirst quarter securities finance revenues were down 12% year-on-year, mainly due to lower agency balances and lower spreads, primarily associated with significantly lower industry specials activity. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, we have seen agency lending balances up as demand is rising.\nSoftware and processing fees were up 25% year-on-year in Q1, largely driven by higher revenues associated with CRD which I'll discuss in more detail shortly. Quarter-on-quarter software and processing fees declined 13%, primarily due to our lower on-premise renewals, partially offset by higher lending-related fees.\nFinally, other fee revenue for the quarter increased $5 million year-on-year. Sequentially, other fee revenue increased $17 million, largely driven by an episodic currency devaluation in the prior quarter, which did not recur.\nMoving to Slide 9. You'll see on the left panel that first quarter front office software and data revenue increased 32% year-on-year, primarily as a result of continued SaaS implementations and conversions driving higher professional services and software-enabled revenue growth. Sequentially, front office software and data revenue was down 20%, primarily driven by lower on-premise renewals and installations.\nTurning to some of the Alpha business metrics on the right panel, we were pleased to report 2 additional alpha wins, including our second Alpha for private markets mandate. In addition, 3 mandates went live in the first quarter, bringing the total number of live mandates to 21.\nFirst quarter ARR increased 19% year-on-year, driven by over 20 SaaS client implementations and conversions over the last year.\nTurning to Slide 10. First quarter NII decreased 7% year-on-year but increased 6% sequentially to $716 million. The year-on-year decrease was largely due to deposit mix shift and lower average noninterest-bearing deposit balances, partially offset by the impact of higher average interest rates, client lending growth and investment portfolio positions.\nWe were pleased to report a sequential increase in NII, which was primarily driven by higher investment securities yields an increase in average interest-bearing deposits and loan growth, partially offset by the decline in average noninterest-bearing deposits.\nThe NII results on a sequential quarter basis were better than we had previously expected, primarily driven by strength in both interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposit balances towards the end of the quarter. While it is difficult to forecast the path of deposits in the current environment, we're pleased with the success that we are having in engaging our clients.\nOn the right of this slide, we provide highlights from our average balance sheet during the first quarter. Average deposits increased 4% year-on-year and 6% quarter-on-quarter, mainly driven by client balance growth across the interest-bearing deposit stack, partially offset by a reduction in noninterest-bearing deposits. Average -- noninterest-bearing deposits decreased by less than $3 billion quarter-on-quarter.\nCumulative U.S. dollar client deposit betas were 80% since the start of the current rate cycle with cumulative foreign currency basis for the same period, continuing to be lower in the 30% to 60% range depending on currency.\nTurning to Slide 11. First quarter expenses, excluding notable items, increased barely 1% year-on-year as we both invested more to fuel fee growth and increase the size of our productivity and optimization savings efforts by more than 50%.\nOn a line-by-line basis, excluding notable items on a year-on-year basis, compensation and employee benefits decreased 3%, primarily driven by lower incentive compensation and salaries as well as a decline in contractor spend that was partially driven by the consolidation of one of our operations joint ventures in India.\nInformation systems and communications expenses increased 4%, mainly due to higher technology and infrastructure investments, partially offset by the optimization savings and vendor savings initiatives.\nTransaction processing increased 4%, mainly reflecting higher broker fees due to increased global market volumes.\nOccupancy increased 10%, partially due to real estate costs associated with the consolidation of the joint venture in India which used to form part of the contractor cost within compensation benefits, partially offset by footprint optimization and other expenses increased 5%, largely due to the timing of foundation funding.\nLastly, I'll spend a moment on our transformation efforts. If you recall, consolidating the first operation's joint venture last October increased our FTE head count as we in-source those capabilities. However, it also came with an expected financial benefit, excluding integration costs of $20 million over the course of the year.\nAs Ron mentioned, the consolidation of our second operations joint venture in India closed on April 1, and this will also come with an increase in additional head count from 2Q as well as expected financial benefits. The consolidation of these 2 joint ventures will be a catalyst for the next phase of State Street's Global operations transformation and enable us to create a second wave of service improvements and productivity savings next year.\nMoving to Slide 12. On the left side of the slide, we detail the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios followed by our capital trends on the right of the slide. As you can see, our capital levels remain well above the regulatory minimums. While we continue to focus on optimizing our capital stack, the strength of our capital position enables us to extend our balance sheet to support our clients. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio of 11.1% was down approximately 50 basis points quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by the expected normalization of RWA.\nThe LCR for State Street Corporation was a healthy 107% and 130% of State Street Bank and Trust. Our exceptionally strong liquidity metrics benefit from the deep and diversified nature of our funding base and active balance sheet management.\nIn the quarter, we were pleased to return $308 million to shareholders consisting of $100 million of common share repurchases and $208 million in declared common stock dividends. As Ron noted, we continue to expect to return around 100% of earnings to shareholders this year.\nIn summary, we're quite pleased with the quarter. We have a clear strategy for growth, a detailed set of priorities that we are executing against in order to drive continued positive business momentum and expect to deliver increased fee operating leverage this year, excluding notable items.\nFinally, let me cover our full year and second quarter outlook, which I would highlight continues to have the potential for variability given the macro environment we're operating in.\nIn terms of our current assumptions, as we stand here today, we are assuming global equity markets flat to first quarter end for the remainder of the year, which implies daily averages up 5% quarter-on-quarter in 2Q and up around 17% for the full year. Our rate outlook broadly aligns with the current forward curve, which I would note continues to move, while we expect FX market volatility will remain muted.\nGiven our strong start to the year, and higher average market levels, we think total fee revenue for the full year will now be at the higher end of our prior guide of up 3% to 4% year-on-year, so up a solid 4%, which is better than our previous outlook. There are, however, episodic and industry headwinds impacting our servicing business this year, including a previously disclosed client transition and the impact of client activity and adjustments, which includes the client asset mix shift into lower-earning cash and cash equivalents.\nWe believe some of these factors are cyclical in nature, and we expect to offset a portion with higher sales and additional management actions this year.\nTurning to NII. As a result of our first quarter outperformance, strong deposit growth and the improved interest rate outlook, we now expect full year NII will be down approximately 5% year-on-year which is better than our previous guide of down approximately 11%.\nOn expenses, we expect full year expenses, ex notables, will be roughly in line with our prior guide of up about 2.5%, but with the potential for some additional revenue-related costs this year.\nGiven our improved outlook, we now expect to deliver additional positive fee operating leverage for the full year, excluding notable items.\nFinally, turning to 2Q on a quarter-on-quarter basis and excluding notable items, we would expect total fee revenue to be up 1.5% to 2%; NII to be down 2% to down 5%; and expenses up about 2% to 2.5%, excluding the seasonal compensation expenses in 1Q and notable items. We think the provisions for credit losses could be in the $15 million to $25 million range in 2Q, and we would expect to have a better view on that later in the quarter as we continue to monitor our portfolio.\nLastly, we expect 2Q tax rate to be approximately 22%.\nAnd with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.\n\nRonald Philip O’Hanley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, State Street Corporation\n\nOperator, we can now open the call for questions."

On our call today, our CEO, Ron O'Hanley, will speak first. Then Eric Aboaf, our CFO, will take you through our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings slide presentation, which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, investors.statestreet.com.\nAfterwards, we'll be happy to take questions.

Now let me turn it over to Ron.\n\nRonald Philip O’Hanley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, State Street Corporation\n\nThank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we released our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. As I reflect on 2023, the operating environment was dynamic with a complex set of challenges for the world's investors and for our industry, and I'm proud of how we carefully navigated State Street for various headwinds while continuing to execute against our strategic agenda.\nWe focused and delivered on that agenda in 3 key areas: achieved strong sales wins across our businesses, drive strategic change in our Investment Services business, and remained disciplined on productivity and broader cost management. Further on that last point, during 2023, we implemented key productivity actions and announced additional efficiency measures that will enable us to enhance the productivity of our operating model in 2024 and the years ahead.\nWe took these many actions, all while investing in our business and returning substantial capital to our shareholders, which helped to drive full year earnings growth, excluding notable items. The world's investors, State Street and our industry faced a host of significant market events and macroeconomic forces in 2023.\nIn the first quarter, turmoil in the banking sector ultimately led to the resolution of several banks, which was a catalyst for some of the largest fixed income market move seen in decades.\nIn the second quarter, anticipation grew about the potential economic benefit from artificial intelligence, helping to drive equity markets higher. However, as we progressed into the third quarter as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to the highest level in [ 2022 ] years in July, the prospect of higher for longer rates led to a substantial selloff in bond markets with the U.S. 10-year treasury yield exceeding 5% in October for the first time since the global financial crisis.\nRate uncertainty and an increasing number of geopolitical concerns cause equities to struggle. Then during the fourth quarter, the equity market rallied vigorously as inflation receded and investors grew increasingly optimistic about a soft landing with positive sentiment gaining further momentum in the last month as the Federal Reserve signaled pivot to lower interest rates this year.\nIn sum, while our full year overall financial results benefited from higher interest rates globally last year and despite the strong market appreciation in the fourth quarter, daily average global equity markets only increased by low single digits in 2023, providing just a modest tailwind to our fee revenue, while client activity was muted as investors stayed on the sidelines for much of the year. And even in such an eventful year, equity and FX market volatility continued to contract, creating revenue headwinds for our trading businesses.\nSlide 3 of our investor presentation provides some of our highlights for the year. Beginning with our financial performance, full year earnings per share was [ $5.58 or $7.66 ] excluding notable items. Year-over-year, excluding notable items, EPS growth was supported by $3.8 [ billion ] of common share repurchases, a record level of NII, continued growth of our front office software and data business, and higher securities finance revenues, the combination of which more than offset the impact of lower servicing and management fees and underlying expense growth, which was still well controlled.\nWe continue to build business momentum and position State Street in longer term success. To that end, we achieved a number of important accomplishments in 2023, as you can see on Slide 3. A key highlight of today's results is the clear progress we are making on innovation and advancing product capabilities, which in turn contributes to stronger sales momentum across our broad franchise aimed at generating better fee revenue growth in the year ahead.\nWithin the Investment Services business, we are intensely focused on ensuring better execution against our strategy and revenue goals. We unveiled the sharpened execution plan last year, underpinned by a number of measurable actions aimed at driving servicing opportunities across key regions and product areas, realizing the full potential of our alpha value proposition and accelerating sales and revenue growth particularly in our core back-office custody.\nEncouragingly, as I just noted, today's results demonstrate our proven ability to deliver the level of sales required for attractive organic servicing fee revenue growth in the future as we built upon the $91 million of new servicing fee sales in the third quarter by recording $103 million of new servicing fee wins in 4Q, which is the highest level of quarterly new servicing fees in recent years.\nFrom its inception, we have noted that Alpha will further establish broaden and deepen client relationships, positioning State Street as our clients' essential partner. Alpha distinctively enables us to grow and tie together the full breadth and depth of State Street's capability as a true one State Street solution for our clients from front to back. 2023 was an important year for Alpha software delivery. The last 2 quarters of the year included the significant development of the fixed income portfolio management module, which propels CRD and Alpha capabilities and competitiveness forward.\nIn 3Q, we recorded our first Alpha for private markets client. And in the fourth quarter, we continued Alpha's momentum by [ deemed paying ] relationships with a number of key existing mandates and recording 4 new Alpha wins, while our front office software and data business had a record quarter of new bookings in 4Q, both demonstrating our ability to drive stronger sales.\nWithin our Global Markets business, even as low volatility created a headwind, we continue to see proof points of our very strong market position. For example, in its 2023 FX awards, Euromoney Magazine named State Street as the winner across 4 important categories, including the best FX bank for real money clients. We also continued to innovate and strategically expand our product capabilities and geographic reach including the planned acquisition of outsourced trading from CF Global Trading.\nAt Global Advisors, we undertook targeted strategic actions aimed at gaining market share and driving management fee growth in the coming years. As a result, we saw encouraging business momentum with GA setting a number of growth records in 2023. A number of key performance indicators make us optimistic as we look ahead. For example, in Q4, GA recorded the best ever quarter of aggregate total flows, including record quarterly flows within our SPDR ETF franchise, amounting to a capture of 21% of total global ETF flows in Q4 and ending 2023 with a record level of total ETF assets under management.\nOur cash business had an exceptional year, delivering record annual flows in 2023 with institutional money market fund AUM also reaching a record. Overall, we gained market share in a number of key areas, including institutional money market funds and U.S. low-cost equity and fixed income, ETFs.\nTurning to our efficiency and productivity efforts, underlying expense growth was well controlled in 2023 with full year expenses increasing 3%, excluding notable items. Q4 expenses, excluding notable items, rose just 1% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting the impact of our ongoing expense actions. Transforming our operations to improve effectiveness and efficiency and realized productivity growth remains a key priority for us. To that end, we announced important steps in our multiyear productivity efforts aimed at improving our operating model.\nAs we previously announced, we are streamlining our operations in India. We have now assumed control of one of our joint ventures in that country with a second joint venture consolidation expected to close in the spring. We expect these actions will accelerate the transformation of State Street's global operations, improve service quality and client experience and enable us to achieve productivity savings as part of our plans to deliver positive fee operating leverage in 2024.\nTurning to Slide 4 of our presentation, you can see our fourth quarter financial highlights and business momentum indicators, which Eric will shortly take you through in more detail. Before I conclude my opening remarks, I would like to touch on our continuing balance sheet strength, which has enabled us to return a substantial amount of excess capital in recent quarters. For example, over the last 5 quarters to the end of December, we have returned $6.4 billion of capital to our shareholders.\nAs we pivot to a more normalized level of capital return, in 2024, it is currently our intention to return approximately 100% of earnings in the form of common share dividends and share repurchases, subject to market conditions.\nAccordingly, as we announced this morning, our Board of Directors has authorized a new common share purchase program of up to $5 billion with no set expiration date.\nTo conclude, while 2023 was an eventful year, we finished strongly in 4Q, which creates an encouraging starting point for our businesses into 2024. This year, we remain highly focused on both the execution of our strategy and the accountability for results. Our goals are clear. We must continue the improvement in our sales performance that we demonstrated in the second half of 2023, and continue to implement a set of productivity initiatives and product enhancements that will drive longer-term improvements in our operating model efficiency and effectiveness and deliver positive [ PR ] operating leverage in 2024, all while returning capital to our shareholders. We are laser-focused on these goals.\nNow let me hand the call over to Eric, who will take you through the quarter in more detail.\n\nEric Walter Aboaf\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, State Street Corporation\n\nThank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my review of our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results, let me briefly discuss the notable items we recognized in the quarter on Slide 5, which collectively totaled $620 million pretax or $1.49 of EPS.\nFirst, we recognized an FDIC special assessment of $387 million, which is reflected in other expenses. Second, we recognized $203 million of net repositioning charges to enable the next phase of our productivity program. As we had indicated in December, the bulk of this action primarily relates to the severance of around 1,500 employees. Our initiative to streamline and delayer our operations, technology and staff functions and improve efficiency will allow us to sustainably reduce expenses.\nWe expect these actions collectively to have a payback of roughly 6 quarters and begin this quarter with roughly 2/3 of the benefit occurring in 2024. These actions and the related savings will contribute to our fee operating leverage goal for 2024 and in subsequent years.\nTurning to Slide 6. I will begin my review both our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. As you can see on the table, total fee revenue was flattish for all periods of comparison quarter-on-quarter, the year-on-year quarter and for the full year. The slight market appreciation notwithstanding the combination of muted volatility, central bank pivots and geopolitical concerns pushed investors to the sidelines for much of the year.\nIn terms of our more durable revenues, we continue to benefit from strong momentum in our front office software and data business, which was up 5% on a full year basis and 13% on the year-on-year quarter. In terms of areas that have begun to rebound, management fee performance was down for the full year at minus 3%, but has begun to rebound with an up 5% result for the year-on-year quarter as flows picked up, and we gained share.\nBack-office servicing fees was challenged for much for the year as the client transactional activity was muted, but has started to turn positive and is up 1% this quarter as we've seen a recent lift in equity markets. And of course, we continue to be affected by industry-wide headwinds in our Global Markets businesses given the low levels of volatility in the FX markets and special activity in agency lending throughout the year.\nNII has been tough to predict and surprised to the positive this quarter compared to third quarter. I'll turn to that in a few minutes. Expenses were well controlled in the quarter as we continue to thoughtfully allocate resources across the franchise and to areas where we see the greatest opportunities for top line growth.\nRelative to a year ago, total expenses ex notables were up 2% year-on-year and reflect intensifying cost management in a tough environment as the year progressed. This expense control, coupled with the repositioning actions I just mentioned, prepare us to deliver productivity savings and positive fee operating leverage in 2024.\nFinally, despite a dynamic and challenging operating environment, we delivered full year 2023 EPS growth of 3%, excluding notable items. This was supported by share repurchases, a record level of NII and the growth of our front office software and data business, which is less exposed to macroeconomic conditions.\nTurning now to Slide 7. We saw period-end AUC/A increased by 14% on a year-on-year basis and 4% sequentially. Year-on-year, the increase in AUC/A was largely driven by higher period end market levels and net new business. Quarter-on-quarter AUC/A increased primarily due to higher period end market levels. At At Global Advisors, period end AUM increased 19% year-on-year and was up 12% sequentially, largely reflecting higher period end market levels and strong net inflows.\nNotably, as Ron mentioned earlier, and I'll describe momentarily, in fourth quarter, GA recorded the best ever quarter of aggregate net flows of $103 billion, which sets us up well for 2024. At the center right, we've also added a table with market volatility indices, which we believe can be useful indicators of plying transactional activity that drives servicing fees, [ specialist ] activity and agency lending and flows and margins in FX trading.\nOn Slide 8 now. On the left side of the page, you'll see fourth quarter total servicing fees up 1% year-on-year, primarily from higher average equity markets, partially offset by pricing headwinds, lower client activity and adjustments in a previously disclosed client transition. Sequentially, total servicing fees were down 2%, primarily as a result of the pricing headwinds and a previously disclosed net client transition partially offset by higher client activity and adjustments, which was nice to see as clients started to come off the sidelines.\nOn the bottom left of the slide, we summarize some of the key performance indicators of our servicing business. We were quite pleased to see new servicing fee revenue wins of $103 million this quarter, the highest in many recent years, primarily reflecting the enhancements of our sales processes and product offerings, including in North America, where we saw strong outcomes after a period of underperformance. These servicing wins contributed to the total full year fee revenue wins of $301 million and underscores the progress we're making towards stronger sales performance. Recall, our goal for 2024 is even higher at $350 million to $400 million in servicing fee sales for the year.\nFinally, we had $270 million of servicing fee revenue to be installed at quarter end, up $57 million year-on-year and $15 million quarter-on-quarter. We expect about half of this to install in 2024. We also had $2.3 trillion of AUC/A to be installed at period end.\nTurning to Slide 9. Fourth quarter management fees were $479 million, up 5% year-on-year, primarily reflecting higher average equity market levels and some performance fees partially offset by a previously described shift of certain management fees into NII and the impact of a strategic product suite repricing initiative that has aided ETF flows.\nRelative to the third quarter, management fees were flat, mainly driven by higher performance fees, offset by a previously described shift of certain management fees into NII and the impact of the strategic ETF product suite repricing initiative.\nAs you can see on the bottom right of the slide, our investment management franchise remains well positioned with very strong and broad-based business momentum across each of its businesses. In ETFs, we had record quarterly net inflows of $68 billion, driven by record net inflows into SPY as well as the [ Spyder ] portfolio U.S. low-cost suite, experiencing consistent market share gains. In our Institutional business, we saw quarterly net flows of $6 billion, primarily driven by defined contribution products.\nAnd lastly, across our cash franchise, we saw quarterly cash net inflows of $29 billion primarily into money market funds, which contributed to the record total full year 2023 cash net inflows of $76 billion, and institutional money market fund market share gains.\nTurning now to Slide 10. Fourth quarter FX Trading Services revenue was down 11% year-on-year ex notables and 2% sequentially, relative to the period a year ago, the decrease was mainly due to lower FX spreads from muted market volatility, offset by slightly higher volumes. Quarter-on-quarter, the decrease primarily reflects lower direct FX revenues from muted volatility.\nFourth quarter Securities Finance revenues were down 6% year-on-year due to lower agency balances, partially offset by higher agency spreads, higher [ specials ] activity and prime services revenue. Moving on to Software and Processing revenues. Fourth quarter fees were up 10% year-on-year and 26% sequentially, largely driven by CRD, which I'll turn to shortly.\nFinally, other fee revenue for the quarter increased $15 million year-on-year, primarily due to a midyear tax credit investment accounting change, partially offset by the impacts associated with the devaluation of the Argentinian peso.\nMoving to Slide 11. You'll see on the left panel that fourth quarter Front Office Software and Data revenue increased 13% year-on-year, primarily as a result of the continued SaaS implementations and conversions driving software-enabled and professional services revenue growth. Sequentially, Front Office Software and Data revenue was up 38%, primarily driven by higher on-premise renewals and go-live implementations.\nTurning to some of the Alpha business metrics on the right panel. We were pleased to report 4 more Alpha mandate wins in the quarter, which means 7 wins for the full year 2023. State Street Alpha continues to be an important differentiator of our business and creates an attractive value proposition for our clients with contractual terms usually covering 5 to 7 to 10 years.\nWe've also gone live with 3 more Alpha clients, which brings us to 6 for the year, which sets us up well for 2024 and added significant new functionality for fixed income portfolio managers. Fourth quarter ARR increased 16% year-over-year driven by 20-plus SaaS client implementations and conversions and we had a record quarter for front office new bookings at $32 million.\nTurning to Slide 12. Fourth quarter NII increased 14% year-on-year but increased 9% sequentially to $678 million. The year-on-year decrease was largely due to lower average deposit balances and deposit mix shift, partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates. Sequentially, the increase in NII performance was primarily driven by the impact of interest rates and the full quarter impact of the third quarter investment portfolio repositioning as well as higher deposits and loan balances.\nThe NII results on a sequential quarter basis were better than we had previously expected as both interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits increased and certain client repricings were further delayed. Some of the higher deposit balances may have been seasonal, but the Fed's quantitative tightening appears to have been offset by the reduction of the Fed reverse repo operation, which seems to have resulted in inclines having higher bank deposit balances.\nIt's hard to know how deposits will trend, but we're pleased with this higher step off going into the first quarter of 2024. On the right side of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during the fourth quarter. Average deposits increased 4% quarter-on-quarter with noninterest-bearing deposits up 3% for the quarter.\nTurning to Slide 13. Fourth quarter expenses, excluding notable items, increased 2% year-on-year or 1% ex FX. Sequentially, fourth quarter expenses were up only 1% as we actively managed expenses and continued our productivity and optimization savings efforts, all while carefully investing in strategic elements of the company, including Alpha, private markets, core custody and tech and ops process improvements in automation.\nOn a line-by-line basis and year-over-year ex notables, compensation and employee benefits increased 1%, primarily driven by higher salaries and employee benefits, partially offset by lower contractor spend in performance-based incentive comp. Information systems and communications expenses increased 4% mainly due to higher technology and infrastructure investments, partially offset by the benefits from ongoing optimization efforts in sourcing and vendor credits.\nTransaction processing increased 1%, mainly reflecting higher brokerage costs. Occupancy increased 24%, largely due to the absence of an episodic sale-leaseback transaction in the prior period. And other expenses were up 3% sequentially, flat year-on-year, mainly reflecting higher marketing expense and professional fees.\nLastly, let me spend a moment on headcount. As we discussed in the third quarter, as part of our ongoing transformation and productivity initiatives, we've streamlined our operating model in India and have now assumed full ownership of one of our operations, joint ventures and we recently announced that we intend a similar undertaking with a second consolidation in the country this spring.\nThis consolidation continues the transformation of State Street's global operations and will enable us to unlock productivity savings, which we expect to start this quarter through a reduction in contract services and in the years ahead, as we simplify our fragmented operating model. As you would expect, consolidating the first joint venture increased our FTE headcount roughly 4,400 in the quarter as we in-source global capabilities. However, these costs were already in our expense base and reported historically under the comp and benefits line. These actions are contributing to our higher productivity savings targets for 2024.\nMoving to Slide 14. On the left side of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios followed by our capital trends on the right of the slide. As you can see, we continue to navigate the operating environment with very strong capital levels, which came in above both our internal targets and the regulatory minimums. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio of 11.6% was up 60 basis points quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by episodically lower RWA and improvement in AOCI, partially offset by the continuation of common share repurchases.\nThe decrease in interest rates during December after the completion of our buyback contributed about 20 basis points to our CET1 ratios and some market factors over the last week of December conveniently contributed roughly another 50 basis points to the RWA end-of-period print.\nGoing forward, I would expect the RWA to run at higher levels to support our various businesses. Our LCR for State Street Corporation was a healthy 106% and 122% for State Street Bank & Trust. In the quarter, we were quite pleased to return over $700 million to shareholders, consisting of $500 million of common share repurchases and over $200 million in common stock dividends. Lastly, as we announced earlier today, our Board authorized a new multiyear common equity repurchase program of up to $5 billion with no expiration date.\nTurning to Slide 15. Before I start, let me first share some of the assumptions and underlying our current views for the full year. Let me cover our full year 2024 outlook as well as provide some thoughts on the first quarter, both of which have more potential for variability than usual, given the macroeconomic environment we're operating in.\nIn terms of our current macro expectations, as we stand here today, we expect global equity markets to be flat point-to-point in 2024, which equates to the daily average being up about 10% year-over-year. Our interest rate outlook for 2024 largely aligned with the forward curve as of year-end 2023, which I would note continues to move.\nWe expect to see modest increase in FX and equity volatility, which should support slightly higher FX trading services fees this year, but we are still seeing muted volatility in the first quarter. And we expect currency translation to have less than 0.5 percentage point impact on revenues and expenses due to dollar depreciation, and I would remind you that a weaker U.S. dollar has a favorable impact on revenues and an unfavorable impact on expenses.\nSo we currently expect that full year total fee revenue will be up approximately 3% to 4% ex notable items with servicing fee and management fee growth driven by them and continued strong growth in Front Office Software and Data. This includes a headwind of a little less than 1 percentage point to fee growth from the expected previously disclosed client transition.\nRegarding the first quarter of 2024, we currently expect fee revenue to be up 2% on a year-over-year basis, with servicing fees expected to be up 1%, management fees up 7% to 8%, and front office software and data expected to be up over 20%, largely due to increased SaaS, new business and conversions and on-premise renewals. We expect full year 2024 NII to be down about 10% on a year-over-year basis compared to a record 2023. This is dependent on the outcome of global rate cuts and deposit mix and levels, which are obviously difficult to predict. Regarding the first quarter of 2024, after a significant step-up in 4Q '23, we expect 1Q 24 NII to be flat to down 3% on a sequential quarter basis given current deposit mix expectations.\nTurning to expenses. As you can see on the walk on Page 16, we expect full year expenses ex notables will be up about 2.5% on a nominal basis in 2023, driven largely by our continued investment in the business, which we expect to largely offset through greater productivity savings worth $0.5 billion, which is approximately 1.7x last year's gross savings level.\nRegarding the first quarter of 2024, we expect expenses ex notable items to be up 1% to 1.5% on a year-over-year basis keeping in mind the seasonal expenses usually occur in the first quarter. As a reminder, we expect to achieve positive fee operating leverage, excluding notable items for full year 2024, given the projected growth in fee revenue and well-controlled expenses.\nFinally, we expect taxes should be in the 21%, 22% range for 2024. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.\n\nRonald Philip O’Hanley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, State Street Corporation\n\nThank you, Eric. Operator, we can now open the call for questions."

Now I would like to introduce Ilene Fiszel Bieler, Global Head of Investor Relations at State Street.\n\nIlene Fiszel Bieler\n\nHead-Fixed Income Investor Relations, Citigroup, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Ron O'Hanley, will speak first. Then Eric Aboaf, our CFO, will take you through our third quarter 2023 earnings slide presentation, which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, investors.statestreet.com.

Now let me turn it over to Ron.\n\nRonald Philip O’Hanley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, State Street Corporation\n\nThank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we released our third quarter financial results. As we issue these results, the world has witnessed a surprise and uncomfortable terrorist attack on innocent Israeli citizens and the resulting enormous human toll in Israel and Gaza. These terrible events have shocked the world and created further global geopolitical uncertainty. State Street stands with the people of Israel and we are united with all those impacted.\nNow turning to the third quarter. Global financial market performance was mixed as a positive start for equity markets in July turned decisively negative as the quarter progressed. Against the backdrop of softening economic data, market sentiment was negatively impacted by continued global central bank rate hikes and investor concerns of a higher for longer interest rate environment and an economic hard landing. As a result, equities fell, while global bond yields continued climbing around the world, reaching levels not seen for many years with the U.S. 10-year yield reaching its highest level since 2007.\nDespite these factors, the third quarter continued to be characterized by relatively low currency market volatility.\nTurning to Slide 3 of our investor presentation, I will review our third quarter highlights before Eric takes you through the quarter in more detail. Beginning with our financial performance. Third quarter earnings per share was $1.25 or $1.93, excluding a loss on sale from an investment portfolio repositioning, which was a notable item in 3Q. EPS growth year-over-year, excluding notable items, was driven by our significant common share repurchases during the period, coupled with a 3% increase in total fee revenue. This fee revenue growth reflects higher servicing and management fees, better front office software and data fees and an increase in other fee revenue. Taken together, the benefit of share repurchases and the improvement in fee revenue more than offset lower NII, market headwinds within trading businesses as well as the impact of year-over-year expense growth. That said, we are pleased with our ongoing transformation and productivity initiatives, which help us to contain that expense growth while allowing us to continue to invest in our businesses.\nTurning to our business momentum. Within Investment Services, total AUC/A increased to $40 trillion at quarter end, and we recorded $149 billion of new asset servicing wins during the third quarter, largely driven by wins in official institutions and private markets. The estimated annual new servicing fee revenue to be recognized in future periods associated with 3Q asset servicing wins amounted to $91 million, which is the highest level of quarterly new servicing fees in over 2 years, demonstrating our ability to achieve our ambition of driving stronger sales performance.\nEncouragingly, Alpha's momentum continued in 3Q. We deepened relationships with existing mandates and recorded 2 new Alpha mandate wins, including our first Alpha for private markets mandate for one of the world's most influential investors.\nDuring the third quarter, we outlined a number of strategic focus areas for our investment services franchise as we aim to drive opportunities across key regions and product areas and realize the full potential of our State Street Alpha value proposition. Importantly, we are taking actions aimed at gaining market share and reinvigorating revenue growth. We are executing against our plan to improve core back-office custody sales performance as it is our largest revenue pool, installed quickly has significant scale and drives high-margin ancillary revenues.\nAs an illustration of our custody sales momentum in the power of Alpha, in the third quarter, State Street in [ Vontobel ], a premier global asset manager headquartered in Switzerland, entered into an agreement to expand our existing front and middle office relationship by providing back-office services subject to the necessary approvals. State Street had no relationship with [ Vontobel ] until discussions began in 2020 around Alpha, resulting in the adoption of our front, middle and now back office services.\nKey client wins such as [ Vontobel ] demonstrate how Alpha can establish, broaden and deepen client relationships, further positioning State Street as our clients' essential partner. It illustrates the value of the Alpha proposition and confirms our strategic rationale of how Alpha can grow and tie together the full breadth and depth of State Street's capabilities in a true One State Street solution for our clients from front to back.\nAccelerating the Alpha sales cycle and implementation time line, particularly back office services remains important strategic priorities to drive even more fee revenue growth.\nTurning to our front office software and data businesses. CRD continues to perform well and has a strong pipeline. By the end of the third quarter, annual recurring revenue for our front office software and data business increased by 12% year-over-year to $299 million. At Global Advisors, assets under management reached $3.7 trillion at quarter end, supported by a record $41 billion of net cash inflows in 3Q. Importantly, our cash business gained market share in an expanding market, driven by strong investment performance, coupled with the higher yield environment. In aggregate, Global Advisors gathered $10 billion of total net inflows in 3Q. Record quarterly flow performance in cash was partially offset by outflows in the institutional business, coupled with the impact of risk off market sentiment in our ETF business in 3Q.\nWhile our ETF franchise saw modest net outflows in aggregate in 3Q, our U.S. low-cost Spider ETF franchise continued to be a bright spot, generating $7 billion of net inflows, gaining further market share. To drive continued growth in 3Q, we reduced the price on 10 low-cost spider portfolio ETFs, demonstrating our commitment to delivering institutional quality investment solutions at competitive price points.\nLastly on business momentum, I am proud to highlight that State Street's foreign exchange business has once again been recognized as the industry leader. After being ranked #1 FX provider to asset managers by Euromoney Magazine in 2022, this year, Euromoney Magazine 2023 FX awards, named State Street as the winner across 4 categories including Best FX Bank for Real Money Clients, Best FX Bank for Research, Best FX Venue for Real Money Clients and Best FX Bank Sales.\nTurning to our financial condition. State Street's balance sheet liquidity and capital positions remain strong. Our CET1 ratio was a strong 11% at quarter end, well above our regulatory minimum. This strength has enabled us to deliver against our goal of capital return to our shareholders. In 3Q, we returned $1.2 billion of capital, buying back $1 billion of our common shares and declaring over $200 million of common stock dividends. This means that cumulatively, over the last 4 quarters to the end of September, we have returned approximately $5.6 billion of capital to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and common stock dividends.\nAs we look ahead in the fourth quarter, it remains our intention to continue common share repurchases under our existing authorization of up to $4.5 billion for 2023, subject to market conditions and other factors.\nTo conclude, amidst the challenges of the market environment in 3Q, we remain dedicated to driving stronger business momentum and improving fee growth. To that end, in the third quarter, we outlined our sharpened execution plan for the Investment Services business, underpinned by a number of actions aimed at accelerating sales and revenue growth while simultaneously improving the discipline and accountability for this execution.\nOur laser focus on expense discipline also remains high. We have a well-established track record of re-engineering our processes and transforming our operations to improve our efficiency and realize productivity growth. In the third quarter, we reduced expenses quarter-over-quarter and announced another step in our multiyear productivity efforts aimed at improving our operating model, while enabling even greater investment in our business.\nAs part of our ongoing transformation and productivity initiatives, we are streamlining our operations in India and have now assumed full ownership of one of our joint ventures in the country. This consolidation will continue the transformation of State Street's global operations and enable us to achieve productivity savings as part of our plans to deliver positive fee operating leverage in 2024.\nNow let me hand the call over to Eric, who will take you through the quarter in more detail.\n\nEric Walter Aboaf\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, State Street Corporation\n\nThank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my review of our third quarter results on Slide 4. We reported EPS of $1.25, which was down year-on-year due to the impact of the $294 million loss on sale in connection with the repositioning of our investment portfolio, which will benefit NII in future periods. EPS was up year-on-year at $1.93, excluding the repositioning, which you can see on the right-hand side of the page.\nTurning to the core business. As you can see on the left panel of the slide, total fee revenue grew by 3% year-on-year, driven by growth in our front, middle and back-office investment services business as well as solid management fee performance at Global Advisors. This performance enabled us to offset some of the industry [ widens ] we saw in our global markets business as well as lower NII given the mixed macroeconomic backdrop in the quarter.\nLastly, we remain focused on managing costs in the current operating environment, limiting expense growth to just 3% this quarter and achieving productivity savings as part of our plans to deliver a positive fee operating leverage in 2024.\nTurning now to Slide 5. We saw period-end AUC/A increase by 12% on a year-on-year basis and 1% sequentially. Year-on-year, the increase in AUC/A was largely driven by higher period end equity market levels and net new business. Quarter-on-quarter, AUC/A increased primarily due to client flows and net new business. While net new business was positive, long-term flows in the asset management industry have been muted, as you can see on the bottom right of the slide. This risk loss settlement leads to the current headwind across the servicing industry.\nAt Global Advisors, period-end AUM increased 13% year-on-year and was down 3% sequentially, relative to the period a year ago. The increase was primarily driven by higher quarter end market levels and inflows of $10 billion. Notably in the quarter, our cash franchise continued to perform strongly, generating a record $41 billion of net inflows as our competitive performance contributed to market share gains. Quarter-on-quarter, AUM increased mainly due to lower quarter end market levels.\nTurning to Slide 6. On the left side of the page, you'll see third quarter servicing fees up 1% year-on-year, primarily from higher average equity markets, net new business and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by lower client activity and adjustments, normal pricing headwinds and a previously disclosed client transition.\nSequentially, total servicing fees were down 2%, primarily as a result of the lower client activity and adjustments and the previously disclosed client transition, partially offset by higher average equity markets.\nAs I've mentioned over the past year, we continue to see lower levels of client activity and flows, all of which impact transactional volumes, leading to a 2 to 3 percentage point headwind on servicing fees year-to-date. Part of this is the cyclical nature of the servicing business. The full year effect has ranged from minus 2% to plus 1 percentage point impact over the last 5 years.\nWithin servicing fees, back office services were generally consistent with total servicing fees. Middle office services, which is part of the Alpha proposition, had another quarter of good growth. On a year-over-year basis, metal office fees were up 3% and up 1% sequentially, largely driven by net new business.\nOn the bottom panel of this page, we highlight the business momentum we saw in the quarter. We won $149 billion of new AUC/A. We onboarded roughly $250 billion of AUC/A in the quarter, primarily in the asset management client segment. And importantly, as Ron mentioned, we achieved new annual servicing fee revenue wins of $91 million this quarter, which will be recognized in future periods. These servicing wins underscore the progress we're making towards stronger sales performance.\nWhile we've historically only described wins in AUC/A terms, we recently expanded our disclosure to indicate that a healthy level of annual servicing sales is in the $300 million range this year. You can measure us against this benchmark. We now have about $2.3 trillion of assets to be installed and about $255 million of servicing fee revenue to be installed as well.\nTurning to Slide 7. Third quarter management fees were $479 million, up 1% year-on-year, primarily reflecting higher average equity market levels, partially offset by a previously described shift of certain management fees into NII. Quarter-on-quarter, management fees were up 4% as a result of higher equity market levels and record quarterly cash net inflows.\nAs you can see on the bottom right of the slide, our investment management franchise remains well positioned with very strong and broad-based business momentum across each of its businesses. In ETFs, we had neutral overall flows but saw positive net inflows and consistent market share gains in the spider portfolio low-cost suite. As you know, we strategically dropped the fees on about 1/3 of our low-cost suite of products and expect more growth in the coming quarters from the action.\nIn our Institutional business, notwithstanding net outflows of $30 billion in the quarter, which were primarily driven by client in-sourcing, both our defined contribution and index fixed income products continue to drive strategic momentum.\nLastly, across our Cash franchise, we saw record quarterly cash net inflows of $41 billion as we captured some of the cyclical movement of cash in the financial system. I'll just remind you that cash flows can be volatile quarter-to-quarter.\nTurning now to Slide 8. Third quarter FX trading services revenue was down 2% year-on-year, while up 3% sequentially. Relative to the period a year ago, the decrease was mainly due to lower direct FX spreads and lower FX volatility, partially offset by higher volumes. Quarter-on-quarter, the growth primarily reflects higher volumes. Industry volatility is down 25% to 40% across developed markets and emerging markets relative to the period a year ago and down 5% to 10% sequentially which is presenting fewer trading opportunities and lower spreads.\nSecurities finance revenues were down 6% year-on-year due to lower special activity and lower agency balances. Sequentially, revenues were down 12%, primarily as a result of seasonally lower activity and the recent industry drop-off of U.S. equity shorting activity and specials.\nThird quarter software and processing fees were up 2% year-on-year, but down 15% sequentially, largely driven by CRD, which I'll turn to shortly. Other fee revenue increased $49 million year-on-year, primarily due to the tax credit investment accounting change and the absence of negative market-related adjustments.\nMoving to Slide 9. You'll see on the left panel that front office software and data revenue increased 2% year-on-year, primarily as a result of higher growth in our more durable software-enabled and professional services revenue as we continue to convert and implement more clients to the SaaS environment, which now accounts for about 60% of our clients, partially offset by fewer on-premise renewals.\nSequentially, front office software and data revenue was down 20% and primarily driven by lower on-premise renewals, partially offset by higher software-enabled revenues. Our sales pipeline continues to grow and remains strong for our [ Charles River ] development from Office Solutions products.\nTurning to some of the other Alpha business metrics in the right panel. We are pleased we had 2 more mandate wins in the quarter for Alpha. Most notably, we also had our first Alpha for private markets win. We also meaningfully advanced CRD's institutional fixed income capabilities.\nTurning to Slide 10. Third quarter NII decreased 5% year-on-year and 10% sequentially to $624 million. The year-on-year decrease was largely due to the continued mix shift from noninterest-bearing deposits to interest-bearing and lower average deposit balances, partially offset by higher interest rates. Sequentially, the decline in NII performance was primarily driven by lower average deposit balances in the deposit mix shift, partially offset by the benefit of higher interest rates, including international Central Bank hikes and our investment portfolio repositioning.\nThe NII results were somewhat better than expected due to noninterest-bearing deposit levels coming down slightly less than expected and the portfolio repositioning, partially offset by client repricing, some of which will be delayed and will impact fourth quarter instead.\nOn the right of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during the third quarter with average deposits declining 4% quarter-on-quarter. Cumulative U.S. dollar client deposit betas were 73% since the start of this recent cycle, while cumulative foreign currency deposit betas for the same period continue to be much lower in the 25% to 50% range.\nFinally, as I mentioned earlier, last month, we executed an NII accretive and capital accretive investment portfolio repositioning exercise to take advantage of both higher yields and spreads, which all else equal, should drive NII towards the higher end of the previously disclosed range of $550 million to $600 million per quarter next year.\nTurning to Slide 11. Third quarter expenses, excluding notable items, increased 4% year-on-year. Sequentially, third quarter expenses were down 1% as we actively manage expenses and continued our productivity and optimization savings efforts, all while carefully investing in the strategic elements of the company, including Alpha, private markets and technology and operations automation.\nOn a line-by-line basis, year-on-year, compensation and employee benefits increased 4%, primarily driven by salary increases associated with wage inflation, higher headcount and the impact of currency translation. Sequentially, however, we brought headcount down and we also reduced incentive compensation this quarter, in line with our year-to-date performance.\nInformation systems and communications expenses increased 3%, mainly due to higher technology and infrastructure investments, partially offset by the benefits from ongoing optimization efforts, in-sourcing and vendor savings initiatives. Transaction processing increased 6%, mainly reflecting higher subcustody vendor costs. Occupancy increased 4% as we relocate our headquarters building and other expenses were up 4%, mainly reflecting higher marketing spend and professional fees.\nMoving to Slide 12. On the left side of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios followed by our capital trends on the right side of the slide. As you can see, we continue to navigate the operating environment with very strong capital levels, which remain above both our internal targets and the regulatory minimum. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio of 11% was down 80 basis points quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by the continuation of our share repurchases and modestly higher RWA, partially offset by retained earnings.\nOur LCR for State Street Corporation was a healthy 109% and 120% for the State Street Bank and Trust.\nIn the quarter, we were quite pleased to return roughly $1.2 billion to shareholders, consisting of just over $1 billion of common share repurchases and over $200 million in common stock dividends. Over the last year, ending September 30, we repurchased approximately 12% of shares outstanding.\nFinally, a few brief closing thoughts before turning to outlook. Our third quarter performance was solid with fee revenue growth of 3% year-on-year. We executed on our plan to improve sales capacity and reported $91 million in new servicing fee wins in the quarter as we look towards our goal of $350 million to $400 million in servicing fee wins in 2024. And as you have seen us do for the last 4 years, we again demonstrated expense discipline while continuing to invest in the business.\nNext, I'd like to provide our current thinking regarding the fourth quarter. At a macro level, our interest rate outlook is broadly in line with the current forwards. We currently assume global equity markets will remain flat from now to quarter end, which implies the daily average is down about 3% quarter-on-quarter. Bond markets are also expected to be down about 3% on average quarter-on-quarter.\nRegarding fee revenue in 4Q on a year-over-year basis, we expect overall fee revenue to be flat to up 1% year-over-year with servicing fees approximately flat and management fees to also be flattish as we expect the year-on-year business driver similar to what we saw this quarter. We do expect fourth quarter sales momentum to be similar to the strong sales performance we saw in the third quarter.\nWe also expect that our markets businesses will be down modestly year-over-year, given lower volatility and we expect software and processing fees to be up 10% to 12%, largely due to the timing of on-prem renewals and the expected new SaaS installations. And we expect the other revenue line to come in at around $30 million to $40 million in the fourth quarter.\nRegarding NII, we now expect 3Q NII -- we now expect 4Q NII to be towards the middle of the $550 million to $600 million range we previously mentioned. This includes continued expected rotation of about $3 billion to $4 billion out of noninterest-bearing deposits and the impact of deposit pricing, which we previously noted, but with more stability in the total deposit averages.\nTurning to expenses. We remain focused on controlling costs in this environment and expect to maintain relatively flat expenses in 4Q quarter-over-quarter. As always, this is on an ex notables basis, and in this regard, we are keeping an eye on the likely FDIC assessment. And we expect our adjusted effective tax rate for 4Q will be around 22%. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.\n\nRonald Philip O’Hanley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, State Street Corporation\n\nThanks, Eric. Operator, we can now open the call for questions."

Now let me turn it over to Ron.\n\nRonald Philip O’Hanley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, State Street Corporation\n\nThank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we released our second quarter financial results. Relative to the significant volatility experienced by investors in the first quarter, market conditions in 2Q were more subdued, and global financial market performance was varied. Global equities generated positive returns for the third consecutive quarter as investors saw continued strength in developed equity markets but weakness in emerging markets.\nFixed income markets fell as investors had to contend with still elevated levels of inflation and further central bank rate hikes including the Federal Reserve raising interest rates above 5% for the first time since 2007.\nThe second quarter was also characterized by falling currency market volatility, which created headwinds for our foreign exchange business.\nTurning to Slide 3 of our investor presentation. I will review our second quarter highlights before Eric takes you through the quarter in more detail. Beginning with our financial performance. Second quarter ROE was 13% and pretax margin expanded by 1.2 percentage points year-over-year to 29.5%. Relative to the year ago period, 2Q EPS increased by 14% to $2.17 supported by our common share repurchases, significantly higher NII, strong front office software and data revenue growth and an increase in securities finance revenue.\nOur results also benefited from the release of an allowance related to the support of a financial -- U.S. financial institution as well as an accounting adoption. Taken together, these factors more than offset headwinds in some of our other fee-based businesses and the impact of higher-than-desired year-over-year expense growth.\nTurning to our business momentum. In Q1, I highlighted that by strengthening our implementation capabilities, we had line of sight into a meaningful amount of client onboarding this year. We began to realize the benefits of this plan and onboarded $1.2 trillion of AUC/A during the second quarter, primarily driven by State Street Alpha, underscoring the power of the alpha value proposition to our investment services strategy and long-term growth.\nAs a result, our AUC/A installation backlog declined to $2.4 trillion while total AUC/A increased by 5% quarter-over-quarter to $39.6 trillion, both at quarter end, in part as a result of this new business. We also recorded over $140 billion of asset servicing wins in the second quarter, largely driven by strong sales in the desirable asset owner, official institutions and alternatives client segments. Our sales pipeline grew and we expect substantial onboardings in the coming quarters.\nWe continue to advance and broaden our enterprise outsourced solutions strategy across our clients' front, middle and back office activities, as demonstrated by the expansion of Alpha's capabilities to ETFs which we announced in 2Q. For the past 30 years, State Street has continuously innovated to support what has become a $10 trillion ETF market. Today, State Street is the largest ETF administrator in the world, with more than 2,700 ETF serviced in 13 countries. That long cycle of innovation continues as State Street Alpha now supports the entire ETF life cycle.\nBy integrating CRD's front office products with State Street's industry-leading ETF servicing capabilities, Alpha now provides a centralized platform for ETF issuers across the entire ETF life cycle, including portfolio management, trading and compliance to enable a growth across a variety of ETF strategies and increased speed to market.\nTurning to front office software and data business. Our overall CRD pipeline is strong. In the second quarter, we converted a meaningful number of on-prem CRD clients to recurring SaaS revenue, which when coupled with new SaaS client implementations, increased annual recurring revenue by 12% relative to the year ago period. In addition, Charles River Wealth Management solution continues to resonate with clients and drove a significant increase in on-prem revenues this quarter. Year-to-date, CRD's wealth-driven revenue has more than doubled as compared to the first half of 2022, and we remain on track to grow CRD's wealth revenue this year.\nThe State Street Global Advisors quarter-end assets under management totaled $3.8 trillion, supported by higher period end market levels and $38 billion of net inflows from all 3 business lines: ETF, cash and institutional. Our SPDR ETF business gathered $27 billion of net inflows in the second quarter, including $20 billion of net inflows into SPY, the industry's largest ETF.\nWe also delivered a solid performance in our U.S. low-cost ETF segment, which gathered $7 billion of net inflows in the quarter, continuing to gain market share. Our cash business gathered a solid $10 billion of net inflows in the second quarter as our U.S. government money market funds benefited from the attractiveness of the cash asset class in the higher rate environment.\nTurning to our financial condition. State Street's balance sheet, liquidity and capital positions remain strong. Our CET1 ratio was a strong 11.8% at quarter end, well above our regulatory minimum. The ongoing capital generation of our business, coupled with effective balance sheet management and our strong capital position has enabled us to deliver against our goal of returning significant capital to our shareholders.\nIn 2Q, we returned approximately $1.3 billion of capital, buying back more than $1 billion of our common shares and declaring over $200 million of common stock dividends. This means that cumulatively over the last 3 quarters to the end of June, we have returned approximately $4.4 billion of capital to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and common stock dividends.\nThe strength of our balance sheet was also highlighted with the release of the Federal Reserve's annual CCAR stress test results in June, following which we announced our intention for the third year in a row, to increase State Street's common stock dividend by 10% in the third quarter, subject to consideration and approval by our Board of Directors. It remains our intention to continue common share repurchases under our existing authorization, for up to $4.5 billion in 2023, subject to market conditions and other factors.\nTo conclude, financial market conditions in the second quarter were mixed. Although global equities recorded another sequential quarter of growth, there was weakness in emerging markets, and we witnessed the negative impact of persistent inflation and further Central Bank rate hikes on fixed income markets. Meanwhile, both equity and currency volatility continued to decline. Despite this varied backdrop, we achieved a number of positive outcomes in the second quarter, including meaningfully reducing our asset servicing backlog, further developing our Alpha capabilities, continuing to record new asset servicing wins, driving strong growth in front office software and data revenue and gathering solid net inflows to Global Advisors.\nAnd while we reached double-digit year-over-year EPS growth supported by our capital management and the higher interest rate environment, our results were below our potential. First, while we achieved sequential fee revenue growth in areas of our business this quarter, we need to demonstrate the fee growth every quarter, especially as NII and we need to demonstrate that fee growth every quarter, especially as NII is no longer a tailwind. And second, we are highly focused on controlling our expense base. We have a well-established track record of reengineering our processes and transforming our operations in order to improve our efficiency and realize productivity growth.\nWe plan to utilize additional tactical expense levers at our disposal in addition to our ongoing structural productivity efforts in order to support our financial performance for the benefit of our shareholders. Now let me hand the call over to Eric, who will take you through the quarter in more detail.\n\nEric Walter Aboaf\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, State Street Corporation\n\nThank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my review of our second quarter results on Slide 4. We reported EPS of $2.17 for the quarter, an increase of 14% relative to the second quarter a year ago. As you can see on the left panel of the slide, revenue grew by 5% year-on-year, driven by the expansion in our front office solutions area, where we are an industry leader, continued momentum in the securities finance business as well as strong growth in net interest income. This growth enabled us to offset some of the headwinds we saw in other fee areas given the relatively mixed macroeconomic backdrop.\nWe also had the benefit of an accounting change for tax credit investments, which simplifies our reporting going forward. While our overall year-on-year fee growth was less than we would have liked to deliver, we did see sequential quarter revenue momentum and a step-up in the sales pipeline, which we expect to build upon in the coming quarters and which I'll discuss later in today's presentation.\nAs we drive growth, we continue to prudently invest in the business while remaining focused on managing costs given the current operating environment, and we stand ready to further intervene on expenses should the softness in the global environment persists.\nTurning now to Slide 5. We saw period-end AUC/A increased by 4% on a year-on-year basis and 5% sequentially. Year-on-year, the increase in AUC/A was largely driven by higher period end equity market levels and client net inflows. Quarter-on-quarter, AUC/A increased as a result of the significant trillion-dollar Alpha installation and a higher period end market levels.\nAt Global Advisors, we saw similar positive dynamics play out in the quarter. Period-end AUM increased 9% year-on-year and 5% sequentially. The year-on-year increase in AUM was largely driven by higher period end market levels. Quarter-on-quarter, the increase in AUM was also due to higher period end market levels as well as strong sequential net inflows.\nTurning to Slide 6. On the left side of the page, you'll see second quarter total servicing fees down 3% year-on-year as net new business in the quarter was more than offset by lower client activity and adjustments largely due to lower custody and transaction volume and better than usual pricing headwinds. Positive year-on-year equity markets were offset by the negative impact of fixed income markets.\nSequentially, total servicing fees were up 3%, primarily as a result of higher average market levels and net new business, slightly offset by better-than-usual pricing headwinds this quarter. We had a more constructive market environment relative to the first quarter as well as a significant onboarding of $1.2 trillion of AUC/A related to an Alpha client in the Asset Manager Client segment which comes at a modest fee rate, but with services that are expected to be added in the coming years.\nWithin the servicing fees, back-office servicing fees were generally consistent with total servicing fees and largely driven by the factors I just described. Middle Office Services performance was meaningfully more positive for the quarter. On a year-on-year basis, fees were up 3%, primarily reflecting net new business and up 10% sequentially, largely driven by the installation that I just mentioned.\nOn the bottom panel of this page, we've again included some sales performance indicators which highlight the business momentum we saw in the quarter. While total AUC/A wins in the second quarter were not as robust in volume terms, client engagement remained healthy and we saw wins across strategic segments, including mandates and asset owners, official institutions and alternatives, which are key growth areas for us as we've previously mentioned.\nThe wins, including those in the alternative segment, which are more complex to service come with above average fee rates. We have also seen a healthy uptick in our pipeline this quarter.\nTurning to Slide 7. Second quarter management fees were $461 million, down 6% year-on-year, primarily reflecting the impact of net outflows from prior periods, a shift of certain management fees into NII as previously described, and some pricing headwinds, partially offset by higher average market levels. Quarter-on-quarter, management fees were up 1% as a result of higher market levels and cash net inflows.\nAs you can see on the bottom right of the slide, our investment management franchise remains well positioned with very strong and broad-based business momentum across each of our 3 lines of business. In ETFs, we saw very strong net inflows of $27 billion into SPY in our sector suite of ETFs as well as our SPDR portfolio low-cost suite.\nIn our institutional business, we saw net inflows with continued momentum in our well-established index fixed income and defined contribution franchises. Across our cash franchise, we continue to see strong demand for our money market funds. We recorded net inflows of $10 billion.\nTurning to Slide 8. Relative to the period a year ago, second quarter FX trading services revenue was down 8% year-on-year and 11% sequentially, primarily reflecting lower client FX volumes and lower industry FX volatility. Relative to the period a year ago, both volumes and volatility were more muted as the start of war in Europe last year caused unusually high FX trading activity in the first half of 2022.\nMany clients were also risk offering the debt ceiling discussions in April and May with a rebound in June in client volumes following its resolution. Altogether, 2Q is muted, we are optimistic about 3Q, but it's hard to predict.\nSecurities finance performed well in the second quarter with revenues up 9% year-on-year, driven by higher agency spreads. Sequentially, revenues were up 7%, again mainly driven by higher agency spreads as well as higher prime services or enhanced custody revenues from deeper client engagement and special activity, partially offset by lower balances.\nMoving on to software and processing fees. Second quarter software and processing fees were up 18% year-on-year and 34% sequentially, primarily driven by higher front office software and data revenue associated with CRD, which I will turn to shortly. Lending fees for the quarter were down 5% year-on-year, primarily due to changes in product mix, but up 5% sequentially, mainly driven by strong client demand for line of credit.\nFinally, other fee revenue increased $101 million year-on-year, primarily due to a tax credit investment accounting change and the absence of negative market-related adjustments. This includes the impact of the new accounting adoption.\nMoving to Slide 9. You'll see on the left panel that front office software and data revenue increased 29% year-on-year primarily as a result of higher on-premise renewals and continued growth in our more durable software-enabled and professional services revenue as we continue to convert and implement more clients over to our SaaS environment. About 60% of our clients are now on our SaaS platform. Sequentially, front office software and data revenue was up nearly 50%. About 2/3 of this uptick was driven by wealth management mandates that are becoming an increasingly important growth segment for us.\nOur sales pipeline continues to grow and remains strong for our Charles River development front office solutions products.\nTurning to some of the other Alpha business metrics in the right panel, we were pleased we had 3 more Alpha mandates go live, which brings our total live Alpha clients to 15 and as I previously mentioned, we installed a significant portion of assets related to Alpha this quarter. We expect to provide more services related to these assets in the future, helping us increase the share of our clients' wallet.\nNow turning to Slide 10. Second quarter NII increased 18% year-on-year but declined 10% sequentially to $691 million. The year-on-year increase was largely due to higher short-term rates, an increase in long-term rates and proactive balance sheet positioning, partially offset by lower average deposits. Sequentially, the decline in NII performance was primarily driven by our continued rotation of noninterest-bearing deposit balances and rate pressure in the U.S. back book, partially offset by higher short-term market rates from international Central Bank hikes.\nOn the right side of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during the second quarter. Average deposits declined 2% quarter-on-quarter, in line with industry total deposit trends, which also fell by 2% in the second quarter and reflect client preferences to shift some cash to other products during periods of rising rates.\nOur operational deposits as a percentage of total deposits remained consistent at approximately 75%. Our global floating rate loan book provides upside at this stage in the cycle, and our investment portfolio positioning provides a tailwind as long rates roll through. We now also have the opportunity to selectively add some duration across the curve as we see good entry points which could enhance NII over time.\nSequentially, U.S. dollar client deposit betas were 100% during the second quarter, leading again to some sequential NII compression. We are now at the point in the U.S. rate cycle where we expect to adjust back book pricing to accommodate our larger clients, but to do so in a disciplined manner and usually as part of a broader relationship discussion of balance and trade for fee opportunities. Foreign currency deposit betas for the quarter continued to be much lower in the 45% to 50% range.\nWe've also included a new slide in the appendix Page 16 that shows our NII trends over the past few rate cycles. I think it will be -- it will put the larger NII increases and decreases in context, which are driven by many factors, including changes in interest rates, the pacing of hikes, deposit levels and mix, Fed balance sheet changes as well as equity markets. You can see from that page that our recent quarters have come with a much higher than usual level of NII, and we are now normalizing to a more typical level of NII that is inherent in our business activities.\nTurning to Slide 11. Second quarter expenses, excluding notable items, increased 6% year-on-year. Sequentially, excluding seasonal expenses, second quarter expenses increased just over 1% as we actively manage expenses and continued our productivity and optimization savings efforts, all while carefully investing in strategic elements of the company including Alpha, private markets, technology and operations, automation.\nOn a line-by-line basis, year-on-year, compensation employee benefits increased 7%, primarily driven by salary increases associated with wage inflation and higher headcount attributable primarily to operational staff for growth areas, technology staff, in-sourcing and some lower attrition -- lower-than-expected attrition rates. Sequentially, however, we have managed headcount to be flat.\nInformation Systems and communications expenses increased 3%, mainly due to higher technology and infrastructure investments partially offset by benefits from ongoing optimization efforts, in-sourcing and credits related to vendor savings initiatives.\nTransaction processing decreased 2%, mainly reflecting lower sub-custody costs from vendor credits. Occupancy increased 7% as we relocated our headquarters building, temporarily resulting in overlapping costs and other expenses were up 7%, mainly reflecting higher professional fees.\nMoving to Slide 12. On the left side of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios followed by our capital trends on the right side of the slide. As you can see, we continue to navigate our operating environment with very strong capital levels, which remain well above both our internal targets and the regulatory minimum. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio of 11.8% was down 30 basis points quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by the continuation of our share repurchases and modestly higher RWA, partially offset by retained earnings.\nOur LCR for State Street Corporation was flat quarter-on-quarter at 108% and decreased 4 percentage points quarter-on-quarter, but still quite high at 120% for State Street Bank and Trust. We're also very happy with our performance in this year's CCAR with a calculated risk capital buffer well above the 2.5% minimum, resulting in a continued preliminary SCB at the floor. This demonstrates we have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry.\nIn keeping with our results, in June, we announced a planned 10% increase for our 3Q '23 quarterly common stock dividend, subject to Board approval, and it remains our intention to continue common share repurchases under a current authorization of up to a total of $4.5 billion in 2023, subject to market conditions and other factors. We plan another $1 billion buyback in third quarter.\nLastly, we are quite pleased to return roughly $1.3 billion to shareholders in the second quarter of '23, consisting of just over $1 billion of common share repurchases and over $200 million in common stock dividends.\nTurning to Slide 13, which provides summary of our second quarter results. While there is certainly still work to do, we are pleased with the durability of our business this quarter against a mix and divergent backdrop. Robust expansion in our front office solutions area and continued momentum in securities finance as well as strong growth in net interest income enabled us to offset some of the headwinds we saw in the other fee areas, highlighting the resiliency of the franchise.\nNext, I'd like to provide our current thinking regarding our third quarter. At a macro level, while we know that rate expectations have been moving, our rate outlook is broadly in line with the current forwards, which suggests that the Fed, the ECB and the BOE will all continue to hike in 3Q to varying degrees.\nIn terms of average equity markets, we currently expect U.S. equity markets to be up about 5% quarter-on-quarter as we are expecting equity markets to remain flat from now to quarter end and we expect international equity markets to be flattish on average.\nRegarding fee revenue in 3Q on a sequential quarter basis, we expect overall fee revenue to be down approximately 1% to 1.5% with servicing fees down 1% to 2% as the below average fee repricing headwinds we saw this past quarter is expected to normalize in 3Q. This will also include a revenue headwind from the previously disclosed client exit.\nWe expect management fees to be up around 0.5% to 1.5%. We expect front office software and data quarter-on-quarter to be down 7%, as we do not expect the level of on-premise renewals in 3Q that we saw this quarter. We expect the other fee revenue line to come in around $30 million to $35 million in 3Q, which is higher than prior years, but down post the accounting change impact in 2Q.\nRegarding NII, after 3 double-digit sequential increases in NII last year, we now expect NII to decrease 12% to 18% on a sequential quarter basis, driven by lower deposit levels and continued rotation as rate hikes continue into 3Q.\nOur outlook assumes that average noninterest-bearing deposits declined by approximately $5 billion from 2Q to 3Q. As we look forward to 4Q, we do expect to see some moderation to the amount of deposit rotation as we work through most of our back book and most central banks begin to pause.\nWith that context, we expect that 4Q NII decline to be much less, somewhere in the range of down 2% to 6% versus 3Q. And we expect NII to then stabilize around those levels but it will depend on market conditions. And our expectation is that 4Q declines in noninterest-bearing deposits, [ lease ] more as well, likely in the down to $3 billion range versus 3Q.\nTurning to expenses, we remain focused on controlling costs in this environment, and we expect to take action in 3Q to bend the cost curve. As such, we expect that expenses will be down 0.5% to 1% on a sequential quarter basis and intend to continue to actively manage expenses. As always, this is on an ex notables basis, and we are keeping an eye on the FDIC assessment, which could be a 3Q notable item. And as I noted previously, given the accounting changes we adopted this quarter, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 21% and 22% for the third quarter. With that, let me hand the call back to Ron.\n\nRonald Philip O’Hanley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, State Street Corporation\n\nThanks, Eric. Operator, we can now open the call for questions."

Earlier today, we released our first quarter financial results. Before I review our financial highlights, I would like to briefly reflect on the eventful operating environment in the first quarter. Investors had to contend with significant market movements and volatility, driven by persistent inflation, continued Central Bank interest rate increases and the recent disruption to certain segments of the banking industry.\nFirst quarter global financial market performance was choppy. January produced a very strong start to the year with gains across most asset classes, including equities recording the strongest start to a year since 2019. However, investors remain cautious about the prospect of enduring inflation and a potential recession in the United States.\nFebruary saw that encouraging start [ recede ] as strong U.S. employment data led to growing concerns about the persistence of inflation, which in turn saw market expectations for Central Bank rate hikes increase, fixed income and equity markets declined and the U.S. dollar strengthened. March saw continued rising Central Bank rates, which in turn drove shocks to both the U.S. regional and international banking sectors and the need to resolve a number of banks. All this drove negative market sentiment contributing to large inflows into money market funds and a reversal of a number of the macro trends from the prior month. Both current interest rates and rate expectations decreased and the U.S. dollar weakened although relative comm returned to markets by the end of the quarter.\nNotwithstanding these events, all told, Global Financial Markets performed relatively well in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of last year with broad-based gains recorded across global equities, while U.S. treasuries experienced their best quarter since the first quarter of 2020. However, daily average equity and bond market levels both remained significantly below the year ago period, with average equity markets down approximately 10%, which created headwinds for our fee-driven businesses, impacting our year-over-year financial results, which I will discuss shortly.\nBefore I discuss our financial highlights, I would like to briefly comment on the recent events and parts of the banking sector. As the globally systemically important financial institution, State Street plays a critical role in the world's financial system. Our strong capital and liquidity positions, size, scale and sophisticated risk management allow us to help safeguard investors and assist in providing market stability during uncertain times. We demonstrated this ability at the start of COVID 3 years ago when we helped establish the money market mutual fund liquidity facility and the Main Street lending program.\nDuring the first quarter in concert with 10 other large U.S. banks, State Street once again use its financial strength to help assist in stabilizing the financial system through the provision of liquidity to a financial institution in the U.S., reflecting our confidence in the American banking system. We stand ready to support the world's investors and the people they serve during this time of uncertainty for our investment servicing and asset management products, which offer clients opportunities, insights and liquidity.\nTurning to Slide 3 of our investor presentation. I will review our first quarter highlights before Eric takes you through the quarter in more detail. Relative to the year ago period, first quarter EPS was $1.52 million, down 3% as the positive year-over-year benefit resulting from our continued common share repurchases as well as significantly stronger NII growth were offset by lower servicing and management fee revenues, which were impacted by weaker average market levels, continued business and personal investments to support growth and a loan loss provision related to State Street's support of the U.S. banking system, which I just mentioned.\nTurning to our business momentum. We remain highly focused on continuing to advance our enterprise outsourced solutions strategy across clients' front, middle and back office activities. For example, in March, we announced our agreement to acquire CF Global Trading. This transaction will further expand State Street's current outsourced trading capabilities, giving our firm the ability to provide these services to new clients and markets. Importantly, the acquisition will allow State Street to expand its liquidity providing capabilities and offer a complete global trading solution as part of our Alpha front-to-back platform. The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions.\nAUC/A amounted to $37.6 trillion at quarter end, and we recorded asset servicing wins of $112 billion in the first quarter, about half of which were higher fee rate alternative mandates consistent with our strategy. Encouragingly, this was our second best quarterly sales performance by projected revenue within the alternative segments over the last 6 years. We also reported an additional alpha mandate during the first quarter as this strategy continues to resonate with clients. Our AUC/A installation backlog amounted to $3.6 trillion at quarter end.\nAt State Street Global Advisors, quarter-end assets under management totaled $3.6 trillion. While flows across our asset management businesses were negatively impacted by the various market factors in the first quarter, we continue to see a number of bright spots where we are focusing our efforts.\nFor example, in the U.S., our [ SPDR ] ETF franchise gained market share in both low-cost equity and low-cost fixed income, while we also had strong inflows into our gold ETFs amidst investor demand for safe haven assets. While aggregate flows to cash were slightly negative for the quarter, this largely resulted from seasonal outflow activity in January. However, Global Advisors gathered strong money market inflows of over $24 billion in the latter part of March amidst the market volatility.\nTurning to our financial condition. State Street's balance sheet liquidity and capital position remain strong. Our CET1 ratio was a high 12.1% at quarter end, well above State Street's regulatory minimum. This balance sheet strength enabled us to continue to return capital to our shareholders in the first quarter while simultaneously supporting our clients and the U.S. banking system. We returned $1.5 billion of capital to our shareholders in Q1, including buying back $1.25 billion of our common shares and declaring over $200 million of common stock dividends.\nAs we look ahead in this uncertain environment, we remain highly focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet position, while continuing to generate and return capital as part of our previously announced common stock repurchase program of up to $4.5 billion for 2023, subject to market conditions and other factors.\nTo conclude, the first quarter included a number of significant events in global financial markets and with the global -- with the broader banking industry. While market conditions were volatile, many asset classes saw sequential quarter gains, although asset prices remained depressed relative to the year-ago period, which created year-over-year headwinds for our fee-driven businesses in the first quarter.\nWhile our year-over-year revenue performance was durable, supported by significantly higher net interest income growth, our results this quarter were below our expectations. We need to do better, and I believe we are equipped and on track to do so by focusing on areas within our control and effectively executing our strategy. In keeping with the strategic priorities I outlined in January, we are driving forward with a number of actions. For example, our AUC/A to be installed is strong and by strengthening our implementation capabilities, we have line of sight into a meaningful amount of client onboarding beginning in 2Q.\nWithin our software and data business, we expect to convert a meaningful number of CRD on-premises clients to more recurring SaaS revenue in the second quarter. Last, given the revenue and inflationary environments, we will continue to selectively reprice some services, proactively manage our cost, execute on our productivity efforts and stand ready to utilize additional expense levers at our disposal.\nWith the focus on accountability and execution of our strategy, I continue to firmly believe in the ability of our diversified franchise to successfully meet the needs of the world's investors and the people they serve, while delivering value for and capital return to our shareholders. Now let me hand the call over to Eric, who will take you through the quarter in more detail.\n\nEric Walter Aboaf\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, State Street Corporation\n\nThank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my review of our first quarter results on Slide 4. We reported earnings per share of $1.52 for the quarter, which included a $20 million -- $29 million provision or $0.06 of EPS impact associated with the extension of liquidity to a U.S. financial institution, as we participated in an industry consortium supporting the banking system. We were pleased to do our part.\nOn the left panel of this slide, you can see that our first quarter '23 results reflected the year-on-year decline in both equity and fixed income markets, but was more than offset by strength in net interest income and strong momentum in our securities finance business. EPS was down just 3% as another quarter of significant buybacks reduced the number of shares outstanding. Against this challenging backdrop, we again held total expense growth to just 2% year-on-year even as we continue to thoughtfully invest in product and client growth initiatives.\nTurning now to Slide 5. During the quarter, we saw period-end AUC/A decreased by 10% on a year-on-year basis, but increased 2% sequentially. Year-on-year, the decrease of AUC/A was largely driven by lower period end market levels across both equity and fixed income markets globally, which were both down in the 10% range. Quarter-on-quarter, AUC/A increased as a result of higher period end market levels and client flows.\nAt Global Advisors, we saw similar dynamics play out. Overall, our first quarter AUM was negatively impacted by volatile markets. Period end AUM decreased 10% year-on-year, but increased 4% sequentially. The year-on-year decline in AUM was largely driven by lower period end market levels and net outflows. Quarter-on-quarter, the increase in AUM was primarily driven by higher quarter end market levels, partially offset by some outflows.\nTurning to Slide 6. On the left side of the page, you'll see first quarter total servicing fees down 11% year-on-year, largely driven by lower average market levels, client activity and adjustments and normal pricing headwinds, partially offset by net new business. Excluding the impact of currency translation, servicing fees were down 10% year-on-year. Sequentially, total servicing fees were up 1%, primarily as a result of higher average equity market levels, partially offset by lower client activity and adjustments.\nOn the bottom panel of this page, we've included some sales performance indicators, which highlight the good business momentum we again saw in the quarter. AUC/A wins in the first quarter totaled $112 billion with about half driven by wins across the growing alternative segment, especially in private markets. The fee rate on these alternative wins are generally more than 4x the total servicing fee average, which makes us a strong win quarter from a projected revenue standpoint.\nAt quarter end, AUC/A won, but yet to be installed totaled $3.6 trillion with Alpha representing a healthy portion which again reflects the unique value proposition of our strategy. Given the planning and preparation since these deals were announced, we expect significant onboardings of this uninstalled AUC/A next quarter.\nTurning to Slide 7. First quarter management fees were $457 million, down 12% year-on-year, primarily reflecting lower average market levels and a previously reported client-specific pricing adjustment. Quarter-on-quarter, management fees were flat as higher market levels were partially offset by outflows in day count. As you can see on the bottom right of the slide, notwithstanding the difficult macroeconomic backdrop in the quarter, our franchise remains well-positioned as evidenced by our continued strong business momentum.\nIn ETFs, we continue to build on strategic growth segments which was reflected in net flows in our SPDR portfolio, low-cost equity and fixed income suites. In our institutional business, we saw net outflows while sustaining continued momentum in defined contribution with a target date franchise recording inflows of $6 billion. Across our cash franchise, consistent with industry trends late in the first quarter, we saw a flight to quality with significant net inflows worth 7% of cash AUM into SSGA money market funds since the week ending March 10, which largely reversed the seasonal outflows experienced earlier in the quarter.\nTurning now to Slide 8. Relative to the period a year ago, first quarter FX trading services revenue was down 5%, primarily reflecting lower client FX volumes, partially offset by higher spreads. As a reminder, the start of the war in Europe last year caused some unusually high FX trading activity in 1Q '22. Sequentially, FX trading services revenue ex notables was down 1%, with lower spreads offset by 6% higher client volumes. And consistent with the significant increases into industry-wide money market flows, our Global Link franchise experienced an increase of $20 billion or 13% into its money market cash sweep program during the last 3 weeks of March.\nSecurities finance performed well in the first quarter with revenues up 14% year-on-year, driven by higher specials activity and an active focus on business returns, partially offset by lower balances, which was consistent with the industry. Sequentially, revenues were up 6%, again, mainly driven by higher specials activity, which was consistent with the market and securities lending industry environment.\nMoving on to software and processing fees. First quarter software and processing fees were down 18% year-on-year and 24% sequentially, primarily driven by lumpy on-premise renewals in the front office software revenues, which I'll turn to shortly. Lending fees for the quarter were down both year-on-year and sequentially, primarily due to a shift away from products with higher fees, but lower returns.\nFinally, other fee revenue increased $16 million year-on-year, primarily due to positive market-related adjustments and $27 million sequentially, largely due to fair value adjustments on equity investments.\nMoving to Slide 9. You'll see on the left panel that front office software and data revenue declined year-on-year, primarily as a result of lower on-premise renewals, partially offset by continued growth in software-enabled revenue. Timing of installations will vary quarter-on-quarter based on the size and scope of prior business wins and we expect several SaaS conversions and several on-premise renewals to come through in the second quarter. Year-on-year, our annualized recurring revenue was 16%. Our software-enabled revenue was up 11% year-on-year, but down sequentially due to the absence of an accounting true-up in the fourth quarter.\nTurning to some of the other alpha business metrics on the right panel, we are pleased to report another alpha mandate win this quarter in the asset owner client segment. In addition to the reported win this quarter, we expect significant middle office installations in 2Q as we've completed the preparations to begin to onboard a portion of a large mandate won back in 2021.\nTurning to Slide 10. First quarter NII increased 50% year-on-year, but declined 3% sequentially to $766 million. The year-on-year increase was largely due to higher short-term rates and proactive balance sheet positioning, partially offset by lower deposits. Sequentially, the decline in NII performance was primarily driven by additional client rotation out of noninterest-bearing deposit balances, partially offset by higher short-term market rates from Central Bank hikes.\nOn the right of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during the first quarter. Year-on-year average assets declined 6% and 2% sequentially. Average deposits declined 3% quarter-on-quarter, which is relatively consistent with our expectation for first quarter seasonality and client pricing preferences during periods of rising rates. Of note, average weekly deposit levels at quarter end increased 5% as we compare with the week ended March 10. The stress in the regional bank space primarily affected consumer and corporate depositors rather than the institutional asset manager and asset owners that we serve. We, in contrast, saw some risk off deposit inflows at the end of the quarter.\nOur operational deposits as a percentage of total deposits remains consistent at 75%. These are determined by regulatory guidance. U.S. dollar client deposit betas were 80% to 90% during the quarter as expected. Foreign currency deposit betas for the quarter continued to be much lower in the 30% to 45% range depending on currency. Our international footprint continues to be an advantage.\nTurning to Slide 11. Our first quarter expenses, excluding notable items, increased just 2% year-on-year or up approximately 4% adjusted for currency translation. In the light of the current revenue environment, we are actively managing expenses while continuing to carefully invest in strategic elements of the company, including Alpha, private markets, technology and operations automation.\nCompensation and employee benefits increased 5% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher salary increases associated with wage inflation and higher headcount attributable to lower attrition rates and in-sourcing. Total noncompensation expenses, on the other hand, decreased 1% year-on-year as continued productivity and optimization savings more than offset increases in certain variable costs and professional services. On a line-by-line basis for noncompensation expenses, information systems and communications expenses were down 2% due to benefits from ongoing optimization efforts, partially offset by technology and infrastructure investments.\nTransaction processing was down 9%, mainly reflecting lower subcustody costs from declining market levels as well as lower broker fees and other expenses were up 9%, mainly reflecting higher professional fees, travel and marketing costs.\nMoving to Slide 12. On the left side of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios, followed by our capital trend on the right of the slide. As you can see, we continue to navigate the operating environment with extremely strong capital levels, which are well above our targets, let alone the regulatory minimums. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio was up slightly year-on-year but down 1.5 percentage points quarter-on-quarter to 12.1%, which was largely driven by the continuation of our share repurchase program and the expected normalization of RWAs that we discussed last quarter.\nTier 1 leverage ratio was flattish at 5.9%. Our LCR for State Street Corporation increased a couple of percentage points quarter-on-quarter to 108% and 4 percentage points quarter-on-quarter to 124% for State Street Bank & Trust, where most of our business is transacted. We were quite pleased to return $1.5 billion of capital to our shareholders in the first quarter, consisting of $1.25 billion of common share repurchases and $212 million in common stock dividends.\nLastly, given the high level of capital [ across ] every measure, positive pull to par in AOCI and our strong earnings trajectory, we continue to expect to return up to $4.5 billion of capital in the form of buybacks at pace this year, subject to market conditions, of course.\nTurning to Slide 13, which provides a summary of our first quarter results. While there is certainly still work to do, we are pleased with the durability of our business this quarter against a very challenging backdrop and the continued competitive strength of our global franchise.\nNext, I'd like to provide our current thinking regarding the second quarter. At a macro level, our rate outlook is broadly in line with the current forwards, which suggests the Fed, ECB and Bank of England, all continue to hike to varying degrees in 2Q. In terms of markets, we currently expect average U.S. equity in global bond markets to be up about 1% to 2% quarter-on-quarter and international equity markets to be flattish.\nRegarding fee revenue in 2Q and on a sequential quarter basis, we expect overall fee revenue to be up 4% to 5%, with servicing fees up 1% to 2% and management fees approximately flat to up 1%. We expect to see a significant increase in front office software and data revenues as we have line of sight to a number of on-premise renewals and SaaS conversions in 2Q.\nIn our other fee revenue line, which we know is difficult to forecast, we intend to adopt in 2Q the new accounting guidance recently issued regarding renewable energy investments. We'd expect to see a sequential quarter uptick in total other revenues of between $5 million to $15 million, though this estimate always depends on market levels. As we adopt this accounting change, our effective tax rate for 2Q '23 is expected to be approximately 21%. The adoption will be roughly neutral to EPS.\nRegarding NII, we now expect NII in the second quarter to decrease 5% to 10% sequentially, primarily driven by the noninterest-bearing deposit rotation and interest-bearing deposit betas as quantitative tightening and rate hikes continue into 2Q.\nTurning to expenses. We remain focused on driving productivity and controlling costs in this environment. We expect that second quarter expenses will be flat on a sequential quarter basis, excluding the 1Q seasonal compensation cost of $181 million. Overall, we will offset some of the 2Q NII trends with higher fee revenues as business momentum builds in 2Q and through the year, and we continue to actively manage expenses.\nAnd with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.\n\nRonald Philip O’Hanley\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, State Street Corporation\n\nThanks, Eric. Operator, we can now open the call for questions."

Today's discussion is being broadcasted live on State Street's website at investors.statestreet.com. This conference call is also being recorded for replay. State Street's conference call is copyrighted and all wise are reserved. This call may not be recorded for rebroadcast or distribution in whole or in part without the expressed written authorization from State Street Corporation. The only authorized broadcast of this call will be housed on the State Street website. Now I would like to introduce Ilene Fiszel Bieler, Global Head of Investor Relations at State Street.\n\nIlene Fiszel Bieler\n\nExecutive VP & Global Head of IR, State Street Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Ron O'Hanley, will speak first. Then Eric Aboaf, our CFO, will take you through our fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings slide presentation, which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, investors.statestreet.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions. During the Q&A, please limit yourself to 2 questions and then requeue. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation will include results presented on a basis that excludes or adjusts one or more items from GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measures are available in the appendix to our slide presentation, also available in the IR section of our website. In addition, today's presentation will contain forward looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those statements due to a variety of important factors such as those factors referenced in our discussions today and in our SEC filings, including the risk factors in our Form 10-K. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change. Now let me turn it over to Ron.\n\nRonald Philip O'Hanley\n\nChairman & CEO, State Street Corporation\n\nThank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. 2022 was an unpredictable year for many of the world's investors and the people they serve. Despite a market rebound in the fourth quarter, 2022 was the worst year for financial markets since the global financial crisis. Both fixed income and equity markets fell, impacted by the war in Ukraine and several macroeconomic headwinds, including broken supply chains, price and wage inflation, dramatically higher global interest rates, U.S. dollar strength and heightened fears of global economic recession, which remain today. The uncertainty created by these factors contributed to a meaningful year-over-year declines in global financial markets as well as increased market volatility impacting flows.\nDespite these difficult macro conditions, State Street performed well. As a result, we continued to progress in 2022 towards achieving our medium-term targets. Our durable 4Q and full year 2022 results were driven by a strategy underpinned by our relentless focus on innovation, the power of our distinct value proposition and State Street's diversified products and services, all of which continue to resonate with clients as demonstrated by yet another year of strong organic net new servicing wins. As we continue to execute against our strategic agenda, we achieved a great deal in 2022. Slide 3 of our investor presentation shows our full year highlights and the progress we made towards achieving our strategic goals in 2022.\nIn a challenging operating environment, and compared to what was a very strong year for our business in 2021, we again delivered positive total operating leverage, pretax margin expansion and a higher return on equity, as you can see on the left of the slide. We drove continued business momentum, including $1.9 trillion of total new asset servicing wins, delivered total revenue growth and demonstrated ongoing expense discipline in the face of inflationary pressures and our continued investment in the resiliency and capabilities of our businesses, as you can see on the right hand bottom of the slide.\nWhile weaker average market levels created fee revenue headwinds for our investment servicing and asset management businesses in 2022, our balance sheet businesses, combined with higher interest rates and our deposit strategy, produced materially higher net interest income as compared to 2021. In addition, our foreign exchange trading services and front office software and data businesses produced double-digit year-over-year fee growth manifesting the desired results of our investments in these businesses and demonstrating the revenue diversification of our business model.\nTurning to Slide 4 of our presentation, I will review our fourth quarter highlights. Business momentum was solid in the fourth quarter with new AUC/A asset servicing wins amounting to $434 billion, driven by broad-based wins across client segments. We reported 2 new Alpha mandates in the quarter and expanded 12 existing Alpha relationships, 7 of which added additional back and middle office offerings. Helped by the sales performance, our AUC/A installation backlog was $3.6 trillion at quarter end. At Global Advisors, quarter-end assets under management totaled $3.5 trillion supported by another good quarter of ETF inflows.\nTurning to our fourth quarter financial performance. 4Q '22 EPS was $1.91 or $2.07, excluding notable items, up 7% year-over-year or 4% higher year-over-year, excluding notable items. The year-over-year EPS growth in a challenging market environment was supported by the resumption of common share repurchases in the fourth quarter as we focused on returning capital to our shareholders. Even in a year marked by economic and political disruptions, total revenue for the fourth quarter was the highest on record, increasing 3% year-over-year as lower total fee revenue was offset by very strong NII result, which increased 63% relative to the year ago period, primarily driven by higher global interest rates plus our balance sheet positioning and effective execution of our deposit management strategy.\nAs we meaningfully invested in our people and business, we remain focused on expense discipline in the fourth quarter with total expenses down 3% year-over-year or flat year-over-year, excluding notable items, in part supported by the stronger U.S. dollar. This was achieved by our relentless and ongoing focus on operational productivity simplification and automation. Turning to our balance sheet and capital. Our CET1 capital ratio increased to a strong 13.6% at year-end, recognizing the importance of capital return to our shareholders, and having already announced a 10% per share increase to our common stock dividend earlier in 2022, we resumed share repurchases in the fourth quarter, buying back a total of $1.5 billion of State Street's common stock.\nFor 2023, it is our intention to return up to 200% of earnings in the form of common stock dividends and share repurchases, subject to market conditions and other factors. We expect our business mix, balance sheet strategy and earnings momentum will enable us to do so while maintaining prudent capital ratios within our target range. Accordingly, as we announced this morning, our Board of Directors has authorized a new common stock purchase program of up to $4.5 billion through the end of 2023. To conclude my opening remarks, I am pleased to be reporting the third year in a row of pretax margin expansion and higher return on equity, which demonstrates the successful progress we have made towards achieving our financial goals. Now let me hand the call over to Eric, who will take you through the quarter in more detail before I discuss our strategic priorities for 2023.\n\nEric Walter Aboaf\n\nCFO & Vice Chairman, State Street Corporation\n\nThank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my review of our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results, let me briefly discuss some of the notable items we recognized in the quarter outlined on Slide 5. First, we recognized acquisition and restructuring costs, including wind-down expenses related to the Brown Brothers Investor Services acquisition transaction, which we are no longer pursuing. Second, we recognized $70 million of repositioning costs consisting of an employee severance charge of $50 million to eliminate approximately 200 middle and senior manager positions, largely related to our Investment Services business as we continue to streamline our organizational structure. We also recognized $20 million of occupancy charge in the quarter to help us further shrink our occupancy costs. We expect these actions to generate a total run rate savings of roughly $100 million.\nLastly, we recognized the benefit of $23 million in the quarter related to the settlement proceeds from the 2018 FX benchmark litigation resolution, which is reflected in the FX trading services GAAP revenue line. Taken together, we recognized notable items of $78 million pretax or $0.16 a share.\nNow turning to Slide 6. I'll begin my review of both our fourth quarter '22 and full year '22 results. As you can see on the top left of the table, despite the dynamic and challenging operating environment, the diversity and durability of our business model allowed us to finish the fourth quarter with solid results. Total revenue for the quarter increased 3% year-over-year or 5% year-over-year, excluding notable items. As lower fee revenue was more than offset by robust NII growth of 63%, which I'll spend more time discussing later in today's presentation. We also continue to demonstrate prudent expense management which enabled us to deliver positive operating leverage in the quarter, and pretax margin is up more than 4 percentage points year-on-year, while ROE is up more than a percentage point this quarter as well.\nOn the right side of the slide, we show our full year 2022 performance. Notwithstanding the challenging operating environment we saw in 2022 for the year, I'm quite pleased that we again delivered positive operating leverage and nearly a percentage point improvement in pretax margin. As Ron mentioned, it has been 3 consecutive years of margin expansion and ROE improvement.\nTurning to Slide 7. During the quarter, we saw period-end AUC/A decrease by 16% on a year-on-year basis but increased 3% sequentially. The Year-on-year, the decrease in AUC/A was largely driven by continued lower period end market levels across both equity and fixed income markets globally, a previously disclosed client transition and the negative impact of currency translation, partially offset by net new business installations.\nQuarter-on-quarter AUC/A increased as a result of higher quarter end equity market levels and the positive impact of currency translation. At Global Advisors, we saw similar dynamics play out. Period end AUM decreased 16% year-on-year and increased 7% sequentially. The year-on-year decline in AUM was largely driven by lower period end market levels, some institutional net outflows and the negative impact of currency translation, which was partially offset by $22 billion of net inflows in our Spider ETF business. Quarter-on-quarter, the increase in AUM was primarily due to higher quarter end market levels. ETF net inflows and the positive impact of currency translation, partially offset by cash net outflows.\nTurning to Slide 8. On the left side of the page, you'll see fourth quarter total servicing fees down 13% year-on-year, largely driven by lower average market levels, lower client activity adjustments and flows normal pricing headwinds and the negative impact of currency translation, partially offset by net new business. Excluding the impact of the currency translation, servicing fees were down 10% year-on-year. Sequentially, total servicing fees were down 1%, primarily as a result of the client activity adjustments and flows. On the bottom panel of this page, we've included some sales performance indicators which highlight the good business momentum we again saw in the quarter. As you can see, AUC/A wins in the fourth quarter totaled a solid $434 billion, driven by strong broad-based traditional wins across client segments and regions including expanding relationships with existing Alpha clients. At quarter end, AUC/A won, but yet to be installed, totaled $3.6 trillion with Alpha representing a healthy portion which again reflects the unique value proposition of our strategy.\nTurning to Slide 9. Fourth quarter management fees were $457 million, down 14% year-on-year, primarily reflecting lower average market levels and the negative impact of currency translation, which represented about 2 percentage point headwind. Quarter-on-quarter, management fees were down 3%, largely due to equity and fixed income market headwinds. As you can see on the bottom right of the slide, notwithstanding the difficult and uncertain macroeconomic backdrop in the year, our franchise remains well positioned as evidenced by our continued strong business momentum. In ETFs, we saw solid full year net inflows in the U.S. with continued momentum in market share gains in of the SPDR low-cost equity and fixed income segments. In our institutional business, there's a continued momentum in defined contribution with $48 billion of inflows in the full year, including target date franchise net inflows of $21 billion, offset by industry-wide outflows in institutional index products. In our cash franchise, we still gained 60 basis points of market share in money market funds in 2022, even though first half inflows reversed in the fourth quarter.\nOn Slide 10, you see the strength of our diverse revenue growth engines with both FX trading services and software and processing up double-digit teens year-on-year in a difficult year. Relative to the period a year ago, fourth quarter FX trading services revenue ex notables was up 15%, primarily reflecting higher FX spreads, partially offset by lower FX volumes. Our global FX franchise was able to effectively monetize the less liquid market environment, which was driven by sharp moves in the U.S. dollar Sequentially, FX trading services revenue ex notables was up 8%, mainly due to higher direct and indirect revenue. Securities finance performance in the fourth quarter was more muted with revenues up 1% year-on-year. Sequentially, revenues were down 6%, mainly reflecting downward pressure on spreads due to lower special activity and year-end risk of activity by clients.\nFourth quarter software and processing fees were up 16% year-on-year and 17% sequentially, primarily driven by higher front office software and data revenues associated with CRD which were up 28% year-on-year and 25% sequentially. Lending fees for the quarter were down 10% year-on-year, primarily due to changes in product mix and flat quarter-on-quarter. Finally, other fee revenue of $18 million in the fourth quarter was flattish year-on-year and up $23 million quarter-on-quarter, largely due to the absence of negative market-related adjustments.\nMoving to Slide 11. On the left panel, you'll see fourth quarter front office software and data revenue increased 28% year-on-year, primarily driven by multiple on-premise renewals and continued growth in software-enabled revenue associated with new client implementations and client conversions to our cloud-based SaaS platform environment. Turning to some of the front office and Alpha business metrics on the right panel. The $21 million of new bookings in the quarter was once again well diversified across client segments, including asset owners, wealth and private markets as well as across asset classes, particularly in fixed income. Front-office revenue backlog and pipeline remains healthy, giving us confidence in the future growth of this business. As for Alpha, we are pleased to report 2 new Alpha mandate wins this quarter in the insurance and asset owner client segments.\nNow turning to Slide 12. Fourth quarter NII increased 63% year-on-year and 20% sequentially to $791 million. The year-on-year increase was largely due to higher short-and long-term market interest rates and proactive balance sheet positioning, partially offset by lower deposits. We have a well-constructed balance sheet, including both U.S. and foreign client deposits, a scale sponsored repo franchise and high-quality loan and investment portfolio that was consciously configured to benefit from rising global rates. Sequentially, the increase in NII performance was primarily driven by higher global market rates working through our balance sheet.\nOn the right of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during the fourth quarter. Year-on-year, average assets declined 6% and increased 3% sequentially, primarily due to deposit levels as well as currency translation impacts. The U.S. client deposit beta, excluding some new deposit initiatives was about 65% to 70% during the fourth quarter. Foreign deposit betas for the quarter were much lower in the 20% to 50% range depending on currency. Our international footprint continues to be an advantage. Total average deposits were up sequentially. We saw a sequential quarter reduction in noninterest-bearing deposits of 5%, which was more than offset by higher NII-accretive interest-bearing deposits that will help support high-quality client loan growth and selective expansion of the investment portfolio.\nTurning to Slide 13. Fourth quarter expenses, excluding notable items, were once again proactively managed in light of the tough fee revenue environment and flat year-on-year or up approximately 3% adjusted for currency translation. We have been carefully executing on our continued productivity and optimization savings efforts, which generated approximately $90 million in year-on-year gross savings for the quarter were approximately $320 million for 2022, achieving near the top end of our full year expense optimization guidance of 3% to 4%. These savings enabled us to drive positive operating leverage and pretax margin expansion which while partially offsetting continued wage inflation headwinds and continued investments in strategic parts of the company, including Alpha, private markets, technology and operations automation.\nOn a line-by-line basis compared to 4Q '21, Compensation and employee benefits were down 1% as the impact of currency translation and lower incentive compensation was partially offset by higher salary increases associated with nearly 6% wage inflation and higher headcount. Headcount increased 9%, primarily in our global hubs as we added operations, personnel to support growth areas such as Alpha and private market, invested in technology talent and in-source certain functions. There was also a portion of the headcount increase associated with some hiring catch-up post-COVID. We expect headcount to increase more modestly in 2023.\nInformation Systems and communications expenses were down 5% due to benefits from our in-sourcing efforts and continued vendor pricing optimization, partially offset by technology and infrastructure investments. Transaction processing was up 1%, mainly reflecting higher broker fees and market data costs, partially offset by lower sub-custody costs related to lower equity market levels. Occupancy was down 17%, largely due to an episodic lease-backed real estate transaction associated with the sale of our data centers, which was worth approximately $12 million. And other expenses were up 12%, primarily reflecting higher professional fees and travel costs.\nMoving to Slide 14. On the left side of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios followed by our capital trends on the right of the slide. As you can see, we continue to navigate the operating environment with strong capital levels relative to our requirements. At quarter end, standardized CET1 ratio of 13.6% increased 40 basis points quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by episodically lower RWA, partially offset by the resumption of share repurchases in the quarter. With respect to RWAs, it's worth noting that we saw unusually low RWAs this quarter worth about $10 billion, largely driven by our markets businesses and some specific currency factors. We would anticipate a similar amount of normalization of RWA in the $10 billion to $15 billion range going into first quarter.\nOur Tier 1 leverage ratio of 6% at quarter end was down 40 basis points quarter-on-quarter, mainly due to the resumption of share repurchases in the fourth quarter. We were quite pleased to return $1.7 billion to shareholders in the quarter, consisting of $1.5 billion for common share repurchases and $220 million in common stock dividends. Lastly, as Ron mentioned earlier, we announced this morning that our Board of Directors has authorized a new common stock repurchase program of up to $4.5 billion through the end of 2023. And as I said in December, we expect to execute this buyback at pace and get back to our target ranges for both CET1 and Tier 1 leverage market conditions and other factors dependent.\nTurning to Slide 15. Let me cover our full year 2023 outlook as well as provide some thoughts on the first quarter, both of which have significant potential for variability given the macro environment we're operating in. In terms of our current macro expectations, as we stand here today, we expect some point-to-point growth in global equity markets in 2023 which equates to global equity markets being down about 2 percentage points year-on-year on a full year average basis. Our rate outlook for 2023 largely aligned with the forward curve, which I would note is moving continuously. However, we currently expect to reach peak rates of 5% for Fed funds, 3.25% at the ECB and 4.5% at the Bank of England.\nAs for currency translation, we expect the U.S. dollar to be modestly stronger than the major currencies on average, but less than what we saw last year. As such, currency translation is likely to have a 0.5 point or less impact on both revenues and expenses. In light of the macro factors I just laid out, we currently expect that full year total fee revenue will be flat to up 1% ex notable items with servicing fees likely flattish and management fees down a bit, largely due to a modest reclassification of revenue out of fees into NII.\nRegarding the first quarter of 2023, we currently expect fee revenue to be down 1% to 2% ex notable items on a sequential quarter basis, given some normalization of foreign exchange market volatility that impacts our trading business with servicing fees expected to be up 1% to 2% and management fees expect to be down 1% to 2%. We expect full year 2023 NII to be up about 20% on a year-over-year basis after a very strong 2022. This is dependent, of course, on the outcome of rate hikes and deposit mix and levels. After a significant step-up in fourth quarter '22 NII, we expect first quarter '23 to be flattish. And after the first quarter of 2023, we expect to see a slide 1% to 2% of sequentially quarterly attenuation of NII throughout the remainder of 2023, then with a stabilization expected in 2024.\nTurning to expenses. As you can see in the walk, we expect expenses ex notables will be up 3.5% to 4% on a nominal basis in 2023, driven partially by wage and inflationary pressures and continued investment in the business and our people while still driving positive operating leverage. You can also see on the [walk] that for full year 2023, we expect gross saves of approximately 3%, which will help offset inflationary pressures and variable costs and ongoing investments in areas like private markets and alpha and further automation. Regarding the first quarter of 2023, on a year-over-year basis, we expect expenses ex notable items to be up about 2%.\nFinally, taxes should be in 19% to 20% range for 2023. This outlook would deliver a fourth consecutive year of margin expansion and advances us towards our medium-term target goal of 30% as well as deliver positive operating leverage and strong EPS growth for our shareholders. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.\n\nRonald Philip O'Hanley\n\nChairman & CEO, State Street Corporation\n\nThanks, Eric. As we enter 2023, we see an uncertain environment. On the positive side, many supply chains have been repaired, the outlook for energy supply is better than anticipated, particularly in Europe and developed world inflation may have peaked. We foresee continued rising interest rates in the short term, but at a slower pace. The most significant known risks are geopolitical, including the Russia-Ukraine war, China from an economic performance and policy perspective and the United States as it approaches its debt ceiling.\nTurning to Slide 17. Even with another year of economic and geopolitical uncertainty ahead of us, we continue to be very clear in our strategic priorities for 2023, focusing on what we can control. We plan to deliver further growth, drive innovation and continue to enhance shareholder value as we further progress State Street towards its medium-term targets. First, we are targeting further improvements in our business growth and profitability by leveraging State Street's Alpha value proposition and enhancing its private market capabilities as we aim to become the leading investment servicer platform and enterprise outsourced solutions provider in the industry. We intend to maintain and extend our leadership positions in a number of key businesses. In Global Markets, we aim to expand wallet share as a leading provider of liquidity, financing and research solutions to investment professionals. At Global Advisors, we aim to build on our strengths in areas such as ETFs and cash, while organically accelerating growth efforts in fast-growing segments where we can win.\nSecond, as we have over the past several years, we must continue to transform the way we work by driving increased productivity and efficiency throughout our organization as we build out a simplified, scalable, configurable end-to-end operating model. As we lead with client service excellence, productivity will become a core differentiator of our value proposition.\nThird, we must continue to build a higher-performing organization. We are strengthening execution skills and increasing accountability thereby fostering an even more results-oriented culture required for future growth. Our fourth priority is supported by and the intended outcome of the first 3 priorities and is aimed at achieving our financial goals meaning another year of positive operating leverage, margin expansion and higher returns.\nTo conclude, supported by our distinctive value proposition and diversified offerings as well as our ability to manage State Street through challenging environments, I believe we will be able to execute on each of these strategic priorities in 2023 as we advance towards achieving our financial goals, all while being an essential partner to the world's investors and the people they serve. And with that, operator, we can now open the call for questions."

State Street's conference call is copyrighted, and all rights are reserved. This call may not be recorded for rebroadcast or distribution in whole or in part without the express written authorization from State Street Corporation. The only authorized broadcast of this call will be housed in the State Street website.\nNow I'd like to introduce Ilene Fiszel Bieler, Global Head of Investor Relations at State Street.\n\nIlene Fiszel Bieler\n\nExecutive VP & Global Head of IR, State Street Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Ron O'Hanley, will speak first; then Eric Aboaf, our CFO, will take you through our third quarter 2022 earnings slide presentation, which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, investors.statestreet.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions. (Operator Instructions)\nBefore we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation will include results presented on a basis that excludes or adjusts one or more items from GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measure are available in the appendix to our slide presentation, also available in the IR section of our website.\nIn addition, today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those statements due to a variety of important factors, such as those factors referenced in our discussion today and in our SEC filings, including the risk factors in our Form 10-K. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change.\nNow let me turn it over to Ron.\n\nRonald Philip O'Hanley\n\nChairman & CEO, State Street Corporation\n\nThank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. 2022 continues to unfold like no other year in recent memory with the challenges faced today arising partly out of, but acutely different from, those the world faced in 2020 during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. And while the global operating environment continues to be very challenging, our third quarter results clearly demonstrate the resilience of our business model and our focus on maintaining and further improving State Street's pretax margin, which was a solid 29% in the third quarter, excluding notable items.\nDuring the third quarter, financial markets were negatively impacted by the adverse effects of the ongoing war in Ukraine and several macroeconomic headwinds, including continued price and wage inflation, dramatically higher interest rates, significant U.S. dollar strength and heightened fears of a global recession. These factors collectively drove heightened uncertainty, which contributed to meaningful declines in both global equity and fixed income markets as well as increased market volatility, which in turn impacted flows.\nWe continue to carefully navigate the business through this environment. While the operating climate created a number of fee revenue headwinds for our business in the third quarter, the savings and efficiency of our Alpha and enterprise outsourcing offering makes our value proposition even more attractive to asset managers and asset owners in the current market and inflationary environment. We maintained a solid balance sheet and strong capital position, delivered significant NII growth as well as healthy FX trading revenues and remain laser focused on intensely managing what we can control as demonstrated by our expense management.\nTurning to Slide 3 of our presentation, I will review our third quarter highlights before Eric takes you through the quarter in more detail. Starting with our financial performance. Third quarter '22 EPS was $1.80 or $1.82, excluding notable items compared to $1.96 or $2, excluding notable items in 3Q '21. Double-digit year-over-year declines in average global equity market values drove most of this decrease.\nTotal fee revenue for the third quarter declined 8% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the impact of significantly lower global equity and fixed income market levels on servicing and management fees as well as the stronger U.S. dollar. Within total fee revenue, our Global Markets franchise once again continued to perform well with FX trading services and securities finance revenues increasing 14% and 4% year-over-year, respectively, as the business was able to benefit from increased volatility while supporting our clients.\nWe also drove a solid result within Front office software and data with third quarter revenue increasing 9% year-over-year. Total revenue for the third quarter declined just 1% year-over-year, as lower total fee revenue was largely offset by a very strong NII result, which increased 36% relative to the year ago period, driven primarily by higher interest rates.\nFaced with continued market-related fee revenue headwinds and inflationary pressures, we remain focused on controlling expense growth. Even as we invested in our people and business, third quarter total expenses were flat, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and expense management.\nBusiness momentum was solid in the third quarter, with new AUC/A asset servicing wins amounting to $233 billion. Encouragingly, our third quarter wins include expanded relationships with two existing Alpha clients. demonstrating our ability to broaden and deepen client relationships and drive new back office mandates through our Alpha strategy. As a result of this quarter's solid sales performance, AUC/A won but yet to be installed with $3.4 trillion at quarter end. Front office and data also experienced good business momentum in the third quarter with annual recurring revenue increasing 20% year-over-year to $267 million.\nAt Global Advisors, assets under management totaled $3.3 trillion. Overall, third quarter AUM flows and management fees were negatively impacted by weaker equity and fixed income markets, but we still saw positive net flows into our cash, SPY and U.S. low-cost ETF products during the quarter. Even in the volatile environment, our global institutional money market business has continued to gain market share this year with AUM reaching a record level in the third quarter, having experienced 4 quarters in a row of inflows. We remain excited by our Global Adviser strategy and the growth potential of the franchise and announced new leadership in the third quarter as Yie-Hsin Hung will become SSGA's new President and CEO in December.\nI would now like to turn to the proposed acquisition of Brown Brothers Harriman's Investor Services business, which remains subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. The current regulatory environment for M&A transactions involving G-SIBs is challenging. We are engaged in ongoing dialogue with U.S. and international banking regulators regarding the prolonged regulatory review process. We have developed with BBH proposed modifications to the transaction, including changes to the operating model and legal entity structure and a reduction to the purchase price. We anticipate that a modified transaction would be somewhat more complex and included a delay in timing and amount of deal synergies, resulting in a slower path to accretion.\nWhile discussions with regulators on the proposed modified transaction are ongoing, the likelihood of a successful outcome is increasingly uncertain. There can be no assurance that a mutually acceptable modified transaction will be agreed and enter into or as to the timing or outcome of any regulatory approvals and other closing conditions for a modified transaction.\nThe modifications to the transaction remain subject to review and approval by both BBH's partners and our Board of Directors. As previously noted, the sale and purchase agreement allows each of State Street and BBH the right to terminate the transaction upon written notice without a contractual penalty at any time.\nWe continue to believe the strategic rationale for the transaction remains compelling, and that has encouraged us to continue to seek an acceptable path forward. These efforts are actively underway. And as we previously stated, we expect to reach a decision on whether the transaction can proceed forward during this quarter.\nTurning to our balance sheet and capital. Despite a continued rise in interest rates, our CET1 capital ratio was a strong 13.2% at quarter end. As I have noted previously, we recognize the importance of capital return to our shareholders and it remains an integral component of our medium-term targets. Accordingly, having already announced a 10% per share increase to our quarterly common stock dividend earlier this year, we now intend to repurchase approximately $1 billion of State Street's common stock in the fourth quarter under the existing common stock repurchase program authorization, which expires at the end of 2022.\nAdditionally, in keeping with our medium-term targets, it is also our intention to return greater than 80% of earnings in 2023 in the form of common stock dividends and share repurchases, subject to approval by our Board of Directors and market conditions at the time. If the proposed acquisition of BBH Investor Services does not progress, we would expect capital return to be significantly more than that amount.\nTo conclude, the events of the last 2.5 years have demonstrated the resiliencies of State Street's business model during times of heightened market volatility and macroeconomic uncertainty. Even as financial markets broadly declined in the third quarter, we delivered a healthy pretax margin of 29%, excluding notable items, in addition to solid new business wins. While the environment is challenging and uncertain, we remain confident in our ability to continue to successfully execute against our strategic agenda and improve our operating model and financial performance over the medium term for the benefit of our clients and shareholders.\nAs we look ahead, we will continue to adapt to the highly uncertain environment by remaining intensely focused on managing what we can control as our solid expense discipline in 2022 to date has demonstrated with year-to-date total expenses flat to the same 9-month period in 2021, even as we invested meaningfully in our people and business.\nAnd with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail.\n\nEric Walter Aboaf\n\nCFO & Vice Chairman, State Street Corporation\n\nThank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my review of our third quarter results on Slide 4.\nWe reported EPS of $1.80 or $1.82, excluding acquisition and restructuring costs as detailed in the panel on the right of the slide. As you know, the operating environment in the third quarter remained challenging with persistent market volatility related to ongoing geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures, rapidly rising interest rates and concerns about the global economy. Despite these challenges, as you can see on the left panel of the slide, strong growth in both net interest income and our FX trading services business enabled us to partially offset the significant headwinds from lower equity and fixed income markets in the quarter. Additionally, we continue to demonstrate prudent expense management in the third quarter, even as we experienced ongoing price and wage increases, while we continue to invest in the franchise.\nTurning to Slide 5. During the quarter, we saw period-end investment services AUC/A decreased by 18% on a year-on-year basis and 7% sequentially. The year-on-year change was largely driven by continued lower period end market levels across equity and fixed income markets globally, a previously disclosed client transition and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by net new business installations. The quarter-on-quarter decline was largely a result of these same factors.\nSimilarly, at Global Advisors, period-end AUM decreased 15% year-on-year and 6% sequentially. The year-on-year decline in AUM was largely driven by lower period end market levels, institutional net outflows and the impact of currency translation, which was partially offset by positive net flows in both our ETF and cash businesses.\nTurning to Slide 6. On the left side of the page, you'll see third quarter total servicing fees down 12% year-on-year, largely driven by lower average equity and fixed income market levels, lower client activity and adjustments, normal pricing headwinds and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by net new business. Excluding the impact of currency translation, servicing fees were down 9% year-on-year. Even with the negative impact of the market environment in the quarter, I would highlight that we're pleased to see good double-digit growth in our private markets businesses. Sequentially, total servicing fees were down 6%, primarily as a result of these same drivers.\nLastly, we recorded traditional custody wins worth $233 billion in the quarter with attractive fee rates across key client segments. And we now have more than $3.2 trillion of assets to be installed, a good portion of which are attributed to large Alpha deals that were won over the past year. Given our large backlog, we installed approximately $350 billion of assets this quarter, which is in line with our historical pace.\nTurning to Slide 7. Third quarter management fees were $472 million, down 10% year-on-year, primarily reflecting lower average equity and fixed income market levels, a previously disclosed client-specific pricing adjustment, institutional net outflows and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by the absence of the impact of money market fee waivers and positive net ETF and cash inflows. Management fees were down 4% quarter-on-quarter, largely due to equity and fixed income market headwinds and the impact of currency translation.\nNotwithstanding the challenging backdrop in the quarter, while we did see some outflows in our ETF business due to an exit of a low-yielding Asia Pacific fund, our franchise still remains well positioned for growth. In ETFs, we saw sustained ETF inflows into the SPDR low-cost suite and fixed income funds.\nIn our institutional business, there's continued momentum in defined contribution with third quarter inflows of $10 billion, including the target date franchise. In our cash business, top quartile performance on our government money market fund was a major driver of net inflows which contributed to market share gains in the institutional money market funds.\nOn Slide 8, FX trading services had yet another strong quarter. Relative to the period a year ago, third quarter FX trading services revenue was up 14%, primarily driven by higher FX spreads driven by higher market volatility and the recent regulatory capital changes partially offset by lower client FX volumes. Quarter-on-quarter FX trading services revenue was down 4% as the benefit of higher FX spreads was more than offset by lower client FX volumes, which tend to be lower in the summer months.\nSecurities finance performed well in the third quarter, with revenues up 4% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher spreads due to higher special activity, only partially offset by lower agency and enhanced custody balances due to falling market levels. Sequentially, revenues were up 3%, mainly reflecting higher agency spreads.\nThird quarter software and processing fees were up 2% year-on-year primarily driven by higher Front office software revenues associated with CRD, which were up 9%, while lending fees were down 11% due to changes in product mix. Finally, other fee revenues of negative $5 million in the third quarter declined on a year-on-year basis, largely due to negative market-related adjustments. Sequentially, we saw an increase in other fee revenue, primarily reflecting fewer negative market-related adjustments.\nMoving to Slide 9. Let me provide some details on the performance of the Front office software and data revenue in the third quarter on the left panel of the slide. Front office software revenues increased 9% year-on-year as our more durable and recurring software-enabled revenue continues to grow nicely, driven by new client implementations and continued success in converting clients through a cloud-based SaaS platform environment. Sequentially, revenues were up 1% due to higher software-enabled revenue, partially offset by lower professional services revenue. Our revenue backlog remains healthy.\nTurning to some of the CRD and Alpha business metrics on the right panel, we continue to be pleased with our new bookings for the business. The $14 million of new bookings from this quarter was well diversified across client segments, particularly wealth and asset owners, demonstrating the benefit of and breadth of clients the platform can now support. As for middle office, we continue to have extremely healthy uninstalled revenue backlog of over $100 million, which is up 50% on a year-on-year basis, as I mentioned earlier.\nNow turning to Slide 10. Third quarter NII increased 36% year-on-year and 13% sequentially, primarily reflecting the impact of higher short-term interest rates from central bank hikes, only partially offset by lower client deposits. More than 40% of this increase was driven by non-U.S. dollar rates as we saw central banks globally raise interest rates.\nOn the right of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during the third quarter. As a result of a rapidly changing rate environment, industry-wide deposits have begun to trend lower, and we are seeing some of this play through our balance sheet as well. Excluding the impact of currency translation, average deposits were down 5%, both year-on-year and sequentially and primarily driven by the global tightening in monetary policy by central banks and by the impact of significantly lower market levels on AUC/A. The investment portfolio is down modestly as we continue to manage duration and we now have more than 60% in HTM. As to today's results reaffirm, our balance sheet continues to be well positioned to recognize this interest rate and NII tailwind and also protect AOCI.\nTurning to Slide 11. Third quarter expenses, excluding notable items, were once again proactively managed in light of the revenue environment and flat year-on-year, or up approximately 4% adjusted for currency translation and notable items. We've been carefully executing on our continued productivity and optimization savings efforts, which generated approximately $80 million in year-on-year gross savings or approximately $230 million year-to-date, which puts us in line to achieve our full year expense optimization guidance of 3% to 4% of the expense base.\nIt also contributed to our year-to-date positive operating leverage, which we also expect to deliver for the full year. These savings, in addition to benefits from a stronger U.S. dollar enabled us to offset some of the wage inflation we have seen -- we have been seeing in the industry while we continue to invest in the strategic parts of our company, including Alpha, private markets and operations automation.\nOn a line-by-line basis compared to third quarter '21. Compensation and employee benefits were down 1% as the impact of currency translation was partially offset by higher salary costs associated with wage inflation and higher headcount. Headcount increased 6%, primarily in our Poland and India global centers as we invested in important technology capabilities and added operations talent to support new products and services in growth areas such as Alpha, private markets and middle office servicing.\nThere is also a portion of the headcount increase associated with some hiring catch-up post COVID. we expect headcount growth to start to level off. Information Systems and communications expenses were down 2% as we began to see benefits from our in-sourcing efforts and continued vendor pricing optimization, partially offset by technology and infrastructure investments.\nTransaction processing was down 10%, mainly reflecting lower sub-custody costs related to equity market movements. Occupancy was down 5% largely due to currency translation. And other expenses were up 17%, primarily reflecting higher securities processing costs, marketing costs, travel costs and foundation grants.\nMoving to Slide 12. On the right side of the slide, we show our capital highlights. We are pleased to report CET1 of 13.2%, up 30 basis points quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by higher retained earnings and well-controlled RWA. With respect to RWAs, there is volatility, and I would caveat that they were lower than we expected this quarter. We would anticipate some RWA increases that we continue to both optimize the balance sheet and efficiently put capital to work across our businesses.\nThird quarter Tier 1 leverage ratio of 6.4% was up 40 basis points quarter-on-quarter, mainly due to the decrease in balance sheet size and higher retained earnings. As the slide highlights, our capital position is strong, and our commitment to being stewards of shareholder capital remains steadfast. In keeping with that commitment, we returned $232 million to shareholders in the third quarter through dividends. And as Ron highlighted, we now intend to repurchase approximately $1 billion of State Street's common stock in the fourth quarter.\nThis higher-than-expected buyback amount is based on our healthy capital levels and our expected future uses of capital. The AFS mark-to-market in OCI this quarter amounted to $170 million negative as compared to minus $0.5 billion in 2Q '22, meaningfully improved as a result of the management actions we took despite another strong run-up in interest rates this quarter.\nTurning to Slide 13. We provide a summary of our third quarter results. Despite the continued volatile market environment, I'm pleased with our quarterly performance. Even with the current macroeconomic environment and persistent geopolitical uncertainties, our strong growth in net interest income and FX trading services enabled us to partially offset another quarter of significant headwinds from both equity and fixed income markets, highlighting the resiliency of the franchise, and our expenses remained well controlled, demonstrating our laser focus on productivity.\nTurning to our outlook. Let me share our current thinking regarding our fourth quarter and some of our macro assumptions as we look over the remainder of the year. At a macro level, while market rate expectations have been volatile, our current interest rate outlook is broadly in line with the current forwards, which suggests that year-end Fed funds rate of 4.5%. We expect other international central banks to continue to raise rates in 4Q and beyond into 2023 as well.\nOur outlook assumes 4Q equity market levels will be flat to September month end, which would imply a 10% quarter-on-quarter decline in global daily average equity markets in 4Q. We also expect continued U.S. dollar strength to be worth about 1 percentage point of headwind to fee and a tailwind to expenses on a quarter-on-quarter basis, which is included in our guide.\nSo in terms of the fourth quarter of 2022. Given the expected decline in average global equity market levels, we expect total fee revenue to be down about 3% on a sequential quarter basis, with servicing fees down 4% to 5% quarter-on-quarter and management fees down 8% quarter-on-quarter.\nTurning to NII. Following yet another strong sequential increase in NII in 3Q, we expect to deliver additional NII growth of 4% to 10% quarter-on-quarter, driven by the tailwind from U.S. and foreign central bank rate hikes. This outlook includes our expectation for some continued deposit outflow in 4Q. For the full year, we now expect NII to increase 28% to 30%, which is better than our prior full year guide of 24% to 27%. We also expect continued good growth in NII in full year 2023.\nNext, we expect total expenses, excluding notable items, to be roughly flat quarter-on-quarter despite inflationary wage pressure as we continue to target productivity initiatives in the face of a challenging environment for fee revenue. This focus should enable us to drive positive total operating leverage and a healthy pretax margin for both the fourth quarter and the full year. Full year expenses are expected to be flat versus last year. Finally, we would expect the fourth quarter tax rate to be approximately 18% to 19% for the quarter.\nAnd with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.\n\nRonald Philip O'Hanley\n\nChairman & CEO, State Street Corporation\n\nThanks, Eric. Operator, let's open the line for questions."

Today's discussion is being broadcast live on State Street's website at investors.statestreet.com. This conference call is also being recorded for replay.\nState Street's conference call is copyrighted and all rights are reserved. This call may not be recorded for rebroadcast or distribution in whole or in part without the expressed written authorization from State Street Corporation. The only authorized broadcast of this call will be housed on the State Street website. I would now like to introduce Ilene Fiszel Bieler, Global Head of Investor Relations at State Street. Please go ahead, Ilene.\n\nIlene Fiszel Bieler\n\nExecutive VP & Global Head of IR, State Street Corporation\n\nThank you. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Ron O'Hanley, will speak first. Then Eric Aboaf, our CFO, will take you through our second quarter 2022 earnings slide presentation, which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, investors.statestreet.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions. During the Q&A, please limit yourself to 2 questions and then requeue. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that today's presentation will include results presented on a basis that excludes or adjusts 1 or more items from GAAP.\nReconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measure are available in the appendix to our slide presentation. In addition, today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those statements due to a variety of important factors such as those factors referenced in our discussion today and in our SEC filings, including the risk factors in our Form 10-K. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change. Now let me turn it over to Ron.\n\nRonald Philip O’Hanley\n\nChairman & CEO, State Street Corporation\n\nThank you, Ilene, and good afternoon, everyone. This morning, we released our second quarter financial results. The second quarter operating environment continued to be impacted by the ongoing geopolitical events in Europe and the notable macroeconomic environment. The associated price and wage inflation, rising interest rates, years of recession are driving declining equity in fixed income markets, currency volatility and concerns over market liquidity.\nThese factors created a number of fee revenue headwinds for our businesses. Despite the adverse market conditions, State Street performed well in the second quarter with a strong balance sheet and good sales momentum while delivering strong FX trading and significantly better NII growth year-over-year, coupled with well-controlled expenses and a healthy pretax margin. We remain focused on executing against our strategy and intensely managing what we can control to navigate through uncertainty, drive further business momentum and achieve our medium-term goals.\nTurning to Slide 3 of our presentation, I will review our second quarter highlights before Eric takes you through the quarter in more detail. Starting with our financial performance. 2Q '22 EPS decreased 8% year-over-year, though it was down just 2% year-over-year, excluding notable items, primarily a prior year gain on sale in 2Q '21. Weaker markets were the major driver of this decline. Total fee revenue for the quarter declined 6% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the impact of significantly lower global equity and fixed income market levels on servicing and management fees and the stronger U.S. dollar.\nWithin total fee revenue, our Global Markets franchise continued to perform well with FX trading services revenue increasing 16% year-over-year, benefiting from higher FX market volatility, which drove higher spreads. Total revenue for the quarter declined 3% year-over-year, but was down just 1%, excluding notable items as lower total fee revenue was largely offset by a strong NII result which increased 25% relative to the year ago period.\nIn the face of market-related fee revenue headwinds in the second quarter, we remain highly focused on controlling the expense base. Second quarter total expenses were flat year-over-year and declined 1% excluding notable items. Our ongoing productivity actions largely offset higher-than-anticipated salary increases and planned business investments.\nTurning to our business momentum, which you can see across the middle of the slide. We reported a strong quarter of new AUC/A asset servicing wins, which amounted to $972 billion with back office services accounting for 40% of these wins by AUC/A. As a result of this quarter's good sales performance, AUC/A won but yet to be installed increased to a record $3.6 trillion at quarter end.\nDuring the second quarter, we also reported another Alpha client win, with 12 of State Street's 20 alpha clients now live as of quarter end. We were also awarded the title of Security Services Provider of the Year in the Financial News 20th Annual Trading and Technology Awards. Front office software and data also experienced good business momentum in the second quarter, with annual recurring revenue increasing 20% year-over-year to $251 million.\nAt Global Advisors, assets under management totaled $3.5 trillion at quarter end. Overall second quarter AUM inflows were negatively impacted by the weaker equity market environment but we still saw positive net inflows into both our cash and U.S. low-cost ETF franchises during the quarter. Even in a volatile environment, we continue to innovate and expand our capabilities to drive future growth. For example, Global Advisors continues to press forward in active ETFs in ESG is illustrated by the launch of the actively managed SPDR Nuveen Municipal Bond ESG ETF and a number of MSCI Climate Paris aligned ETFs.\nLast, in terms of business momentum, I was particularly pleased to see that State Street was recognized as the top provider in FX services by Euromoney Magazine in the second quarter. Importantly, State Street regained its #1 position overall for real money clients in addition to being ranked #1 for best service for real money clients. Our FX franchise supports and complements our core investment services business and has proven to be an effective deployment of our capital.\nTurning to our balance sheet and capital. Despite a continued rise in interest rates, our CET1 capital ratio improved significantly to 12.9% at quarter end due to our active management of risk-weighted assets and the mitigating actions we executed in our investment portfolio in the second quarter. The strength of our balance sheet was highlighted in the second quarter with the release of the Federal Reserve's annual CCAR stress test results in June, following which we announced our intention to increase State Street's quarterly common stock dividend by 10% to $0.63 per share in the third quarter, subject to approval by our Board of Directors.\nWe were pleased to announce the intended increase to our quarterly common dividend as we recognize the importance of capital return to our shareholders. With that in mind, in the fourth quarter of this year, it remains our intention to resume our existing common share repurchase program in an amount reflecting interest rate levels and market conditions at that time.\nI'll now turn to our proposed acquisition of BBH Investor Services business which remains subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. We continue to be excited about the business and its people, the franchise it represents and the opportunities the transaction represents for our collective clients, and for accelerating our strategy. I've mentioned previously that we've been engaged in ongoing dialogue with U.S. banking regulators regarding the regulatory review process and potential modifications to the transaction intended to facilitate resolution of that process.\nBased on those discussions, we have developed with BBH, proposed modifications to the transaction structure that the parties believe present a path forward. The proposed modifications include changes to the operating model and legal entity structure and changes to the regulatory approvals required to complete the transaction. As part of the proposed modified transaction, State Street is seeking amendments to the transaction terms, including the purchase price. Both BBH and our Board of Directors would need to review and approve the modified transaction in amended terms.\nDuring the third quarter, we intend to finalize the proposed structure and contractual terms and confirm our approach with regulators. Assuming the financial and operational aspects of the proposed modifications are timely finalized and contracted, subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions, the parties are aiming to close the transaction at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022.\nHowever, there exists significant timing uncertainty and risk that closing will extend beyond that time line. There can be no assurance that a mutually acceptable modified transaction will be entered into or as to the timing or outcome of any regulatory approvals and other closing conditions for this modified transaction. After September 6, 2022, either party can terminate the transaction without penalty, absent further agreement of the parties.\nTo conclude, as we progress towards our medium-term targets in this uncertain environment, we remain particularly focused on maintaining and further improving our pretax margin performance, which despite the challenging market conditions, increased almost 29% for the quarter, excluding notable items. To help achieve this goal, in the face of inflationary pressure in a challenging revenue environment, we will continue to exhibit expense discipline and to drive our automation and productivity efforts. We also remain laser-focused on innovating for the benefit of our clients and driving organic growth, as demonstrated by the strong AUC/A wins in the second quarter, all while returning capital to our shareholders.\nAnd with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail.\n\nEric Walter Aboaf\n\nCFO & Vice Chairman, State Street Corporation\n\nThank you, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin my review of our second quarter results on Slide 4. We reported EPS of $1.91 or $1.94 excluding acquisition and restructuring costs as detailed on the panel on the right side of the slide. As Ron noted earlier, the operating environment in the second quarter remained challenging, largely characterized by continued market volatility related to macroeconomic events and continued geopolitical uncertainties.\nAs you can see on the left panel of the slide, strong growth in both net interest income and FX trading enabled us to partially offset significant headwinds from lower equity and fixed income markets in the quarter that impacted other fee areas. Also evidenced by today's results, our approach to expense management remains very disciplined and deliberate. On a year-on-year basis, second quarter expenses were down even as we experienced higher-than-expected wage increases and continue to thoughtfully invest in the franchise.\nLastly, you'll see that in the second quarter, we had a lower-than-expected tax rate. The bulk of the discrete tax items that contributed to our lower taxes were due to the reassessment of a deferred tax asset worth roughly $60 million. All things considered during the quarter, our business model demonstrated resilience against the challenging backdrop.\nTurning to Slide 5. During the quarter, we saw period-end AUC/A decreased by 10% on a year-on-year basis and 8% sequentially. Amidst continued and uncertain economic conditions, the year-on-year change was largely driven by lower period end market levels across just about every equity and fixed income market around the world, partially offset by net new business and client flows. On a quarter-on-quarter -- the quarter-on-quarter decline was largely a result of the same lower period end market levels, as we've also started to see industry outflows from investment products as the risk off sentiment continues.\nSimilarly, at Global Advisors, quarter-end AUM decreased 11% year-on-year and 14%, sequentially. The year-on-year decline in AUM was also largely driven by lower period end market levels and institutional net outflows which was partially offset by positive net inflows in both our U.S. low-cost ETF complex and cash inflows in the quarter.\nTurning to Slide 6. On the left side of the page, you'll see second quarter total servicing fees down 7% year-on-year, largely driven by lower average equity and fixed income market levels, normal pricing headwinds, client activity and adjustments and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by net new business growth. Excluding the impact of currency translation, servicing fees were down only 4% year-on-year.\nI'd also highlight that from a segment perspective, we continue to see excellent revenue growth in our Alternative Client segment, both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. Sequentially, total servicing fees were down 5%, primarily as a result of the same drivers, lower average equity and fixed income market levels, client activity and adjustments and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by positive net new business.\nWithin servicing fees, back office fees were down 7% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by the factors I just described. Middle Office Services was down 12% year-on-year and 8% quarter-on-quarter, primarily due to decreased client AUMs, driven by lower market levels and client transaction activity and adjustments. But we are seeing some compression in our legacy middle office book. It is an important component of our Alpha proposition when it connects to both the Front office and Back office and new wins generally come with contracts of 7 to 10 years. We continue to expect to see good growth over the medium term as evidenced by our large uninstalled middle office revenue backlog of more than $90 million, which I will talk more about in a moment.\nEven against this challenging backdrop, we continue to be pleased with our Investment Services business momentum and robust pipeline. We recorded another strong quarter of new AUC/A wins worth $972 billion while AUC/A won, but yet to be installed amounted to $3.6 trillion at quarter end. As Ron mentioned earlier, during second quarter, we reported another new Alpha win, Allspring Global Investments taking the total number of Alpha clients to 20 and now have 12 implementations live.\nLastly, in response to industry inflationary cost pressures, we've undergone a comprehensive analysis of our pricing across all our products' areas. The result of this analysis has led to the decision to begin to adjust our client pricing upwards in certain areas of servicing where the wage pressure is most acute and industry capacity is stretched. Ultimately, we believe these pricing changes will support the continued investment that allows us to best serve our clients.\nTurning to Slide 7. Second quarter management fees were $490 million, down 3% year-on-year, primarily reflecting lower average equity and fixed income market levels, the impact of currency translation and a specific client repricing adjustment, partially offset by the elimination of money market fee waivers and the run rate impact of net ETF inflows. Management fees were down 6% quarter-on-quarter, largely due to equity and fixed income market headwinds, partially offset by the elimination of the same money market fee waivers.\nAs you can see on the bottom right of the slide, our franchise remains well positioned for growth. In ETFs, although we saw outflows in equity in commodities, we continue to see inflows into SPDR low cost and fixed income ETFs. In our Institutional Business, there's continued momentum in our target date franchise, notwithstanding outflows primarily from 1 large client with very low fee assets, which ultimately benefited the overall management fee rate this quarter. Across our cash franchise, we again saw another quarter of strong net inflows, this time worth $15 billion in the quarter, contributing to market share gains.\nOn Slide 8, FX trading services had yet another strong quarter. Relative to a period a year ago, second quarter FX trading services revenue was up 16%, primarily driven by higher FX spreads, partially offset by lower client FX volumes. Quarter-on-quarter, FX trading services revenue was down 8% as the benefit of higher FX spreads was more than offset by lower client FX volumes too.\nOur second quarter securities finance revenues decreased slightly year-on-year, primarily driven by lower agency and enhanced custody balances due to lower markets, partially offset by higher spreads. Sequentially, revenues were up 11%, mainly reflecting higher spreads, partially offset by lower agency and enhanced custody balances.\nSecond quarter software and processing fees were down 11% year-on-year and 6% quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by lower Front office software and data revenue associated with CRD, which I'll turn to shortly. Finally, other fee revenues of negative $43 million in the second quarter declined both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. Both the year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter declines largely reflect negative market-related adjustments while the absence of prior period positive fair value adjustments on equity investments also contributed to the sequential decline.\nWhile we saw pressure throughout the quarter, almost half of the $43 million came through in the second half of June.\nMoving to Slide 9. Let me provide some details on the performance of our Front office software and data revenue in the second quarter on the left panel of this slide. As a reminder, CRD represents the majority of these revenues, but we also include Alpha Data Services, Alpha Data Platform and Mercatus revenues since they are part of our Front office offering.\nOn both a year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter basis, Front office software revenue declined as expected, primarily driven by the absence of several on-premise renewals in the prior periods as well as some episodic fees when compared to the prior year quarter, partially offset by higher software-enabled SaaS revenue.\nIt is important to note, however, that the more durable and recurring software-enabled and professional services revenues have continued to grow nicely with a year-on-year growth of 15%, demonstrating success in deploying our cloud-based SaaS platform environment to more clients. Turning to some of the softer metrics enabled by CRD and Alpha on the right panel, you'll see that our annual recurring revenue has grown 20% year-on-year as we convert more clients to SaaS, which we expect will create a stickier and more profitable business model.\nAs for the middle office, we continue to have an extremely healthy backlog of uninstalled revenue worth $92 million, which is almost twice the prior year. Lastly, we are pleased to have announced another Alpha mandate win this quarter. We're also excited to have expanded an existing Alpha relationship this quarter, winning approximately $300 billion of new back office assets to custody from an asset owner client. This provides another proof point that our Alpha value proposition is working as we're gaining more of the wallet share over time.\nTurning to Slide 10. Second quarter NII increased 25% year-on-year, primarily reflecting the impact of higher interest rates and continued growth in loan balances. Relative to the first quarter, NII was up 15%. The sequential increase was largely driven by the improvement in both short and long end rates, which benefited our yields, together with continued growth in loan balances, partially offset by lower investment portfolio balances.\nOn the right side of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during the quarter. Average deposits were down 6% year-on-year and 2% quarter-on-quarter, primarily related to the impact from currency translation and dollar strengthening, which accounted for almost half of the year-on-year decline and 2/3 of the sequential decline. The investment portfolio is now down modestly, and we have almost 60% of our securities now in held to maturity. We're pleased that our balance sheet is well positioned to recognize this interest rate and NII tailwinds and also protect OCI.\nTurning to Slide 11. Second quarter expenses, excluding notable items, decreased 1% year-on-year or increased 2% adjusted for currency translation. In response to the revenue environment, we have been proactively managing our expenses, including lowering our incentive compensation, in addition to carefully executing on our continued productivity savings efforts which generated approximately $60 million in year-on-year gross saves or approximately $150 million year-to-date. These savings enabled us to continue to self-fund a good portion of the 4% to 6% higher wage rates we're facing and the targeted investments in the business, including the Alpha product, technology infrastructure and broader automation.\nCompared to 2Q '21, Compensation employee benefits was down 3% as lower incentive compensation, the impact of currency translation were partially offset by salary merit increases associated with wages and inflationary pressure and higher contractor spend. Excluding currency translation, compensation and employee benefits would have been up 1%.\nInformation Systems and communications expenses was down 2%, primarily due to the episodic credits related to vendor pricing optimization and infrastructure rationalization. Occupancy was down 4% due largely to currency translation. And other expenses were up 18%, primarily reflecting higher recoverable client-related expenses, which are offset in fee revenue, professional fees and travel costs.\nOn a quarter-on-quarter basis, expenses were down due to seasonal expenses in the first quarter. Headcount increased quarter-on-quarter as we continue to in-source some strategic technology functions from vendors as well as support growth in Alpha. Overall, in light of the current macroeconomic environment, we have had pretty healthy pretax margin for the quarter at approximately 29%, excluding notable items, supported by active expense management and strong NII growth.\nMoving to Slide 12. On the right side of the slide, we show our capital highlights. We are quite pleased to report CET1 of 12.9%, up 100 basis points quarter-on-quarter. We're also happy with our performance under this year's CCAR with a calculated stress capital buffer well above the 2.5% minimum, resulting in a preliminary SCB at the floor. As a result, in June, we announced the planned 10% increase to our 3Q '22 quarterly common stock dividend, subject to Board approval, and it remains our intention to again begin our existing common share repurchase program in the fourth quarter in an amount reflecting market conditions at the time.\nTo the left of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. As you can see this quarter, even against the backdrop of a challenging operating environment, we drove stronger and higher capital levels. During the second quarter, we completed several of the previously announced RWA optimization actions across our trading, lending and investment portfolios, reducing RWA $12 billion quarter-on-quarter. We also shifted about $20 billion of AFS securities to HTM. As a result, we limited AOCI from the investment portfolio to under $500 million or 40 basis points of CET1, even with a roughly 60 basis point upward interest rate move across the 2- and 5-year part of the curve.\nYou'll see a larger AOCI move in the GAAP books, but much of that is ratio hedged and offset by the appreciating dollar effect on RWA with an offsetting goodwill and intangibles as well. Given that we have now significantly reduced the OCI risk to interest rate shocks by 75%, we are now comfortable operating somewhat below our standard target ranges for both CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios.\nTurning to Slide 13. We provide a summary of our second quarter results. Despite the continued volatile market environment, I am pleased with our quarterly performance, which demonstrates the strength of our business model. The current macroeconomic environment and persistent geopolitical uncertainties, notwithstanding, our strong growth in both net interest income and FX trading services enabled us to partially offset significant headwinds from both equity and fixed income markets highlighting the resiliency of our franchise. And our expenses remained well controlled, demonstrating the progress we are making in improving our operating model.\nNow turning to outlook. We would like to provide our current thinking regarding the third quarter. At a macro level, while market rate expectations have been volatile, our current interest rate outlook is broadly in line with the current forward which suggests the year-end [Fed] funds rate of 3.5%. We expect other major international central banks to continue raising rates, with the ECB expected to start increasing rates in third quarter. The current spot level of global equity markets would imply that average equity markets in 3Q would be down 7% to 8% quarter-on-quarter, and U.S. dollar appreciation to be about 1 percentage point of headwind to revenues and tailwind to expenses, which will be included in our guide.\nNow in terms of the third quarter of 2022 and on a stand-alone State Street basis. Given the implied declines in average global markets, we expect total fee revenue to be down about 2% on a sequential basis. And we expect both servicing fees and management fees to be down 4% quarter-on-quarter, driven by weaker market levels.\nTurning to NII. Following 1 of the strongest sequential increases in the NII for many years in 2Q, we expect to deliver further growth with NII expected to increase 5% to 9% quarter-on-quarter, driven by the tailwind from Central Bank rate hikes. This outlook includes our expectation for some initial deposit outflow and rotation in 3Q. And for the full year, on a stand-alone State Street basis, we expect NII to increase 24% to 27%, which is significantly better than our prior full year guide of 18% to 20%.\nNext, we expect total expenses, excluding notable items, to increase just under 1% quarter-on-quarter, driven by inflationary pressures on wages as we continue to target productivity initiatives and execute against our strategy with a deep focus on expense discipline. This focus enable us to drive positive total operating leverage, excluding notable items for the full year. Lastly, we would expect our 3Q tax rate to be approximately 20% for the quarter. And with that, let me turn the call back to Ron.\n\nRonald Philip O’Hanley\n\nChairman & CEO, State Street Corporation\n\nThanks, Eric. Operator, we can now open the call for questions."

Today's discussion is being broadcasted live on State Street's website at investors.statestreet.com. This conference call is also being recorded for replay. State Street's conference call is copyrighted and all rights are reserved. This call may not be recorded for rebroadcast or distribution in whole or in part without the express written authorization from State Street Corporation. The only authorized broadcast of this call will be housed on the State Street website. Now I would like to introduce Ilene Fiszel Bieler, Global Head of Investor Relations at State Street.\n\nIlene Fiszel Bieler\n\nExecutive VP & Global Head of IR, State Street Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Ron O’Hanley, will speak first. Then Eric Aboaf, our CFO, will take you through our first quarter 2022 earnings slide presentation, which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, investors.statestreet.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions.\nDuring the Q&A, please limit yourself to 2 questions and then requeue. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation will include results presented on a basis that excludes or adjusts one or more items from GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measure are available in the appendix to our slide presentation. In addition, today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those statements due to a variety of important factors, such as those factors referenced in our discussion today and in our SEC filings, including the risk factors in our Form 10-K. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change.\nNow let me turn it over to Ron.\n\nRonald Philip O’Hanley\n\nChairman, President & CEO, State Street Corporation\n\nThank you, Ilene, and good afternoon, everyone.\nEarlier today, we released our first quarter financial results. Before I review our results, I would like to briefly reflect on the operating environment in the first quarter which included both significant geopolitical events as well as notable macroeconomic developments and market movements.\nTurning to Slide 3 of our presentation. First, I would like to acknowledge the ongoing events in Europe following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In March, I traveled to crack out to visit some of State Street's approximately 6,400 employees in Poland. During my visit, I was moved by the selflessness of our colleagues in Poland, who continue to support displaced Ukrainian people in a number of important ways from opening their own homes and providing shelter to offering professional support, such as interpretation services. While State Street's direct exposure to Russia and Ukraine is very small, our teams are responding fluidly to the situation and delivering for our affected clients and other stakeholders with dedication and professionalism in what continues to be a stressful time. We have well-established and regularly tested business continuity plans designed to continue critical services for our clients and support for our people.\nThe first quarter also saw dramatic market movements, driven partially by the conflict in Ukraine, plus a broader set of macroeconomic forces. A tight labor market, rising energy prices, continued supply chain disruptions and the ongoing effects of significant COVID-related fiscal stimulus has contributed to inflation reaching multi-decade highs. As a result, in March, we saw the first interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve since late 2018, a substantial upward move in long-end interest rates as well as volatile currency and equity markets and a stronger U.S. dollar. Each of these factors in part shaped State Street's financial results in the first quarter, which I will now discuss before Eric takes you through the quarter in more detail.\nStarting with our financial performance. First quarter '22 EPS increased 15% year-over-year and was up 8%, excluding notable items, with earnings growth supported by both higher total fee revenue and stronger net interest income, leading to an improved year-over-year total revenue performance in the first quarter. Within fee revenue, our global markets franchise performed particularly well, driven by higher FX market volatility. And while State Street's revenue performance improved, we also remain highly focused on controlling the expense base. Notwithstanding continued new investments in our business and operational capabilities, first quarter total expenses were flat year-over-year and increased just 1%, excluding notable items, supported by ongoing productivity efforts and the stronger U.S. dollar.\nTaken together, we delivered both positive fee and total operating leverage as well as pretax margin expansion, good earnings growth and higher return on equity relative to the year ago period.\nTurning to our business momentum, which you can see across the middle of the slide, we recorded another quarter of solid new AUC/A asset servicing wins, which amounted to $302 billion in the first quarter, while AUC/A won but not yet installed amounted to $2.9 trillion at quarter end. Front office software and data also experienced good business momentum with annual recurring revenue for the first quarter, increasing 15% year-over-year to $235 million.\nAt Global Advisors, assets under management totaled $4.0 trillion at quarter end. Importantly, we saw another quarter of solid net inflows of $51 billion despite the volatile market environment in the first quarter. Our ETF business continued to perform well as we further focused on innovation and enhancing our ETF product offering.\nFor example, in January, Global Advisors launched 3 new ESG-oriented SPDR ETFs across small-cap international and emerging market equities, aimed at helping investors incorporate ESG considerations into their portfolios. In February, Global Advisors expanded its fixed income offering with the debut of the actively managed SPDR Blackstone high income ETF as we continue to innovate in the active ETF category, which accounted for 13% of U.S. net industry flows in the first quarter.\nAt State Street Digital, we announced a number of exciting developments. In March, we entered into a licensing agreement with Copper co, a provider of institutional digital asset custody and trading infrastructure. We intend to leverage Copper.co's technology to develop an institutional-grade digital custody offering where clients can store and settle their digital assets within a secure environment operated by State Street.\nTurning to capital. Our ratios remained healthy, although CET1 declined quarter-over-quarter, largely due to lower AOCI driven by the significant moves in interest rates. In the coming quarters, we remain focused on maintaining strong capital ratios.\nRegarding BBH, the regulatory review process for the proposed acquisition of the BBH Investor Services business has progressed more slowly than we anticipated. While many required approvals have been obtained, some required regulatory approvals, most notably approval to the relevant federal banking agencies, remain outstanding. We are evaluating potential modifications of the transaction that are intended to facilitate resolution of the bank regulatory review. We are working towards concluding regulatory reviews during the third quarter.\nWhile we are engaged in an ongoing dialogue with the relevant federal banking agencies, there can be no assurance of the timing or outcome of their regulatory review. Both parties, State Street and BBH, continue to be excited about the overall financial and strategic opportunities of combining BBH Investor Services with our business. We are continuing to work closely with the BBH team on pre-integration planning. This includes all the preparatory work in product, operations, technology as well as employee communication and client planning. We still expect the transaction to be accretive to earnings per share in the first quarter -- first year post closing.\nTo conclude my opening remarks, the first quarter was defined by both unexpected significant geopolitical events and notable macroeconomic and market developments, in the face of which State Street delivered an improved year-over-year financial performance and solid business momentum metrics while supporting our clients and colleagues. As we look ahead in this environment of heightened geopolitical uncertainty and market volatility, we remain laser-focused on delivering what is within our control, including excellence of strategic execution across the front, middle and back office, maintaining the recent improvement in our sales effectiveness and expense discipline all while continuing to provide valuable insights and promote better outcomes for the owners and managers of the world's capital.\nAnd with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail.\n\nEric Walter Aboaf\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, State Street Corporation\n\nThank you, Ron. I'll begin my review of our first quarter results on Slide 4.\nWe reported EPS of $1.57 or $1.59 excluding acquisition and restructuring costs. On the left panel of this slide, you can see we had yet another solid quarter of total fee revenue growth with strength in many of our businesses, notwithstanding the macroeconomic environment. At the same time, we held total expenses roughly flat year-on-year as we continue to both invest in the franchise and control expenses. As a result, we generated positive operating leverage of about 5 percentage points in the quarter and continue to improve our pretax margin year-over-year. All things considered, this was another strong quarterly performance, demonstrating the progress we are making as we continue to improve our operating model and drive growth.\nTurning to Slide 5. We saw period-end AUC/A increased by 4% year-on-year and decreased 4% quarter-on-quarter. The year-on-year change was largely driven by higher period end equity market levels, client flows and net new business growth. The quarter-on-quarter decline was largely the result of lower period end market levels in both equity and bond markets. Similarly, at Global Advisors, AUM increased 12% year-on-year, but declined 3% sequentially. Relative to the period a year ago, the increase was also driven by higher period end market levels coupled with strong net inflows across all 3 of our franchises, our ETF, institutional and Cash businesses.\nThe sequential decline was primarily driven by lower market levels, which was partially offset by strong net inflows of $51 billion in the quarter.\nTurning to Slide 6. Before I start, I would like to remind you that we are expanding our servicing fee revenue disclosures by disaggregating the line into back-office servicing fees and middle office services. With that, on the left side of the page, you'll see first quarter total servicing fees were flat year-on-year as higher client activity and flows average equity market levels and net new business were offset by normal pricing headwinds and a 2% currency translation headwind.\nWe continue to see good growth in both our insurance and official institutions client segments. Sequentially, total servicing fees were down 1%, primarily as a result of the seasonal pricing headwinds and lower average equity market levels partially offset by strong client activity. Within servicing fees, back office fees were flat both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by the factors I just described.\nMiddle office servicing was down 3% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on-quarter, primarily due to a partial transition from a legacy climb and lower professional services fees in the quarter. Notwithstanding the decline in the quarter, middle office is an important component of our Alpha proposition when it comes to both the front office when it connects to both the front and back office, and we expect to see good growth over the medium term. As evidenced by our uninstalled revenue backlog, which I'll talk more about in a moment.\nIn terms of business momentum, I'm pleased with how 2022 has started. As we report another quarter of solid new AUC/A wins of $302 billion, while AUC/A won 1 but yet to be installed, amounted to $2.9 trillion at quarter end. We continue to be happy with our pipeline, and I'm also particularly pleased to report that our first quarter wins span a good mix of strategically important premium and preferred clients.\nTurning to Slide 7. First quarter management fees were $520 million, up 5% year-on-year, primarily reflecting higher average equity market levels and strong ETF inflows. Management fees were down 2% quarter-on-quarter, largely due to equity market headwinds, partially offset by the tailwind of lower fee waivers and net inflows. Of note, our management fee performance for the quarter was supported by strong net inflows of $51 billion with positive inflows across our entire business franchise, Institutional, Cash and ETF.\nWith respect to money market fee waivers, the fee waiver impact to management fees for the quarter was roughly $10 million, down from about $20 million in the fourth quarter. I would note that following the 25 basis point Fed hike we saw in March of this year, we no longer expect money market fee waivers to be a headwind to management fees starting in April. As you can see on the bottom of the slide, our franchise remains well-positioned for growth. I'm particularly pleased that the strategic actions that we've previously taken in our long-term Institutional and ETF franchises are now helping to draw inflows even in the current volatile market environment.\nOn Slide 8, you can see that FX trading services had yet another strong quarter. Relative to the period a year ago, FX trading services revenue was up 4% year-on-year and 20% quarter-on-quarter. Both the year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter performance benefited from high FX market volatility while higher client FX volumes also contributed sequentially. Part of the revenue uptick has come from about $5 billion in higher risk-weighted assets we put to work this quarter, which demonstrates our balance sheet flexibility and which I'll come back to in a moment.\nOur securities finance revenues decreased 3% year-on-year, primarily driven by lower average agency assets alone, partially offset by solid new business wins in enhanced custody. Sequentially, revenues were down 6%, mainly reflecting lower average agency and enhanced custody balances due to the declining market levels and fewer specials. First quarter software and processing fees were up 26% year-on-year and 7% quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by higher front office software and data revenue associated with CRD, which I'll turn to shortly.\nFinally, other fee revenue of $29 million almost doubled year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, mainly reflecting fair value adjustments on equity investments.\nMoving to Slide 9. We've provided a breakdown of our consolidated front office software and data revenue on the left. We've broken down the revenue into software categories you have seen us use before, on-premise, professional services and software-enabled revenue. While CRD represents a large majority of this line, Alpha Data Services, Alpha Data Platform and (inaudible) revenues are also included here as well. As we've highlighted earlier, front office software revenue growth was particularly strong, up 44% year-on-year, primarily driven by on-premise renewals as well as the continued strong growth in software-enabled and professional services revenues.\nOn the right of the slide, we've provided some key growth metrics enabled by CRD and Alpha. As I mentioned earlier during today's presentation, you'll notice that we've broken out both the front office and middle office uninstalled revenue backlog, both of which are key components of our alpha proposition going forward. The front office backlog of $93 million is up 43% and the middle office backlog has more than tripled year-on-year to $63 million. The backlogs reflect expected annualized revenue, which can be compared to the $900 million of annual revenue base in 2020 across both the front and middle office businesses and is an indicator of future revenue growth once fully installed.\nThe Alpha pipeline remains promising despite the current geopolitical environment as clients realize the transformational benefits to their technology and operations infrastructure.\nTurning to Slide 10. As we see the start of another rate tightening cycle, first quarter NII increased 9% year-on-year, primarily driven by growth in our investment portfolio coupled with higher loan balances, which will also benefit us in future quarters. Relative to the fourth quarter, NII was up 5%, which came in better than expected due to higher long end rates. The sequential increase was largely driven by the improvement in both short and long end rates, which benefited our yields together with higher investment portfolio balances.\nOn the right of this slide, we show our average balance sheet during the first quarter, which has been relatively steady. Average assets were down 3% quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by seasonally lower 1Q deposit balances, which are down slightly from the seasonally high fourth quarter, but up year-on-year.\nTurning to Slide 11. First quarter expenses, excluding notable items, increased 1% year-on-year or 2% adjusted for currency translation. Productivity savings and targeted investments remain on try for the first quarter as we generated approximately $90 million in year-on-year growth savings and self-funded most of the strategic investments we've been making in the businesses, including technology infrastructure, broader automation, Alpha and State Street Digital. Compared to first quarter on a line item basis, excluding notable items, compensation and employee benefits was down 1% as lower head count in high-cost locations and the tailwind of currency translation was partially offset by higher seasonal expenses.\nInformation systems and communication expenses were up 5% due to continued investment in our technology infrastructure and resiliency. Occupancy was down 13% due to footprint optimization and lower maintenance costs and other expenses were up 9%, primarily reflecting higher professional fees.\nRelative to the fourth quarter, expenses were primarily impacted by higher seasonal expenses partially offset by productivity and footprint optimization savings. Headcount increased slightly quarter-on-quarter as we began to in-source some technology functions from vendors and growth in Alpha. Overall, we remain focused on delivering positive total and fee operating leverage and have demonstrated that this quarter amidst the current macroeconomic environment.\nMoving to Slide 12. We show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio decreased by 2.4 percentage points quarter-on-quarter to 11.9% due to both numerator and denominator effects. RWA increased by roughly $15 billion or 160 basis points of CET1 during the first quarter of 2022 compared to year-end, driven by 3 factors: a modest rebound from an unusually low fourth quarter; a strategic and temporary allocation of additional RWA capital to our markets businesses to generate the higher-than-expected first quarter revenues that we just discussed; and lastly, the RWA impact from the SA-CCR implementation that started on January 1 of this year, which we had planned for. At the same time, our capital base was also impacted by the substantial reduction in AOCI of about $1.3 billion, worth 110 basis points of CET1 relative to the fourth quarter as we saw a significant and historic quarter-on-quarter movement in long-end rates, particularly in the belly of the curve.\nFor instance, the rise in the 5-year U.S. treasury of roughly 120 basis points was the largest in the last 30 years. Taken together, the increase in RWA, coupled with a meaningful reduction in AOCI, partially offset by about 35 basis points of earnings accretion, net of dividends, drove the decrease in our CET1 ratio this quarter.\nIn contrast, first quarter Tier 1 leverage was down only slightly to 5.9%, mainly driven by the substantial decrease in AOCI, reflecting a significant change in the interest rate environment and a stable balance sheet.\nWhile capital return remains an explicit priority for us, and we recognize its important to our shareholders, given this $1.3 billion move in AOCI related to higher interest rates, we no longer expect to resume our share repurchase program in the second or third quarter as we operate with a conservative balance sheet philosophy.\nGiven the volatility in rates and the possibility of further significant increases, we are in the process of taking several actions to reduce AOCI risk by about half. This primarily includes shifting additional AFS securities to HTM as well as shortening the portfolio duration through swaps lowering extension risk and consciously allowing some portfolio runoff. Some of these latter actions can be reversed in the future when we choose to reinvest at higher rates.\nTurning to Slide 13. We provide a summary of our first quarter results. Despite the continued volatile market environment, I'm pleased with our financial performance, which demonstrates solid underlying trends within our businesses. Total fee revenue was up 4% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher management fees, FX trading, software and processing fees and other fee revenues. Expenses were well-controlled and were held roughly flat year-on-year, demonstrating the progress we are making in improving our operating model.\nNext, I would like to provide our current thinking regarding the second quarter outlook and some of our economic assumptions as we look out over the year. At a macro level, while we know that rate assumptions have been moving, our rate outlook is broadly in line with the current forwards, which suggests a year-end Fed funds rate of 2.5%. In terms of second quarter of 2022, we expect overall fee revenue to be down about 2% on a sequential basis, with servicing fees up about 1% and management fees up 2% to 3%, assuming equity markets remain flat to March 31 levels for 2Q and some downward normalization in FX trading revenues.\nIn terms of some of our newer fee revenue line items that we started to disclose this quarter, we would not expect to see a repeat of the size of on-premise renewals in the front office software line nor the positive equity investment markups in the other revenue line in 2Q.\nRegarding NIIs, we now expect 2Q NII to increase 7% to 9% sequentially, which will be driven by the expected Fed rate hikes, partially offset by the AOCI mitigating portfolio actions that I outlined earlier. For full year 2022, we now expect to see year-on-year NII growth of around 18% to 20% and depending on Fed actions and rate moves as well as the shape of our portfolio.\nTurning to expenses. We remain laser-focused on driving sustainable productivity improvements and controlling costs. We expect that second quarter expenses ex-notable items will be up around 2% to 3% on a sequential quarter basis, excluding notable items and seasonal compensation of expenses of $208 million.\nOn taxes, we expect that the 2Q '22 tax rate will be around 20%. We continue to expect to deliver on our goals of margin expansion and positive total and fee operating leverage for the year.\nAnd with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.\n\nRonald Philip O’Hanley\n\nChairman, President & CEO, State Street Corporation\n\nThank you, Eric. And operator, we can now open it up to questions."

Now let me turn it over to Ron.\n\nRonald Philip O’Hanley\n\nChairman, President & CEO, State Street Corporation\n\nThank you, Eileen, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we released our fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results. Before I review our results, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the dedication and strong performance of State Street employees during the past year. These team members remain central to the continued successful execution of our strategy as we hope to create better outcomes for the world's investors. Together, we accomplished a great deal in 2021 and including higher fee and total revenue generation, successful execution against both sales effectiveness and client retention goals that is driving growth and business momentum as well as announcing the proposed acquisition of Brown Brothers Harriman Investor Services. All of this would not have been possible without our employees' hard work, skill and commitment. Slide 3 of our presentation highlights the progress we made during 2021 with both of our business segments performing strongly as we advance towards achieving our medium-term financial targets. Within the investment servicing business, we enhanced our enhanced core strategy, combined with our strategic pivot to an enterprise outsourced solutions provider across the front, middle and back office manifested itself in stronger business momentum and revenue growth in 2021, which you can see along the top of the slide. As we successfully diversify and broaden our wins by region and client segment, we achieved record AUCA servicing wins of $3.5 trillion in 2021 and continue to deploy our enterprise outsourcing capabilities underpinned by our integrated front-to-back Alpha platform. We announced 9 additional Alpha wins in 2021, with 10 Alpha clients now live at year-end.\nWe also continued to enhance our product capabilities in 2021, launching Alpha for private markets as well as our new State Street Digital division. At Global Advisors, we executed well against our long-term strategy, which contributed to a number of records for that business in 2021, including revenues, assets under management and ETF inflows. Importantly, Global Advisors' full year pretax margin expanded by over 6 percentage points in 2021 to a record 32% and, deepening the value of our investment management franchise to State Street's results.\nOur Spyder business performed particularly well in 2021, gaining U.S. ETF flow market share, including low cost and active in addition to the record inflows I just mentioned. As I look back at 2021, I am particularly pleased with our client impact, improvement in our sales effectiveness and heightened focus on client satisfaction, service quality and retention across our businesses, together with a favorable equity market backdrop helped to drive a stronger revenue performance. Notably, full year servicing and management fees each reached our highest level on record in 2021, with total fee revenue increasing by 5% year-on-year and exceeding $10 billion for the first time.\nWhile we delivered a strong revenue performance in 2021, expense management remained a key focus for us, with company-wide productivity and engineering efforts achieving approximately $330 million of gross expense savings. Because of our strong revenue and sales performance in 2021 and the healthy pipeline in front of us, these efficiency savings allowed us to fund investments in our talent, technology and business in the fourth quarter to drive future growth. Even with this increased investment, total expenses were well contained relative to revenue growth, helping to drive a significant improvement in a number of key financial metrics that you can see on the bottom of the slide.\nDespite record low interest rates, and excluding notable items, we delivered meaningful full year pretax margin expansion, positive fee and total operating leverage and EPS growth in 2021, and we expect to do this again in 2022.\nTurning to Slide 4. I will briefly touch on our fourth quarter highlights before Eric takes you through the quarter in more detail. 4Q '21 EPS increased 28% year-over-year, or 18% excluding notable items. This strong year-over-year earnings growth was driven by solid total fee revenue growth, which more than offset interest rate headwinds on NII, leading to a good fourth quarter total revenue performance. We delivered 130 basis points of total positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter, excluding notable items. Importantly, we again expanded State Street pretax margin, which increased by more than 1 percentage point relative to the year ago period to 28% in the fourth quarter, excluding notable items.\nThe solid business momentum that we saw during 2021 continued into the fourth quarter, which you can see in the middle of this slide. AUCA increased to a record $43.7 trillion at quarter end, and new asset servicing wins amounted to $332 billion for the quarter. AUCA [won], but yet to be installed was $2.8 trillion at quarter end, while Charles River's annual recurring revenue in the fourth quarter increased 9% year-over-year to $244 million. At Global Advisors, assets under management totaled $4.1 trillion at quarter end, management fees increased to a record $530 million in the fourth quarter, benefiting from higher year-on-year average equity market levels and record inflows to our ETF franchise.\nTurning to our balance sheet at the bottom of the slide. Capital return remains a key part of our medium-term targets, and we recognize its importance to our shareholders. As you know, we suspended common share repurchases in Q3 in connection with our intended purchase of Brown Brothers Harriman Investor Services. We currently expect to reinstate common share repurchases during the second quarter of this year, in line with our previous expectations.\nTo conclude my opening remarks, I am pleased with the strategic operational and financial progress we demonstrated in 2021. We meaningfully improved our full year financial performance across a number of key metrics creating value for our shareholders and advancing us towards our medium-term financial targets.\nLooking ahead, I have 4 core strategic objectives for 2022, which are aimed at helping us achieve our vision for the organization and position the business for future success. First is to continue to grow revenue by executing on a number of key strategic priorities this year, including completion of our pivot to an enterprise outsourcer underpinned by our Alpha platform build-out, continuing to develop key product offerings and capabilities, particularly private markets, and further strengthening sales and client management capabilities and processes. Second, the successful integration of BBH Investor Services is a key priority. The proposed acquisition is a financially compelling use of capital. And once closed, it will strengthen our market leadership by creating the world's largest custodian, expand and deepen our international reach, further propel our Alpha strategy and add strong talent that will supplement our focus on client and service excellence and expertise. Third, as we did in 2021, we must continue to transform the way we work by driving increased productivity and efficiency throughout our organization.\nWe are developing and implementing a simplified, scalable, configurable end-to-end operating model. This more scalable model will allow us to deliver increased client quality, operational capacity, speed and resilience. Fourth, we must continue to build an even higher-performing organization. Our performance culture and improved employee experience will enable us to sustain a more diverse, engaged and empowered team with the experience, capabilities and desired behaviors required for further -- for future growth. These 4 goals reflect our relentless focus on performance and achieving our medium-term financial targets. I have confidence that we will be able to meet our strategic and client goals while also delivering positive fee and total operating leverage and expanding our pretax margin each year through our medium-term horizon, aided by the strong momentum we are seeing across our businesses.\nAnd with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail.\n\nEric Walter Aboaf\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, State Street Corporation\n\nThank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my review of our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results, let me briefly discuss some of the notable items we recognized in the quarter outlined on Slide 5. First, we recognized acquisition and restructuring costs, most of which were related to CRD and whose integration is now complete. Second, we recognized the net repositioning release of $3 million, which consists of occupancy cost of $29 million as we continue to reduce our footprint and a release of previously accrued compensation costs were $32 million as attrition picked up and we redeployed staff more effectively than anticipated. Third, we saw an opportunity to correct an imbalance in the competitiveness of our compensation program by accelerating expenses associated with certain deferred cash incentive awards. The impact of the acceleration increased expenses by $147 million in this quarter. This change will allow us to realign the mix of immediate versus deferred cash in our incentive compensation awards in future periods, which will make our pay practices competitive and enable us to better attract talent in an increasingly tight talent market. Our mix of deferred equity remains unchanged.\nFinally, you'll see that in the fourth quarter also benefited from a $58 million gain on sale of legacy LIBOR-based securities previously classified as held to maturity. This sale, and this quarter's higher-than-usual tax benefit, helped to offset some of the deferred compensation expense acceleration I just mentioned.\nTurning to Slide 6. I'll begin my review of both fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. As you can see on the top left of the slide, we finished the fourth quarter with strong revenue growth compared to 4Q '20. We 4Q '21 fee revenue increased 4%, primarily reflecting strong growth in servicing fees, management fees and CRD revenues, only partially offset by lower FX trading services. 4Q expenses were well managed, delivering positive total operating leverage, notwithstanding the significant 2021 NII headwind. 4Q pretax margin is up more than 1 percentage point year-on-year and ROE is up almost 2 percentage points.\nOn the right side of the slide, we show our full year 2021 revenue performance. As Ron highlighted earlier, 2021 was a record year for us for fee revenues. And despite historically low interest rates in 2021, I'm quite pleased that for the full year, we still delivered positive operating leverage of more than 1 percentage point improvement in pretax margin and EPS growth in the double digits.\nTurning to Slide 7, you'll see our Investment Services balance growth remained strong as we saw record AUCA at the end of the fourth quarter of $43.7 trillion, a year-on-year increase of 13%, largely driven by higher market levels, client flows and net new business. Quarter-on-quarter AUCA growth was muted as markets were pretty mixed. At Global Advisors, AUM at year-end increased 19% year-on-year and 7% quarter-on-quarter to a record $4.1 trillion. The year-on-year and sequential quarter increases were both primarily driven by higher market levels, coupled with net inflows. Of note, we reported strong net inflows during the fourth quarter of almost $80 billion. Our global Spider ETF business recorded the highest ever quarter driven by strong U.S. flows, pushing total net ETF inflows to $107 billion for the full year.\nTurning to Slide 8, you can see another quarter of good business momentum. Fourth quarter servicing fees increased 6% year-on-year. The increase reflects higher average equity market levels client activity inflows and positive net new business again. These items were only partially offset by normal pricing headwinds and about a full point of currency translation. On a sequential basis, I would remind you that while the S&P was up on average, international markets were down, so markets were relatively neutral. Servicing fees were down 1%, primarily due to client activity and adjustments and the impact on appreciating U.S. dollar, partially offset by another quarter of positive net new business.\nAUCA wins totaled a solid $332 billion in the fourth quarter, which gets us to a record $3.5 trillion new wins across client segments and regions for the full year, and our pipeline remains strong. At quarter end, AUCA won, but yet to be installed amounted to $2.8 trillion, with Alpha representing a nice proportion, which reflects the unique value proposition and our competitive strength as the only front-to-back offering from a single provider.\nTurning to Slide 9. Fourth quarter management fees reached a record $530 million, up 8% year-on-year and up 1% quarter-on-quarter, resulting in an investment management pretax margin of 34% for fourth quarter. The year-on-year management fee results primarily benefited from higher average equity market levels and strong ETF inflows. These year-on-year benefits were only partially offset by previously reported client asset reallocation and money market fee waivers of $20 million in the quarter. The quarter-on-quarter results were largely driven by a slight uptick in equity market daily averages. As you can see on the bottom right of the slide, our franchise remains well positioned as evidenced by both strong quarterly momentum and full year results.\nWe are particularly pleased with the actions that we've previously taken over the years in our long-term institutional and ETF franchises delivered growth over the course of 2021. Regarding management fee money market waivers, we currently expect that they will come in at approximately $5 million less in the first quarter of '22 based on an anticipated March Fed rate hike, which will be included in our 2022 outlook.\nTurning to Slide 10. Let me discuss the other important fee revenue lines in more detail. FX trading services was down 7% year-on-year, reflecting lower FX volatility and lower volumes in our standing instruction business. On a sequential basis, FX revenue increased 8%, primarily driven by higher FX volatility, partially offset by lower volumes.\nMoving to securities finance, quarter fees increased 16% year-on-year, mainly reflecting higher client securities loan balances and new business wins and enhanced custody. On a sequential basis, fees were down 4% quarter-on-quarter, mainly as a result of lower agency balances. Finally, fourth quarter software and processing fees were down 4% year-on-year and 2% lower quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by lower market-related adjustments, partially offset by continued growth in CRD, which I'll turn to next.\nMoving to Slide 11. I'd like to highlight our CRD and Alpha performance. We delivered strong stand-alone CRD results in the quarter, with year-on-year revenue growth of 13%. Full year stand-alone revenue growth was 11% year-on-year, which makes this the second year in a row where we grew the business revenue in the double-digit range. The more durable SaaS and professional services revenues continue to grow nicely as we onboarded and converted more clients to the cloud. SaaS clients now represent nearly half of our CRD client base.\nIn addition, we achieved record new bookings of [$62] million for full year 2021, with a healthy revenue backlog of $117 million at quarter end, demonstrating the continued business momentum as we head into 2022, supported by the State Street Alpha value proposition.\nTurning to Alpha on the bottom right of the slide. Full year 2021 was a business year as we announced 9 new Alpha mandates and nearly double the amount of wins we've achieved since inception. At year-end, we have 10 total live Alpha clients. We've also been busy enhancing our Alpha product offering this year. In addition to launching Alpha for private markets and our acquisition of Marcadus in the third quarter, we also went live with our Alpha data platform in the fourth quarter, which is our cloud-native platform, providing enterprise data management and access to all the data and analytics that our clients use to perform their daily end-to-end investment processes.\nTurning to Slide 12. Fourth quarter NII was down 3% year-on-year, mainly driven by the impact of a low 2021 interest rates on the investment portfolio yields, partially offset by another quarter of higher loan balances as well as growth in deposits and the investment portfolio. Relative to the third quarter, 4Q NII came in 1% lower, primarily as a result of the expected normalization of premium amortization. As you may recall, third quarter '21 included an episodic benefit worth about $7 million, which we previously noted wasn't expected to repeat in the fourth quarter. We do, however, see continued premium amortization slowing.\nWe, like many of you, are excited about the rise we've seen in long-end rates this year. However, short rates have been flat so far, and it's really the prospect of Fed action in the March time frame, which would have a significant benefit on NII. On the right of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during the fourth quarter. Average assets increased 4% quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by higher deposit levels. We consciously allowed average deposits to float up this past quarter, which we then expect to monetize in a period of rising interest rates.\nTurning to Slide 13. Fourth quarter expenses, excluding notable items, were up 1% year-on-year as we previously decided to increase incentive compensation to reflect strong year-on-year performance and pulled forward some investments in the business. At the end of the year, however, we also experienced some higher-than-expected episodic expenses. Medical costs were higher as we saw a ramp-up in year-end claims. We saw some elevated IT vendor costs, and we realized higher marketing spend associated with GA volumes. Compared to 4Q '20, on a line item basis, excluding notable items, Compensation and employee benefits was up 2%, driven by higher incentive compensation and medical costs, partially offset by lower headcount and salaries. Notably, our continued focus on digitization, automation as well as resource discipline have helped us reduce our headcount this year by 2 percentage points even as we onboarded larger deals and processed more transaction volume. Information systems and communications were up 11% due to continued investment in our technology infrastructure and resiliency as well as equipment expenses as we move more activities to the cloud. Transaction processing was down 7%, primarily driven by lower market data and brokerage costs. Occupancy was down 6%, reflecting the benefits from eliminating another 5,000 seats and achieving 115% occupancy rate, and other expenses were down, too.\nOverall, we're pleased this year with our continued ability to demonstrate productivity and expense discipline. Excluding the impact of currency translation with approximately 1 percentage point, full year 2021 expenses would have been flat. And in a year where fee revenue growth grew by mid-single digits, we meaningfully expanded our pretax margin and generated positive total and fee operating leverage despite a challenging interest rate environment.\nMoving to Slide 14. On the left side of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios followed by our capital trends on the right side of the slide. As you can see, we continue to navigate the operating environment with strong capital levels with or without the recent equity raise relative to our requirements. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio of 14.2% increased 0.7 percentage points quarter-on-quarter, primarily reflecting an outsized reduction of about $5 billion in RWA related to the impact of FX mark-to-markets and higher retained earnings. We expect RWAs to increase in the first quarter to more normalized business levels and the effects of expected regulatory changes coming in 2022, all of which has been previously considered in our capital guidance.\nOur Tier 1 leverage decreased slightly quarter-on-quarter, mainly driven by higher client deposits. And lastly, we returned a total of $209 million to shareholders in the form of fourth quarter dividends. As previously communicated, we expect our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios to be at the lower end of our target ranges for the first half of 2022, inclusive of the implementation of SACCR and the expected closing of the Brown Brothers Investment, Investor Services acquisition.\nTurning to Slide 15. You can see a summary of our 4Q '21 and full year 2021 results. I've already covered fourth quarter in detail, so let me say a few words about our full year results before jumping into our outlook for 2022.\nIn summary, we're pleased with our strong performance this year. Notwithstanding the challenging interest rate environment, we delivered a 5% increase in total fee revenue for the year, with servicing and management fees reaching our highest levels on record. Our expenses for the full year remained well controlled and despite higher revenue-related costs and investments in our business and people. As a result, even in last year's low rate environment, we delivered positive operating leverage, and we were able to drive pretax margin and ROE closer to our recently enhanced medium-term targets.\nAnd with that, I'll turn to outlook. On Slide 16, let me cover our full year 2022 outlook as well as provide some thoughts on the first quarter, both of which do not yet include the previously announced acquisition of the Brown Brothers Investment Services. We continue to target a closing by the end of the first quarter, although the timing could fall in the second quarter. We are in the process of obtaining the required regulatory approvals, some of which have already been secured. The process is proceeding at a slower pace than anticipated with many regulators around the world addressing the high volume of global M&A activity. That said, given the current higher equity market step off and new interest rate forward, we now expect about 25% year-on-year EBIT growth for the acquired business for each quarter in the first year post closing instead of just 15% year-on-year EBIT growth in our original acquisition deal modeling.\nNow, as I usually do, let me first share some assumptions underlying our current views for the full year. At a macro level, our rate outlook largely aligns to the current forward curve and assumes we see 3 U.S. rate hikes in 2022, but the first hike occurring in March. We are also assuming around 5 percentage point to point growth for equity markets in 2022 as well as further normalized FX market volatility, which influences our trading businesses. As for currency translation, we expect the U.S. dollar will be stronger for the year, which will be a headwind to revenues, but mostly offset as a benefit to expenses.\nSo beginning with revenue. For the full year, we currently expect that fee revenue will be up 3% to 4%, with servicing fees growing 2% to 3%, both include about 1 point of currency translation headwind for 2022. Regarding the first quarter of 2022, we expect fee revenue to be up 2% to 3% year-over-year given equity market expectations and continued business momentum, with servicing fees expected to be up 1% to 2% and management fees expected to be up 8% to 9%. For full year NII, depending on the timing of the projected rate hikes, we expect 2022 NII to be up 10% to 12% on a year-on-year basis. Regarding first quarter of 2022, we expect NII to be up 3% to 4% year-over-year and still flattish sequentially.\nNow turning to expenses. As you can see in the walk, we expect expenses ex-notables will be up just 1.5% to 2% on a nominal basis in 2022 as we continue to invest in the business and our people while driving both positive total and fee operating leverage. We currently assume that this includes a 1 percentage point benefit to expenses due to the stronger U.S. dollar.\nYou can also see on the walk that for full year '22, we expect another year of gross saves of approximately 3 to 4 percentage points, which will help fund variable costs and ongoing business investments in areas like Alpha, digital, tech infrastructure and automation. Regarding the first quarter of '22, we expect year-on-year expense growth to be largely in line with the full year guide and includes the seasonal compensation expenses, which occur in the first quarter. All in all, our plan is to invest behind the revenues and deliver both positive total and positive fee operating leverage.\nFinally, we estimate our effective tax rate to be in the 17% to 19% range for 2022. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.\n\nRonald Philip O’Hanley\n\nChairman, President & CEO, State Street Corporation\n\nThanks, Eric. Operator, we can now open the call for questions."

This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and part -- for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.\n\nStacey Jill Brodbar\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Verisk Analytics, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our third quarter 2025 financial results.\nOn the call today are Lee Shavel, Verisk's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Elizabeth Mann, Chief Financial Officer and Interim Head of Claims.\nThe earnings release referenced on this call as well as our traditional quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in.\nAs set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance, including those related to our financial guidance and our recently announced pending acquisition of AccuLynx. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings.\nA reconciliation of reported and historic non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call is provided in our 8-K and today's earnings presentation posted on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. However, we are not able to provide a reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable expected GAAP results because of the unreasonable effort and high unpredictability of estimating certain items that are excluded from projected non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, including for example, tax consequences, acquisition-related costs, gains and losses from dispositions and other nonrecurring expenses, the effect of which may be significant.\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee Shavel.\n\nLee M. Shavel\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThanks, Stacey. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our third quarter earnings call. Today, I will provide broad context on the results and allow Elizabeth to go into more detail on the financial review. I will also offer some relevant perspective from recent C-suite meetings with our largest clients. Finally, with AI being a focus for investors in our sector, I will update you on the AI enhancements that we've delivered and are developing for our clients and what we believe AI represents for the industry and for us in the coming years based on extensive engagement with our clients on the topic and ground truth experience from our active AI-enhanced solutions.\nNow let's turn to the third quarter results. Verisk delivered organic constant currency revenue growth of 5.5% driven by strong subscription revenue growth of 8.7%. This growth compounded on top of the solid growth delivered last year. In the quarter, we experienced an exceptionally low level of severe weather resulting in a decline in claims assignments across our Xactware system. This and other factors drove transactional revenue declines of 8.8% on an OCC basis.\nDespite the transactional revenue impact, we delivered 8.8% OCC adjusted EBITDA growth with expanded EBITDA margin of 55.8%. Looking at our year-to-date performance, we delivered 7.1% OCC revenue growth, 9.4% OCC adjusted EBITDA growth and a 56.3% margin, which reflects the underlying strength and resilience of our business and is fully consistent with our organic guidance for the year. Our strong subscription growth reflects continued strategic engagement with our clients and a much improved dialogue on the value that we are delivering and how we can tailor our solutions to their individual needs.\nAs an example, last month, I attended with several of my direct reports, the CIAB Insurance Leadership Forum in Colorado and hosted 40 strategic client meetings. What we heard consistently from our clients was, one, that they need more data from us to better integrate across their businesses and functions, and they've demonstrated in new solutions like excess and surplus that they're willing to increase their data contributions. Two, a high interest in the AI enhancements that we've developed using our data sets where they can get immediate benefit without heavy investment. And three, strong support for the efficiency driving multi-partner integrations that we provide in our property estimating solutions and specialty business and that we are developing an antifraud and extreme event solutions.\nIt is for this reason that we remain committed to investing in integrations to deliver value to clients. I'd also highlight three meetings just in the past month with clients where we have not had previous C-suite engagement. These discussions included comprehensive reviews of where we support these clients across underwriting, risk and claims but most importantly, our discussion centered around future planning on how we can integrate and augment that support to align with our operating, data, AI and financial objectives, elevating and adapting to how our clients are evolving in this ever-changing environment. In every meeting, the conclusion is that there is more opportunity for us to work together.\nConcretely, our elevated strategic engagement is leading to more pipeline opportunities. And in fact, 2025 is on track to be our strongest sales year yet with sales teams across Verisk exceeding an ambitious quota for the second straight year.\nDigging into our AI strategy further and given the heightened focus on the topic from investors and analysts, I believe it's important to share a few perspectives on what we are doing and what we've been experiencing. First, AI is top of mind for our clients as well. They've been exploring the technology and its potential and have turned to Verisk as an active partner in helping them evaluate use cases and to support their operational objectives with our data sets and content. Through our strategic engagement, our Chief Information Officer and Chief Global Data Officer, have participated in meetings to help our clients on key issues, including data architecture, vendor management and governance.\nAdditionally, many of our clients want to understand Verisk's AI investment and deployment strategy so that they can align and prioritize their own investment. This underscores the connection we have to the industry and its support for the fundamental and central utility function we provide by developing and deploying a technology that the industry can benefit from at a much lower cost of ownership and investment.\nSecond, and proceeding from the first, our deployed AI applications have been enthusiastically embraced by our clients. As an example, in Xactexpert where we utilize AI to advise claims professionals in estimate review. We now have over 40 clients using the solution, including six of the top 10 carriers and year-to-date, sales performance is now more than double original quotas. And Xactexpert can now be further enhanced by XactAI, adding Gen AI capabilities like photo tagging through a new solution, which launched just this month and already has 273 users, including a top 10 carrier.\nOn the development front, we've had very positive reactions to our AI query tools for claims search and SavvyR regulators, with about half of our 30 SavvyR states signed on, allowing our clients to more easily interrogate our data through natural language interfaces. Third, it's all about the data. AI relies on high-quality and usable data to train the models, and I can say with confidence that Verisk's content, which includes data, language, analytics and models is built upon proprietary data that is not publicly available and is structured, cleansed, vetted and designed by us to take advantage of the power of AI.\nAdditionally, our clients continue to reinforce the value of our content and the importance of integrating it into their workflows. Our investments in Core Lines Reimagine and the success we've had as demonstrated by our subscription growth is the clearest evidence that our curated data sets remain the fuel that powers insurance analytics. While it is still early, we are experiencing increased usage of our content as the introduction of AI tools in certain of our solutions is making it easier for our clients to interact with driving value for our clients.\nFurther, we continue to grow the number of contributors to our existing data sets, onboarding 10 new statistical data contributors so far in 2025. And Verisk's clients are also actively supporting our new initiatives to build greenfield contributory data sets across antifraud and for the excess and surplus lines. Specifically, our new digital media forensics currently has 106 contributors, including 5 of the top 10 carriers, representing over 600 million digital images.\nWith E&S, insurers are responding positively to our initiative to collect data for this growing market. We began this initiative less than a year ago and have already received commitments and actual data from several companies representing billions of dollars of premium. Our ability to provide analytics on their data and benchmark this data to the admitted market, leveraging our statistical data is also driving additional interest in contribution.\nFourth, it's not just about AI. While AI is a powerful tool making the insurance industry better, requires human expertise and collaboration. We are connecting ecosystems across the industry that bring material efficiencies and improved data sets to drive better results. Our white space and Xactware platforms are compelling models of the value we can deliver to clients across the industry.\nFifth, AI is enhancing our own internal processes and product development as we leverage advanced technologies to better ingest and interrogate data to advance our models and analytics. In our Xtreme Events business, we are using the power of AI to simulate globally correlated atmospheric perils with a level of realism and reliability that traditional approaches cannot achieve. Specifically, we are using deep learning AI models to correct biases in raw output of a climate model, ensuring that the frequency and intensity of extreme events align with observed reality.\nIn addition, we're also using generative AI techniques to introduce details that capture the local impact of these large events. In short, our clients are more interested in working with us on AI because of our experience and the economic utility of using our solutions. Our proprietary data is more valuable with increasing AI utilization because of its breadth and usability. Our clients are contributing more data and actively supporting the development of new contributory data sets demonstrating their commitment to Verisk's partnership. Our growth opportunities are expanding by the rapid adoption of solutions like Xactexpert and the robust pipelines we have across many of our new inventions.\nWe have been investing in these solutions and enhancements for several years while maintaining our strong margin profile. And finally, we believe our long-term growth and margin model is enhanced by the integration of AI into our own processes and across the industry overall. Beneath the near-term light weather impacts reflected in our current quarter's results is clear and unmistakable evidence that our strategic engagement initiatives, enhanced go-to-market strategy and product invention, including AI, are enhancing the value of our data and expanding our growth opportunities.\nBefore I turn the call over to Elizabeth, let me share recent developments on the AccuLynx transaction. FTC approval of the transaction has been delayed. We have received a second request for information, and we continue to have productive engagement with the FTC, working within the conditions of the federal government shutdown. Consequently, we do not expect to realize any material benefit from the pending transaction in 2025 and have removed any operating results from our 2025 guidance. We are proactively engaged with the FTC and continue to believe in the strategic and financial merits of the transaction.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Elizabeth for the financial review.\n\nElizabeth D. Mann\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Lee, and good morning to everyone on the call. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, third quarter revenue was $768 million, up 5.9% versus the prior year, reflecting growth across both underwriting and claims. Net income was $226 million, a 2.5% increase versus the prior year while diluted GAAP earnings per share were $1.61, up 5% versus the prior year. The increase in diluted GAAP EPS was driven by sales growth, operating leverage and a lower average share count.\nMoving to our organic constant currency results. Adjusted for nonoperating items, as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, our operating results demonstrated balanced growth across the business. In the third quarter, OCC revenues grew 5.5% with growth of 5.8% in underwriting and 5% in claims. We did experience two temporary factors that impacted growth in the quarter. Namely, first, a historically low level of weather activity and therefore, claims volumes that were significantly lower than our estimate of a typical year. And two, the reduction in a government contract, which we had spoken to you about previously.\nTogether, those factors combined for an impact of approximately 1% to overall Verisk OCC revenue growth in the quarter. We view these factors as temporary and continue to have confidence in our ability to deliver results in line with our long-term target for this year for 2026 and beyond.\nThe clearest demonstration of the health of our business is the growth of our subscription revenues. Subscription revenues, which comprised 84% of our total revenue in the quarter, grew 8.7% on an OCC basis, compounding on the 9.1% OCC growth we delivered in the prior year quarter and consistent with growth levels in the first half of the year. This quarter's growth was broad-based across most of our subscription-based solutions, with outperformance across our largest businesses.\nWithin form tools and loss costs, we continue to execute on our innovation agenda through the Reimagine program. which is driving solid price realization in the renewal process across all client tiers. In the third quarter, we launched 3 new modules as the latest demonstration of the increased value we're delivering to clients and the industry. For example, our new indication center delivers key rating elements to our clients 2 months sooner than our traditional loss cost review process. This allows insurers to begin responsive rate actions sooner and more confidently when incorporating Verisk data into their pricing and underwriting management.\nWe remain on track to deliver all 20 planned Reimagine releases in 2025, reinforcing our commitment to innovation and execution discipline. We are also driving double-digit subscription growth in Extreme Event Solutions through the expansion of contracts with existing clients, solid renewals and the addition of new logos globally, including competitive wins. We are seeing strong appetite from clients to subscribe and expand their hosted relationship with Verisk in preparation for the transition to our fully SaaS-based Verisk Synergy Studio, creating a more durable and more deeply aligned client partnership.\nWithin our antifraud business, we have continued to achieve strong price realization through enhancement of the solution and the continuation of our ecosystem strategy. In addition, we have driven outsized growth with noncarrier clients like third-party administrators and healthcare subrogation companies as we are focused on building and expanding solutions specifically geared for their use cases.\nAdditionally, we are seeing meaningful interest in our advanced anti-fraud inventions, including claims coverage identifier and digital media forensics and have a rich pipeline of future opportunities. And finally, we delivered double-digit subscription growth across our Specialty Business Solutions and Life Solutions businesses, where we are driving new sales and expanding relationships with existing clients.\nOur transactional revenues, which comprised 16% of total revenues, declined 8.8% on an OCC basis. The principal factor for the transactional revenue decline with lower transactional volumes in our Property Estimating Solutions business, resulting from historically low levels of weather activity. Weather events in the third quarter as tracked by Noah, declined 18% versus last year and were 31% below the 5-year average. According to Verisk's own PCS data, third quarter weather event frequency and severity declined 30% and 78%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. In fact, this third quarter marks the lowest level of storm events in the U.S. since 2017, and 2025 is on track to be the first year since 2015 without a named U.S. hurricane to make landfall so far.\nThis has translated into lower level of transactional claims assignment and fewer subscription overages across our Property Estimating Solutions business. This quarter of lighter weather activity has validated our strategy to increase the level of subscription volume in our PES business as it has reduced the weather-related variability for both us and our clients.\nAs discussed last quarter, we continue to see softness in our Personal Lines Auto business. relating to competitive pressures. In addition, we are experiencing tougher comparisons on certain nonrate action deals as carriers have been more successful achieving greater rate adequacy.\nFinally, transactional revenue growth was negatively impacted by ongoing conversion to subscriptions across our business.\nAs we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we remind you that we do have another very tough weather comparison as last year, we saw an uplift in revenue from Hurricane Helene and Milton.\nMoving to our adjusted EBITDA results, OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 8.8% in the quarter, while total adjusted EBITDA margin, which include both organic and inorganic results, were 55.8%, up 60 basis points from the prior year. This level of margin expansion reflects our ongoing cost discipline, including the benefits of our Global Talent Optimization as well as the core leverage from sales growth. It also reflects continued investment in our business across many projects, including Core Lines Reimagine, Verisk Synergy Studio and in new and advanced technologies, including AI.\nOver the past 5 years, we have delivered over 500 basis points of margin expansion, while self-funding investments in some large-scale transformative technology and product upgrades, including our cloud migration, Core Lines Reimagine, the ERP implementation and artificial intelligence. Specific to AI, we continue to develop inventions across our business units that include AI and as we mentioned, we have many solutions commercially available today. And we have confidence that like our other tech transformation, we will be able to self-fund this investment while also continuing to deliver margin expansion in line with our target.\nMoving down the income statement. Net interest expense was $42 million in the third quarter compared to $32 million in the same period last year, due to higher debt balances and higher interest rates, offset in part by higher interest income on elevated cash balances. During the third quarter, we acted opportunistically to take advantage of favorable bond market pricing and issued $1.5 billion in senior notes to finance the announced acquisition of AccuLynx. We are earning yields on those cash proceeds, which significantly reduced the net interest expense.\nOur reported effective tax rate was 25.3% compared to 22.9% in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year increase was driven by a lower level of employee stock option exercise activity in the current year and a onetime tax benefit in the prior year period. We continue to believe that our tax rate will fall in the 23% to 25% range for the full year.\nAdjusted net income increased 1% to $241 million, and diluted adjusted EPS increased 3% to $1.72 for the quarter. The increase was driven by revenue growth, margin expansion and a lower average share count. This was partially offset by higher depreciation and interest expenses and a higher tax rate.\nOn a reported basis, net cash from operating activities increased 36% to $404 million, while free cash flow rose 40% to $336 million. This increase was driven primarily by an improvement in the timing of collections as well as lower cash taxes paid due to changes in the tax code associated with the treatment of research and development costs.\nWe remain committed to returning capital to shareholders. During the third quarter, we paid a cash dividend of $0.45 per share, a 15% increase from the prior year. Additionally, we repurchased $100 million of common stock. As of September 30, we had $1.2 billion in capacity under our share repurchase authorization.\nTurning to guidance. Though it is not our typical practice to update guidance following 3 quarters, we want to provide more transparency given the recent delay in approval for the AccuLynx transaction. We do not expect to realize any material financial benefit from the pending transaction in 2025 and have therefore removed any operating results from our 2025 guidance.\nMore specifically, we expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $3.05 billion to $3.08 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.69 billion to $1.72 billion and adjusted EBITDA margins to remain in the 55% to 55.8% range. We now expect net interest expense to be in the range of $165 million to $185 million, reflecting the impact of cash earned on the proceeds from the bond transaction.\nFrom a tax perspective, we are still expecting to be in the range of 23% to 25%.\nTaken all together, we continue to expect diluted adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.80 to $7. A complete listing of all guidance measures can be found in the earnings slide deck, which has been posted to the Investors section of our website, verisk.com.\nAnd now I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments.\n\nLee M. Shavel\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThanks, Elizabeth. We are excited about the growth opportunities ahead and have confidence in delivering on our long-term strategy and driving value creation for shareholders. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to 1 question.\nWith that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.\n\nStacey Jill Brodbar\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Verisk Analytics, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our second quarter 2025 financial results. On the call today are Lee Shavel, Verisk's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Elizabeth Mann, Chief Financial Officer. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as our traditional quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com.\nThe earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC.

Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Reconciliation of reported and historic non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call is provided in our 8-K and today's earnings presentation posted on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com.\nHowever, we are not able to provide a reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable expected GAAP results because of the unreasonable effort and high unpredictability of estimating certain items that are excluded from projected non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, including, for example, tax consequences, acquisition-related costs, gains and losses from dispositions and other nonrecurring expenses, the effects of which may be significant. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee Shavel.\n\nLee M. Shavel\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThank you, Stacy. Good day, everyone, and welcome to today's call. I'm pleased to share that our operating momentum continued in the second quarter, as we delivered another strong quarter, which was generally in line with our expectations.\nOrganic constant currency revenue growth of 7.9% was broad-based across most of our businesses. Our focus on cost discipline delivered healthy margin expansion, resulting in organic constant currency, adjusted EBITDA growth of 9.7%. Elizabeth will provide much more detail in our financial review but these results demonstrate the compounding power of our subscription-based business model, driven by the value we create for our clients.\nI'm confident that this year is on track to be another solid year for Verisk, and we are raising our revenue and adjusted EBITDA outlook for the full year 2025 to reflect the strong first half and the impact of M&A. Almost 3 years ago, we unveiled the new Verisk, an insurance-focused predictable growth company. We implemented structural and cultural changes to become more integrated and we focused on elevating the strategic dialogue with our clients.\nThe net result has been strong financial and operational growth. We also evolved our business from industry utility to data analytics specialists to integrated technology network, serving the global insurance industry by focusing on innovation and advanced technologies. And we maintained our capital allocation discipline, investing behind our highest return on capital opportunities while returning excess capital to shareholders.\nThis morning, we announced that we have signed a definitive agreement to acquire AccuLynx for $2.35 billion. AccuLynx is the leading SaaS platform providing end-to-end business management workflow for the residential restoration and repair industry with expertise in roofing.\nAccuLynx is a natural fit and extension of the network capabilities we provide to insurance carriers and contractors into our property estimating solutions business. AccuLynx's integrated service software platform sits at the center of the roofing contractors workflow, addressing each critical stage, including lead generation, sales and customer relationship management, virtual measurements, materials ordering, labor sourcing, payment processing and job management.\nMost of the company's 5,000-plus customers perform insurance-driven repairs and restoration and roofs are one of the largest and most expensive home components, making up more than 25% of all residential claim value. AccuLynx is a very strong business with a compelling financial profile marked by revenue growth and EBITDA margins that are accretive to Verisk overall and a high mix of recurring revenues.\nBut more importantly, AccuLynx is highly additive to our Property estimating solutions business due to a high degree of customer overlap and complementary functionality. We see strong incremental value creation from combining AccuLynx with Verisk property estimating solutions, which will in turn improve, extend and strengthen our network enhancing the value of the ecosystem for all participants.\nSpecifically, more seamless integration will remove manual work and improve information flow between carriers and contractors delivering cost and time savings for both constituencies while property owners can benefit from quicker repairs due to workflow efficiency and cost savings driven by more accurate pricing data. On the data front, AccuLynx differentiated and rich data sets focused on roofing materials and labor will improve the analytics we provide to insurers and contractors.\nThrough our elevated strategic dialogue, we hear frequent requests for enhancements to our roofing materials information and benchmarking reports. We see synergistic cross-sell and upsell opportunities as we can advance the adoption of the AccuLynx platform and its many modules to existing Verisk customers.\nAdditionally, we are excited about the opportunity for expanded data monetization of existing Verisk products across the AccuLynx client base. We previously announced the strategic acquisition of Assurance Bay, a leading provider of producer licensing, onboarding and compliance solutions for the life and annuity industry.\nAssurance Bay will become part of Verisk Life Solutions and extends our presence into the independent agent and broader distribution channel. The combination of Assurance Bay and Verisk's Fast business will help to streamline and improve the process of insurance distribution and will provide the life and annuity ecosystem with solutions that enhance workflows between carriers, general agencies, insurance agents and consumers.\nThe initial reaction to the announcement has been very positive, clients, prospects and industry analysts have commented that they see the value in an integrated solution as voiced by one of them that this was \"a perfect fit for the suite. This feedback further affirms our ongoing commitment to delivering innovative, integrated solutions that address the evolving needs of the life and annuity sector.\nTogether, the acquisitions of AccuLynx Insurance Bay are a meaningful demonstration of our capital allocation discipline, which includes our fundamental value-creating M&A philosophy. This approach is focused on 3 pillars: namely: one, acquiring solid operating businesses, consistent with our insurance-focused strategy with sustainable growth and operating leverage; two, identifying clear opportunities to improve and enhance the value of the combined entities, and three, to acquire businesses at a price that generates an attractive return on capital.\nOver the past 3 years, we have demonstrated patience, selectivity and price discipline, and we are excited to welcome the AccuLynx Assurance Bay teams risk. We are energized about working together to enhance the network effect of these businesses and maximize value for the property claims and life insurance ecosystems. Across Verisk, we have been focused on driving innovation and leaning in on our use of generative AI, embedding new features in some of our core products to deliver greater insights and efficiencies for our clients.\nIn particular, as part of our Core Lines reimagined initiative, we launched premium audit Advisory Service AI, a first-to-market AI chatbot. This invention enables insurers to research classifications and rules to ensure risks are accurately classified at underwriting with information achievable over 95% faster than our legacy solutions.\nClient adoption of the solution has been strong, and we are experiencing increases in time spent by clients as they are finding value in the tool. Additionally, within Mode start, our farms management platform -- the Mode start compare with AI enables our customers to compare across ISO forms to quickly identify changes we have made to coverage language to reflect up-to-date market and compliance requirements.\nThis solution is saving our customers time and eliminating complexity in managing forms changes. And finally, we are in the early stages of a commercial introduction of underwriting assistant, our AI-powered solution that produces transformative underwriting results with greater efficiency and data accuracy, enabling users to maximize their productivity and effectiveness.\nOne of the key features of underwriting assistant is its ability to automate the creation of structured commercial property submissions, significantly reducing the time to decision transforming what used to take days or weeks into just minutes. This not only speeds up the process, but also replaces lower-value data capture activities allowing underwriters who are leveraging the tool to focus on more strategic tasks.\nOur solution also enhances data accuracy through data augmentation by leveraging our extensive commercial property data sets to ensure that underwriters have the most reliable and complete data, contributing to more profitable underwriting decisions. And finally, our interactive chatbot provides real-time expert advice to underwriters and agents, which leverages our deep domain expertise and proprietary data. By providing timely pumps and insights, we help ensure that underwriting decisions are both more informed and profitable. We are excited about this new groundbreaking innovation and the opportunity to help our insurance partners include the most advanced technologies in their core processes.\nBefore we close, I want to announce that Maroun Mourad is stepping down from his role at Verisk to assume an executive position at another public company. We wish Maroun well and thank him for his decade of service to Verisk. With Maroun's departure, Elizabeth Mann will take on the added responsibility of interim President, Claims Solutions, we are confident in the bench strength we have in place within claims and have commenced a search for a permanent replacement. Now let me turn the call over to Elizabeth for the financial review.\n\nElizabeth D. Mann\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Lee, and good morning to everyone on the call. Today, I plan to provide details on 3 topics: First, I will cover our financial results for the second quarter 2025. Second, I will address the financial impact of our recently announced acquisitions, Assurance Bay and AccuLynx. And third, I will provide details on our updated outlook for 2025.\nTurning to earnings. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, Second quarter revenue was $773 million, up 7.8% versus the prior year, reflecting strong growth across both underwriting and claims. Net income was $253 million, an 18% decrease versus the prior year, while diluted GAAP earnings per share were $1.81, down 16% versus the prior year.\nThe decline in GAAP net income and EPS are primarily the result of a cumulative $102 million net gain in the prior year period related to previously disposed businesses and the early extinguishment of debt. Moving to our organic constant currency results adjusted for nonoperating items, as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, our operating results demonstrated sustained broad-based growth across the business.\nIn the second quarter, OCC revenues grew 7.9% with balanced growth of 7.7% in underwriting and 8.3% in claims. Our subscription revenues, which comprised 82% of our total revenue in the quarter, grew 9.3% on an OCC basis. This was driven by strong growth across our largest businesses in underwriting and claims, including forms, rules and loss costs, extreme event solutions and anti-fraud. All 3 of these businesses delivered strong price realization and expanded renewals as we continue to innovate and improve our core offerings.\nAdditionally, we saw solid double-digit growth in Specialty Business Solutions as we continue to see strong acceptance and usage across our whitespace platform. As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we remind you that we will be comparing against strong elevated double-digit subscription growth in 2024 that was helped by the conversion of certain contracts to subscription. Additionally, we will be realizing the impact related to federal government spending cuts that we expect to start in the third quarter though as we have previously communicated, the federal government contracts represent less than 1% of our total revenue.\nOur transactional revenues, which comprised 18% of total revenue, returned to growth in the quarter, up a modest 1.8% on an OCC basis. This growth was a function of strength in our international businesses, including properties and life, health and travel. Additionally, we delivered strong revenue growth in our Extreme Events business from securitization as issuance volumes were at record levels. This market continues to attract new capital and market participants turn to Verisk's models as the trusted source on pricing risk.\nThis growth was offset by softness in our auto business related to tough comparison from last year, customer mix and some competitive pressures, which we expect to persist. Additionally, we are experiencing some weakness in our sustainability business owing to market conditions. Moving to our adjusted EBITDA results. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 9.7% during the quarter, while total adjusted EBITDA margins, which include both organic and inorganic results, were 57.6% up 220 basis points from the prior year.\nOur reported margins benefited from a foreign exchange translation impact, which contributed 120 basis points in the quarter. This FX benefit was not contemplated in our guidance as we do not forecast or hedge foreign currency. Adjusting for this nonoperational benefit, we still delivered healthy margin expansion highlighting the effect of strong revenue growth, ongoing cost discipline and our global talent optimization initiative.\nAs we have shared in the past, we find it useful to look at our margins on a trailing 12-month basis to adjust for seasonality. LTM margins came in at 55.6% in the period. As we look to the second half of the year, we want to remind you that we did have some margin variability in the third and fourth quarter of 2024 associated with foreign currency translation.\nMoving down the income statement. Net interest expense was $36 million in the second quarter compared to $29 million in the same period last year due to higher debt balances and higher interest rates. During the second quarter, we retired $500 million of 4% notes that were due in June 2025. Our reported effective tax rate was 22.7% compared to 21.7% in the prior year.\nThe year-over-year increase was driven by a onetime tax benefit in the prior year period. Adjusted net income increased 6.3% to $264 million and diluted adjusted EPS increased 8% to $1.88 for the quarter. The increase was driven by strong revenue growth, margin expansion and a lower average share count. This was partially offset by higher depreciation and interest expenses and a higher tax rate.\nOn a reported basis, net cash from operating activities increased 15.5% to $245 million, while free cash flow rose 22.6% to $189 million. This increase was driven primarily by the timing of certain cash collections. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders.\nDuring the second quarter, we paid a cash dividend of $0.45 per share, a 15% increase from the prior year. Additionally, we completed a $100 million accelerated share repurchase program. As of June 30, we had $1.3 billion in capacity under our share repurchase authorization.\nTurning to our acquisitions. We are excited about the growth opportunities ahead with the acquisition of Sherman Bay and AccuLynx upon closing. These businesses both have strong financial characteristics, marked by robust revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth and healthy margins that will enhance Verisk's overall growth profile.\nAdditionally, both businesses have a substantial mix of recurring revenue, consistent with our predictable growth model. We are expecting revenue contribution in the range of $40 million to $50 million from all acquisitions this year, assuming that the AccuLynx transaction closes at the end of the third quarter of 2025.\nAnd we expect the transaction to be accretive to earnings by year-end 2026. As we discussed, we see strong value creation opportunities from the combination of these businesses with Verisk. We have plans to invest behind the integration to drive durable long-term revenue growth and maximize synergy. From a financing perspective, we funded the $163 million purchase Assurance Bay with cash on hand and closed the transaction on July 17.\nAnd we have fully committed debt financing in place, supporting the $2.35 billion acquisition of AccuLynx. This financing will increase our leverage temporarily bringing it to the high end of our current 2 to 3x target range, but we intend to delever towards the middle of the target leverage range by year-end 2026.\nAdditionally, we expect our interest expense to increase in the back half of the year, reflecting the new borrowings associated with the deal. Given our strong free cash flow generation, which will only be enhanced by these acquisitions, we intend to continue to repurchase shares as we also delever.\nThese transactions are representations of our disciplined approach and execution of our capital allocation framework. We will continue to actively manage our portfolio, both through acquisitions and dispositions to maximize value creation for shareholders.\nOn guidance, we are pleased with our strong results for the first half of the year, and we have updated our full year outlook for 2025 to reflect this solid performance as well as to incorporate the impact of our recently announced acquisitions, which are still subject to regulatory approval and closing.\nMore specifically, we are raising our outlook for consolidated revenue and now expected to be in the range of $3.09 billion to $3.13 billion, inclusive of $40 million to $50 million from acquisitions.\nWe are also increasing our outlook for adjusted EBITDA and to a range of $1.7 billion to $1.74 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins to remain in the 55% to 55.8% range, reflecting contribution from our acquisition and some onetime expenses associated with the transaction and integration of these businesses.\nWe expect interest expense to be in the range of $190 million to $210 million reflecting the incremental debt necessary to fund the acquisition of AccuLynx. From a tax perspective, we are still expected to be in the range of 23% to 25%, so we will likely come in closer to the low end. Taken all together, we now expect diluted adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.80 to $7, reflecting strong results in our core business, and modest initial dilution from the acquisition. We expect the transaction to become accretive by year-end of 2026. A complete list of all guidance measures can be found in the earnings slide deck which has been posted to the Investors section of our website, verisk.com.\nAnd now I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments.\n\nLee M. Shavel\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThanks, Elizabeth. Before I close, I want to ask you all to market your calendars and save the date of March 5, 2026, for our next Investor Day, which will be hosted in Jersey City. We will share more information as it gets closer. We are excited about the growth opportunities ahead and have confidence in delivering on our strategy and value creation. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to 1 question.\nWith that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nFor opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.\n\nStacey Jill Brodbar\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Verisk Analytics, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our first quarter 2025 financial results. On the call today are Lee Shavel, Verisk's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Elizabeth Mann, Chief Financial Officer. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as our traditional quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in.\nAs set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance, including those related to our financial guidance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings.\nA reconciliation of reported and historic non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call is provided in our 8-K and today's earnings presentation posted on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. However, we are not able to provide a reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable expected GAAP result because of the unreasonable effort and high unpredictability of estimating certain items that are excluded from projected non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, including, for example, tax consequences, acquisition-related costs, gains and losses from dispositions and other nonrecurring expenses, the effect of which may be significant.\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee Shavel.\n\nLee M. Shavel\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThanks, Stacey. Good morning, everyone, and let me welcome you to today's call. I'm very pleased to share that 2025 is off to a positive start at Verisk as we delivered solid first quarter results, underscored by double-digit subscription growth strong overall top line growth, healthy margin expansion and profit growth. Organic constant currency revenue growth of 7.9% was driven by 10.6% subscription growth, which was broad-based across most of our business units. Our focus on cost discipline delivered 130 basis points of margin expansion, resulting in OCC adjusted EBITDA growth of 9.5%. Elizabeth will provide the details in our financial review but these results are a demonstration of our emphasis on delivering consistent and predictable growth and our results-oriented culture.\nOne of the hallmarks of Verisk's business model is that we have delivered consistent levels of growth across varying macroeconomic and insurance-specific operating environments. The current industry backdrop in which we are operating has strengthened as premium increases are better matched to levels of risk, thus driving improved trends. In fact, according to data collected by Verisk and the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, the insurance industry returned to profitability in 2024, recording an underwriting gain of $25 billion marking the first game recorded in 4 years. That said, the industry still faces an uncertain risk environment ahead as challenges, including inflation, regulatory changes, rising reconstruction costs, social inflation and the potential impact of tariffs and severe weather events are making it more complex to operate.\nSpeaking of severe weather, last year marked the second worst year for catastrophic losses since 1950 with the vast maturity of damages stemming from hurricane and severe convective storms including the back-to-back hurricanes of Helene and Milton, and that trend has continued in 2025 as the year started with the devastating wildfires in Los Angeles, which have had a profound impact on individuals, businesses, communities and our insurance industry clients and which Verisk estimated would result in $28 billion to $35 billion in insurance losses for the industry. At Verisk, we are focused on supporting our clients with the most advanced data analytics and insights to help them better understand risk and navigate through these dynamic times.\nThe changes to our go-to-market strategy that we implemented in 2024 have enabled us to get ever closer to our clients, delivering better service improved customer satisfaction and strong sales results for Verisk. We are now taking the learnings from 2024 and applying this improved sales model to a broader group of our business units in 2025 and including our new growth vectors. Through our strategic and elevated dialogue with clients, we continue to hear 3 key resounding areas of need. Specifically, our clients are asking for, one, greater and more timely insights; two, connection across our data sets and capabilities; and three, a more efficient and effective [ ecosystem ]. Let me spend a few minutes on each and detail how we are leaning in on investment toward invention to create new solutions on behalf of the industry.\nFirst is the demand for greater insights. Data and insights that help our clients understand risk across their portfolio is the foundation of the work we do. And through our Core Lines reimagined project, we are converting data into insights with greater speed and frequency helping our clients navigate these dynamic market pressures. In particular, the actuarial hub within our Core Lines platform provides insights into loss cost trends 12 months earlier than usual to help clients address the evolving pricing needs of the market. Additionally, our executive insights reports leverage our statistical data across the 6 largest lines of insurance to help with benchmark analysis and to evaluate individual client performance measures. We are also delivering more granular insights throughout our underwriting data and analytic solutions as we are incorporating a broader range of data sources, including aerial derived analytics, permit data, property records, real estate and claims data to enhance our property databases and offer a more comprehensive risk profile of buildings and building condition.\nAnd finally, our reconstruction cost data is updated monthly to provide granular material and labor cost information and analysis to help our clients estimate costs and align insurance to value. Our comprehensive database includes over 23,000 line item activities assembled from over 14,000 material, equipment and labor components. Our team of researchers and analysts survey and report pricing for these line items and components at market level for over 470 geographies in North America. In periods of rapid economic change, we often complete bimonthly updates to our research to ensure we are providing the most up-to-date market information.\nIn today's [indiscernible] environment, our clients depend on precision to maintain appropriate coverage levels and competitive pricing in the market, and they turn to Verisk as the trusted partner for our commitment to data accuracy and timeliness. We recently published our quarterly reconstruction cost analysis, which provides reconstruction cost trends at the national and state levels. The analysis is derived from building cost research using our property estimating solution. In an effort to support our clients with detailed data to navigate the changing operating environments, this quarter's report includes detailed coverage of cost changes, inclusive of recent severe weather and macroeconomic events.\nThe second area of need for our clients that I referenced is better connections across our data sets and capabilities, and we have many active projects here. One such example is our enterprise exposure manager, a cloud-native solution that combines the unique capabilities from our Specialty Business Solutions and extreme events businesses. Enterprise Exposure Manager is a scalable solution that enables users to evaluate enterprise-wide risk across billions of locations with performance and stability, providing an improved understanding of global exposures and insights into portfolio-wide risk accumulations to enable better informed business decisions.\nThis solution can utilize and analyze clients' data across insurance and reinsurance to create real-time insights, including identifying the risk of multiple claims from a single event as well as trend in comparative analytics. This new solution is also creating opportunities for us to address the needs of chief risk officers across our clients, a newer constituent for our services. Another example of our work to connect our data and capabilities is in our extreme events business. We are reimagining the core catastrophe modeling software platform into a fully cloud-native, scalable workflow solution, we are calling Verisk Synergy Studio, launching in 2026.\nWe recently engaged in more than 100 live one-on-one client demonstrations of Verisk Synergy Studio at our Verisk Insurance Conference last month, and client interest in reception was very strong. Upon release, Verisk Synergy Studio will provide a flexible, fast and stable platform on which our full global suite of catastrophe models will be deployed at a lower cost of ownership, allowing for a better understanding of the near present climate risk impacting the global insurance market. Importantly, Verisk Synergy Studio can also serve as a platform to connect the functionality of Verisk products and data sets and serve as an ecosystem hub for all Verisk's clients. We are excited about this rollout and are in active dialogue with clients ahead of the launch.\nThe third demand we are addressing is the need for an efficient and effective ecosystem that benefits all parties, namely insurers, reinsurers, brokers, regulators and ultimately policyholders. The insurance industry has strengthened through the many ecosystem players being linked together and our ability to drive connectivity enables us to support many constituencies through data relationships and partners. Specifically, we are continuing to grow our ecosystem by continually adding new partners to our various platforms across underwriting and claims, including property estimating solutions and anti-fraud. This is driving increased revenues for Verisk, more choice for clients and more connectivity and interoperability within the industry.\nWe are also creating new platforms to connect different parts of the ecosystem, such as regulatory data exchange launched in April to regulators. This platform streamlines data sharing between regulators and carriers across multiple jurisdictions. RDX enables regulators to review data elements that have been requested in prior data calls, both in their own and other jurisdictions in order to make regulatory data calls more consistent efficient and less costly to insurers. And finally, just last month, we closed on the strategic acquisition of Simplitium from NASDAQ, a SaaS platform that will be part of our Extreme Events business. Simplitium supports an open ecosystem where specialized model partners make models, hazard data and analytics available to the industry to help assess the global insurance protection gap. This acquisition will provide our clients with access to over 300 third-party models, providing unique niche views of risk across the globe, supporting the entire risk transfer ecosystem.\nNow let me turn the call over to Elizabeth to review our detailed financial results for the first quarter.\n\nElizabeth D. Mann\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Lee, and good day to everyone on the call. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, First quarter revenue was $753 million, up 7% versus the prior year, reflecting solid growth across both underwriting and claims. Net income was $232 million, up 6% versus the prior year, while diluted GAAP earnings per share, or EPS, were $1.65, up 9% versus the prior year. The increase in diluted GAAP EPS was driven by strong operating performance and a lower average share count. Moving to our organic constant currency results adjusted for nonoperating items, as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, our operating results demonstrated continued broad-based growth across both underwriting and plans.\nIn the first quarter, OCC revenues grew 7.9% with growth of 7.2% in underwriting and 9.6% in claims. This strong revenue growth represents a solid start to the year and reinforces our ability to deliver consistent levels of growth across varying macroeconomic and insurance-specific operating environment. Our subscription revenues, which comprised 83% of our total revenue in the quarter, grew 10.6% on an OCC basis during the first quarter. We experienced solid growth across most of our largest subscription-based solutions with strong price realization in our renewals, expanded relationships with existing clients and solid sales of new solutions.\nWe also continue to see a benefit from the conversions to committed subscriptions from previously transactional contracts. Within forms rules on loss costs, we continue to see improved value capture through pricing as we digitize our content, expand our insights and release more client-facing innovations as part of Reimagine. This quarter, we expanded executive insights and the ISO Experience Index to another major line of insurance, commercial auto and brought several new innovations to market, including reimagined ratings for homeowners and personal auto. We also introduced a generative AI tool within our [indiscernible] management platform. to help clients efficiently compare changes in our proprietary forms and migrated additional circular content to our new client platform.\nIn anti-fraud, we experienced underlying strength in the business augmented by strong sales of new solutions like claims scoring as well as the continued benefit from the conversion to subscription of previously transactional clients. And within Extreme Event solutions, we delivered another quarter of high single-digit subscription growth, driven by strong multiyear renewals with existing clients as well as the addition of new logos to Verisk. In our marketing business, we have experienced a recovery and growth from our insurance clients but continue to experience headwinds in other appliance segments that are more economically sensitive.\nOur transactional revenues which comprised 17% of total revenues, declined 4% on an OCC basis during the first quarter. We have had continued success converting transactional revenues to committed subscriptions including the 1 discrete contract that we have previously mentioned, which has reduced our transactional revenue growth. In addition, we continue to experience soft results in our personal auto business as well as lower levels of service revenue in certain of our software-related businesses. This decline was partially offset by better-than-expected transactional growth within Extreme Event Solutions related to securitization.\nMoving now to our adjusted EBITDA results. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 9.5% in the quarter, while total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results, was 55.3%, up 130 basis points from the reported results in the prior year. This level of margin expansion reflects the positive impact of sales leverage, the timing of certain expenses and our ongoing cost discipline, including the benefits from our global talent optimization efforts. This level of expansion also embeds the self-funded investments back into our business for invention and future growth. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted EBITDA margins were 55%, up 110 basis points over last year's levels.\nMoving down the income statement. Net interest expense was $36 million in the quarter compared to $29 million in the same period last year, resulting from higher debt balances and higher interest rates. During the first quarter, we issued $700 million of senior notes at 5.25% due to 2035. And subsequently in April, retired $500 million of 4% notes that were due in June 2025. While we still expect our full year interest expense to be in line with the previously guided range, the net effect of these transactions is that our ongoing quarterly run rate for the remainder of the year will be higher than in the first quarter. That said, we are comfortable with our current leverage, which stands at 2x the EBITDA and is at the low end of our targeted range of 2 to 3x EBITDA.\nOur reported effective tax rate was 21.6% compared to 20.3% in the prior year quarter. This year-over-year increase was primarily related to a onetime tax benefit in the prior year period. We continue to believe our tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 25% for the year. So there could be some quarterly variability related to employee stock option exercise activity. Adjusted net income increased 4.5% to $245 million and diluted adjusted EPS increased 6.1% to $1.73 for the quarter. The increase is primarily driven by solid revenue growth, strong margin expansion and a lower average share count. This was partially offset by higher depreciation expense, higher interest expense and a higher tax rate.\nFrom a cash flow perspective, on a reported basis, net cash from operating activities increased 20% to $445 million, while free cash flow increased 23% to $391 million. This was driven by an increase in operating profit and the timing of certain tax funds received in the quarter. As of March 31, we had $1.1 billion in cash on our balance sheet. However, on April 21, we retired $500 million of our 4% notes due June 2025, reducing our cash balance. We are committed to returning capital to shareholders. During the first quarter, we paid a cash dividend of $0.45 per share, a 15% increase from the prior year. We also initiated a $200 million accelerated share repurchase program, which was completed in April. We continue to have $1.4 billion in capacity remaining under our share repurchase authorization.\nWe are pleased to reiterate our outlook for 2025 or specifically, we expect consolidated revenue for 2025 to be in the range of $3.03 billion to $3.08 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.67 billion to $1.72 billion and adjusted EBITDA margins in the range of 55% to 55.8%. We expect our tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25% and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.80 to $7.10. A complete listing of all guidance measures can be found in the earnings slide deck, which has been posted to the Investors section of our website, verisk.com.\nAnd now I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments.\n\nLee M. Shavel\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThanks, Elizabeth. We are pleased that 2025 is off to a solid start. Our execution priorities are unchanged as we remain focused on delivering consistent and predictable growth while allocating capital back towards investment for future growth. Our heightened strategic engagement with clients has strengthened relationships and fostered new product and business opportunities for the industry, where we can invest at scale to drive value for clients, employees and shareholders. Our durable subscription-based economic model and strong cash flow enable us to continue to invest in our business while also returning capital to shareholders. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to 1 question.\nWith that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.\n\nStacey Jill Brodbar\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Verisk Analytics, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our second quarter 2024 financial results. On the call today are Lee Shavel, Verisk's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Elizabeth Mann, Chief Financial Officer.\nThe earnings release referenced on this call as well as our traditional quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com.

Shavel\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThanks, Stacey. Good morning, and thank you for participating in this morning's call. As we mark the halfway point in 2024, I can confidently say that we are on track to deliver against the strategic, operational and financial goals that we articulated at Investor Day and in our 2024 full year guidance.\nElizabeth will provide the detailed financials, but at a high level, Verisk delivered solid organic constant currency revenue growth led most importantly by strong subscription growth of 8.3% that was broad-based across most of our businesses. This was partly offset in the quarter by modest declines in our transactional business, related to historically high volumes in auto shopping and elevated weather-related activity in the prior year quarter, which made for tough comparisons to normalized activity this quarter. We also experienced a drag on our transactional growth from the conversion of transaction-based contracts to subscriptions, which enhances the consistency of our growth going forward.\nTo put this quarter in perspective and minimize the transaction to subscription conversion impact on a 2-year compound annual growth rate basis, our total organic constant currency revenue growth has been 8%, at the high end of our Investor Day revenue growth targets. We are driving subscription growth through strong renewals and improved price realization as our customers recognize the innovation and value-added upgrades we have incorporated into existing solutions. This is something that we've heard repeatedly in our renewal discussions with our largest clients.\nOur focus on cost discipline and operating efficiency resulted in healthy organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth and strong margin expansion, translating into 15% adjusted EPS growth. We delivered these results while continuing to invest in innovation and technologies that can help our clients improve speed, efficiency and accuracy through deeper insights, improved data and increased automation.\nOur strategy is unchanged as we focus on building long-term value for the insurance ecosystem while delivering consistent and predictable growth with high returns on capital for shareholders. The industry backdrop in which we are currently operating is one marked by continued strong premium growth as rate increases continue to earn in.\nIn fact, in the first quarter of 2024, industry-wide direct premium growth increased 10%, and Swiss Re's forecast is for 8% growth for the full year. Profitability across the sector has improved, and industry-wide combined ratios have come down, though there is variability by line and geography. Carriers continue to be cautious in an uncertain environment and focused on driving profitability.\nSpecific to the homeowners line of insurance, 2023 was the worst year on record for catastrophic losses with $15.2 billion in losses, and direct combined ratios in 17 states were above the breakeven threshold of 100. This has driven carriers to restrict underwriting in certain markets and in some cases, exit challenging states and lines of business.\nWe are working with our clients and innovating new solutions that target these problem areas, including introducing new roof analytics that leverage aerial imagery and engaging with the respective departments of insurance in Western states to share the updates we have made to our wildfire solutions. In the near term, these market conditions may present some headwinds for our predominantly subscription property business, but in the longer term, we continue to believe it highlights the need for the most accurate information to best price the risk.\nTechnological and regulatory change also continue to challenge the industry structurally. And we continue to partner with clients to help them address the rapid pace of technological change as well as increased regulatory scrutiny on data privacy, fairness, generative AI and climate risk.\nAs another example of our work to support understanding of broad industry challenges, we recently co-authored a paper along with research organization Rand Corporation analyzing the impact of social inflation in insurance casualty claims payments with a focus on better understanding the trends, impact and potential structural factors in growing jury verdicts and trial awards. At the center of our growth strategy is our effort to engage with our clients on a more strategic level.\nAs an example of what I've been hearing recently from clients, I've had conversations with both client CEOs and CIOs about the importance to them of integrating data sets across their enterprise for efficiency and consistency. We are the natural trusted technology partner to help with this data asset convergence as we are best positioned, given our deep data and domain expertise, our position in the industry and our proven track record of aggregating and integrating industry data at scale. These C-suite level and strategic conversations are opening up broader and enterprise-wide opportunities and applications of our data and analytics with the industry and new avenues for growth for Verisk.\nFor example, in casualty, an area of focus for carriers due to the rising claim severity, our Liability Navigator is an analytic solution that objectively assesses bodily injury claims to help carriers improve settlement consistency across claim teams. By integrating our proprietary medical provider fraud data and our Discovery Navigator medical record review technology, we transformed previously unstructured and disparate medical data into actionable insights at the point of decision, thus improving efficiency and accuracy in bodily injury claims outcomes.\nAlso key to our growth strategy is building upon our 50-plus year history in insurance and our competitive advantages and positioning to serve as a network for the insurance industry. To that end, in our specialty business solutions, we are delivering solid double-digit growth as we build out an interconnected ecosystem built upon the white space platform for the participants in the London market, including brokers, underwriters and managing general agents.\nWe are continuing to win new clients, adding 15 new clients in the quarter, and placement volumes are growing rapidly as the scale of the platform builds. This network effect is also active across our claims platforms as we continue to add new partners to our claims solutions ecosystem. The ClaimSearch partnership enables insurance technology providers to integrate with the ClaimSearch platform, allowing insurers to select the technology that best fits their individual business needs.\nEarlier this year, we announced 2 new collaborations with [indiscernible] and [indiscernible] Technologies, who are integrating with our ClaimSearch platform. This integration will facilitate advanced fraud analysis and detection, including more complex scoring and triaging to improve decision-making. Additionally, it should minimize the manual fraud detection process, saving valuable time and reducing operational costs for our clients.\nFinally, we continue to focus on innovation as a key pillar of our growth strategy. To that end, earlier this month, we officially launched ISO Experience Index, a new benchmarking tool which is part of our Core Lines Reimagine initiative. The ISO Experience Index is designed to modernize how actuaries in the insurance industry analyze risk patterns by addressing the increasing volatility and scale of loss patterns in the industry and offering a responsive and up-to-date indicator of observed underwriting experience.\nExperience Index empowers our clients to be more responsive to changing conditions across various geographic markets by offering quarterly releases with more frequent updates compared to traditional loss cost reviews. This enables our customers to make more informed decisions in real time.\nExperience Index is available for the homeowners line and will be expanded over time to other lines of insurance. Our customers are realizing the value we are delivering through Core Lines Reimagine, and we are benefiting from this investment through better price realization and improved client dialogues.\nIn a recent conversation with the CEO of a national carrier, he expressed appreciation for our quarterly emergent issues updates. These reports are just one example of listening to our customers' requests to not only provide data but to also deliver more valuable and actionable insights.\nAnd with that, let me turn it over to Elizabeth for the detailed financial review.\n\nElizabeth D. Mann\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Lee, and good day to everyone on the call. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, second quarter revenue was $717 million, up 6.2% versus the prior year, reflecting consistent levels of growth across both underwriting and claims.\nIncome from continuing operations was $308 million, up 51% versus the prior year, while diluted GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.15, up 53% versus the prior year. The GAAP figures include a cumulative $102 million net gain associated with retained interest in previously disposed businesses as well as a gain associated with the bond tender transaction we entered in June. The underlying EPS growth reflects strong revenue and profit growth combined with a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count.\nMoving to our organic constant currency results for the second quarter. Adjusted for nonoperating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, our operating results demonstrated consistent growth across both underwriting and claims.\nOCC revenues grew 6% with growth of 6% in underwriting and 5.8% in claims. This was a slowdown in growth as expected from the first quarter as we overlap the tough comparison to our largest ever transactional revenue dollar [indiscernible] in the second quarter of '23.\nOur subscription revenues, which comprised 81% of our total revenue in the quarter, grew 8.3% on an OCC basis during the second quarter. We experienced broad-based growth across most of our subscription-based solutions with strong renewals and expanded relationships with existing customers and solid sales of new solutions.\nOur subscription growth also reflects the benefit of conversion to subscription from previously transactional contracts. In some cases, temporary assignments or pilots are converting into longer-term contracts. In other cases, customers are looking to move away from pricing mechanisms tied to volume and instead opting for fixed pricing to give more visibility in their own cost structures.\nWe are experiencing this trend across underwriting data solutions, anti-fraud solutions, specialty and property estimating solutions. And we expect the impact of these conversions to continue for the remainder of the year.\nThe largest contributor to subscription growth continues to be forms rules and loss costs, where we are benefiting from improved price realization in our renewals as we continue to modernize our platform and deliver more value and insights to our clients through features like Experience Index that Lee spoke about earlier.\nIn anti-fraud, we experienced underlying strong price realization in the business with growth augmented by strong sales of new solutions, including claims coverage identifier and claims scoring, our new real-time monitoring tool that uses both rules-based and predictive models to identify and triage suspected fraudulent claims.\nAnd within extreme event solutions, we delivered another quarter of high single-digit subscription growth driven by strong multiyear renewals with existing clients as well as the addition of new logos to Verisk.\nOur transactional revenues, representing 19% of total revenue in the second quarter, declined 3% on an OCC basis, reflecting a tough comparison versus the prior year, a drag on growth from conversion to subscription and the impact of more year-over-year weather-related claims activity. This was offset in part by strong growth contribution from our life insurance business and securitization within our extreme events business.\nSpecific to the tough comparisons, last year, transactional revenues increased 12.4% and included benefits from elevated levels of auto shopping activity as well as the large nonrate action deal we had called out. Our revenue associated with auto shopping did continue to grow in this year's second quarter, but not at the level of the trailing 12 months. We expect those tough comparisons in auto to continue for the balance of the year.\nAnd with regard to the weather-related claims activity, while frequency of events was up in the second quarter, the severity events and the associated claims volume from those events was down year-over-year from record levels in 2023. It is this volume metric that impacts our transactional revenues within property estimating solutions.\nAll that said, we continue to experience a longer-term secular trend of growing weather-related claims across the property sector. And in fact, while 2024 claims volumes are down in the second quarter year-over-year, they are still continuing an upward trend as they are running approximately 20% above the trailing 5-year average.\nMoving now to our adjusted EBITDA results. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 8.5% in the quarter while total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results, was 55.4%, up 130 basis points from the reported results in the prior year.\nAs we've said in the past, the margin rate in any given quarter can be influenced by revenue mix and timing of spending. So we think it's useful to look at our margin on a trailing 12-month basis, which, as of June 30, 2024, was 54.3%, up 120 basis points over last year's level.\nThis level of margin expansion reflects the positive impact of sales leverage, cost discipline and our global talent optimization efforts. Our margins also reflect a lower level of headcount growth in the quarter [indiscernible] to accelerate hiring in the back half of the year to support our growth investments.\nFor the full year 2024, we continue to expect our margins to be in the 54% to 55% range. We remain confident in our ability to meet our margin expansion targets while strategically investing in future growth opportunities.\nContinuing down the income statement, net interest expense was $29 million for the second quarter compared to $32 million in the prior year, reflecting higher interest income on cash balances. During the second quarter, we issued $600 million of senior notes due 2034 and successfully tendered for $400 million of our notes due in 2025. The net effect of these 2 financing transactions is that the ongoing run rate for net interest expense will be higher in the second half of the year than it was in the first half. That said, we are comfortable with our current leverage, which at 2x is at the low end of our targeted range of 2 to 3x EBITDA.\nOn taxes, our reported effective tax rate was 21.7% compared to 23.8% in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year decrease in the tax rate is primarily due to the timing of certain discrete items that we do not expect to repeat. We believe that our tax rate for the full year 2024 will be at the low end of the 23% to 25% range. There could be some quarterly variability related to employee stock option exercise equity.\nAdjusted net income increased 13% to $249 million, and diluted adjusted EPS increased 15% to $1.74 for the quarter. The increase is primarily driven by solid revenue growth, strong margin expansion, a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count. This was partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense.\nFrom a cash flow perspective, on a reported basis, net cash from operating activities increased 10% to $212 million while free cash flow increased 14% to $154 million. This is the first quarter that our cash flow metrics demonstrate the results of our insurance-only business and are reflective of the operating cash flow of the new Verisk.\nFrom an M&A perspective, we did not acquire or dispose of any businesses in the quarter. But we did receive $112 million in cash proceeds related to the prior sales of our health care business in 2016 and our specialized markets business in 2022. In both of those cases, we maintained a small structured equity position, which was monetized in this quarter.\nAs of June 30, we had $632 million in cash on our balance sheet, which gives us the financial flexibility to continue to self-fund the investment back into the business. We are also committed to returning capital to shareholders. During the second quarter, we initiated a $150 million accelerated share repurchase program, which was completed in July. As of June 30, we had $1.3 billion in capacity remaining under our share repurchase authorization.\nWe are pleased with our results for the second quarter and the first half of the year. Our outlook for 2024 remains unchanged. More specifically, we continue to expect consolidated revenue for 2024 to be in the range of $2.84 billion to $2.9 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.54 billion to $1.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin in the 54% to 55% range.\nBelow the line, we expect fixed asset depreciation to be at the high end of the range as we continue to put new projects into service and the tax rate to be at the low end of the range, given certain onetime discrete items for the first half of the year. Combined with the slightly higher net interest expense due to our refinancing, the net result is that we still expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.30 to $6.60. A complete listing of all guidance measures can be found in the earnings slide deck, which has been posted to the Investors section of our website, verisk.com.\nAnd now I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments.\n\nLee M. Shavel\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThanks, Elizabeth. In summary, our execution priorities are unchanged as we remain focused on delivering consistent and predictable growth while allocating capital to our highest return on investment opportunities. Our focus on heightened strategic engagement with clients, both large and small, has strengthened relationships and has fostered new product and business opportunities for the industry where we can invest at scale to drive value for our clients, employees and shareholders. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk. [Operator Instructions]\nWith that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.\n\nStacey Jill Brodbar\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Verisk Analytics, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our first quarter 2024 financial results. On the call today are Lee Shavel, Verisk's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Elizabeth Mann, Chief Financial Officer.\nThe earnings release referenced on this call as well as our traditional quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in.\nAs set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance, including those related to our financial guidance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings.\nA reconciliation of reported and historic non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call is provided in our 8-K and today's earnings presentation posted on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. However, we are not able to provide a reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable expected GAAP result because of the unreasonable effort and high unpredictability of estimating certain items that are excluded from projected non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin including, for example, tax consequences, acquisition-related costs, gain/loss from dispositions and other nonrecurring expenses, the effect of which may be significant.\nAnd now, I'd like to turn the call over to Lee Shavel.\n\nLee M. Shavel\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThanks, Stacey. Good morning, and thank you for participating in this morning's call. 2024 is off to a solid start at Verisk as we are building upon the strong performance we delivered in 2023. Elizabeth will provide the detailed financials, but I am pleased to share that we delivered 6.9% organic constant currency revenue growth with strong underlying subscription growth of 7.8% that was broad-based across most of our businesses. Our focus on cost discipline and operating efficiency produced strong double-digit organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth and healthy margin expansion, translating into 26% adjusted EPS growth. This quarter's performance was in line with our 2024 guidance.\nWe are driving predictable and consistent growth by harnessing the power of our more integrated insurance-focused company and executing against our strategy to partner with the insurance ecosystem to help all participants address their most pressing challenges.\nOur execution priorities are unchanged from those that we communicated to you a year ago at Investor Day. We are building on the progress that we made in 2023 as we continue to focus on three key things: One, delivering consistent and predictable revenue growth; two, driving operating efficiency and profitability; and three, allocating our strong free cash flow with discipline and a focus on return on investment.\nI've spoken on this call many times about our efforts to engage with our clients on a more strategic level. To that end, in April, we hosted the Verisk Insurance Conference, or VIC as it is affectionately known in the industry, which attracted a record number of attendees from across the global insurance ecosystem including representatives from the carriers, reinsurers, regulators and our channel partners. VIC is our flagship event where we strategically engage with all our ecosystem clients and partners through joint discussions and presentations as an integrated one Verisk.\nThis year's event featured over 70 different educational sessions and panel discussions on some of the industry's top-of-mind issues, including fairness, generative AI, fraud, climate risk, rate adequacy and social inflation. One of the best attended sessions was a panel discussion about Florida property insurance and featured representatives from key market players, including the carriers, regulators, legislators and Verisk. The discussion focused on lessons learned from the insurance crisis in this important and high-risk market and what other states can learn from this experience.\nThe event also featured a solutions gallery that showcased many of our offerings, covering risk, natural perils, commercial property, [ home model ] as well as several of our key technology ecosystem partners. The event has generated strong collaboration ideas with our clients and partners as well as leads for our sales teams. It also builds upon the goals that we set last year to elevate the strategic dialogue with our clients and continue our path to serve as a data and technology partner to the global insurance ecosystem.\nDuring the Verisk Insurance Conference, our Extreme Events division unveiled its latest innovation, next-generation models or NGM, for insurers, brokers and reinsurers. Verisk is the first firm to release its full suite of over 100 models across all perils and geographies to a next-generation financial modeling framework. And these models are all now accessible via our Touchstone platform.\nAs the rising cost of catastrophes and an increase in losses from frequency-driven perils such as severe convective storms has challenged the industry, next-generation models provide a better quantification of uncertainty and enhanced capabilities to assess insured losses across the insurance industry more accurately.\nWith next-generation models, our clients can make better financial assessments of loss potential and more accurately represent the risk to their policyholders, their businesses and their partners. NGM also offers new advantages to support complex insurance policy structures and deal with new terms and conditions that previously went unmodeled. Clients can effectively manage risk, both at the portfolio and individual levels using the NGM suite of models.\nNGM represents the next step in our journey towards a fully SaaS native platform, underscoring our commitment to continuous investment in advanced data and technologies and capabilities on behalf of the industry.\nNext, I'd like to provide you with an update on our core lines reimagine program. As previously mentioned, we are on a journey to digitize and enhance our essential suite of industry standard solutions to make our forms, rules and loss cost content easier to access, use and customize and provide much needed updates and insights. We have made good progress in modernizing our internal systems and processes for digital-first content creation, enabling us to deliver new client-facing modules.\nWe recently introduced Filing Intelligence, which is accessible on our new platform. This tool simplifies our filings delivery process by consolidating all necessary documents, forms, rules and loss costs into one accessible interface eliminating the need for manual review and piecing together multiple documents. Filing Intelligence digitally connects all documents related to each filing, streamlining the process for users and ensuring seamless access to essential information.\nOn the actuarial front, we recently added Actuarial Hub to the new platform. Within the hub, clients can access new insights such as the ISO Experience Index, the loss cost activity dashboard and a new series of actuarial prospective articles. These resources offer deeper insights into our filings and data, empowering our clients to make quicker, well-informed decisions.\nLooking ahead, we plan to launch additional customer-facing modules, that will provide even more value to our clients by introducing new proprietary analytics, workflow tools and insights to further streamline processes and enhance underwriting accuracy for our clients.\nOverall, we're excited about the progress of the reimagined program. This initiative is already driving returns for Verisk as we are receiving positive client feedback and experiencing better price realization in contract renewals.\nLastly, today is an important day as May 1 is officially Verisk generative AI day. Our technology teams from across our global offices and business units are gathered at our Jersey City headquarters to collaborate and share best practices and learnings on their work with GenAI for both customer-facing initiatives and internal efficiencies. More specifically, all of our divisions have active GenAI pilots running in many other areas in active development. And within our claims business, we have three solutions in production and available today for clients.\nGenerative AI continues to be top of mind for our clients and is a topic of much discussion in my conversations with industry executives. One very promising application that I'm seeing is the use of generative AI to gather and predigest massive amounts of information to organize and distill it for the insurance professional, improving and focusing their expertise, not replacing it. This is a natural fit and opportunity for the work we do in curating and managing the needs of the global insurance industry to facilitate more effective and efficient workflows.\nAs we have done with other forms of advanced technology, GenAI is an area where we can invest benefit of the industry at a lower cost of investment in ownership than any single client can do on their own.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Elizabeth to cover the detailed financial review.\n\nElizabeth D. Mann\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Lee, and good day to everyone on the call. I am pleased to share that Verisk delivered a solid first quarter of 2024. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, first quarter revenue was $704 million, up 8% versus the prior year, reflecting solid growth in underwriting and more modest growth in claims. Income from continuing operations was $219 million, up 12.9% versus the prior year, while diluted GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.52, up 19.7% versus the prior year. This level of EPS growth reflects strong revenue and profit growth, combined with a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count due to the large accelerated share repurchase program in 2023. .\nMoving to our organic constant currency results for the first quarter, adjusted for nonoperating items, as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, our operating results demonstrated solid growth for most of our businesses. OCC revenues grew 6.9% with growth of 7.8% in underwriting and 4.7% in claims. This was an acceleration from the fourth quarter in both subsegments and was in line with our expectations and 2024 financial guidance.\nOur subscription revenues, which comprised 80% of our total revenue in the quarter, grew 7.8% on an OCC basis during the first quarter. We experienced broad-based growth across most of our subscription-based solutions with strong renewals and expanded relationships with existing customers and solid sales of new solutions. The largest contributor to subscription growth was forms, rules and loss costs. We are benefiting from a stronger renewal cycle and improved price realization as we continue to modernize our platform and deliver more value and insights to our clients through our core lines reimagine programs that Lee spoke about earlier.\nIn anti-fraud, we experienced underlying strength in the business with growth augmented by the continued benefit from the conversion to subscription from previously transactional customers that we mentioned throughout 2023. Most of our clients have successfully completed this transition. Therefore, the benefit will continue to taper throughout 2024.\nAnd within underwriting data solutions, we are seeing a positive client response to our enhanced commercial lines property solutions, which have benefited from our expanded coverage as our database of commercial property records has grown by over 200% in 2020 and now has over 15.9 million records.\nOur transactional revenues representing 20% of total revenue in the first quarter increased 3.1% on an OCC basis, reflecting a tough comparison versus the prior year which benefited from the strong auto shopping activity and nonreaction activity. During the quarter, we saw continued growth across our auto suite of solutions, though growth rates have moderated as we expected.\nRegarding auto, due to recent changes in our data source, we have decided to discontinue our existing telematics offering. The impact of this is immaterial in 2024 with less than $1 million of revenue impact. We do not expect this to have any impact on the remainder of our auto solutions.\nOur transactional revenue growth also benefited from double-digit growth within life insurance solutions as we saw strong customer demand for incremental services.\nAnd within our extreme events business, we saw better-than-expected transactional growth driven by securitization. This was offset in part by lower weather-related transaction volumes in property estimating solutions and the impact of the conversion to subscription within our anti-fraud business.\nMoving now to our adjusted EBITDA results. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 10.6% in the quarter while total adjusted EBIT margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results, was 54%, up 180 basis points from the reported results in the prior year. As we've said in the past, the margin rate in any given quarter can be influenced by revenue mix and timing of spending. So we think it's useful to look at our margin on a trailing 12-month basis which as of March 31, 2024, was 53.9%, up 120 basis points over last year's level. This level of margin expansion reflects the positive impact of sales leverage and cost discipline.\nWe also experienced a modest margin benefit from nonoperating items, including foreign currency changes, but this was largely offset by margin impact from recent acquisitions. Our current margin rate also reflects continued organic investment for future growth, including our Reimagine program, the replatforming of key solutions in extreme events and property estimating solutions, our new financial and human capital systems as well as exploration of advanced technologies like GenAI. We remain confident in our ability to meet our margin expansion targets, while strategically investing in future growth opportunities.\nContinuing down the income statement, net interest expense was $29 million for the first quarter compared to $26 million in the prior year. The current level of net interest expense reflects interest income on lower cash balances than 1 year previously. Our reported effective tax rate was 20.3% compared to 27.1% in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year decrease in the tax rate is primarily due to tax charges -- structuring the sale of our Energy business last year as well as certain discrete items that we do not expect to repeat in the remaining quarters of the year. We continue to believe that our tax rate for the full year 2024 will be in the 23% to 25% range. So there could be some quarterly variability related to employee stock option exercise activity.\nAdjusted net income increased 19% to $234 million and diluted adjusted EPS increased 26% to $1.63 for the quarter. The increase is primarily driven by solid revenue growth, strong margin expansion, a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count. Our lower average share count reflects the impact of the large accelerated share repurchase program we completed in 2023 using the proceeds from the divestitures. This was partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization and higher net interest expense.\nFrom a cash flow perspective, on a reported basis, net cash from operating activities increased 1.9% to $372 million while free cash flow increased 4.2% to $317 million. Both cash flow metrics reflect the impact of our indemnification obligation related to our former Financial Services business which we accrued for in 2023. It is also important to note that the prior year cash flow figures still include the results of our previously divested Energy business. So these growth figures understate the cash flow growth of our insurance-only business.\nWe are committed to returning capital to shareholders. During the first quarter, we initiated a $200 million accelerated share repurchase program, which was completed in April. Our $0.39 per share dividend was up 15% from the prior year. We continue to have $1.4 billion in capacity remaining under our repurchase authorization.\nWe are pleased with our results for the first quarter and reiterate our outlook for 2024. More specifically, we continue to expect consolidated revenue for 2024 to be in the range of $2.84 billion to $2.9 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.54 billion to $1.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin in the 54% to 55% range. We expect our tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25% and adjusted earnings in the range of $6.30 to $6.60 per share. A complete listing of all guidance measures can be found in the earnings slide deck, which has been posted to the Investors section of our website, verisk.com.\nAnd now, I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments.\n\nLee M. Shavel\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThanks, Elizabeth. In summary, our execution priorities remain consistent with those communicated at Investor Day, continued focus on revenue growth, operating efficiency and disciplined cash flow allocation. Following a strong 2023, we are pleased to see 2024 off to a strong start with implied growth of 7% in consolidated revenue and 9.5% in adjusted EBITDA at the midpoint of our 2024 financial guidance.\nOur focus on heightened strategic engagement with clients has strengthened relationships and fostered new product and business opportunities for the industry where we can invest at scale to drive value for -- employees and shareholders.\nWe continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question.\nWith that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

Shavel\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThank you, Stacey. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in this morning's call. I am pleased to be here today to recap what was an exceptional year for Verisk, marked by strategic, organizational and cultural change matched with outstanding financial performance and value creation for clients and shareholders alike.\nElizabeth will provide the financial detail, but in summary, we delivered 8.7% organic constant currency revenue growth in 2023, the strongest performance on record since our initial public offering back in 2009. And we exceeded the expectations we set at Investor Day in March.\nWe combine this with double-digit organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth and 150 basis points of margin expansion on an Insurance-only basis, achieving the low end of the initial margin improvement goal of 300 basis points 1 year earlier than our original target of 2024. And we have plans in place to build on that in 2024 and beyond.\nDespite the separation of our non-Insurance business, we still grew free cash flow 6% to over $800 million and above our 2022 level on an unadjusted basis. Over the past 2 years, we demonstrated capital discipline by returning over $4 billion in proceeds from recent dispositions to shareholders through share repurchases, reducing our share base by about 10%. This also served to substantially improve our capital efficiency and boost our returns on invested capital.\nAnd while our strong 2023 revenue growth was exceptional, the long-term opportunity of addressing our clients' most pressing needs gives me confidence in our strategy to drive consistent and predictable growth in 2024 and beyond. The insurance industry backdrop in which we are operating is relatively comparable to 2023. Insurance carriers continue to deal with cyclical challenges on profitability resulting from higher losses and the lagging effects of inflation by restricting new business in profit-challenged markets.\nThe most recent AM Best data shows losses for the first 9 months of 2023 were $32.2 billion, a further deterioration from the $24.5 billion in net losses recorded through the first 6 months of the year and tracking way ahead of the pace of losses in 2022. This caused AM Best to downgrade their outlook for the homeowners line from stable to negative, while also maintaining their negative outlook on personal auto.\nTo some extent, profitability challenges in the industry were the result of higher catastrophe-related losses. Our own PCS data points out that 2023 was the highest year on record for frequency of catastrophe activity with 74 events. While 2023 did not have a major tropical hurricane make U.S. landfall, wind and severe convective storms were dominant and the major source of events in the year. That said, the fourth quarter of 2023 was a relatively quiet period with only 7 events and was lower than the fourth quarter of 2022, which experienced 13 events.\nOn the more positive end, carriers are having success raising rates and driving premium growth and are taking the very early steps in certain lines to unwind restrictions on writing new business as they achieve rate adequacy. In fact, net written premium growth increased 10.8% for the first 9 months of 2023.\nMore structurally, the insurance industry continues to be challenged by the rapid pace of technological change, including digitalization and cloud migration. This is being compounded by the fact that the industry also faces technological [ debt ] and aging legacy systems.\nIn addition, the industry continues to experience growing regulatory focus on issues of data privacy fairness and climate risk. Our business model and strategy are designed to address our customers' most pressing needs, both from a cyclical and structural perspective.\nWe invest on behalf of the industry, applying our industry knowledge and technical expertise at scale to deliver value to our clients at a lower cost of investment and ownership than any one participant can achieve individually. As we work with our clients on a more integrated basis, the opportunities to develop new solutions expands.\nWe are focused on the 3 key priorities we articulated back at Investor Day, namely delivering consistent and predictable top line growth, driving operating efficiency and profitability and ensuring disciplined capital allocation. Let me spend a few minutes on how we plan to go after each in 2024 and beyond.\nOur first priority is delivering consistent and predictable growth through strategic dialogue with clients in innovation. Throughout 2023, we made substantial progress on our initiative to elevate the strategic dialogue with our clients and to become their strategic data analytic and technology partner.\nDuring the year, I met with over 3 dozen client CEOs and senior leaders, representing over half of the U.S. property and casualty insurance industry direct written premium, to discuss how we could better support their objectives. Three primary themes came up repeatedly. How can you accelerate and expand the delivery of data and analytics to our organization? How can Verisk augment the capabilities of our colleagues to improve their ability to manage the amount of information they receive? And finally, how can Verisk help better connect the ecosystems we operate in to improve our efficiency.\nOn the acceleration point, we are intensively addressing this opportunity across our businesses, but perhaps most significantly in our Core Lines Reimagine project to reengineer how we deliver our core data sets and analytics to meet the rapidly evolving ingestion demands of our clients. Prospectively, we see the application of low, no-code and micro services technology that we have successfully deployed in the life insurance industry having material significance to the property and casualty segment and have been working with clients on testing applications.\nOn augmentation, we have already been applying generative AI technology through our Discovery Navigator solution to dramatically accelerate the summarization of large and complex medical files in our casualty business. Prospectively, we have been developing and working with clients to refine several augmented underwriting applications.\nOn connectivity, we have been investing in our Xactware platform to support the integration of more ecosystem and partners. Last week, I attended our Elevate Conference in Salt Lake City, which had record attendance from our insurance, contractor, adjuster clients and over 30 ecosystem partners. Both clients and partners expressed enthusiasm for our delivery of improved connectivity and efficiency, demonstrating the network potential of this business.\nFinally, on connectivity, we were thrilled at last week's announcement of Marsh's expansion of its digital trading initiative on the Verisk Whitespace platform. This builds on a successful pilot in 2023, which [indiscernible] in premium and is a gratifying endorsement by a world-leading insurance broker that should draw more participation onto a data-first platform that will drive greater efficiency for the market.\nWith expansion across its U.K. specialty and international placement business, Marsh anticipates that over 90% of all client premium in that segment will flow through the platform by the end of 2024.\nOur strategic conversations are also helping to drive more informed innovation. In our conversations with clients, we repeatedly hear about the increasing regulatory focus and reporting requirements on fairness and unfair discrimination.\nTo address this need, during the fourth quarter, we launched FairCheck, a solution designed to address issues of fairness and discrimination in the underwriting process. FairCheck helps insurers test their personal lines' models and variables to respond to regulatory change and to evaluate and mitigate the potential for unfairly discriminatory outcomes. This solution is an extension of the work we did internally to assess Verisk's own personal auto rating model to determine whether there were unfair pricing outcomes regarding race. We recently signed a national property and casualty carrier to be our first customer.\nInternally, during 2023, we worked with an outside consultant to sharpen our go-to-market strategy and are implementing the first steps of this changed approach in 2024. This includes an investment behind sales effectiveness, incorporating a change to the composition of incentives to be more in line with industry best practices. In addition, we have identified pricing and packaging opportunities within property estimating solutions and extreme event solutions. And we will be bringing them to market throughout this year.\nOur second priority from Investor Day is driving operating efficiency and profitability. We remain committed to driving operating efficiency and margin expansion over time. We are leaning into our global talent optimization initiative, tapping into the talent-rich and low-cost markets like Krakow, Poland and Hyderabad, India. We have recently expanded our real estate footprint in both markets to support our growth.\nAdditionally, we should continue to achieve savings as we modernize and optimize our technology infrastructure across all our legacy systems, including our internal financial and human capital ERP upgrade, which is underway and which should start delivering early efficiency benefits in 2025 with the full impact to be achieved in 2 to 3 years.\nAs we look out, we see opportunity in improving our operational efficiency by careful reviews of our workflow and processes. We will continue to deploy our Lean Six Sigma program to drive additional savings and continue to focus on our organizational structure and efficiency.\nAnd finally, our third priority is disciplined capital allocation. Disciplined capital allocation underscores all our decision-making at Verisk. We invest our strong free cash flow into value-creating opportunities that support growth with attractive returns. Excess capital is returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nIn 2023, our return on invested capital was approximately 26% with incremental returns on capital at approximately 19% as continue to invest our capital at high internal rates of return. We are excited about the many opportunities we have to invest across our business in emerging technologies, including generative AI, low, no-code applications and [indiscernible] expansion.\nWe also are investing behind upgrades and replatforming of our core solutions, some of which have been underinvested and need modernization to support future innovation. The most notable example is our Core Lines Reimagine project. As we highlighted before, we are about 1/3 of the way through this project from an investment perspective, and we are engaging our clients as we plan for customer-facing modules launching in 2024.\nWhile there is still much work to be done, we are already driving returns through strong contract wins with our largest customers as they recognize the value of the program. We are also investing in modernizing our property estimating solutions platform to advance our strategic goal of creating a [indiscernible] open ecosystem that is resilient, redundant and available for all stakeholders.\nWe are simplifying partner integration and developing new services to enable deeper workflow integration, richer solutions and better client services. This initiative should increase our agility and create a more dynamic work environment for both our clients and our development teams.\nWe are also excited about the opportunities to continue to create incremental value in our Insurance-related acquisitions. For example, in claims, we are driving growth and synergies in our 3 recent acquisitions in Germany, where we have a leading market position in the bodily injury space, and are adding services and technology offerings in the auto and property spaces through the acquisitions of ACTINEO, [indiscernible] and Rocket, respectively. These acquisitions enable us to deliver solutions and add value to our German customers across the entire claims life cycle.\nBefore we close, I want to address the recent leadership announcements naming 3 new business leaders to the Verisk Senior Operating Committee. Rob Newbold was named President, Extreme Events, taking over the reins from Bill Churney, who retired at the end of the year. And Doug Caccese and Saurabh Khemka, who are recently named Co-Presidents of Underwriting Solutions, replacing Neil Spector, who has moved into a strategic advisory role. All 3 leaders are evidence of our deeply talented management bench and focused leadership development and succession planning process.\nI want to thank both Bill and Neil for their many contributions to Verisk and to me personally as I stepped into the role of CEO. And while we will miss them, they have left their business in the very capable hands of talented, experienced and energized leaders.\n2023 was a demonstration of Verisk's evolving culture. We delivered strong financial success while absorbing organizational and leadership change. And I am excited about having the fresh perspective and energy of these 3 leaders as we move into 2024.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Elizabeth to review our financial results.\n\nElizabeth Mann\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Lee, and good day to everyone on the call. I am pleased to share that Verisk delivered a solid fourth quarter, capping off an outstanding 2023. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, fourth quarter revenue was $677 million, up 7.4% versus the prior year, reflecting solid growth in underwriting and more modest growth in claims.\nIncome from continuing operations was $182 million, down 15.5% versus the prior year, while diluted GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.25, down 8.8% versus the prior year. The year-over-year decline in both measures were primarily due to a $19 million litigation reserve expense related to our former Financial Services segment that was previously sold alongside a onetime tax benefit of $30 million or $0.19 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nAdditionally, elevated depreciation and amortization expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023, resulting from the completion and implementation of certain large internally developed software projects during the year, also contributed to the decrease. These factors were partially offset by strong revenue growth, lower net interest expense and the benefit from our accelerated share repurchase program.\nMoving to our organic constant currency results. Adjusted for [indiscernible] items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, our operating results demonstrated solid growth for most of our businesses.\nIn the fourth quarter, OCC revenues grew 6% with growth of 7.3% in underwriting and 2.8% in claims. Normalizing for the $5.6 million in storm-related revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022, total OCC revenue growth would have been 6.9%, and claims OCC revenue growth would have been [ 6.0% ].\nAs expected, and as we highlighted in prior quarters, some of the environmental trends recorded elevated growth earlier in the year began to normalize in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we did begin to overlap tougher comparisons in many of our businesses.\nThat said, 2023 was a record year for Verisk with total OCC revenue growth of 8.7% driven by strong growth of 8.5% in underwriting and 9.3% in claims. Growth for the full year was broad-based with almost all businesses delivering better-than-expected results.\nThroughout 2023, our increased focus on the Insurance business and our energized organization capitalized on 3 key industry and environmental trends to amplify our growth. These trends included the pricing environment resulting from the hard insurance market, the high transaction activity driven by elevated shopping activity for auto insurance and the active U.S. weather patterns that Lee highlighted.\nOur subscription revenues, which comprise 80% of our total revenue in the quarter, grew 7.3% on an OCC basis during the fourth quarter with growth in almost all our subscription-based solutions. The drivers of growth we experienced in the quarter were consistent with trends we saw throughout 2023.\nMore specifically, during quarter, we experienced the continued benefit on certain of our revenues from the stronger net premium growth in 2021, which is currently [indiscernible] in some of our contract pricing. In anti-fraud, we saw underlying strength in the business with growth augmented by the continued benefit from the conversion to subscription from previously transactional customers through our claim [indiscernible] bundle.\nThat said, we have started to anniversary the benefit we experienced from these conversions and are expecting the benefit from this transition to continue to moderate in 2024. These strengths were offset in part by continued weakness within Verisk Marketing Solutions and a more normalized level of attrition across the business, including some reduction in the level of contractor activity due to the weather and some pressure within our Insurtech customer segment.\nOur transactional revenues, representing 20% of total revenue in the fourth quarter, increased a modest 0.8% on an OCC basis, reflecting a tough comparison versus the prior year, which included revenues associated with Hurricane Ian. Adjusting for the storm impact, transactional revenue growth would have been 4.1%.\nDuring the quarter, we continued to see strong results from our auto solutions driven by healthy consumer shopping activity and the final quarter of benefit from the large nonrate action deal we signed for 2023.\nWe have begun to overlap the positive inflection in shopping behavior from last year and are expecting growth to moderate in 2024. Our transactional revenue growth also benefited from double-digit growth within life insurance solutions as we are seeing strong customer demand for incremental services. And within our extreme events business, we saw better-than-expected transactional growth driven by securitizations.\nMoving now to our adjusted EBITDA results. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 6.5% in the fourth quarter. Total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results, was 53.4%, up 70 basis points from the reported results in the prior year.\nThe fourth quarter margin rate reflects the positive impact of sales leverage, cost discipline and foreign currency changes. This was offset in part by margin pressure from higher incentive compensation, acquisitions and organic investments for future growth.\n2023 was a year of tremendous growth and efficiency for Verisk as evidenced by total OCC adjusted EBITDA growth of 11.5%, while total adjusted EBITDA margin was 53.5%, up 150 basis points from the prior year. This margin rate reflects core operating leverage from the strong revenue growth and cost discipline across the organization.\nAs Lee discussed earlier, delivering operational efficiency and profitability remains a key priority for us as we move forward into 2024 and beyond. We have confidence we can continue to make further progress while also balancing investments to support future growth.\nContinuing down the income statement, net interest expense was $28 million for the fourth quarter compared to $41 million in the prior year. The current level of net interest expense reflects lower year-over-year debt balances as well as higher interest on cash balances.\nDepreciation and amortization of fixed assets was $68 million for the quarter, an increase of 57%. The increase was primarily driven by an additional $23 million of expense related to the timing of certain large internally developed software projects that were completed and placed into service during the year.\nOn taxes, our reported effective tax rate was 24.9% compared to 9.9% in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year increase in the tax rate is related to the onetime tax benefit of $30 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and a $19 million litigation reserve taken in the fourth quarter 2023 that we mentioned earlier.\nAdjusted net income decreased 9.3% to $204 million. And diluted adjusted EPS decreased 2.1% to $1.40 for the fourth quarter. These changes reflect the negative impact from the onetime tax benefit in the prior year quarter and higher depreciation and amortization expenses, partially offset by solid revenue and EBITDA growth, lower net interest expense and a lower average share count.\nThe share count reflects the impact of the additional $250 million of share repurchases executed in the fourth quarter as well as the final settlement of our $2.5 billion accelerated share repurchase plan that we entered into in March.\nFrom a cash flow perspective, on a reported basis, net cash from operating activities increased 1.4% to $252 million, while free cash flow increased 15.8% to $196 million. It is important to note that the prior year cash flow figures still include the results of our previously divested energy business. So these growth figures understate the full cash flow growth potential of our Insurance-only business.\nOn dividends and repurchases, during 2023, we returned $3 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends and repurchases. We are pleased to share that the Board has approved a $0.05 or 15% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.39 per share.\nIn addition, our Board has also authorized an additional $1 billion in share repurchases, bringing our total authorization to $1.6 billion. On [indiscernible], we are pleased to deliver our expectations for 2024 with growth and margins in line with our Investor Day target. And they build upon the exceptional performance we delivered in 2023.\nMore specifically, we expect consolidated revenue for 2024 to be in the range of $2.84 billion to $2.9 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.54 billion to $1.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin in the 54% to 55% range. This margin reflects strong cost discipline while also funding incremental investment opportunities that we expect to drive future growth.\nThese opportunities include investing in our sales force to drive greater sales effectiveness, expanding internationally through acquisitions and building our capabilities with new advanced technologies, including generative AI. Walking further down the P&L, we expect depreciation and amortization of fixed assets in the range of [ $210 million ] to $240 million and amortization of intangibles of approximately $75 million. Both items are subject to the timing of completion of projects and foreign currency changes.\nWe expect our tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%. This all culminates in adjusted earnings in the range of $6.30 to $6.60 per share. We also expect capital expenditures to be between $240 million and $260 million as we continue to invest organically to drive future growth. A complete list of all guidance measures can be found in the earnings slide deck, which has been posted to the Investors section of our website, verisk.com.\nAnd now I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments.\n\nLee M. Shavel\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThanks, Elizabeth. In summary, we're excited about the opportunity that lies ahead. Our motivating purpose is to partner with our clients in building resilience for individuals, communities and businesses globally. The combination of our focused business model, deep customer relationships and strategy to deliver value for clients through improved decision-making and operational efficiency is a formula that will also deliver value to our shareholders through growth and returns. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk. [Operator Instructions]\nWith that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.\n\nStacey Jill Brodbar\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Verisk Analytics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Sheryl, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our third quarter 2023 financial results. On the call today are Lee Shavel, Verisk's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Elizabeth Mann, Chief Financial Officer. .\nThe earnings release referenced on this call as well as our traditional quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. As set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance, including those related to our financial guidance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings.\nFinally, I'd also like to remind everyone that the financial results for recent dispositions are included in our consolidated and GAAP results, but are excluded from all organic constant currency growth figures. A reconciliation of reported and historic non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call is provided in our 8-K and today's earnings presentation posted on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. However, we are not able to provide a reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA as adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable expected GAAP results because of the unreasonably high effort and unpredictability of estimating certain items that are excluded from projected non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, including, for example, tax consequences, acquisition-related costs, gains and loss from dispositions and other nonrecurring expenses, the effect of which may be significant. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee Shavel.\n\nLee M. Shavel\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nGood morning and thank you for participating in our third quarter earnings call. I am pleased to be here today to update you on the progress our team at Verisk is making on driving strategy and translating it into strong growth and value creation for our clients and shareholders alike. Elizabeth will provide the financial detail, but in summary, we delivered another strong quarter of results marked by solid organic revenue growth across most of our businesses, healthy margin expansion and double-digit profit growth. We have confidence in our ability to deliver on both our 2023 guidance and the longer-term objectives we communicated back in March at Investor Day.\nThe industry environment within which we are operating is marked by some deep challenges. Insurance carriers are dealing with the cross currents of inflation and higher losses, which are both negatively impacting industry profitability. In fact, AM Best data for the first 6 months of 2023 points to a $24.5 billion net underwriting loss for the U.S. property and casualty insurance industry, running well ahead of the pace of the full year 2022, which experienced net underwriting losses of $26.9 billion. AM Best notes that personal lines specifically homeowners is the primary driver of these declines.\nIn reaction to this backdrop, carriers are exiting markets in key catastrophe-prone states dropping certain lines of unprofitable business and laying off portions of their workforce. Carriers are also raising rates to attempt to cover rising inflation and losses, driving net written premium growth up 9.7% for the first 6 months of 2023. In response to this environment, Verisk is partnering closely with our clients to address their most pressing concerns, including high-value solutions that can deliver high return on investment for our clients, and we are including our clients earlier in the innovation process to ensure we are delivering the right solutions with simple implementations, improving the success rate and pace of uptake of new solutions.\nOne of the key tenets of our strategy is to elevate the strategic dialogue with our clients and to become their trusted data and analytic and technology partner. During the third quarter, we engaged with clients on several occasions and at a variety of venues, including the Verisk Insurance Conference in London. This year, we've combined several Verisk events to make it easier for clients to explore the many ways we can add value and increase the efficiency of their operations. In London, for example, we combined events focused on underwriting, claims, specialty insurance and extreme event modeling into a singular client-centric experience featuring Verisk solutions. I delivered 1 of 2 keynote presentations and the entire Verisk Senior Operating Committee was in attendance, demonstrating our commitment to our customers at all levels.\nA solutions gallery featured Verisk solutions as well as the solutions of our ecosystem partners, and we held 35 concurrent educational sessions. We wrapped up with the CEO dinner with attendees that represented carriers, brokers and managing general agents had a group discussion around common challenges faced by the entire insurance value chain.\nEnterprise-wide Risk management is top of mind for many in London as our clients are managing extremely large and complex portfolios of risk spanning multiple classes of business and insurance markets all over the world. To address this pressing need, we recently introduced Enterprise Exposure Manager. This solution is a joint development effort between specialty business solutions and extreme events to bring to the market a cloud-native and scalable solution that enables insurers and reinsurers to make more informed business decisions by offering a comprehensive view of risks that exist across large property portfolios.\nAs we engage with our customers at these events and in the many one-on-one meetings we have hosted throughout the year, there were a few consistent themes that we hear in these conversations. First is digital transformation, which represents a massive opportunity for the global insurance market. Our clients aspire to modernize their platforms, improve systems integrations, lower expenses and improved operational efficiency, and we are partnering with them on this journey. Verisk is introducing solutions that drive operational efficiency for some of their most people and paper intensive processes. For example, within our casualty business, we recently launched Discovery Navigator and are seeing solid early success. Discovery Navigator combines artificial intelligence and machine learning, Verisk's contributory data and years of clinical and legal expertise to immediately identify and extract key medical data points from unstructured records, which are part of bodily injury claims. Depending on the complexity of the case, the number of medical pages involved in a bodily injury claim can range from hundreds to thousands. Verisk has automated the organization, review and summary of these complex unstructured documents, allowing insurers to adjust, negotiate and settle more claims in less time.\nDiscovery Navigator easily integrates into our customers' workflows through API or online options and delivers up to a 90% time savings and 95% accuracy for an average 10x ROI for clients. Additionally, Discovery Navigator is a widely versatile tool that is driving innovation and can be used in combination with other Verisk solutions like Liability Navigator, delivering workflow automation, decision support and overall efficiency for clients.\nThe need for deeper data insights is also something we hear regularly from customers. Inflation trends during the past year have underscored the need for accurate, up-to-date and granular data insights to inform underwriting, risk management, reinsurance and claims decisions. No company is better positioned to meet this need than Verisk with our comprehensive and proprietary data assets. For example, our Verisk property estimating solutions are designed to meet these challenges head on with a comprehensive set of tools based on timely proprietary data, enabling our customers to write the most accurate estimates possible on their first attempt. This reduces the risk of over and underpayments while improving cycle times.\nKey to this process is exact expert. Our recently introduced rules engine that assists estimators in avoiding unwarranted costs in their estimates. We also enable our customers' quality assurance teams that evaluate the data from the entire process, ensuring that the claim payment will be correct for the first time.\nFinally, generative AI remains a frequent topic with clients, both its transformative potential and the risk that it brings. We believe Gen AI can deliver efficiency within Verisk and in client-facing solutions starting first in our underwriting and life businesses where we are actively exploring new product development as well as enhancements to existing solutions. We are increasing our investment and leaning into generative AI as our clients recognize that by partnering with Verisk, we can invest in this advanced technology on behalf of the industry more efficiently than any 1 customer can do on their own.\nWe also intend to do so while maintaining our focus on fairness and value-centric governance. On the theme of investment, I want to provide a progress report and update on our core lines reimagined project. We are about 1/3 of the way complete in what is likely a 5-year journey to modernize our forms, rules and loss costs and related solutions. We have made progress modernizing our internal processes like our ratemaking operation to enable and efficiently scale innovations in current and new solutions. We are expanding our industry-leading contributory database by adding new data contributors and by increasing the quality of our collected data, and we are working on enhancing the recency of our data in our analytics.\nOn the customer-facing side, we are in market with new proprietary analytics and workflow tools. For example, we have launched executive and client insight reports designed for the senior leadership of our clients across 2 of the largest lines of insurance, namely homeowners and business owners with plans to expand into other large lines over time. Just this month, we also launched our legislative monitoring application in the new platform for select clients. This new cloud-native application transforms what was previously a document-based paper trail for tracking thousands of insurance-related legal, regulatory and legislative developments into a data-driven modern digital monitoring and efficiency tool with an improved customer interface.\nLegislative monitoring is the first of a series of new features that will be launched over the next several years on the platform. Overall, customer feedback on the reimagined project has been quite positive, including on the custom analytics and legislative monitoring application I mentioned before, and there is excitement for future advances within core lines. This excitement is driving more constructive value-driven conversations with our clients as we partner with them along their digital transformation journey. We are making these investments to deliver increased value for our clients through enhanced underwriting accuracy and efficiency. With that, I'll hand it over to Elizabeth to review our financial results.\n\nElizabeth Mann\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Lee, and good day to everyone on the call. I am pleased to share that Verisk delivered strong third quarter financial results. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue was $678 million, up 11% versus the prior year and income from continuing operations was $187 million, up 13% versus the prior year, reflecting strong growth across both underwriting and claims. .\nDiluted GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.29, up 23% versus the prior year. This quarter's reported results included a $19 million litigation reserve expense associated with an indemnification for an ongoing inquiry related to our former Financial Services segment, which was sold in April 2022.\nMoving to our organic constant currency results adjusted for nonoperating items, as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, our operating results demonstrated strong and broad-based growth from most of our businesses, aided by some in-period transactional benefits. In the third quarter, OCC revenues grew 9.4% and with growth of 8.3% in underwriting and 12.2% in claims. Our subscription revenues, which comprised 80% of our total revenue in the quarter, grew 9.3% on an OCC basis, with growth in almost all our subscription-based solutions.\nMore specifically, on the drivers of growth in subscription revenues, during the quarter, we experienced the continued benefit on certain of our revenues from the stronger net premium growth in 2021, which is currently reflected in some of our contract pricing as well as a lower level of attrition and consolidation across the industry.\nWithin Property Estimating Solutions, our efforts to expand the ecosystem and drive new innovations like Exact Experts are paying dividends through higher levels of customer retention for our contractor customers. In anti-fraud, we saw underlying strength in the business with growth augmented by the continued benefit from the conversion to subscription from previously transactional customers through our Claims Essentials bundle. And finally, within Extreme Event solutions, we are benefiting from strong renewals and new customer wins.\nOur transactional revenues, representing 20% of total revenue in the third quarter grew 10.2% on an OCC basis. The largest contributor to growth was again from our Auto Solutions, driven by better-than-expected shopping activity by consumers, and the continued benefit from the large non-rate action deal with a national insurer that we previously communicated.\nOur trends track consistently with the recent J.D. Power data, which pointed to a 12% increase in shopping activity for auto insurance in the third quarter as customers continue to respond to rate increases. That said, we will begin to anniversary the elevated shopping activity in the fourth quarter, so we are expecting that growth to moderate.\nIn addition to gains in auto, our transactional revenue growth also benefited from double-digit growth from life insurance solutions as we are seeing strong customer demand for incremental services. And within our Property Estimating Solutions business, we saw strong transactional growth generated by our expanded set of distribution partners within our ecosystem and from elevated weather events, although not to the level of a large-scale catastrophe. In fact, according to Verisk's PCS data, the third quarter of 2023 had 73 days out of 92 that included a PCS event in the U.S. And 2023 is on track to become a new high for catastrophe frequency likely to bypass 2021, which was the highest year on record to date.\nMoving now to our adjusted EBITDA results. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 11.8% in the third quarter, while total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results, was 54%, up 70 basis points from the reported results in the prior year. This margin rate reflects core operating leverage from the strong revenue growth and cost discipline across the organization. As we've said in the past, the margin rate in any given quarter can be influenced by revenue mix and timing of spending. So we think it's best to look at our margins on a trailing 12-month basis, which in the third quarter were 53.3%, up 150 basis points over last year's level.\nContinuing down the income statement, net interest expense was $29 million for the third quarter compared to $34 million in the prior year. The current level of net interest expense reflects lower year-over-year debt balances as we paid down our revolving credit facility as well as higher interest on cash balances.\nOur reported effective tax rate was 25% compared to 24.2% in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year change in the tax rate is related to the $19 million litigation reserve expense that we mentioned earlier, partially offset by higher stock compensation benefits in this quarter versus the prior year's period. Going forward, we expect the tax rate for the full year 2023 to be near the high end of the originally guided range of 23% to 25%.\nAdjusted net income increased 17% to $221 million, and diluted adjusted EPS increased 27% to $1.52 for the third quarter 2023. These changes reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions and a lower average share count. The share count reflects the impact of our $2.5 billion accelerated share repurchase plan that we entered into in March as well as an additional $50 million worth of share repurchase that we completed in the third quarter.\nRegarding the share count, you can see that while our weighted average diluted shares outstanding declined 7.7% year-over-year, it was essentially flat sequentially.\nFrom a cash flow perspective, on a reported basis, net cash from operating activities decreased 11% to $250 million. while free cash flow declined 9% to $196 million. The decline in both cash flow metrics is a function of the fact that prior year cash flow metrics include the results from previously divested businesses as well as a favorable cash tax impact in the prior year from the sale of our Environmental Health and Safety business. Adjusted for these items, both cash flow metrics increased year-over-year during the third quarter.\nWe are very pleased with the robust year-to-date performance. Our guidance for 2023 remains unchanged. We now expect revenue to be towards the high end of our range of $2.63 billion to $2.66 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is still expected to be between $1.39 billion to $1.43 billion, adjusted EBITDA margin in the 53% to 54% range and adjusted EPS in the range of $5.50 to $5.70. A complete listing of all guidance measures can be found in the earnings slide deck, which has been posted to the Investors section of our website, verisk.com.\nWe do want to remind you that the fourth quarter of 2022 included $6 million in revenue associated with Hurricane Ian as well as tax benefit associated with the divestiture of Wood Mackenzie. And now I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments.\n\nLee M. Shavel\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThanks, Elizabeth. In summary, we are excited about our business momentum and the opportunity ahead. Our motivating purpose is to partner with our clients in building resilience for individuals, communities and businesses globally. The combination of our focused business model, deep customer relationships and strategy to deliver value for clients to improve decision-making and operational efficiency is a formula that will also deliver value to our shareholders through growth and returns. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to 1 question. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions. ."

This call is being recorded [Operator Instructions]. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.\n\nStacey Jill Brodbar\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Verisk Analytics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Avi, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our second quarter 2023 financial results. On the call today are Lee Shavel, Verisk's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Elizabeth Mann, Chief Financial Officer.\nThe earnings release referenced on this call as well as our traditional quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verus.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in.\nAs set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance, including those related to our financial guidance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings.\nFinally, I'd like to remind everyone that the financial results for recent dispositions are included in our consolidated and GAAP results but are excluded from all organic constant currency growth figures. A reconciliation of reported and historic non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call is provided in our 8-K and today's earnings presentation posted on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. However, we are not able to provide a reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable expected GAAP results because of the unreasonable effort and high unpredictability of estimating certain items that are excluded from projected non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, including, for example, tax consequences, acquisition-related costs, gains and losses from dispositions and other nonrecurring expenses, the effect of which may be significant.\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee Shavel.\n\nLee M. Shavel\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThanks, Stacy. Good morning, and thank you for participating in today's call. I'm excited to be with you today to provide an update on how our strategy, focus and results-oriented culture is translating into strong financial performance for Verisk. I will leave the details of the financial results to Elizabeth. But in summary, Merus delivered continued business momentum in the second quarter, underscored by strong organic revenue growth and solid margin expansion, translating into double-digit profit growth. We are driving these results by focusing on our clients' most pressing needs as they deal with an environment marked by elevated underwriting losses, including those from catastrophes and high levels of inflation, leading to pressure on profitability.\nWe have elevated the conversation and directed our sales focus to the solutions in our portfolio best suited to solve those challenges. A byproduct of the tough operating environment is a hardening of the insurance market as carriers are taking rate actions to help drive improved profitability, leading to stronger net written premium growth. Rate takes time to work through, so we expect this environment to persist into 2024. The cross currents of elevated underwriting losses and increasing pricing in the insurance industry has become a hot topic across the press with headlines about trouble spots like Florida and California. Specific to Florida, since our last update, there has been little change as we have not seen any additional liquidations, though uncertainty remains. We continue to watch the market carefully, particularly as we head into the Atlantic hurricane season. We are also keeping a keen eye out for new financial stability ratings for the Florida market, which we expect in the next few weeks and could identify further deterioration in the market.\nRecent legislative reforms in the property market are expected to have a positive impact, but it may take some time for that to materialize. In California, current regulation restricts insurers from using catastrophe models and ratemaking, but the Department of Insurance is exploring a change to that policy. To that end, Verisk recently testified in front of the California State Assembly, joint hearing, insurance and emergency management as the expert on catastrophe models and how their use can help insurers assess risk from low frequency, high severity events like wildfires, ultimately benefiting the residents and businesses in the state. This is a great example of our enhanced industry engagement as we leverage our expertise to benefit all the players in the insurance ecosystem, including carriers and regulators and build resilience for consumers and businesses.\nAs I discussed at Investor Day and on prior calls, a key pillar in our strategy is elevating and strengthening the strategic dialogue with our clients. To that end, I had the opportunity in the second quarter to visit with many of our clients in the U.S. to understand their focus and explore how we can better support their objectives. These conversations generated several initiatives for expanded dialogue with C-suite support to accelerate opportunities on technology and data initiatives, particularly regarding inflationary impacts. During a visit to Europe, I encountered similar opportunities with our clients there as well as exceptional energy and focus at Verisk offices in London, Malaga, Cracow and Cologne. The message that we hear is very similar across industry participants, large and small, U.S. and international. We welcome Verisk's expertise in partnership to drive more automation, lower our investment cost and improve efficiency. Given our mission-critical data, deep customer relationships and engagement and scale, no one is better positioned to meet this need than Verisk.\nA key extension of our conversations with our clients is our innovation agenda. We are listening to our customers and designing solutions to meet their most pressing needs. For example, we recently launched a new solution for carriers, contractors and adjusters within our property estimating solutions called Exact Expert. Exact Expert is a no-code, low-code bot-based rules engine designed to streamline the insurance restoration and claims estimation process. Exact Expert targets the key challenges our clients face, including inaccurate and incomplete information and claims estimates, high compliance needs, pressure to reduce cycle times, revisions, loss adjustment expenses and a need for more digital and simplified processes for a changing workforce demographic. Further, it empowers carriers, contractors and adjusters to customize organizational estimating behaviors, delivering quick, accurate claims estimation by reducing manual input errors and driving consistency, accuracy and efficiency throughout the claims estimating process. We are seeing strong interest from our customers for this newly launched solution. In our antifraud solutions, we recently launched image forensics, an AI tool designed to detect fraud in digital images submitted as part of the claims settlement process.\nImage use and claims processing has grown exponentially with more and more images being submitted directly by the claimant. In fact, just since mid-2020, photo estimates for auto claim settlement have doubled. And while virtual claims processing is driving industry efficiency and customer satisfaction, it is also exposed insurers to an increasing source of fraud from activities like reusing prior loss images using Internet images or digital or document manipulation. We are leveraging the depth and breadth of our customers' relationships in building a contributory image database, combining it with images sourced from Verisk's Property estimating solutions databases to provide images in match reports and indications if an image was used in a prior loss. Image forensics is also a great example of how our innovation engine is now actively associating data sets that were previously siloed into powerful new tools for our customers as this tool combines data from antifraud with data from property estimating solutions. I know that generative AI has been top of mind for many.\nAt Verisk, we have been using artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision and natural language processing in many of our solutions for some time. For example, our Mozart forms composer uses machine learning and natural language processing to help insurers organize, track, edit and analyze insurance policy forms with greater consistency, efficiency and speed. This tool employs advanced technology to digitize a historically document-driven process and addresses a major pain point for our clients. managing the complex and growing problem of analyzing policy language across multiple lines and states while enhancing their ability to customize policy language more quickly. With regard to generative AI, we are currently testing private versions of generative AI and are making an index of possible use cases focused on both customer-facing solutions and internal efficiency opportunities. We are working in partnership with our customers and state regulators to ensure that we are approaching this innovative technology with a focus on ethical use in fairness.\nFinally, I would like to formally welcome Samantha Vaughan to Verisk as our Chief Privacy Officer. Data governance and stewardship have always been a key focus for Verisk, and Vaughan will lead the oversight and enhancement of our policies to protect the data entrusted to Verisk and will help ensure the integrity of Verisk's data practices, regulation and compliance. In addition to the focus and dedicated privacy leadership, our new privacy officer expands on the thought leadership Verisk is providing across the insurance industry. As technology and data capabilities expand, the privacy risks expand as well. Concerns about AI, data risk management and security, all have a key nexus in privacy, and we are glad to be joining the best-in-class companies that articulate a values-based approach to the privacy office.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Elizabeth to review our financial results.\n\nElizabeth Mann\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Lee, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'm pleased to share that Verisk delivered strong second quarter financial results.\nOn a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue was $675 million, up 10% versus the prior year and income from continuing operations was $204 million, up 18% versus the prior year, reflecting strong growth across both underwriting and claims. Diluted GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.35, up 9% versus the prior year.\nMoving to our organic constant currency results adjusted for nonoperating items, as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, our operating results demonstrated strong and broad-based growth from most of our businesses, aided by some in-period transactional benefits. In the second quarter, OCC revenues grew 9.8% and with growth of 9.3% in underwriting and 11.2% in claims. This quarter's result was boosted by certain transactional revenues that we do not expect to repeat in the back half of the year. Our subscription revenues, which comprised 79% of our total revenue in the quarter, grew 9.1% on an OCC basis. We saw contributions across nearly all of our subscription offerings. More specifically on the drivers of growth in subscription revenues. During the quarter, we experienced the continued benefit on certain of our revenues from the stronger net written premium growth in 2021, which is currently reflected in some of our contract pricing. In anti-fraud, we are driving accelerated growth from the successful conversion to subscription from previously transactional customers through our claims essential bundle. And in property estimating solutions, we continue to benefit from strong contractor subscription growth as contractors are realizing the value of being part of the Verisk network, particularly with the active weather patterns we are undergoing. In fact, according to Verisk's Property Claim Services, PCS, in 70-plus years of history, this was the most active first half of the year on record from a weather event perspective, dominated by hail, wind and thunderstorms.\nFinally, liquidations and consolidation across the industry was lower than historic average during the quarter, but we continue to anticipate some normalization in the second half of the year. Our transactional revenues representing 21% of total revenue in the second quarter grew 12.4% on an OCC basis. The largest contributor to growth for the second consecutive quarter was from our auto solutions, driven by increased rate shopping by consumers and the continuation of a large nonrate action deal with a national insurer that we told you about last quarter. Our trends are reflective of those noted by recent J.D. Power data, which pointed to a 13% increase in shopping activity for auto insurance in the second quarter as consumers react to rate increases. However, J.D. Power also noted that carrier switching increased a much more modest 4%, which may suggest a potential slowing of the market going forward.\nIn addition to gains in auto, our transactional revenue growth also benefited from double-digit growth from life insurance solutions as we are seeing strong customer demand for incremental services. And within our extreme events business, we saw a very strong transactional growth related to securitization as the second quarter marked a record for new issuance in the catastrophe bond market. I will remind you that the catastrophe bond market is seasonal, and we do not expect this level of activity to continue in the second half of 2023. These transactional results also included some onetime benefits, including overage charges on specific large underwriting contracts that renewed in the quarter.\nMoving now to our adjusted EBITDA results. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 12.6% in the second quarter, reflecting core operating leverage on the strong revenue growth and the impact of certain cost reduction actions we have taken in connection with our margin expansion objectives.\nTotal adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results, was 54.1%, up 160 basis points from the reported results in the prior year. On a pro forma basis for all divestitures, the second quarter margin expanded 140 basis points from margins of 52.7% in Q2 '22. The margin rate in any given quarter can be influenced by the revenue mix, leading to a seasonal pattern in our margins. As such, we think it's helpful to look at our margins on a trailing 12-month basis within the second quarter were 53.1% on a trailing 12-month basis, up 140 basis points over the prior period.\nThe year-over-year change in the second quarter margin reflects the impact of certain onetime expenses in the prior year quarter as well as strong cost and operational discipline and the impact of our cost reduction program. This was offset in part by higher levels of performance-based compensation, including commissions related to our stronger year-to-date performance as well as a decrease in our pension credit, negative margin impact from recent acquisitions and higher T&E expenses. Reflecting on our ongoing cost reduction plans, we continue to have confidence in our ability to deliver on the margin targets that we articulated in our 2023 guidance and at Investor Day in mid-March.\nContinuing down the income statement. Net interest expense was $31.6 million for the second quarter compared to $31.9 million in the prior year. With the divestitures now behind us, the proceeds from the sales directed to our $2.5 billion accelerated share repurchase plan and the long-term capital structure now in place. We now expect this current level of net interest expense to be at a similar quarterly run rate for the remainder of the year. On taxes, our reported effective tax rate was 23.8% compared to 19.2% in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year change in the tax rate is related to lower stock compensation benefits in this quarter versus the prior year's period. Going forward, we still expect the tax rate for the remainder of the year to be in the originally guided range of 23% to 25%. Adjusted net income increased 8.5% to $219.8 million, and diluted adjusted EPS increased 18.9% to $1.51 for the second quarter 2023. These changes reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions and a lower average share count, offset in part by a higher tax rate.\nWith regard to the share count, we received the vast majority of the shares from the $2.5 billion accelerated share repurchase plan when we entered into the plan back in March. And while we did not make any repurchases in the second quarter, we do have the ability to repurchase some additional shares outside of the ASR, and we may do so in the future. From a cash flow perspective, net cash from operating activities increased 48% to $193 million due to strong operations and a decrease in cash taxes paid. The decrease in taxes paid is primarily related to the nonrecurring gain on the 3 disposition in the prior year quarter. Though there was also a onetime cash tax payment of $17 million paid in the second quarter of 2023 related to the energy divestiture. I will remind you that the prior year cash flow metrics include the results from previously divested businesses.\nTurning to guidance. Given our strong half -- strong first half performance as well as the contribution from recent acquisitions, we are increasing our financial outlook for 2023. We have posted a summary of all guidance measures in the earnings deck on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. Specifically for 2023, we now expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $2.63 billion to $2.66 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.39 billion to $1.43 billion. We continue to expect adjusted EBITDA margins to be in the range of 53% to 54%. Walking further down the P&L, we still expect fixed asset D&A to be between $175 million and $195 million and intangible amortization to be approximately $70 million. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to currency variability, the timing of purchases, the completion of projects and future M&A activity.\nRegarding capital expenditures, we now expect CapEx to be between $220 million and $240 million, reflecting increases associated with recent acquisitions, as well as our continued focus on investing organically behind our highest return on investment opportunities. These include a modernization of our forms, rules and loss costs, a migration of our extreme events platform to a cloud-native architecture and further investments across our growth businesses. We are also investing in an upgrade of our financial and human capital system that will enable future efficiencies once implemented. As previously communicated, we expect the tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%, bringing adjusted earnings per share to a range of $5.50 to $5.70.\nAnd now I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments.\n\nLee M. Shavel\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThanks, Elizabeth. In summary, we're excited about the opportunity ahead and our ability to focus all our attention, talent and resources on the global insurance industry. Verisk is best positioned to capitalize on the opportunity because of our scale and expertise. Our motivating purpose is to work together with our clients in building resilience for individuals, communities and businesses globally.\nThe combination of our focused business model, deep customer relationships and strategy to deliver value for clients through improved decision-making and operational efficiency is a formula that we're confident will also deliver value to our shareholders through growth and returns. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk.\nGiven the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to 1 question. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introductions, I would now like to turn the call over to Verisk Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.\n\nStacey Jill Brodbar\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Verisk Analytics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mandeep, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our first quarter 2023 financial results. On the call today are Lee Shavel, Verisk's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Elizabeth Mann, Chief Financial Officer.\nThe earnings release referenced on this call as well as our traditional quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in.\nAs set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance, including those related to our financial guidance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings.\nFinally, I'd like to remind everyone that the financial results for recent dispositions are included in our consolidated and GAAP results but are excluded from all organic constant currency growth figures. A reconciliation of reported and historic non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call is provided in our 8-K and today's earnings presentation posted on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. However, we are not able to provide a reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable expected GAAP results because of the unreasonable effort and high unpredictability of estimating certain items that are excluded from projected non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, including, for example, tax consequences, acquisition-related costs, gain/loss from dispositions and other nonrecurring expenses, the effect of which may be significant.\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee Shavel.\n\nLee M. Shavel\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThanks, Stacey. Good morning, and thank you for participating in today's call. At our Investor Day in mid-March, we detailed the benefits of being an insurance-focused business and our comprehensive strategy to drive consistent, predictable growth at Verisk. Our first quarter results demonstrate the sharpened focus and results-oriented operating plan at Verisk. We are operating on a more integrated basis across the company and have been more engaged with our clients, as I'll describe in greater detail.\nI will leave it to Elizabeth to walk through the details of the financials. But in summary, we delivered very strong organic revenue growth combined with solid margin expansion yielding double-digit profit growth. The growth was broad-based with most businesses contributing to the result, and we have strong business momentum. We delivered this performance despite a macroeconomic environment marked by high inflation, interest rate volatility and market anxiety.\nSpecific to the insurance industry, our customers are coming off a year marked by elevated underwriting losses and pressure on profitability. In fact, the U.S. property casualty insurers experienced a $27 billion net underwriting loss in 2022, the largest loss since 2011, according to industry data collected by Verisk and the American Property Casualty Insurance Association.\nMoreover, profitability was under pressure as reflected in deteriorating combined ratios at 103% in 2022 versus almost 100% in 2021. One consequence of this tough loss in profitability environment in 2022 has been a hardening insurance market where rate increases are driving faster net written premium growth in the first quarter reports of many major insurers. Verisk is partnering with the industry to help them reduce costs, better select and price risk, root out fraud and overall operate more efficiently, given the macro environment.\nOne problem area has been the state of Florida. As we have discussed in prior calls, the insurance crisis in Florida is being driven by a litigious environment, further complicated by extreme event vulnerability. The combined impact is pushing insurers into insolvency. The state legislature has passed reforms to address the crisis, and there are currently efforts be negotiated to bring increased oversight to the state's insurance market.\nThat said, the risk for more liquidations remains. And we continue to monitor both the primary and reinsurance markets closely while leaning in with our customers to help them adapt to new legislation, to better select and price risk in the state and to identify the systemic bad actors in the market.\nA second area of challenge has been auto underwriting as insurers pulled back on writing new policies as they awaited regulatory approval for rate increases. Rate actions have started to roll through. And in the first quarter, we saw a rebound in policyholder shopping activity in response to higher rates, driving strong transactional revenue growth for Verisk this quarter.\nThat said, we have yet to see behavior change on the part of the underwriters as they are still cautious about spending on marketing and underwriting new policies. We continue to expect that improvement in the back half of the year.\nOne key pillar in our strategy that we discussed at Investor Day is being a more client-centric organization and the importance of strengthening the strategic dialogue with our clients and intensifying our industry engagement. To that end, I've been leading the organization with direct client engagement through full relationship reviews at several of our largest clients where we've been able to identify how we can best serve them and integrate new solutions to meet their specific objectives.\nI've also hosted our first CEO roundtable, where we brought together the leaders of our clients to discuss the issues that are foremost in their minds and where we can leverage our centrality and expertise to help address these issues. This has been followed by a client Chief Information Officer roundtable, where we brought our technology leadership headed by our CIO, Nick Daffan; and Chief Data Officer, Eric Schneider, to discuss technology and analytics trends that are on the minds of insurance industry CIOs.\nIn particular, generative AI was a hot topic. And we discussed how we can help the industry develop safe, ethical and effective use cases and guide policy. Our clients are recognizing the early benefits of change and focus at Verisk and have provided great feedback.\nA recent quote from an important client stated, \"I can't remember a meeting with this degree of transparent dialogue where I felt like Verisk was listening.\" Our recent NPS scores also reflect this change in perception. Verisk conducts customer relationship surveys twice a year. And our recent NPS scores in the first quarter of 2023 were 47, up 4 points versus this time last year.\nFurther, so far this year, we have hosted 3 in-person client events. At all our events, clients can engage with our solutions and hear directly from those clients who use the products in the market and learn how effective they are in helping solve industry challenges.\nMore specifically, in February, our claims business hosted 2 events, including Elevate, our signature event for claims and restoration professionals, which provided educational and networking sessions for over 600 [indiscernible] professionals. We also hosted almost 300 industry participants at IFM, an industry-wide event targeting the latest issues and advances in fraud management.\nIn the U.S. alone, insurance fraud is estimated to cost the industry $300 billion annually, impacting industry profitability, and Verisk is uniquely positioned to help the industry. We host this event in partnership with the National Insurance Crime Bureau. Both events included expert panel discussions featuring our clients and partners, leading academics and thought leaders in the industry covering top-of-mind issues.\nIn April, we hosted the inaugural Verisk Insurance Conference and hosted almost 600 clients for a 4-day multitrack conference designed to deliver a combination of product and thought leadership-focused content to key extreme events, life and underwriting decision-makers in insurance and reinsurance. This comprehensive event, which combined 3 previously separate events, enabled us to educate our clients and prospects about Verisk's end-to-end capabilities while continuing to provide them with valuable content applicable to their specific role in organization.\nIt raised the awareness of the breadth and depth of solutions we offer to solve the industry's biggest challenges and really highlighted the benefits of the integrated Verisk approach. We saw a great response to this event with almost half of the extreme events professionals attending underwriting sessions and 40% of the underwriting attendees joining an extreme event session.\nA recent notable competitive contract win in our Extreme Events business is a great example of the benefits of being more focused and more integrated across Verisk. We recently signed a large multiyear contract expansion with a global insurer for extreme events platform, Touchstone. This client, who is already a subscriber to our property underwriting data solutions, will partner with Verisk in a workflow that will directly integrate those data solutions into the Touchstone platform.\nThis partnership not only allows the client to obtain an enhanced view of their catastrophe loss potential based on various data with minimal operational friction, but it also gives Verisk the opportunity to market the feasibility of the same solution to a broader range of market participants.\nWhat struck me at both our claims and underwriting events after dozens of client conversations was the genuine enthusiasm our clients have for our ability to help them address industry issues with our scale and centrality. A commonly expressed sentiment is Verisk has a unique perspective, and we know you can help us. This is a tremendous privilege for us, and we are more mindful of our responsibility to create value for our clients and stakeholders. We are particularly excited about the opportunity it represents to find new channels for growth.\nOn the technological transformation front, we recently achieved a major milestone as we have successfully sunset our mainframe. The scope and complexity of this project was massive. And our technology teams worked tirelessly to shut down a [indiscernible] old mainframe in just 5 years.\nI want to thank my colleagues for their hard work and dedication to modernizing our legacy technology footprint. This move allowed us to modernize our operations and provide a better experience for our customers. Equally importantly, it enables Verisk to allocate more of our technology resources towards innovation to drive future growth.\nFinally, I wanted to share that we recently published our 2022 corporate social responsibility report. This year's report offers a view of our ESG journey and our work to help build global resilience for individuals, communities and businesses. We continue to pursue sustainability and growth through the lens of a responsible ESG framework.\nOn the environmental front, this year, we established a Climate Advisory Council to glean strategic guidance on climate change and receive climate-related feedback on our forthcoming solutions. Moreover, Verisk's sustainability team is currently working with an independent consultant to help the company complete a report, meeting the expectations set forth by the task force on climate-related financial disclosures.\nAs part of the exercise, we are conducting analysis assessing the impact of climate change, both on Verisk's direct operations and across key elements of its value chain and developing a realistic pathway to support science-based targets and a commitment to net zero targets. The team is also engaging with internal stakeholders regarding Verisk's current risk assessment activities and framework for identifying climate-related opportunities. We expect to publish the report in late 2023.\nRegarding governance, over the last 12 months, Verisk took steps to enhance our governance at the Board level, including making changes to provide for the annual election of directors and separating the role of Chair and CEO. We also took steps to refresh our Board, welcoming 4 new independent directors, who bring fresh perspectives and valuable skill and experience sets.\nAs of the 2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, 4 directors, namely Annell Bay, Chris Foskett, [indiscernible] and David Wright will be retiring from the Board. I would like to express my gratitude to each of these directors for their leadership and guidance, which have been invaluable to Verisk's journey and transformation. These changes will bring our Board to a total of 10 members, 90% of whom are independent and 60% are gender or racially diverse.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Elizabeth to review our financial results.\n\nElizabeth Mann\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Lee, and good day to everyone on the call. Before I start with the first quarter results, I have a few reminders for everyone. First, all consolidated and GAAP numbers are negatively impacted by dispositions of 3E and Verisk Financial Services. This will be the final quarter of this year-over-year comparison.\nSecond, as it was in the prior quarter, Wood Mackenzie is accounted for as discontinued operations on our income statement, and results are not included in continuing operations for either period. Third, all cash flow metrics include the results of all 3 disposed businesses in the prior year figures.\nTurning to the financial results. I am pleased to share that we delivered a strong first quarter. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue was $652 million, up 1% versus the prior year, reflecting growth in Insurance, offset by the impact of the VFS and 3E disposition. Income from [indiscernible] operations was $194 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share attributable to Verisk was $1.27.\nMoving to our organic constant currency results. Adjusted for nonoperating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, we are pleased with our operating results, which demonstrated strong core underlying performance across most of our businesses, aided by some in-period onetime benefits.\nIn the first quarter, OCC revenues grew 9.8% with growth of 9.1% in underwriting and rating and 11.4% in claims. This quarter's results was boosted by certain transactional revenues that we do not expect to repeat for the remainder of 2023.\nOur subscription revenues, which comprised 80% of total revenue in the quarter, grew 8.7% on an OCC basis. We saw broad-based growth across most of our businesses with strength in core underwriting, property estimating solutions, extreme events, antitrust, life insurance solutions and many of our international businesses.\nSpecific to our core line services, we are experiencing a benefit on certain of our revenues from the stronger net premium growth in 2021, which is currently reflecting in our contract pricing. Working against this is a modest negative impact from the 7 liquidations in Florida that occurred over the last 12 months and which we discussed earlier. We do expect the impact from liquidations overall to become more pronounced as we move throughout the year.\nOur transactional revenues, representing 20% of total revenue in the first quarter, grew 14.4% on an OCC basis. The largest contributor to growth was from a strong rebound in our auto businesses driven by increased rate shopping and the signing of a large nonrate action deal with national insurer.\nAdditionally, we experienced double-digit growth from life insurance solutions as we are seeing strong customer demand for incremental services. Our travel solutions are benefiting from a post-COVID rebound, particularly in markets like Australia and New Zealand. And our property estimating solutions experienced continued storm benefit in the quarter. These transactional results did include some onetime benefits, including overage charges on specific large underwriting contracts that renewed in the quarter and catch-up billing for certain claims customers.\nFinally, the casualty workers' compensation business delivered growth in the quarter but continues to remain below pre-COVID level and is recovering at a pace slower than we had originally expected. On the auto underwriting side, we did see solid growth in transaction volume this quarter versus declines last year as rate increases are now driving shopping behavior by policyholders. However, as Lee mentioned earlier, carriers continue to be cautious and have pulled back on marketing spend to attract new customers as they measure the impact of rate increases on profitability. To that end and given the transactional nature of this business, we are cautiously optimistic about the outlook for auto as we move throughout the year.\nMoving now to our adjusted EBITDA results. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 15.7% in the first quarter, reflecting core operating leverage on the strong revenue growth and the impact of certain cost reduction actions we have taken in connection with our margin expansion objective. Total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results, was 52.2%, up 480 basis points from the reported results in the prior year.\nOn a pro forma basis for all divestitures, the first quarter margin expanded 320 basis points from margins of 49% in Q1 of '22. This reflects the impact of certain onetime expenses in the prior year quarter as well as strong cost and operational discipline and the impact of our cost reduction program.\nThis level of margin also does include several headwinds, which in total represent about 150 basis points and include a decrease in our pension credit, pressures from recent [indiscernible] and higher T&E expenses, offset by foreign currency realized gains in the quarter. Reflecting on our ongoing cost reduction plan, we continue to have confidence in our ability to deliver on the margin targets that we articulated in our 2023 guidance and at Investor Day in mid-March.\nDuring the quarter, we also took actions to put in place a permanent capital structure for the new Verisk as well as actively manage the balance sheet to take advantage of the $3.1 billion in proceeds we received from the closing of the Wood Mackenzie transaction. To that end, in February 23, we paid down $1.4 billion in debt that was outstanding on our revolver. On March 3, we issued $500 million of 10-year senior notes at a rate of 5.75%, bringing our total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter to $2.85 billion.\nWe then entered a $2.5 billion accelerated share repurchase plan and received an initial delivery of 10.7 million shares in the quarter. We expect to receive the final shares when the program is completed in the fourth quarter.\nThe net result of these actions in the quarter was net interest expense of $26.4 million for the first quarter compared to $31.3 million in the prior year. Included in this number was $7.4 million in interest income that we earned on the proceeds of the Wood Mackenzie transaction, which we do not expect to continue as the proceeds are now fully deployed. Having now completed all these transactions, we now expect net interest expense for 2023 to be slightly below the full year 2022 level.\nOn taxes, our reported effective tax rate was 27.1% compared to 17.4% in the prior year quarter. This higher tax rate included a onetime tax charge of $15.2 million associated with the structuring of the energy sale, which closed in the quarter, offset in part by higher stock compensation benefit versus the prior year period. Going forward, we expect the tax rate for the remainder of the year to be in the originally guided range of 23% to 25%.\nAdjusted net income increased 9.4% to $196.4 million, and diluted adjusted EPS increased 16.2% to $1.29 for the first quarter of 2023. These changes reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions and a lower average share count, offset in part by higher tax rate.\nWe are very pleased with the robust [indiscernible] in the first quarter. But given that it is still early in the year, our transactional revenues are inherently less predictable. At this time, we are maintaining our outlook for 2023. While the first quarter showed strong operating momentum, based on what we see today, we have not changed our expectations for the balance of the year. To that end, our full year 2023 guidance is unchanged.\nAnd now I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments.\n\nLee M. Shavel\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nIn summary, we're excited about the opportunity ahead and our ability to focus all our attention, talent and resources on the global insurance industry. Verisk is best positioned to capitalize on the opportunity because of our scale, centrality and expertise.\nOur motivating purpose is to work together with our clients in building resilience for individuals, communities and businesses [indiscernible]. The combination of our focused business model, unique market position and strategy to deliver value for clients through improved decision-making and operational efficiency is the formula that will also deliver value to our shareholders through predictable growth and returns. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk. [Operator Instructions]\nWith that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

This call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nFor opening remarks and introductions, I would now turn -- like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, you may go ahead.\n\nStacey Jill Brodbar\n\nHead of IR, Verisk Analytics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Devin, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our fourth quarter 2022 financial results. On the call today are Lee Shavel, Verisk's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Elizabeth Mann, Chief Financial Officer.\nThe earnings release referenced on this call as well as our traditional quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-K can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in.\nAs set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone, today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance, including those related to our financial guidance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings.\nFinally, I'd like to remind everyone that the financial results for recent dispositions are included in our consolidated and GAAP results, but are excluded from all organic constant currency growth figures. A reconciliation of reported and historic non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call is provided in our 8-K and today's earnings presentation posted on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com.\nHowever, we are not able to provide a reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable expected GAAP results because of the unreasonable effort and high unpredictability of estimating certain items that are excluded from projected non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, including, for example, tax consequences, acquisition-related costs, gain or loss from dispositions and other nonrecurring expenses, the effect of which may be significant.\nAnd now I would like to turn the call over to Lee Shavel.\n\nLee M. Shavel\n\nCEO, President, COO & Director, Verisk Analytics, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you, Stacey, and thanks to you all for participating today. We've really been looking forward to this call because it's our first opportunity to reintroduce Verisk in our new insurance-focused configuration, to discuss the momentum in the fourth quarter and given all the structural changes, give you a forward view of our expected performance in 2023. We accomplished an extraordinary amount in 2022, so let me provide a brief summary.\nFirst, there's been a lot of structural change. In March, we sold 3E, our environmental health and safety business, for net cash proceeds of $575 million. In April, we sold Verisk Financial Services for net cash proceeds of approximately $500 million. And most recently in February, we sold Wood Mackenzie for approximately $3.1 billion.\nWe've begun the process of returning a substantial majority of the after-tax proceeds of those transactions to shareholders through share repurchases as promised. Despite a challenging economic, geopolitical and financing environment, we were able to complete these transactions at attractive valuations through the strong underlying businesses, capable management teams and a well-organized sale process.\nLet's turn to governance change. Structural change wasn't the only transition at Verisk. We also made a number of governance changes that shareholders suggested. We are transitioning to a declassified Board with annual elections. We added 4 new directors with fresh perspectives and experiences: Jeff Dailey, Wendy Lane, Olumide Soroye and Kim Stevenson. We separated the Chairman and CEO role with the election of Bruce Hansen as our new Chair. I have to personally thank Bruce for his advice and leadership through my transition. As a former CEO, he's been a great coach to me as have been all of our directors.\nLet's turn to organizational change. Finally, organizationally, we've had substantial change. In addition to Scott Stephenson's retirement last year, Mark Anquillare stepping down in January and the addition of Elizabeth Mann as our CFO, we have made over a dozen changes in senior management. These have enabled the next generation of management to rise, bringing new energy and fresh perspectives on how we can make Verisk better.\nAt the highest level, I have reconstituted our senior operating committee with 10 colleagues, 6 of whom are new to the committee, who represent a better balance of business unit leaders and corporate leaders for improved integration and coordination. I'm also proud that the committee represents 50% gender diversity and 40% ethnic diversity, a strong signal for our entire organization.\nWe all share the common mission of creating value for our clients, employees and shareholders. With all this change, we were, of course, carefully watching for disruption with our employees and clients. While there is some understandable anxiety with any organizational change, the feedback from employees at 3 town halls, anonymous surveys and informal feedback has been very positive, with enthusiasm for our refocused strategy in insurance and new leadership.\nIn particular, our purpose of working together to build global resilience for individuals, communities and businesses has resonated strongly with our employees as has our new cultural values of learning, caring and results. As I believe all of you can appreciate, what we accomplished in terms of structure and organizational change in 2022 was no foregone conclusion, and the delivery of a clear view of our insurance-only operations in our 10-K was a massively complex exercise.\nIt required the effort, expertise and commitment of hundreds of our employees to accomplish. So I'd like to take this opportunity to personally thank all of our nearly 7,000 employees for their professionalism, commitment and understanding as we have undergone so much change in 2022. They are absolutely talented and critical to our future success.\nWhat we accomplished this year demonstrates what we're capable of ahead. On the client front, we have also received a positive response from many clients who appreciate our renewed insurance focus and desire to improve our relationships across their organizations.\nI experienced this firsthand at our Elevate Conference in Salt Lake City and dozens of client meetings and calls. Their feedback reinforces that while we have been a great product organization, we can be a much better client organization. And that's an area where I'm dedicating substantial time and leading from the front. I've spent most of my career as a client professional, and I'm excited to be returning to this particular role.\nLet's move to financial change. I won't steal Elizabeth's thunder on the financials, however, there are 2 elements that matter most to me in our 2022 performance and what we intend to achieve in 2023.\nFirst is our ability to continue to deliver strong revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth despite the changes and challenging environment in 2022 and the clear momentum in the fourth quarter results. We have clearly demonstrated what Verisk is capable of in the fourth quarter by delivering organic constant currency revenue growth of over 7% in the insurance-only business even after eliminating the impact of storms. I'd also note that fiscal year 2022, the insurance OCC revenue growth of 6.5% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 8% is a solid result for a year of substantial change and macroeconomic challenges and is a strong reflection of the stability of our business and a good foundation to build on to in 2023 and beyond.\nSecond is our delivery of clear margin improvement consistent with the clear goals we set for the insurance-focused business of 300 to 500 basis points improvement from a normalized base of 50% to 51% in 2021. At 52.7% for the fourth quarter, we are on the cusp of delivering at the low end of our targeted range of 53% to 56% for 2024. And our guidance for 2023 is our adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 53% and 54%.\nFinally, we are providing expanded financial guidance for 2023 as a reflection of the complex structural changes in 2022 as well as an expectation of more predictable growth with our refocused business. This decision also reflects the input from many of our shareholders who ask for improved financial guidance. Naturally, it will come with the necessary caveats that we can't predict all contingencies but represents our best assessment of 2023 financial performance.\nSo where does that leave us after all of these changes? We are, as of this moment, a new Verisk, new structurally, organizationally and with a reenergized and refocused purpose values. There's a lot that you'll be familiar with, including our insurance focus, industry centrality, strong market position, stable growth and strong margins. And some new elements that are expanding our growth opportunities in areas such as life assurance, marketing solutions and in our European businesses, including specialty business solutions, where we are improving workflows and efficiency in the Lloyd's nonstandard market. You will also see changes in our expense discipline to drive margin expansion and a new approach to providing financial guidance for the year ahead.\nLet's step back and take a moment to reframe our opportunity. The insurance industry is massive, complex and growing globally. Our clients face substantial technology, regulatory and macroeconomic challenges in a rapidly evolving environment. This is less an assertion than an often repeated sentiment that I hear from the leaders of our clients.\nOne of my favorite client quotes was, \"Lee, we need Verisk's help to address this, but more importantly, the industry needs Verisk's help.\" That crystallizes our opportunity and position. You'll hear at Investor Day from several clients that Verisk is considered a true business partner rather than a vendor and that we work together to collectively solve problems for the insurance industry.\nWe create value for our clients through a simple economic mechanism. We invest in data, analytics and software at scale to address industry needs much more efficiently than individual companies can. We are addressing hundreds of billions of dollars of premiums and expense across the industry to improve revenue growth, risk outcomes, client experience, productivity and margins. These investments deliver real value to the industry and in turn, drive our growth, operating leverage and high incremental returns on capital.\nMuch of this opportunity is realized by facilitating connectivity across the insurance ecosystem, hence, the theme of our annual report for 2022: connecting what matters. To connect, you must be central. You must be trusted, and you must understand the needs of the ecosystem. No company is better positioned than Verisk with our scale, relationships and expertise to create this value for the insurance industry.\nWe're very proud of what we accomplished in 2022, but it was all to put us in this position where we can demonstrate our full potential, focused on serving the substantial and expanding needs of the insurance industry. With a reconfigured and energized organization bound together by a common purpose and values, we are very excited about the path ahead and can already feel the benefits of this better integrated and focused approach. This is the way. As our 2023 financial guidance implies and as you'll hear at our upcoming Investor Day, we believe this path will see continued growth, improving margins and strong returns on capital.\nI'll end with thanks to our shareholders, who encouraged us to consider new approaches and offered their perspectives directly or indirectly through surveys and our analyst community. We and our Board have listened carefully, and our actions and path ahead clearly reflect your input. We are here to expand the opportunity, execute on the plan and deliver value on your behalf. I can't imagine us being in a better position to do so, and we're off to a solid start.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Elizabeth to review our financial results for the quarter, the year and our financial guidance for 2023.\n\nElizabeth Mann\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Verisk Analytics, Inc.\n\nThanks, Lee, and good day to everyone on the call. Before I start with the fourth quarter results, I have a few reminders for everyone. First, all consolidated and GAAP numbers are negatively impacted by the dispositions of 3E and Verisk Financial Services. This effect will continue through the first quarter of 2023 when we will anniversary those transactions.\nSecond, as we described previously, due to its materiality, Wood Mackenzie is accounted for as discontinued operations beginning this quarter. And its results are not included in our revenue or adjusted EBITDA results in either the current period or the prior period.\nThird, in the earnings presentation now posted on the Investors section of our website, we have included certain pro forma quarterly financial metrics, removing the operational results of all our divestitures as well as a reconciliation to our historical reported results, which we hope you will find helpful.\nTurning now to the financial results. I'm pleased to share that we had a strong finish to 2022. For the fourth quarter on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue was $630 million, up slightly versus the prior year, reflecting growth in insurance, offset by the impact of the VFS and 3E dispositions. Income from continuing operations was $216 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share attributable to Verisk was $1.37.\nMoving to our organic constant currency results adjusted for nonoperating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, we are very pleased with our operating results, which demonstrated strong sequential improvement relative to the third quarter as a broad-based recovery across our business contributed to the strongest quarter of the year. In the fourth quarter, OCC revenues grew 8.1%, with growth of 6.5% in underwriting and rating and 11.9% in claims. This quarter's results included $5.6 million in storm-related revenue associated with Hurricane Ian. Excluding the storm-related revenues, OCC revenue would have grown 7.1%.\nOur subscription revenues, which comprise 80% of our total revenue in the quarter, grew 7.2% on an OCC basis. We saw broad-based growth across most of our businesses with strength in core underwriting, property estimating solutions, extreme events, antifraud and life insurance solutions.\nWe did experience a modest negative impact from the liquidations in Florida. As we noted in previous calls, Florida has been a trouble spot for the insurance industry, and the losses from Hurricane Ian add complications. In 2022, the market saw 6 liquidations. And so far in '23, we have seen one company placed into receivership after higher-than-expected losses from Hurricane Ian pushed the carrier into insolvency.\nWe continue to work to offset this headwind through engagement with our customers by helping them adapt to Florida's new roof coverage rules and by better segmenting risk using both new and existing sources such as our roof age data and aerial imagery. Our analytics have been integrated into our LightSpeed platform and can help customers leverage data earlier in their quoting process, ensuring they underwrite risk appropriately as well as help drive nonrate action for in-force policies.\nTransactional OCC revenue growth of 12.1%, representing 20% of total revenue in the fourth quarter, also improved from the third quarter, reflecting the revenues associated with Hurricane Ian. Adjusting for the storm impact, transactional growth was a healthy 8.2%, comprised of continued strong recovery in international travel, strong sales of life insurance solutions and a modest contribution from our workers' compensation business, which is improving though continues to be below pre-pandemic levels. This was offset in part by continued weakness across auto underwriting and marketing solutions.\nOn the auto underwriting side, we continue to see cyclical softness across our auto underwriting and marketing solutions as carriers are dealing with the impact of rising inflation and increasing loss ratios. To that end, carriers have pulled back on underwriting new auto policies as well as on marketing spending to drive new policy volume and customer acquisition.\nCarriers are working to reset pricing, which we think could take another 6 to 12 months to truly take effect. To help our customers bridge this uncertain time and drive growth for Verisk, we are working with them to help identify ways to improve profitability with targeted nonrate actions that minimize premium leakage. We are actively engaging with customers about our risk check renewal product, which allows insurance -- which allows insurers to analyze an entire book of business with minimal IT resources and pinpoint policies that require attention.\nMoving now to our adjusted EBITDA results. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 12.9% in the fourth quarter, reflecting core operating leverage and the impact of certain cost reduction actions we have taken in connection with our margin expansion objectives.\nTotal adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results, was 52.7%, up 210 basis points from the reported results in the prior year, reflecting the benefit from recent dispositions, strong cost and operational discipline, the impact of certain cost reduction actions and the high incremental margins associated with storm-related revenue. This level of margin also includes a number of margin headwinds, including approximately 110 basis points from recent acquisitions as well as 80 basis points from the headwinds from our ongoing technological transformation and higher T&E expenses.\nIn addition, this quarter included certain onetime or nonoperating expenses including severance, FX impact and a decrease in our pension credit, which collectively negatively impacted margins by 190 basis points. Finally, if you compare the fourth quarter margins on a pro forma basis for all divestitures, the 4Q 2022 margins of 52.7% represent an 80 basis point margin expansion from 51.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021 pro forma.\nReflecting on our objective to deliver 300 to 500 basis points of margin improvement in 2024 from a normalized base of 50% to 51% in 2021, we took great strides in 2022, with full year adjusted EBITDA margin of 52% on a pro forma basis reflecting approximately 140 basis points of margin expansion associated with our operational excellence focus. To date, we have made decisions and taken actions to address more than 60% of the run rate cost savings we are targeting.\nThe impact of those actions will be realized through 2024 with about 30% of the cumulated expected cost savings already achieved in the reported results in 2022. Our business continues to demonstrate the operating leverage embedded in our data analytics business model, and we have confidence in our ability to deliver on the objective in 2024.\nInterest expense. Interest expense totaled $41 million for the fourth quarter compared to $30.2 million in the prior year. For the full year, interest expense totaled $139 million versus $127 million in 2021. This increase in interest expense is related to higher balances on our revolving credit facility as well as higher interest rates.\nWe have paid off all borrowings under our credit facility as of February 2023. And in the near term, we'll look to establish a go-forward balance sheet for the business, staying within our targeted leverage range of 2 to 3x adjusted EBITDA.\nTaxes. Our reported effective tax rate was 9.9% compared to 16.8% in the prior year quarter. This lower tax rate included a onetime benefit of approximately $30 million, which was primarily the result of transaction benefits related to our Wood Mackenzie divestitures, offset in part by lower stock compensation benefits versus the prior year period.\nFor the full year '22, our effective tax rate was 17.5% as compared to 22.8% in the prior year, including approximately $67.7 million in benefits related to all our dispositions throughout the year. The net effects of these transaction-related tax benefits was a reduction in our full year effective tax rate of 5.4%.\nAdjusted net income and diluted adjusted EPS. Adjusted net income increased 14% to $225 million, and diluted adjusted EPS increased 18% to $1.43 for the fourth quarter '22. These changes reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions, a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count.\nCapital returns. During the fourth quarter, we returned $514 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends as our strong cash flow allows us to consistently return capital to shareholders while also investing in our business.\nIn particular, included in that amount is $366 million of share repurchases we have completed since the announcement of the Wood Mackenzie transaction back in November. In the coming days, we intend to enter into an additional $2.5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement for a total capital return of $2.87 billion associated with the transaction proceeds. This is consistent with our plan to return the majority of the proceeds from the Wood Mackenzie divestiture to shareholders via share repurchases. We continue to expect the dilution from the transaction to be within the 4% to 6% range.\nLooking ahead to 2023, as Lee mentioned, we have listened to shareholder feedback, and we'll now be providing annual financial guidance. We have posted a summary of all guidance measures in the earnings deck on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com.\nSpecifically, for 2023, we expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $2.59 billion to $2.63 billion versus $2.437 billion in 2022 pro forma. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.37 billion to $1.42 billion versus $1.266 billion in 2022 pro forma and adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 53% to 54%.\nWorking further down the P&L, we expect fixed asset D&A to be between $175 million and $195 million and intangible amortization to be approximately $70 million. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to FX variability, the timing of purchases, the completion of projects and future M&A activity.\nWe also expect capital expenditures to be between $200 million and $230 million as we continue to invest organically behind our highest return on investment opportunities. These include a modernization of our core line services to digitize our industry standard offering and enable expansion into new workflows that improve productivity for the industry. We are also investing in an upgrade of our financial and human capital systems that will enable future efficiencies once implemented.\nAs previously communicated, we expect the tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%, bringing adjusted earnings per share to a range of $5.20 to $5.50. This range represents strong double-digit growth rates on EPS after normalizing for the impact of transaction tax benefits in 2022.\nBefore I turn the call over to Lee, I just want to remind everyone that we will be hosting an Investor Day on March 14 here in Jersey City, where we will provide more transparency and clarity on our strategic profile, growth drivers and long-term financial targets.\nAnd now I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments.\n\nLee M. Shavel\n\nCEO, President, COO & Director, Verisk Analytics, Inc.\n\nThanks, Elizabeth. In summary, we are excited to focus all our attention, talent and resources on the global insurance industry where we can deliver substantial value to our clients through improved decision-making and operational efficiency. We will be engaged more intensively as a strategic technology partner to our clients and the broader insurance industry to identify and develop ways for Verisk to support their objectives.\nWith our scale, relationships and expertise, we are well positioned to help make those connections in this period of accelerated change for the industry and by extension, to the people and communities they serve. Our motivating purpose is to work together with our clients in building resilience for individuals, communities and businesses globally. Combined with our focused business model and unique market position, this is a formula that will deliver value to our shareholders through growth and returns.\nWe continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk. (Operator Instructions) With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

This call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.\n\nStacey Jill Brodbar\n\nHead of IR, Verisk Analytics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Savannah, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our third quarter 2022 financial results. On the call today are Lee Shavel, Verisk's Chief Executive Officer; Mark Anquillare, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Elizabeth Mann, Chief Financial Officer.\nThe earnings release referenced on this call as well as our traditional quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in.\nAs set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone, today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today.

Shavel\n\nCEO & Director, Verisk Analytics, Inc.\n\nThanks, Stacey, and good day, everyone. Before I jump into the earnings results, I want to officially welcome Elizabeth Mann to Verisk. Elizabeth brings operational and corporate finance experience from her 3 years at S&P Global Capital Markets and strategic sophistication from her 12 years of investment banking experience at Goldman Sachs, and finally, an impressive academic foundation and enthusiasm for mathematics that fits perfectly into our analytical culture. She is coming up the curve quickly and has already established herself as a valued part of the team.\nI am pleased to share that we delivered on our stated intention to become a global insurance-focused data analytics and technology company. As we announced on Monday, we have signed a definitive agreement to sell Wood Mackenzie to Veritas Capital for $3.1 billion in cash consideration, payable at closing, plus future additional contingent consideration of up to $200 million. Our ability to achieve this result in the midst of a deteriorating deal environment speaks to the quality of the asset and the momentum of the business.\nWood Mackenzie is the globally recognized leader in natural resources intelligence, with in-depth proprietary data sets and subject matter experts that cover the full energy and natural resource value chain. Since we acquired Wood Mackenzie in 2015, the business has increased revenue and EBITDA; integrated acquisitions; developed new areas of growth in the energy transition, chemicals and metals and mining; and most recently, upgraded their client platform, Lens. This has transformed Wood Mackenzie from an advisory services business focused on transactional research and consulting to a data analytics business bolstered by long-term subscription contracts, a leading brand and market position.\nWe have been honored to work with and support our friends and colleagues at Wood Mackenzie, and we wish them well and look forward to their continued growth and success under the proven leadership of Mark Brinin and Joe Leveque, and their respected future owners, Veritas Capital. The future for Wood Mackenzie is very bright, and we look forward to having an ongoing productive relationship with them.\nThis transaction, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023, will best position Wood Mackenzie to fully capitalize on secular industry tailwinds, including the energy transition, and deliver on the growth opportunity that lies ahead. The closing of this transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. Going forward, the Wood Mackenzie business will be reported as discontinued operations beginning with Verisk's fourth quarter earnings report and 10-K filing.\nWe plan to use the approximate $3.1 billion in proceeds, primarily for share repurchases and debt paydown. After accounting for share repurchase and debt paydown, we expect this transaction to be modestly dilutive to Verisk's earnings in the range of 4% to 6%. That said, over the longer term, we believe the deal will bring Verisk the added benefit of increased focus on our core insurance business, more consistent growth in line with our long-term targets and improved return on capital, which should drive shareholder value.\nNow let me turn my attention to our third quarter earnings results. Verisk delivered solid third quarter results as we partner with our customers to help them navigate through environmental challenges in the marketplace, including inflation and elevated losses in certain lines of insurance.\nAdjusted for the impact of the suspension of commercial operations in Russia, Verisk delivered mid-single-digit organic constant currency revenue growth and margin expansion, resulting in organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth of 7%. This performance reflects our focus on cost discipline, operational efficiency and the early benefits of initial steps taken in previously announced margin improvement initiative. Elizabeth will provide more detail in her financial review.\nOn our EBITDA margin expansion objective, we continue to be confident in our ability to achieve our stated target to deliver 300 to 500 basis points of margin expansion by 2024, an insurance-only baseline of 50% to 51% normalized adjusted EBITDA margins. We have taken actions to enhance operating efficiency, improve productivity and streamline processes.\nDuring the quarter, we eliminated certain roles across the organization, sunset legacy products and reduced office square footage. Additionally, we entered into an agreement to sublease our data center to a third party as we move more of our computing infrastructure to the cloud, delivering long-term savings for Verisk. We have also advanced on our future of data collection project, where we are improving the efficiency and productivity of our field force, which not only saves money, but enhances our solutions.\nWe expect that over the next 2 years, about half of our identified cost savings will come from headcount actions; about 25% from reductions in spending from IT infrastructure; and about 25% from third-party spending, including real estate. To date, we have made decisions and taken actions to address more than half of the cost savings we are targeting.\nTurning to our customers. Our Insurance customers continue to be generally healthy while they're dealing with the cross-currents of inflation and increasing loss ratios, which are negatively impacting profitability across the industry. This is having a disproportionate impact in personal lines, insurtech companies and certain geographic markets.\nWhile insurers are increasing rates to help cover inflation in repair costs, it takes time to get rates approved by the regulators and then implement it across the entire book of business. To date, premium growth has not yet caught up to loss costs. Specifically, in personal auto, we continue to see pressure on underwriting activity across the industry as insurance providers are holding back on writing new business.\nIn fact, combined ratios across the industry continue to trend lower, and as a result, insurers are cutting back on marketing spend as a way to protect profitability. The net result is lower transactional revenues for Verisk across both our personal lines and auto underwriting solutions as well as certain of our marketing solutions. We believe this is a cyclical issue and will abate over time.\nAs we noted last quarter, Florida is a trouble spot for the insurance industry, and the losses from Hurricane Ian add complication. We are experiencing an increasing level of insolvencies across the market, with 4 companies liquidating just this quarter, while other carriers are electing to exit the market entirely. This has had a negative impact on both our subscription and transactional revenues.\nTo address these issues and drive future growth, our sales teams are engaged with the new entrants into the market as well as expanding our relationship with a state-backed insurer to help price and select risk. We are also working with our existing customers to help them understand the impact of inflation across their book of business and to help them price the risks accordingly as policies come up for renewal.\nApart from the near-term challenges, we continue to believe that the opportunity for Verisk to address the long-term strategic and operating needs of the insurance industry remains substantial. In my many conversations with insurance CEOs, they have consistently encouraged us to develop a more strategic dialogue and how we can help the industry address technology, regulatory and operating issues, leveraging our unique and legacy position as an effective utility for the industry.\nTo that objective, we have been coordinating a series of CEO and CIO roundtables to develop solutions that can improve industry operating efficiency and capital efficiency as well as productivity. While these initiatives will take time to develop and implement, they represent a substantial incremental opportunity for Verisk. We are very excited about the opportunity to engage with the industry at the strategic level and broaden our technology partnership with them.\nIn recognition of our commitment to innovate on behalf of clients, Verisk was recognized by Celent as a Luminary for developing innovative solutions that help property, casualty and life insurers detect claims fraud. Our solutions were recognized by highly advanced functionality and ability to integrate with third-party data, driving faster outcomes and a more accurate claims experience.\nSimilarly, we are committed to creating value for our employees, which includes providing an exceptional workplace. And we were awarded the Great Place to Work designation this year in the U.S., U.K., India, Spain and New York. We were also recognized as a Great Place To Work for Women in the U.K. In today's rapidly evolving workplace, we are focused on talent attraction, development and retention by supporting our teammates' passion and having a purpose-driven culture that allows unlimited success.\nFinally, as a demonstration of our commitment to ESG priorities, Verisk has been ranked third out of 100 Best ESG Companies in 2022 by Investor's Business Daily. The list recognize companies with superior environmental, social and governance ratings, in addition to fundamental and technical stock performance. We are honored to receive this recognition for our commitment to sustainability and the ability of our strong and growing business to meet customer and investor expectations.\nAs we move forward, I am more confident than ever that with our proprietary data sets, talented and dedicated people, deep industry knowledge and technical expertise, Verisk is best positioned to create value for our customers by helping them evolve in a new digital environment, integrate rapidly growing data sets and achieve new levels of efficiency. This, in turn, will create value for our employees and shareholders.\nI will now turn the call over to Mark for some more color on the Insurance business performance.\n\nMark V. Anquillare\n\nPresident & COO, Verisk Analytics, Inc.\n\nThanks, Lee. I'm pleased to share that the Insurance segment delivered another solid quarter. In Insurance, we are experiencing strong growth in subscription revenues across both underwriting and claims, resulting in OCC subscription growth of 6.1% for the segment overall.\nWithin Underwriting, we had strong results from core underwriting, extreme event solutions and our international businesses. We also had healthy contribution with double-digit growth achieved in certain of our newer acquired businesses, including life insurance and specialty business software solutions. Extreme event solutions had a strong quarter, driven by the addition of new customers to our core Touchstone platform as well as the expansion of multiyear deals with existing customers.\nWith new environment of rising inflation, insurers and reinsurers are challenged to keep up with the growth in their exposures. To help our customers understand the risk of the inflation and assess their exposures, we recently released our 2022 Global Model Catastrophe Losses Report, detailing key global financial loss metrics based on our latest suite of catastrophe models.\nAdditionally, we are supporting insurers with a broad array of property data solutions so that they can ensure they're keeping up with the impacts of inflation and have a more informed view of risk and ongoing exposures. Our sustainability and country risk business also had a very strong quarter as demand for our risk indices in both the corporate and investor segments continue to drive strong double-digit growth. We're also beginning to get traction with the expansion of our sustainability offerings into the Insurance segment.\nWithin Life Insurance, we're delivering strong double-digit growth through the addition of new customers as well as the expansion of our relationships with existing customers. Our low-code, no-code technology is leading the industry's modernization by helping carriers gain efficiencies and improve profitability at scale with a simpler technology ecosystem and a faster time for implementation.\nWe continue to be excited about the growth potential for our Life business. And our success here serves as a great blueprint for our ability to drive growth and value creation through the extension into large, addressable and adjacent insurance markets.\nInsurance transactional revenues grew a more modest 1.8%. This quarter's transactional revenues were negatively impacted by a lower level of storm activity versus the prior year when Hurricane Ida made landfall in Louisiana, as well as the environmental impact of software results in our personal auto underwriting and marketing businesses. We do expect to see some benefit in the fourth quarter from Hurricane Ian claims, but we caution that some of this can be offset by more liquidations or insolvencies within the core insurance market. Additionally, we expect the environmental headwinds in personal auto and marketing to persist.\nIn our effort to advance the dialogue and our work on ethical AI and algorithm preparedness, we recently coordinated and sponsored the Insurance Fairness Forum, where we presented on social fairness, pricing and underwriting for insurance, with a preliminary study focused on personal auto rate-making.\nDuring the conference, we engaged with consumer advocates, insurance regulators, as we want to ensure that we're at the forefront of the conversation on this very important topic. The insurance industry is inherently trying to differentiate, selecting and pricing risks, but our goal is to ensure that there is no unfair discrimination.\nIn our customer conversations, we hear that they need help to become more automated, more digitally engaged and more connected. The insurance industry is directing their spending towards these projects and, in turn, to Verisk, as a key ecosystem partner to drive these initiatives forward, which has been a key driver of growth for us. The industry continues to look to us to innovate and respond to recent industry events with leading-edge solutions.\nFor example, our Verisk teams responded to Hurricane Ian by helping clients track damage, dispatch adjusters and staff, estimate the cost to repair the damage and speed the claims process to get properties repaired and safely return families to their homes. Our catastrophe loss estimate of $42 billion to $57 billion was an early and accurate estimate of insured losses related to Hurricane Ian, allowing insurers and reinsurers to understand the impact on their portfolios.\nIn California, insurers face new regulatory measures to address rating, property coverage, wildfire from areas. Verisk is helping our customers comply with these new regulations. We continue to help our customers select and price risk and root out fraud with our advanced data and analytics, and believe that we are well positioned to continue to grow as we advance our mission to become the trusted technology partner for the industry.\nNow let me turn the call over to our new CFO, Elizabeth Mann, for financial review.\n\nElizabeth Mann\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Verisk Analytics, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark, and good morning to all of you here on the call. I'm so happy to be here at Verisk and speaking to you today. I have admired the company and its phenomenal Insurance business for over a decade as I worked in the information services sector. And now is a particularly exciting time to join as we have an opportunity to redefine our strategy as a global insurance-focused data analytics and technology company. We can now focus our capital and all of our industry knowledge to support the needs of our customers, as Lee and Mark have already highlighted.\nAs I've joined Verisk over the last 6 weeks, and I've been getting to know the people and digging into the business, I've been focused on a few priorities. The first is a focus on cost discipline and execution against the margin targets we've committed.\nSecond, Lee has established a framework for capital allocation and ROIC metrics, which I intend to continue. The resulting transparency and accountability on our deployment of capital will support our ability to invest with confidence to drive top line growth and strong returns.\nThird, I will prioritize investor engagement, gathering feedback and providing transparency into the business. So I look forward to getting out on the road and meeting all of you.\nLet me now turn to our third quarter results. Before I begin, I want to remind everyone that all consolidated and GAAP numbers are negatively impacted by the recent dispositions of 3E and Verisk Financial Services. This effect will continue through the first quarter of 2023 when we will anniversary those transactions. As noted, due to its materiality, Wood Mackenzie will be accounted for as discontinued operations beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nFor the third quarter of 2022, on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue was $745 million, a modest decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of recent dispositions and foreign currency exchange rate headwinds, which are most pronounced in our Energy segment, offset in part by acquisitions.\nNet income attributable to Verisk decreased 6% to $189 million while diluted GAAP earnings per share attributable to Verisk decreased 3% to $1.20. The decline was primarily due to the dispositions within the former Energy and Specialized Markets and Verisk Financial Services segments, including the loss incurred as part of the true-up of the closing adjustments.\nMoving to our organic constant currency results, adjusted for nonoperating items, as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, we are pleased with our operating results, led by continued growth in our subscription revenues. In the third quarter, OCC revenues grew 4.8%, driven by continued strength in our Insurance segment and continued sequential improvement in our Energy segment.\nOur subscription revenues increased 5.6% while our transactional revenues increased a more modest 1.2%. Adjusting for $3.3 million in prior year revenue associated with our Energy business in Russia, OCC revenue would have grown 5.3% and subscription revenues would have grown 6.2%.\nConsolidated OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 6% in the third quarter. Normalizing for the prior year revenue associated with our Energy in Russia and the incremental expenses associated with exiting that business, OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 7%.\nTotal adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results, was 51.5%, up 160 basis points from the year prior, reflecting strong cost and operational discipline as well as the benefit from recent dispositions. This level of margin includes approximately 60 basis points of headwind from recent acquisitions; 50 basis points of headwind from our ongoing technological transformation, including cloud expenses, which we absorbed into our cost structure; and 40 basis points from higher year-over-year T&E expenses.\nDespite the environment and cyclical headwinds to margin, this quarter's margin expansion is further demonstration of our commitment to efficiency. On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an OCC basis.\nFor Insurance. In the third quarter, Insurance segment revenues increased 5.3%. We saw healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, claims analytics, extreme events, life insurance and specialty business solutions. Subscription revenues increased 6.1%, reflecting tougher comparisons versus last year's 7.9% growth as well as the impact of some of the environmental factors Lee and Mark spoke about earlier.\nTransactional revenues increased 1.8% in the quarter, reflecting a lower level of storm activity in the quarter as well as continued softness from personal auto, underwriting and marketing. This was offset in part by strong recovery growth in international travel insurance solutions. Within workers' compensation, we have seen a return to modest growth, though the business is not yet back to pre-pandemic levels.\nAdjusted EBITDA grew 6.9% in the third quarter while margins declined 70 basis points to 55.2%. These margins reflect a heavier burden from the corporate costs that were previously allocated to businesses that have been disposed as well as the impact of recently acquired businesses, higher cloud expenses and the partial normalization of travel expenses back into the business. This level of margin also includes continued investment in our high-growth areas like life insurance and specialty business solutions and the impact of recently acquired businesses.\nEnergy and Specialized Markets. Revenue increased 2.5% in the third quarter. Normalizing for the impact of our exit from Russia, Energy revenue growth was 5.2%. Our subscription revenues increased 3.5% or 6.8%, normalizing for the Russian exit, led by double-digit growth in energy transition, chemicals and metals and mining research, coupled with modest growth in our core research subscriptions.\nAdditionally, we continue to experience strong adoption and contract expansion from our Lens renewals. Transactional revenues decreased 1.8% as growth was constrained by consulting resources.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased 0.2% in the third quarter, and margins contracted 210 basis points to 34.4%. These adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin figures include $0.2 million in incremental expense related to the suspension of operations in Russia. Normalizing for that impact, adjusted EBITDA growth would have been 7.8%.\nOn taxes. Our reported effective tax rate was 22.7% compared to 20.9% in the prior year quarter. This higher year-over-year tax rate was the result of lower level of stock option activity versus the prior year. Looking ahead to the remainder of 2022, we expect the tax rate in the fourth quarter to be approximately 24% to 26%, reflecting the impact of discontinued operations as well as a lower than originally expected level of stock option activity.\nOn adjusted net income and diluted adjusted EPS. Adjusted net income decreased 1.9% to $230 million, and diluted adjusted EPS increased 1.4% to $1.46 for the third quarter of 2022. These changes reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions and a lower average share count, offset in part by the impact of divestitures and the higher interest expense and tax rate.\nFor free cash flow, net cash provided by operating activities was $280 million for the quarter, down 1.8% from the prior year period due to the loss of operating cash flows related to the dispositions. Normalizing for the impact of the 3E and Verisk Financial Services dispositions, free cash flow would have been up 7.5%.\nCapital expenditures were $66 million for the quarter, up 7% versus last year, reflecting increases in capitalized software development, offset in part by savings on third-party hardware and software as we move to the cloud. We now expect capital expenditures for the full year to be within the range of $270 million to $280 million. This range supports our plans to increase our software investment into core underwriting, where we believe there is a significant opportunity for platform enhancement.\nIn addition, we now expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization to be within the range of $195 million to $205 million, and intangible amortization should be approximately $145 million for the full year 2022. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to foreign currency variability, the timing of purchases, the completion of projects and future M&A activity.\nOn capital returns. During the third quarter, we returned $349 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, as our strong cash flow allows us to consistently return capital to shareholders while also investing in the business. Additionally, in October of '22, we entered into a new $100 million accelerated share repurchase agreement to be completed in the fourth quarter, as is our normal practice.\nLooking ahead, we plan to optimize the use of proceeds from the sale of Wood Mackenzie while also maintaining our leverage range. We will achieve this through a combination of debt paydown and share repurchases and may act opportunistically from a timing standpoint.\nBefore I turn the call back over to Lee, I just want to remind everyone that we will be hosting an Investor Day in March, where we will provide more transparency and clarity on our strategic and financial profile and growth drivers as a global insurance-focused data analytics and technology company.\nAnd now I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments.\n\nLee M. Shavel\n\nCEO & Director, Verisk Analytics, Inc.\n\nThanks, Elizabeth. In summary, our business is strong, as evidenced by our organic constant currency, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA growth of 7% and strong margin performance in the quarter. We are confident that we have the team in place to execute on our operational efficiency plans over the next 2 years and deliver on our margin expansion targets.\nLonger term, we continue to believe as well that the opportunity to create value for our customers and employees will drive value for our shareholders. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to 1 question.\nAnd with that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

This call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions). For opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.\n\nStacey Jill Brodbar\n\nHead of IR, Verisk Analytics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our second quarter 2022 financial results.\nOn the call today are Lee Shavel, Verisk's Chief Executive Officer; Mark Anquillare, President and Chief Operating Officer; and David Grover, Controller, Chief Accounting Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer.\nThe earnings release referenced on this call as well as our traditional quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC.\nA replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. As set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings.\nFinally, I'd also like to remind everyone that the financial results for recent dispositions are included in our consolidated and GAAP results, but are excluded from all organic constant currency growth figures. A reconciliation is provided in our 8-K.\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Verisk's CEO, Lee Shavel.\n\nLee M. Shavel\n\nCEO & Director, Verisk Analytics, Inc.\n\nThanks, Stacey, and good day, everyone. I'm pleased to share that Verisk delivered solid second quarter results. As you review the financial results, please be aware that due to the dispositions of 3E and Verisk Financial Services, certain year-over-year comparisons will be distorted by the impacts of these transactions. For example, the decrease in our free cash flow year-over-year was primarily the result of a significant tax on the realized gain from the sale of 3E. Dave will provide more details in his financial review.\nSecond quarter organic constant currency revenue grew approximately 5% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA grew approximately 4%. Adjusted for the impact of the suspension of commercial operations in Russia, organic constant currency revenue grew approximately 6% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA grew approximately 6%.\nAdjusted EBITDA margins expanded 140 basis points to 51% through cost discipline, operational efficiencies, the benefit of decisions affecting recent portfolio actions and some very early steps taken in our previously announced margin improvement initiative. This level of margin also includes headwinds from cloud transition and a partial normalization of travel and entertainment expenses as we continue to hold more in-person conferences and visits as we engage with our customers.\nWhile overall organic constant currency revenue growth, excluding Russian revenues, was below our long-term targets, we saw solid performance in our subscription revenues, offset by weakness in our transactional revenues due to the continued impact of the work-from-home environment on certain businesses as we'll describe. We did see sequential improvements in the second quarter, reflecting some normalization in certain businesses, including international travel.\nSubscription revenue, organic constant currency growth, excluding Russian revenues, of approximately 7%, representing 81% of total revenue, was solid and improved sequentially in both Insurance and Energy. Insurance OCC subscription revenues were above our 7% long-term target, demonstrating the mission-critical nature of our solutions.\nEnergy subscription growth improved sequentially as positive pricing momentum from our Lens investment and strong annual contract value growth begins to convert into revenue growth. We also had strong growth in our energy transition, chemicals and metals and mining research. Transactional organic constant currency revenue growth of approximately 2%, representing 19% of total revenue, improved slightly in the quarter with sequential improvement in Insurance due to solid underwriting growth, offset by weaker performance in claims due to ongoing declines in workers' compensation claims volumes across the industry of at least 25% and new regulations that went into effect in early 2022 that are slowing clean settlement.\nIn addition, we are also experiencing some softness in personal lines auto related to the market dislocation as Mark will describe in his section. We have seen normalization progress across our businesses and expect this to continue. However, several of these impacts are having longer cycle recovery times than we originally expected.\nEnergy transactional revenue declined modestly on an organic constant currency basis due primarily to resource constraints in our consulting business as a result of strong demand from our professionals, particularly in (inaudible) region as well as tough compares versus last year's rebound level growth rates. You can find more details about our subscription and transactional growth rates by segment in our quarterly earnings deck, which can be found in the Investors section of our website.\nSince taking over the CEO role at the end of May, I've been meeting with the leadership teams of many of our key customers and stakeholders. In these valuable conversations, where I'm learning how we can improve, I hear repeatedly that Verisk is a critical partner with a unique seat to analyze performance and technology across the industries we serve and most importantly, implement technology change for the benefit of all of our clients.\nAs one of our clients put it, not only do we need Verisk's help on this issue, the industry needs your help. Our value proposition is clear. Verisk strategically invests in data and technology at scale to deliver economic value to our customers through operational efficiencies and better decision-making.\nIn both the Insurance and Energy industries, we benefit from the growing demand for data analytics from our customers, along with their increased ability to ingest and use our rapidly growing data sets. We deliver greater value per dollar invested than our clients would be able to individually. And we are in an advantaged position as few companies enjoy closer ties to and a greater understanding of their clients' businesses than Verisk.\nThis is a responsibility that we do not take lightly as it is this unique proposition that will power our growth and drive long-term value creation for shareholders, customers and employees. As we focus and define the strategic orientation over 2022, we expect to lay out our plans in greater detail at an Investor Day in the first quarter of 2023 following the reporting of our fourth quarter 2022 results.\nDuring the second quarter, we made a series of new leadership announcements as we build out the team that will lead Verisk forward. Of importance to many of you on this call, we recently announced that Elizabeth Mann will be joining Verisk as our Chief Financial Officer. Elizabeth joins us from S&P Global, where she was the Chief Financial Officer of the Ratings and Mobility divisions. And before that, she was Senior Vice President of Capital Management, which included oversight of the treasury department.\nElizabeth will bring very relevant experience and a fresh perspective that I know will improve our organization financially and operationally. She will be joining us on September 15, and we look forward to introducing her to you, and she will welcome your perspectives as she comes up the curve on Verisk.\nIn addition, we recently announced that Maroun Mourad has been named President of Claims Solutions. Maroun has been a key leader in our Underwriting and Rating business since 2015, serving as President of ISO Commercial Lines; President, Global Underwriting; and most recently, President, Life and Growth Markets. Maroun brings deep industry expertise from his many leadership roles at Gen Re, AIG, Arch and Zurich across underwriting operations and general management. He also brings a great entrepreneurial spirit and a true customer-centric approach to the business, and is the right leader to help drive our vision of revolutionizing claims for the industry through automation, technology and advanced analytics.\nMaroun takes the reins from Rich Della Rocca, who has retired after 27 years with Verisk. We thank Rich for all of his many contributions to Verisk and wish him very well in his retirement.\nWe also announced that Tim Rayner has been named President of Verisk's Specialty Business Solutions, our U.K.-based business, centered around our [Sequel] suite of insurance software. The Specialty Business Solutions team is a linchpin in our strategy to create an automated and interconnected ecosystem for the Insurance industry in the U.K., EU and beyond, and Tim is the right leader to drive that strategy. Tim joined Verisk in 2018 after a long and successful career in the Insurance industry, holding various leadership roles at Miller Insurance Services.\nNow let me provide an update on both our progress towards being an insurance-focused data analytics solutions provider and our commitment to furthering margin expansion. We are making steady progress on our evaluation of the separation of the Energy business. The preparation of the internal separation analysis and stand-alone financials are ongoing, and we have hired a team of outside advisers, who are engaged in the next phase of our process of developing all alternatives available to us.\nOur timing expectations remain unchanged. And as we have stated previously, our decisions will continue to be guided by shareholder feedback, value considerations and market conditions. As many of you know, we've also undertaken a broad shareholder survey for the benefit of your perspectives, not only on the energy separation, but how we can improve and meeting investor expectations generally.\nOn our EBITDA margin expansion objective, we continue to be very confident in our ability to achieve our stated target to deliver 300 to 500 basis points of margin expansion by 2024 off an insurance-only baseline of 50% to 51% normalized adjusted EBITDA margins. We have taken some early steps, including the restructuring of our marketing function, office space consolidation and a greater emphasis on our global talent optimization hiring.\nAdditionally, we have embarked on a span of control analysis to guide further operational efficiencies. We continue to experience the impact of the stranded corporate allocations from the businesses we have sold in our reported segment margins. It is important to remember that 2022 is likely to remain quite noisy due to the impact of portfolio changes and implementation costs.\nAs such, we continue to expect the margin expansion to be increasingly visible over 2023 as we move past the timing impacts of the portfolio changes in implementations and work toward previously stated 2024 target.\nNow I will turn the call over to Mark for some more color on the Insurance business performance.\n\nMark V. Anquillare\n\nPresident & COO, Verisk Analytics, Inc.\n\nThanks, Lee. I'm pleased to share that the Insurance segment delivered another solid quarter. Across Insurance, we're experiencing strong growth in subscription revenues across both underwriting and claims, resulting in OCC subscription growth of 7.3% in segment overall, and demonstrate stability and consistency of our business model and the must-have nature of our solutions.\nWithin underwriting, we had strong results from core underwriting, extreme event solutions and our international software business. We also had healthy contribution in certain of our newer acquired businesses, including life insurance and marketing solutions. Within life insurance, we have delivered strong sales growth from the addition of new customers and expansion of existing relationships.\nLife insurers are embarking on a modernization and digital transformation of the core systems and FAST software offers flexibility and speed of implementation that helps insurers achieve their goals in a timely and cost-efficient manner.\nExtreme event solutions had a strong quarter, driven by the addition of new customers added to our core touchdown platform as well as expansion of multiyear deals with existing customers. In addition, the catastrophe bond market continues to be strong, and Verisk is growing its share in that market. Our sustainability and country risk business also had a strong quarter as demand for our risk indices in both corporate and investor segments continue to drive strong double-digit growth.\nWithin claims, we're experiencing strong growth in our fraud fighting analytics driven by the addition of new customers and expanded use cases. More specifically, our new claims essentials bundle designed for self-insurers and third-party administrators provides an end-to-end claim solution and is driving conversion to subscriptions from customers [approval] to use our solutions in a more limited and transactional basis.\nWe've also recently announced our exclusive partnership with [LIMRA and LOMA], an industry research organization, life and annuity insurance industry to fight the account takeover fraud situation.\nInsurance transaction revenues grew more modest 2.7%. We have seen strong rebound in our international travel business, that has been offset by headwinds for both our workers' compensation claims solutions and softer results from our personal auto underwriting. In addition, the first half of the year has seen a lower level of storm activity versus the prior year and historic averages.\nMore specifically, our workers' compensation solutions are dealing with 2 headwinds, including volume levels are down at least 25% across the industry as well as new regulations, they're slowing the pace settlement. That said, we are not sitting still. We have recently implemented process improvements to help drive greater throughput and new customer outreach to drive volumes to Verisk. (inaudible) insurance industry is generally healthy, the shorter term, insurers are dealing with the impact of interest rate volatility, inflation and rising loss ratios. This is having disproportionate impact on personal lines and insurtech players in certain geographic markets.\nWhile insurers are increasing rates to help cover inflation and repair costs, it takes time to fully take effect across the entire book of business. Specifically, in personal auto, we're seeing lower levels of underwriting activity, which is resulting in lower transaction volumes and revenue. The industry is dealing with higher inflation and supply chain shortages, which are pushing up physical damage claims costs. As a result, the industry is raising rates and temporary pulling back on new business to improve profitability.\nNotably, we're also watching carefully the developments in the Florida homeowners insurance market. This is a market that is dominated by small local companies, has widespread exposure to climate-related risk and is dealing with elevated levels of litigation and fraud. This combination is leading to a pullback in underwriting and increase in insured liquidations and exits from the market. As a result, these risks are moving to the state-run insurer as last resort.\nThe state of Florida recently created a reinsurance facility to bring more stability to the homeowners market. To address these issues and help our customers on the underwriting side, we are facilitating new market participants and have expanded our relationship with the state-run insurer to help price and select risk.\nOn the claims side, we're helping customers, including state government agencies with (inaudible) and analytics to improve their ability to investigate and identify fraud. This is a developing situation on staying close to our customers and regulators.\nThrough our customer engagement, we know that the Insurance industry is focused on becoming more automated, more digitally engaged and more connected, and they're directing spending toward these projects. They turn to Verisk as a key partner to drive these initiatives forward, which has been a key driver of our growth. We can help our customers select and price risk and root out fraud with our advanced data analysts. And believe that we are well positioned to continue to grow as we advance our mission to become a trusted partner from a technology and analyst perspective for the industry.\nLet me turn the call over to Interim CFO, David Grover, for a financial review.\n\nDavid J. Grover\n\nController, CAO & Interim CFO, Verisk Analytics, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark. Before I begin, I want to remind everyone that all consolidating [GAAP results] are negatively impacted by the recent dispositions of 3E and Verisk Financial Services. That will continue through the first quarter of 2023 when we will anniversary those transactions. For the second quarter of 2022, on a consolidated (inaudible) basis, revenues were $746 million, a modest decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of recent dispositions and headwinds for FX rate changes, which were most put out in our Energy segment, offset in part by acquisitions.\nNet income attributable to Verisk increased 28% to $198 million, while diluted GAAP EPS attributable to Verisk increased 32% to $1.24. The increase was primarily due to a lower tax provision this year versus the prior year period, which included a noncash revaluation charge related to an increase in U.K. tax rates that became [effective] last year.\nMoving to our OCC results. Adjusted for nonoperating items, as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, we are pleased with our operating results, led by continued and consistent growth in our subscription revenues. In the second quarter, OCC revenues grew 5.3%, driven by continued strength in our Insurance segment.\nOur subscription revenues increased 6.2%, while our transactional revenues increased a more modest 1.7%. Adjusting for $3.5 million in prior year revenues associated with our Energy business in Russia, OCC revenues would have grown 5.9% and subscription revenues would have grown 6.9%. Consolidated OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 4.4% in the second quarter, normalizing for the prior year revenue associated with our Energy business in Russia and the incremental expenses associated with exiting that business. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 5.7%.\nTotal adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results, was 51.0%, up 140 basis points from the prior year, reflecting strong cost and operational discipline as well as the benefits from recent dispositions. This level of margin includes approximately 80 basis points of headwind from recent acquisitions, 60 basis points of headwind from our ongoing technological transformation, including cloud expenses, which we absorbed into our cost structure and 60 basis points from higher year-over-year P&A expenses.\nFinally, this margin also reflects about 60 basis points of headwind from the timing shift related to executive compensation, which we told you about last quarter and will have no impact on the full year results.\nOn that note, let's turn to our segment results on an OCC basis. In the second quarter, Insurance segment revenues increased 6.4%. We saw healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, claims analytics, extreme events, life insurance and international specialty business solutions. Subscription revenues increased 7.3%, while transactional revenues were up 2.7%.\nWe continue to experience strong recovery growth in certain of our transactional businesses, including international travel insurance solution, but continues to be pressured by weakness in workers' compensation as well as softness in personal auto underwriting as (inaudible) dealing with some dislocation as Mark described earlier.\nAdjusted EBITDA grew 6.1% in the second quarter, while margins declined 180 basis points to 54.7%. These margins reflect heavier burden from the corporate costs that were previously allocated to businesses that have been disposed, the impact of recently acquired businesses, higher cloud expenses and the partial normalization of travel back into the business. This level of margin also includes continued investment in our high-growth areas like life insurance and marketing solutions.\nEnergy and Specialized Markets revenues increased 0.8% in the second quarter. Normalizing for the impact of suspended operations in Russia, Energy revenue growth was 3.6%. The end market continues to be volatile and impacted by geopolitical developments, but we're seeing sequential improvements in our subscription revenue growth rates as our customers are turning to Wood Mackenzie data and analytics.\nOur subscription revenues increased 1.7% and was affected by our decision to suspend all commercial operations in Russia. Normalizing for Russia, subscription revenue growth was 5.2%, led by double digit growth in energy transitions, chemicals and metals and mining research, coupled with modest growth in our core research subscriptions. Additionally, we continue to experience strong adoption and (inaudible) expansion from our Lens renewals.\nTransactional revenues decreased 2.8% as growth was constrained by consulting resources as we are seeing an elevated level of employee attrition due to a competitive market for expertise in energy and technology. We are working to offset this trend and have demonstrated success attracting talent to our Energy business as well.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased 6.4% in the second quarter and margins contracted 90 basis points to 34.6%. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin includes $1.1 million in incremental expense related to the suspension of operations in Russia. Normalizing for the Russian impact, adjusted EBITDA growth would have been 3.6%. In addition to the incremental Russian expense, this margin also reflects the partial normalization of travel expense back into the business and higher cloud expenses.\nIt also reflects continued investment in Lens as we further build our capabilities to garner maximum value from the platform, including Lens power, energy transitions, chemicals and metals and mining.\nLooking to the remainder of 2022, (inaudible) Russian revenues and adjusted EBITDA will negatively impact each quarter by approximately $4 million per quarter. Verisk Financial Services results are included in our reported numbers, but not in the OCC figures. We sold Verisk Financial Services to TransUnion on April 8.\nOur reported effective tax rate was 18.3% compared to 35.6% in the prior year quarter. The prior year's tax rate was elevated due to a noncash revaluation charge (inaudible) U.K. tax law change. We also benefited in the quarter from higher levels of stock option exercise activity as compared to last year.\nLooking ahead to the remainder of 2022, we expect the tax rate to be between 20% and 23% in the third and fourth quarters of 2022, though there could likely be some quarterly variability related to employee stock option exercise activity. Adjusted net income increased 28% to $244 million and diluted adjusted EPS increased 31% to $1.53 for the second quarter of 2022. These increases reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions, a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $130 million for the quarter, down 44% from the prior year period due to a tax payment of $122 million, primarily related to the gain on sale of 3E as well as the loss of operating cash flows related to the dispositions. Adjusting for these unique items, operating cash flow would have increased by a double-digit rate year-over-year.\nCapital expenditures were $69 million for the quarter, up 11% versus last year, reflecting increases in capitalized software development, offset in part by savings on third-party hardware and software as we move to the cloud. We continue to expect our capital expenditures to be within the range of $280 million to $310 million. This range supports our plans to increase our software investment through the acceleration of our pace of development in Lens and extending software development into core underwriting, where we believe there is a similar opportunity for platform enhancement.\nRelated to CapEx, we now expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization to be within the range of $210 million, $230 million and intangible amortization to be approximately $170 million. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to FX variability, the timing of purchases, the completion of projects and future M&A activity.\nDuring the second quarter, we returned $374 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends as our strong cash flow allows us to invest behind our highest growth and highest return initiatives, while also consistently returning capital to shareholders. Additionally, in June, we entered into a new $300 million accelerated share repurchase agreement to be completed in the third quarter.\nAnd now I'll turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments.\n\nLee M. Shavel\n\nCEO & Director, Verisk Analytics, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dave. In summary, our businesses are strong, and we are making important progress executing on our strategic and operational initiatives, including the evaluation of the separation of the Energy business and our margin expansion targets. As we evaluate options for the Energy business, we will continue to focus on pursuing the most value-creating path for our shareholders and we'll also consider market conditions and timing.\nWe are confident that with the recent transformation of our portfolio and active cost management over (inaudible) we can deliver growth in line with our long-term objectives, with organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth ahead of revenue growth, reflecting our strong operating leverage.\nFinally, I wanted to remind you that we are planning an Investor Day for the first quarter of 2023 to be held at our offices in Jersey City. We will provide more details as it gets closer, and we certainly hope you will join us.\nWe continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question.\nWith that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

This call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nFor opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.\n\nStacey Jill Brodbar\n\nHead of IR, Verisk Analytics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Justin, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our first quarter 2022 financial results. On the call today are Scott Stephenson, Verisk's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Lee Shavel, incoming CEO; Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer and incoming President; and David Grover, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer.\nThe earnings release referenced on this call, as well as our traditional quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in.\nFinally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. I would also like to note that the financial results for recent dispositions of 3D and Verisk Financial Services, are included in our consolidated GAAP result,s, are excluded from all organic constant currency growth figures. A reconciliation is provided in our 8-K.\nAnd now, I'd like to turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott G. Stephenson\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Verisk Analytics, Inc.\n\nThanks, Stacey. Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. The past 21 years at Verisk have been an incredible and rewarding journey. It's been my absolute privilege to serve as Chairman and CEO during such a transformative time for our company. I'm incredibly proud of the growth that we delivered and the value that we created for customers, employees and shareholders, and we always deliver this value by acting with the highest level of integrity.\nOur company's success has always been a team effort. To that end, I'm delighted we have such a deep bench of talent, including our incoming CEO, Lee Shavel; and incoming president, Mark Avelar, who I know will drive continued growth for our company and lead Verisk towards becoming a global insurance-focused data analytics solution provider. I look forward to seeing the work that all our Verisk teammates will do to drive innovation and growth and long-term success.\nAs this is my final earnings call, I also wanted to take a moment to thank all the shareholders and analysts that have covered Verisk for your effort and your support over the years.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Lee.\n\nLee M. Shavel\n\nCFO and Group President of Energy, Specialized Markets & Financial Services Segments, Verisk Analytics, Inc.\n\nThanks, Scott, and good day, everyone. On behalf of the entire Verisk team, Scott, let me thank you for your dedication and service to Verisk. We wish you all the very best in your well-deserved retirement. It has been a privilege to work with you and learn from you over the past 5 years, and I'm fortunate to have your ongoing support and counsel.\nI'm pleased to share that Verisk delivered solid first quarter results. First quarter organic constant currency revenue grew 5.3% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA grew 4.1%. Adjusted for the impact of the suspension of our commercial operations in Russia and higher discrete professional fees, organic constant currency revenue grew 5.7% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA grew 6.9%.\nWe delivered solid growth across the Insurance segment, with the fastest growth reported in marketing solutions, international specialty business solutions, life insurance, extreme event solutions and claims analytics. We also had solid contributions from our industry standard solutions in underwriting.\nWithin Energy, we continue to see improving results across both subscriptions and consulting, with the strongest growth in the energy transition, chemicals and metals and mining. We did experience softness in certain of our transactional businesses, including workers' compensation, which is experiencing continued weakness, as carriers are adjusting to new regulation within the industry. In addition, our property estimating solutions had weaker transactional growth related to a slower storm season versus last year's ice storms in Texas.\nFinally, the auto underwriting business continues to deal with a lower level of shopping activity. Our results also included headwinds from the suspension of commercial operations in Russia, increased cloud costs, higher discrete professional fees in the quarter and the partial normalization of travel and entertainment in the post-pandemic environment. We will provide more details in the financial review section of the call.\nIn preparation for officially stepping into the role as CEO, over the last 75 days, we have visited our offices in London; Boston; Lehi, Utah; and of course, Jersey City, to meet with the employees and leadership teams of all our business units. Many of these individuals are long-time colleagues, and I'm excited to build on these relationships going forward.\nIn addition, I've had the opportunity to meet with more than a dozen of our most significant customers. Some of whom I've interacted with throughout my tenure here. I've long known the valued role we play as a technology partner to our customers, and I'm more energized than ever about the extraordinary opportunity we have to expand the breadth and the depth of those relationships.\nOur value proposition is very clear. Verisk strategically invests in data and technology at scale in order to deliver economic value to our customers through operational efficiencies and better decision-making across the industries we serve. In Insurance, our customers look to us to help them better select risks and facilitate the automation of legacy processes to improve efficiencies and underwriting and claims. They also turn to Verisk for support with the digitization of their customer experience, and to enable the use of new data sets and platforms for expanded product lines.\nThe development of our Touchstone platform and Extreme Event Solutions, the LightSpeed product suite and underwriting and the development of our life business are tangible examples of what we have delivered to clients.\nAnd in Energy, understanding the complex impacts of the energy transition and the geopolitical events continuing to unfold in Ukraine, on the global energy economy, remain a primary customer focus through strong demand for improved data delivery and analytics, and we continue to deliver on that demand for our customers through our Lens platform. In fact, the first quarter was our fourth consecutive quarter of mid- to high single-digit ACV growth, helped by new multiyear contracts, with material upsell for customers that are adopting Lens as they recognize the value of this new platform delivers.\nIn both Insurance and Energy, we benefit from the growing demand for data analytics from our customers, along with their increased ability to ingest and utilize our rapidly growing data sets and technologies to make better decisions and drive operational efficiency. We create lift from these growth engines through the industry scale at which we can deliver greater value per dollar invested that our clients would be able to, individually.\nGrowth and returns on invested capital have been and will continue to be the primary driver of value creation for our shareholders over the long term. And my highest priority as CEO will be to continue to deliver on both. We are well-positioned in industries with massive opportunities that will require investment and focus in areas where we can maximize value for our customers. It also requires delivering value for our employees on whom we rely for their talent, commitment and effort. We operate in a highly competitive market for talent and must be sure that Verisk remains a very attractive destination for the best and brightest.\nMoving from our long-term value creation strategy to our near-term focus on the activities we described to drive enhanced shareholder value. I wanted to provide an update on both our progress towards being an insurance-focused data analytics solutions provider, and our commitment to achieving margin expansion. We are making steady progress on the separation of the Energy business. We are actively engaged in a detailed planning and modeling exercise of the financial, legal, tax and operational costs associated with separating the business. This analysis will inform valuation and the transaction structure that we intend to pursue, subject to market conditions and shareholder value considerations. Our timing expectations remain unchanged.\nOn our EBITDA improvement objective, as Mark will describe in greater detail, though still early, we have identified several areas of organic cost efficiencies at the operating and corporate level to drive margin expansion. These opportunities include the consolidation of certain real estate locations as leases come due or to the extent sublease opportunities are available; the increased usage of our global talent optimization locations for new hires; and more efficient technology investment, including the closure of our on-premise data centers. We will also reduce corporate overhead after we complete the transition services agreements associated with the sale of 3D and Verisk Financial Services.\nAs we previously announced in mid-March, the company continues moving towards the goal of being a global insurance-focused data analytics solutions provider. We expect to deliver 300 to 500 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion in the consolidated remaining insurance-focused business by 2024, against a baseline of 50% to 51% normalized adjusted EBITDA margins on the 55% adjusted EBITDA margin that our Insurance segment delivered in 2021.\nIndeed, 55% does not represent a normalized run rate for the Insurance business as it does not account for a number of offsets, including: First, corporate overhead costs allocated to other businesses of approximately 200 basis points; second, the impact of 3 strategic insurance-related acquisitions made over the last 2 quarters, approximately 80 basis points; and finally, the normalization for incremental cloud transition and post-pandemic travel and entertainment expenses for a combined approximately 170 basis points.\nIn addition, investments in new financial and human capital systems will provide greater efficiency opportunities when fully implemented, but will pressure margins in the near term as well inflationary and competitive compensation pressures, but these effects are all embedded in the 300 to 500 basis point target.\nWe should note that 2022 is likely to be quite noisy due to the impact of portfolio changes and implementation costs, as well as the impact of other environmental issues. As such, we expect the margin expansion to be most visible beginning in 2023 as we move past the timing impacts of the portfolio changes and implementation. Based on our work to date, we are very confident in our ability to achieve our stated target for EBITDA expansion by 2024, as we originally disclosed.\nBefore turning it over to Mark, let me provide a quick update on the CFO search. We continue to make progress in our prioritizing public company CFOs with operational efficiency experience. In the meantime, David Grover, Verisk's Controller and Chief Accounting Officer, has been acting as Interim Chief Financial Officer, and is well suited for this job.\nI'll now turn it over to Mark for some more color on the Insurance business.\n\nMark V. Anquillare\n\nCOO & Group President of Enterprise Risk Management, Verisk Analytics, Inc.\n\nThanks, Lee. Before I begin, I also want to take a moment to thank Scott for all that he has contributed to Verisk. The legacy that you're leaving is leading the way our teams innovate and always deliver for our customers. I wish you the very best in your retirement. It has been a pleasure to partner with you for all these years, and I'm excited to build on the strong foundation of success as we move to the next chapter of their story.\nI'm pleased to share that the Insurance segment delivered another solid quarter. Across Insurance, we're seeing strong results from both commercial and personal lines and seeing contributions to growth from our newly acquired businesses like Marketing and Life Insurance Solutions. Within our core underwriting and claims solutions, growth is being driven by strong renewal cycles, with existing customers, as well as from the addition of new customers and expanded use cases for our claims solutions.\nWithin Marketing, we're seeing strong growth driven by continued adoption from P&C carriers using our solutions to optimize lead acquisition programs, build more intelligent marketing segmentation and monitor portfolios from right-timed outreach and for improved customer retention. We're excited about the opportunity ahead as we combine with Jornaya with our newly acquired (inaudible) business to further enhance these capabilities by synergizing products and offerings.\nOur Life Insurance Solutions continue to help our life and annuity to customers, along with their digital transformation, all the while delivering very strong growth for Verisk. With the addition of new customers, as well as expansion of relationships with existing customers. Life insurance recognized the benefits of our modular and flexible software solutions and are standardizing on vast platform.\nWithin stream events, we're seeing strong growth in our core Touchstone platform, with designing to move customers, as well as expansion of multiyear deals with existing customers. In addition, the catastrophe bond market continued to be strong, with Verisk participating in more than half of the deals placed in the quarter.\nOur sustainability business also had a very strong quarter as demand for our ESG in resilience global risk indices in both the corporate and financial sector grew strong double digits. During the quarter, we launched sovereign ESG ratings, targeting the financial sector and early interest is encouraging as our focus on the risk and unmet need in the marketplace.\nDuring the quarter, we experienced recovery in many of our transactional businesses that were negatively impacted by the pandemic, including travel, international auto and claims. This was offset in part by continued weakness in our workers' compensation business, as carriers are adjusting to new regulation within the industry, as well as tougher compares on the storm-related revenue versus last year's ice storms in Texas.\nIn our many discussions with our customers, we continually hear the same message. The insurance industry is healthy and focused on becoming more digital, more efficient and more automated. While insurers are experiencing increasing costs related to inflation, rates are hardening, reflecting these inflationary factors. This should lead to faster premium growth. In addition, rising interest rates are helping the investment portfolios of our customers, driving better profitability. All that said, cost efficiency continues to be a big focus of our customers as they work to be quicker, more automated and drive savings.\nThe growing of our data sets has been a strategic focus as we work to further advance our mission to help our customers better select risk. To that end, we've been expanding the data and currency of our commercial property database and now have over 15.4 million properties, up from 12.2 million just a year ago. Growth will become a combination of [onsite] surveys, virtual technologies third-party data sources and our ability to accurately model key characteristics using the data we have to expand and update our databases more frequently. Separately, we've added 10 new data contributors into our core statistical databases for rate making in the first quarter.\nOn the client in grade (inaudible) front, this quarter has been wonderful. We successfully hosted hybrid customer events with many in-person sessions. In February, we held our Signature Elevate Conference. And in March, we held our Insurance Fraud Management Conference, both of which successful. Across the 2 events, we had almost 600 attendees in person and another 900 plus through virtual sessions. It was great to be in person with customers again.\nDuring the quarter, we acquired Opta, Canada's leading provider of property intelligence and innovative technology solutions. The acquisition further expands Verisk's footprint in the Canadian market. It supports Opta in reshaping risk management with valuable business intelligence. As the only organization in Canada regular gathers and validates data through ongoing research, Opta is widely considered the industry standard for valuations, property risk intelligence and loss control services. This transaction offers Verisk immediate expansion into Canada, with the leading provider of underwriting data and analytics to carriers and provides opportunity for product harmonization across the Opta and Verisk portfolio. We're excited to welcome the Opta team to the Verisk family.\nFinally, I want to take a minute to add to the comments that we made around operational efficiency. Within the Insurance segment, we have engaged in a detailed study across all our costs throughout our business units. We have identified the areas of expenses to be eliminated without impacting future growth opportunities. Such opportunities exist in real estate, technology infrastructure, increased use of our lower-cost count locations for open positions, improved sourcing and procurement, product optimization, and we will work diligently to realize these cost savings in a timely and efficient manner.\nNow let me turn the call over to Interim CFO, David Grover, for the financial review.\n\nDavid J. Grover\n\nController & CAO, Verisk Analytics, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark. For the first quarter of 2022, on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenues grew 6.8% to $776 million. Net income attributable to Verisk increased 200% to $506 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share attributable to Verisk increased 204% to $3.13. Our GAAP results include the impact of a $380 million after-tax gain on the sale of our environmental health and safety business.\nMoving to our organic constant currency results adjusted for nonoperating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release. We are pleased with our operating results, led by continued and consistent growth in our subscription revenues. In the first quarter, organic constant currency revenues grew 5.3% driven by continued strength in our Insurance segment and sequential improvement within our Energy segment. Our subscription revenues increased 6.2%, while transactional revenues increased a more modest 1.3%.\nAdjusting for $3 million in prior year revenues associated with our Energy business in Russia, organic constant currency revenues would have grown 5.7%. Consolidated OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 4.1% in the first quarter. Adjusting for expenses related to the suspension of commercial operations in Russia as well as discrete higher professional fees, consolidated OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 6.9%. Total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic revenues and adjusted EBITDA was 46.3%.\nThis level of margin includes the impact of the suspension of Russian operations, approximately 70 basis points of headwind from strategic recent acquisitions, a higher level of professional fees and the return of certain COVID-related costs back into the business. It also includes approximately 90 basis points of headwind from our ongoing technological transformation, including our cloud transition costs, which we absorbed into our cost structure.\nFinally, this margin also reflected a beneficial timing difference related to executive compensation, which will reverse over the remainder of 2022. On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. In the first quarter, Insurance segment revenues increased 6.1%. We saw healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, claims analytics solutions, extreme event solutions, life insurance solutions and international specialty business solutions. Subscription revenues increased 7.2%, while transactional revenues were up 1.3%.\nCertain of our transactional businesses experienced recovery in the quarter, including international travel insurance solutions and international auto claim solutions, but this was offset by a slower storm season versus last year's Texas ice storms and continued softness in workers' compensation.\nAdjusted EBITDA grew 5.5% in the first quarter, while margins declined 240 basis points to 51.5%. These margins reflect a heavier burden from our corporate costs that were previously allocated to businesses that have been disposed, the impact of recently acquired businesses, higher cloud expenses, and the return of travel expense back into the business. This level of margin also includes continued investment in our high-growth areas like life insurance and marketing solutions.\nEnergy and specialized markets revenues grew 1.9% in the first quarter. Normalizing for the impact of suspending operations in Russia, Energy revenue growth was 4.3%, a solid acceleration from the fourth quarter. The end market continues to be volatile, but has benefited from higher commodity prices. Our customers are in a much stronger financial position than they were just 2 years ago. Our subscription revenues increased 4.8% when adjusted for the Russian impact as we are capitalizing on the increased appetite for advanced analytics.\nDuring the quarter, we delivered double-digit growth in energy transition in chemicals research coupled with modest growth in our core research subscriptions. We continue to benefit from strong adoption of our Lens platform through upsell of existing customers and the adoption of new logos as customers are seeing the value of our integrated cloud-based data analytic environment. This is evidenced by material increases in contract size for multiyear contracts that include (inaudible).\nWe also had another successful renewal cycle in the first quarter of 2022, resulting in our fourth consecutive quarter of mid- to high single-digit ACV growth. Transactional revenues increased 1.5%, but growth was constrained by resources as we actively are managing to take on only the highest value consulting work. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 4.9% in the first quarter and margins contracted to 130 basis points to 33.1%. This margin includes $1.4 million in incremental expense related to the suspension of operations in Russia.\nNormalizing for the Russian impact, adjusted EBITDA growth would have been 5.3%. In addition to the Russia expense, this margin level reflects higher cloud expenses and the return of travel expenses back into the business. It also reflected continued investment in Lens as we further build out capabilities to garner maximum value for the platform, including Lens Power, energy transition, chemicals and metals and mining. Looking to the remainder of 2022, the loss of Russian revenues and the adjusted EBITDA will impact each quarter by approximately $4 million per quarter.\nFinancial services were included in our reported numbers, but not within our organic constant currency figures. We closed the sale of VFS to TransUnion on April 8. Our reported effective tax rate was 17.2% compared to 22.5% in the prior year quarter. The quarterly tax rate benefited by over 500 basis points from certain nonrecurring adjustments related to the sale of 3E. Looking ahead to the remainder of 2022, we still expect the tax rate to be between 20% and 22% in each of the next 3 quarters, though there will likely be some quarterly variability related to the [case] of employee stock option exercises.\nAdjusted net income increased 7% to $217 million and diluted adjusted EPS increased 9% to $1.34 for the first quarter of 2022. These increases reflected organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions, a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count. Net cash provided by operating activities was $400 million in the quarter, down 11% from the prior year period, reflecting timing differences for certain of our collections and the impact of the 3E disposition, which closed in the middle of March.\nCapital expenditures were $60 million for the quarter, up 1.4% versus last year, reflecting increases in capitalized software development, offset in part by savings on third-party hardware and software as we move to the cloud. We continue to expect our capital expenditures to be approximately $280 million to $310 million. This supports our plans to increase our software investment with the acceleration of our pace of development in [monies] and extending software development into core underwriting where we believe there is a similar opportunity for platform enhancement.\nRelated to CapEx. We now expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization should be within the range of $210 million to $230 million and intangible amortization to be approximately $170 million. Both depreciation and the amortization elements are subject to FX variability, the timing of purchases, the completion of projects and future M&A activity.\nDuring the first quarter, we've returned $621 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, as our strong cash flow allows us to invest behind our highest growth and highest return initiatives while also returning capital to shareholders consistently. We continue to expect to deploy after-tax proceeds from the sale of our 3E and Verisk Financial businesses for share repurchases in addition to our normal pace of quarterly repurchases, which are generally executed through an ASR program.\nAnd now, I'll turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments.\n\nLee M. Shavel\n\nCFO and Group President of Energy, Specialized Markets & Financial Services Segments, Verisk Analytics, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dave. In summary, our businesses are strong, and we are making important progress executing on our strategic and operational initiatives, including the separation of the Energy business and our improvement in margins. As we evaluate options for the Energy business, we will continue to focus on pursuing the most value-creating path for our shareholders and all of Verisk stakeholders. We are confident that the transformation of our portfolio and active cost management, we can return to growth in line with our long-term objectives and deliver OCC-adjusted EBITDA growth ahead of revenue growth in 2022 and beyond.\nWe continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk given the large number of analysts we have covering us. (Operator Instructions)\nAnd with that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

This call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.\n\nStacey Jill Brodbar\n\nHead of IR, Verisk Analytics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ram, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results. Today's call will be led by Scott Stephenson, Verisk's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Lee Shavel, Chief Financial Officer and Group President; and Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer and Group President.\nThe earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-K can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days and on our website and by dial-in.\nFinally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about our future performance, including, but not limited to, the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nActual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings.\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott G. Stephenson\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Verisk Analytics, Inc.\n\nThanks, Stacey. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call.\nBefore we discuss the company's performance, I want to first reflect on the recently announced leadership succession plan. After 21 years at Verisk, I will be retiring as CEO following our Annual Meeting of Shareholders, and I'm pleased that Lee Shavel will succeed me as CEO, and Mark Anquillare as President. It has been an honor and privilege to lead Verisk through critical and transformative periods for our company and the industries we serve. With a dynamic executive team, deep bench of talent, strong balance sheet, collaborative culture, a modernized technical environment and leading-edge analytics software platforms in place, this is the right time to begin the transition to Verisk's next CEO.\nI have every confidence that under Lee and Mark's steady leadership, the team will continue to empower a better, more resilient and sustainable model for customers and the world. I'd like to personally take all 9,000-plus Verisk teammates for their passion and dedication to always being innovative, for their underlying commitment to our customers and for conducting business each and every day with the utmost integrity. I know the Verisk I will be leaving is more data rich, more modern and more integrated with our customers. And the future is very bright.\nMost of you know Lee quite well. Since joining Verisk in 2017, he has served as our Chief Financial Officer and has been a trusted partner to sharpen our focus on the effective allocation of capital. In 2021, Lee became Group President of our Energy and Financial Services segments and successfully integrated the business for improved strategic and operating coordination and accelerated investment in the company's energy data analytics network. In addition, he's been actively engaged in the company's ongoing business and portfolio review, which I'll speak to in just a bit.\nPartnering with Lee will be Mark Anquillare, who has been (inaudible) to Verisk's growth, operational excellence and customer-centric culture for 30 years. Mark has been instrumental in growing the company's Insurance vertical and aligning the company's enterprise risk assessment and management with its core operations.\nWith Lee as CEO and Mark as President, I have great confidence that we have the right team in place as we execute on our plans to enhance shareholder value. And I look forward to working together towards a smooth transition of leadership.\nI also want to comment briefly on the recent governance actions that were announced last week. These actions were the culmination of a broad shareholder engagement and outreach program that the management team and independent members of our Board of Directors have undertaken since last year's annual meeting.\nAs part of our proactive approach, we focused on environmental, social and governance matters as well as long-term strategic positioning and operational excellence. We appreciated the broad set of perspectives we heard over the course of conversations with investors who represented a wide variety of geographies and investment styles, and we greatly value the input we receive.\nReflecting this feedback from shareholders, we've taken a series of actions, including: first, a proposal in the company's 2022 proxy statement to declassify the Board of Director election terms; second, the separation of the Chairman and CEO roles effective at the 2022 Annual Meeting; third, the implementation of return on invested capital based incentives for named executive officers and other leaders; fourth, direct oversight from the Board on the risks and opportunities that sustainability issues create; and fifth, continued ongoing Board refreshment. We believe these actions will bring improved transparency, increase the capability and further align our corporate governance with best-in-class practices.\nTurning now to the financial results, I'm pleased to share that Verisk delivered a strong fourth quarter, demonstrating the consistency and stability of our subscription-based business model, the relevancy and mission-critical nature of our solutions and our relentless focus on our customers. The net result for the fourth quarter was organic constant currency revenue growth of 5.2% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth of 7.6%, reflecting solid growth in our Insurance segment and sequential improvement in Energy and Financial Services.\nFor the full year, Verisk reported consolidated revenue growth of 7.7% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 6.8%, reflecting the positive impact of the acquisitions, including (inaudible), Data Driven Safety, (inaudible) and Whitespace. On an organic constant currency basis, Verisk grew revenue 5% and adjusted EBITDA of 4.7%.\nThe last year was also one of major technological transformation, international expansion and continued investment in innovation, all of which occurred alongside our comprehensive portfolio review. Starting with our Insurance business. 2021 was a strong year as we reported 6.9% organic constant currency revenue growth and 6.5% on constant currency and adjusted EBITDA growth.\nWe experienced exceptional new sales growth across the broad range of insurance solutions, including underwriting, claims, extreme events and international software solutions and strong uptake for new insurtech solutions like our LightSpeed platform. We continue to see strong demand for our ESG-related solutions for corporate customers, including our (inaudible) climate and human rights data and analytics solutions.\nOverall, our Insurance franchise remains competitively positioned. And we are advancing our lead by continually building our data advantage and maximizing the strategic synergies across our insurance data assets and solutions.\nThis year, we added [40] new data contributors to our statistical agent database to support ratemaking across our core insurance loans and provide our insurance customers with valuable analytics that can help them innovate and expand in the rapidly (inaudible) marketplace. This includes contributions from global, national, super regional and regional companies and built upon the 37 contributors we added in 2020.\nAdditionally, we expanded our contributor image library with real-time images of (inaudible) property in autos (inaudible) with the contribution of management from the top line insurer. We also expanded our (inaudible) rights for automated underwriting, analytics and (inaudible).\nWe continue to experience exponential growth in our small business database, which should fuel future opportunities across the small business lines of insurance. This continued growth in our contributory data is a testament to our partnership with our customers, who entrust us with their data assets, a responsibility that we do not take for granted.\nThese ever-growing data sets not only enable and empower us to innovate further to solve our customers' problems, but they also (inaudible) competitive position and strengthen our growth position into the future. Importantly, our strategic decision to expand our gating analytics to additional areas within the broader insurance segment is delivering results for our customers and for Verisk.\nFor example, Verisk life insurance solutions combine our data analytics and software platforms within the life and annuity segment helping carriers, distributors and acquirers transform their product rollout, customer buying experience, underwriting, policy management and claims. In addition, we are saving our customers significant CapEx and OpEx and expediting their speed to market for new products.\nDuring 2021, Verisk Life Insurance Solutions delivered strong double-digit growth with faster growth in our license (inaudible). Moreover, our late 2020 acquisition of Jornaya and the subsequent acquisition of Contact State in the U.K. is enabling us to extend our data analytic capabilities into the marketing suite of our insurance customers and is driving strong growth for Verisk.\nOur marketing and analytics solutions, health insurance carriers and financial business companies improve the timing, relevancy and compliance of consumer engagements using end market behaviors and consent-based data solutions. Marketers are increasingly focused on first-party data enrichment at their foundational strategy, all while managing risk and protecting consumer privacy in an increasingly complex and evolving privacy landscape.\nJornaya partners with the biggest insurers and powers data-driven personalized marketing programs for their customers, acquisition and retention. We are also excited about the added capabilities we will be bringing to our marketing solutions through the addition of (inaudible), a strategic acquisition that we closed earlier this month.\nThe investment rationale for this transaction is clear. (inaudible) offers real-time identity resolution and consumer intelligence to marketers to help understand the consumer behind each marketing interaction. Combining this with Jornaya's unique insight into in-market behaviors positions Verisk marketing solutions as a key data partner to our insurance customers. It also further strengthens our insurance offering as we continue our portfolio-reshaping efforts and increase our focus on the Insurance segment.\nTurning to our Energy and Specialized Markets segment. For the full year 2021, we delivered organic constant currency revenue growth of 2.4% and organic constant currency EBITDA growth of 6.4%, reflecting sequential improvement as we move through the year. This was driven in large part by an enthusiastic reception to our Lens platform, which helped our Energy businesses deliver solid annualized contract value growth, resulting from 3 consecutive quarters of mid-single-digit ACV growth.\nAs we continue to integrate the business for improved strategic and operating coordination and accelerate technology investments, we have an active pipeline of new features and functionality scheduled to be released during 2022 within our Lens platform, including ongoing development of discovery and valuation capabilities in our power, upstream and subsurface packages. In addition, we will continue to bolster our existing data to include emerging technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture and storage.\nThese combined efforts should continue to drive increased adoption and uptake by our customers. With just over 10% of our ACV related to Lens, we feel confident in our penetration runway and expect us to support continued sequential growth in 2022.\nNow let's turn and discuss our portfolio review process. As we've mentioned on previous earnings calls, we've been engaged in an ongoing and comprehensive bottoms-up review of our noninsurance businesses and overall portfolio composition.\nWith the assistance of outside advisers, our Board and management team have extensively studied each of our noninsurance business units, analyzing them across a broad spectrum of financial and operating metrics, including long-term sustainable growth, operating leverage and capital return potential. We also carefully explored competitive positioning, business scale, cross-vertical data and technology synergies and the shape and long-term development of the end markets. (inaudible) decision making is driving synergies across our businesses and improving sustainable returns on invested capital.\nIt is with this in mind that we determined to sell 2 of our business units that after careful review did not meet certain operating metrics or did not prove to generate the needed synergies. First, we recently announced the sale of our environmental health and safety business, 3E, to New Mountain Capital for total potential aggregate consideration of up to $950 million. Verisk intends to return the immediate after-tax proceeds of roughly $460 million to shareholders through share repurchases once the transaction closes late in the first quarter of 2022.\nSecond, as we announced yesterday, we have signed a definitive agreement to sell Verisk Financial Services to [Trans Union] for a total cash consideration of $550 million. VFS has a unique and proprietary data set that positions them at the nexus of payments, commerce and banking as the only provider of a full customer wallet view of consumer banking and spending behavior.\nThis transaction will best position Verisk Financial to capitalize on the changing market dynamics and continued digitization of banking and retail while providing increased focus for Verisk going forward. The closing of this transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. Like with 3E, we intend to return the after-tax proceeds to shareholders through share repurchases.\nMoving on to our Energy business. We continue to actively evaluate alternatives for this business with relevant work streams underway. This includes preparing for the potential creation of a stand-alone public entity that would benefit from enhanced independence, agility and unique brand value.\nWe are also exploring how to structure such a transaction in a way that enhances tax efficiency to the benefit of our shareholders. We believe the 2021 ACV momentum, the penetration runway we have for Lens and the long-term growth prospects of the energy transition represent an immediate growth and return opportunity.\nWe are also undertaking a more intensive review of where we can leverage data sets across our Insurance and Energy businesses to create value for our clients and shareholders. These actions, combined with an improving energy industry end market and newly changed leadership team within the business unit, give us confidence in the continued momentum of this business and gives us the necessary flexibility regardless of which long-term strategic path we pursue.\nIn connection with our comprehensive portfolio review, we are also undertaking a proactive study of our cost structure, make sure that we better align our costs with the scale and requirements of our ongoing Verisk businesses. Under Mark's leadership, we will continue to work to reduce our overall expense base by more than just those costs associated with the 2 business units we have agreed to divest.\nThis work includes productivity initiatives from our lean Six Sigma teams, use of our global talent optimization hubs, the continued modernization of our technology infrastructure and careful management headcount. Certain of these actions are already underway, and we plan to further update you on our progress on our next earnings call.\nWe have confidence that through our asset management costs and ongoing transformation of our portfolio, cost structure and technology infrastructure, we can return to growth in line with our long-term objectives and deliver OCC-adjusted EBITDA growth ahead of revenue growth in 2022 and beyond.\nOn our technology transformation, we continue to make progress on our move to the cloud, and 2022 marks the fiscal year. I'm pleased to share that Verisk no longer owns mainframe, and we've outsourced our small mainframe footprint. Additionally, as we approach over 3/4 of our compute environment residing into the cloud, we will reach the point late this year where we will begin closing the first of our U.S. state centers with the second to follow in 2023 and officially retire the mainframe of that time. This is an exciting milestone for Verisk, and we look forward to achieving these goals and delivering all the benefits of cloud to our customers.\nBefore turning it to Lee, let me touch on our strong free cash flow generation, which enables us to find the highest return on invested capital opportunities, while also directly returning capital to our shareholders. In 2021, we returned over [$660 million] to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. I'm pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved a 7% increase in our annualized cash dividend to $1.24 a share and an incremental $1 billion in our share repurchase authorization to support ongoing capital return.\nAnd now with that, let me turn the call over to Lee for the financial review.\n\nLee M. Shavel\n\nCFO and Group President of Energy, Specialized Markets & Financial Services Segments, Verisk Analytics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Scott. And on behalf of the entire team, let me thank you for your leadership and dedication to Verisk. You have driven the success of Verisk, broadened our horizons and provide a rare balance of leadership and humanity. It has been a privilege to work with you and learn from you over the past 5 years. And I'm fortunate to know that I will have your support and counsel through this transition.\nI'm humbled to be named Verisk's next CEO and excited about our opportunities to build upon our track record of success and further strengthen the company ahead. I would like to thank the many shareholders, who have personally expressed their confidence in my leadership ahead. And it has been a pleasure to get to know so many of you over the past 5 years, understand your perspective and take your input. I look forward to building on this dialogue going forward.\nBefore we discuss the financial results, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted our traditional quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. For the fourth quarter of 2021, on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 7.4% to $766 million. Net income attributable to Verisk decreased 19.5% to $142 million, while diluted capital (inaudible) attributable to Verisk decreased 18.7% to $0.87 per share.\nOur GAAP results include a release of a $50 million litigation reserve previously taken for a patent suit with a new technology that has now been settled and a $134 million noncash impairment charge related to our Financial Services segment.\nMoving to our organic constant currency results. Adjusted for nonoperating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, we are very pleased with our operating results led by continued and consistent growth in our subscription revenues.\nIn the fourth quarter, organic constant currency revenue grew 5.2% driven by continued strength in our Insurance segment and sequential improvement within our Energy and Financial Services segments. Our non-COVID-sensitive revenue as we defined at the beginning of the pandemic increased 6.2% in the fourth quarter of 2021, our strong quarter of growth for the year. This stable growth in our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, representing 85% of our total revenues, reflects the durability and resilience of our primarily subscription model and the (inaudible) of our solutions.\nOur COVID-sensitive revenues, which represent 15% of our consolidated revenues, declined 1.1% as compared to declines of 12.5% in the fourth quarter last year. While certain of our businesses are back to prepandemic levels, we experienced a modest step back relative to the [fourth] quarter in certain transactional businesses, including workers' compensation claims solutions, repair estimating solutions, auto solutions and energy consulting services.\nAdditionally, we saw continued COVID-related weakness in the part of our Financial Services segment related to bankruptcy volumes. To be specific, our COVID-sensitive revenues decreased 2% in both our Insurance and Energy segments, but increased 4% within Financial Services. As we move into 2022, we will no longer report this breakdown of our revenue growth as it's becoming less relevant as we are 2 years into the pandemic and compares have normalized.\nConsolidated OCC-adjusted EBITDA growth was 7.6% in the fourth quarter, reflecting core operating leverage on solid revenue growth and cost efficiencies. Total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic revenue and adjusted EBITDA was 49% in the quarter, up 80 basis points on a year-over-year basis and still well above our prepandemic margin level of 47.1% recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nWhile we are experiencing some inflation in certain of our salaries and benefits and the return of certain COVID-related costs back into the business, we were able to offset that with core operating leverage and efficiencies. This level of margin also includes approximately 70 basis points of headwind from our ongoing technological transformation, including our cloud transition costs, which we absorbed into our cost structure.\nThat said, we are already generating real economic value from our cloud transition as our cash flow benefits primarily from lower capital expenditures on third-party hardware and software exceed our P&L expense.\nOn that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. In the fourth quarter, Insurance segment revenues increased 6.4%. We saw healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, claims analytics solutions, extreme event solutions, life insurance solutions and international insurance software solutions.\nWe did experience a 2% decline in our transactional revenues because of a slower storm season versus last year and a modest step back in certain COVID-related revenues, including workers' compensation claim solutions. Adjusted EBITDA grew 6.3% in the fourth quarter, while margins declined 50 basis points to 54.1%, reflecting a return to a more normalized rate of headcount growth compared to the prior year, higher year-over-year short-term incentive compensation expense and the return of certain travel expenses.\nNevertheless, this quarter's margin is still 160 basis points above our pre-pandemic levels recorded in 2019 and continues to reflect accelerated investment in our high-growth areas like life insurance and marketing solutions, the impact of acquisitions as well as our technology modernization, including our cloud transition. Energy specialized markets revenue increased 2.8% in the fourth quarter, a modest sequential improvement from the third quarter were building momentum as we enter 2022.\nIn the quarter, we delivered double-digit growth in energy transition and chemicals research, coupled with modest growth in our core research subscriptions. As Scott mentioned, we continue to benefit from strong adoption of our Lens platform as customers are seeing value of our integrated cloud-based data analytic environment and had a successful renewal cycle in the fourth quarter of 2021, our largest renewal quarter of the year.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 15.3% in the fourth quarter, and margins expanded 360 basis points to 36.2%. A portion of the margin expansion reflects favorable comparisons versus last year's fourth quarter, which included a timing difference for certain compensation expenses that were onetime in nature. For the full year, margins in the Energy segment expanded 90 basis points, reflecting core operating leverage and inclusive of continued investment in our Lens platform and our cloud transition.\nAs we go forward to 2022 for modeling purposes, 3E contributed a high teens percentage of segment level revenue and adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2021. Given that the transaction is likely to close in the first quarter of 2022, financial results for this business will be included in our GAAP results but will be excluded from all organic constant currency growth (inaudible).\nFinancial Services revenue was essentially flat in the quarter, reflecting double-digit growth in combined spend-informed analytics and portfolio management, offset by continued weakness primarily in the bankruptcy business. Adjusted EBITDA increased 4.6% in the quarter, while total adjusted EBITDA margins were 28.9%, up 230 basis points year-over-year because of expense discipline. Like 3E, results from VFS will be included in our GAAP results but fully excluded from all organic constant currency growth figures.\nOur reported effective tax rate was 13.7% compared to 18.4% in the prior year quarter. This quarterly tax rate benefited from higher levels of stock activity and certain long-time discrete items in the quarter. Looking ahead to 2022, we expect our full year tax rate to be between 20% and 22%, though there will likely be some quarterly variability related to the pace of employee stock (inaudible).\nAdjusted net income increased 14.8% to [$240 million] and adjusted -- diluted adjusted EPS increased 15.7% to $1.47 for the fourth quarter 2021. These increases (inaudible) organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions, a lower effective tax rate and a lower average (inaudible).\nNet cash provided by operating activities was (inaudible) for the quarter, down 24% from the prior year period, reflecting the impact of the onetime payment related to the settlement of the (inaudible) litigation. For the full year, net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion, reflecting growth of 8.2% versus the prior year period.\nCapital expenditures were $85.2 million for the quarter, up 17.8% versus last year, reflecting increases in capitalized software development, offset in part by savings on third-party software and hardware as we move to the cloud. CapEx for the full year 2021 was $268.4 million as we continue to invest in innovation and future growth opportunities. Capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue was 9% for 2021.\nAs we have discussed previously, our business is becoming increasingly software-intensive, organically and through our recent acquisitions. Our customers are recognizing the value and capabilities that our proprietary software can deliver as evidenced by increased subscription pricing and deeper integration with our customers' workflows.\nAs we look forward to 2022, we expect our capital expenditures to approximately $280 million to $310 million. This range supports our plans to increase our software investment through the acceleration of our pace of development in Lens and extending software development into core underwriting, where we believe there is a similar opportunity for enhancement.\nAdditionally, it reflects the reality of inflation or hiring talent in software deployment, data science and cloud architecture and the impact of prior acquisitions. These software investments generate some internal rates of return as we drive incremental value by distributing these platforms across the customer base to become even more deeply embedded in customer workforce. We believe these investments will continue to build upon the trend of improving returns on invested capital we recently delivered.\nRelated to CapEx, we expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization to be within the range of $220 million to $240 million and intangible amortization to be approximately [$145 million]. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to FX variability, the timing of purchases and the completion of projects and future M&A activity.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we returned $122 million in capital to shareholders from share repurchases and dividends that our strong cash flow allows us to invest both in client growth and highest return initiatives while also returning capital to shareholders consistently. As we look to 2022, we expect to deploy after-tax proceeds from the sale of our 3E and Verisk financial businesses for share repurchases in addition to our normal pace of quarterly repurchases that we generally execute through an accelerated share repurchase program.\nIn summary, we are seeing increased momentum across our businesses as demonstrated by our business. At the same time, we are making important progress executing on strategic, operational and governance initiatives, several of which we announced since our last quarterly call and some of which remain ongoing today and all of which are consistent with our commitment to enhancing shareholder value.\nWe will continue to move diligently in pursuing the most value (inaudible) for our shareholders and all of Verisk's stakeholders. And we have confidence that through our active cost management and ongoing transformation of our portfolio, cost structure and technology (inaudible), we can return to growth in line with our long-term objectives and deliver OCC-adjusted EBITDA ahead of revenue growth in 2022 and beyond.\nWe hope this provides some useful context for you, and we look forward to addressing your questions. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. (Operator Instructions) With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

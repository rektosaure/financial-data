Please note, this event is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Jordan, please go ahead.\n\nJordan Sadler\n\nAnalyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Digital Realty's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on today's call are President and CEO, Andy Power; and CFO, Matt Mercier. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Colin McLean, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A.\nManagement will be making forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC.\nThis call will contain certain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website.\nBefore I turn the call over to Andy, let me offer a few key takeaways from our third quarter results. First, we posted $1.89 in core FFO per share, a quarterly record and 13% higher than the third quarter of last year. Constant currency core FFO per share was $1.85, 11% higher than last year. Other profitability metrics surged as well with AFFO per share and adjusted EBITDA up 16% and 14% year-over-year, respectively. These strong earnings results were comfortably ahead of expectations, resulting in our third quarterly guidance increased so far this year.\nSecond, we have strong visibility to continued growth given our near-record backlog and crisp execution. Our backlog grew to $852 million, with the lion's share slated to commence through the end of next year, while organic growth continues to accelerate as demonstrated by 8% same capital cash NOI growth year-over-year.\nThird, we continue to execute across the full product spectrum and our footprint with over $200 million of bookings at 100% share, near record 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection bookings in the quarter with a leading power bank of 5 gigawatts of IT load to support our customers and Digital Realty's future growth.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Andy Power.\n\nAndrew P. Power\n\nCFO, Digital Realty Trust, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. As digital transformation, cloud and AI continue to grow, our ability to deliver scalable connected infrastructure across key metros worldwide is more critical than ever.\nPlatformDIGITAL's global reach and full spectrum product offering are key differentiators, enabling us to support the evolving needs of cloud providers, enterprises and service partners around the world.\nOver the past 2 years, the data center industry has experienced unprecedented demand fueled by the digitization of enterprise business processes, the expansion of cloud and the ongoing proliferation of AI, resulting in complex hybrid IT architectures.\nDemand for scalable connected infrastructure remains robust across a wide range of customer segments from global cloud platforms to regional service providers and multinational enterprises. Meeting this demand within our markets, however, is becoming increasingly challenging. Power availability, permitting challenges and infrastructure constraints are making it harder to bring new supply online at the pace our customers require.\nDigital Realty's established presence in the world's leading metros, deep relationships with utilities and local governments and proven development track record give us a distinct advantage in navigating these challenges and delivering capacity efficiently and reliably where and when our customers need it.\nIn an attempt to help frame how we see the abundance of data center infrastructure announcements we are all seeing in the market, I want to make a few comments. It is clear that the world is engaged in a full-scale technology race with a handful of key players aiming to build the most advanced AI models or perhaps even AGI.\n3 years post launch, ChatGPT holds the title of the fastest-growing app and is already among the most highly used applications in the world with more than 800 million weekly users. Several others, including Meta, Google, Baidu and xAI have also developed AI with meaningful scale.\nWith each passing week, we continue to see massive investment announcements and partnerships aimed at scaling the infrastructure necessary to support the world's most powerful AI training models.\nGiven the scale of these announcements, the ongoing development and proliferation of AI offerings, the opportunity still appears to be in the very early innings. The preponderance of gigawatt campus announcements to date have generally fallen outside of the major metro markets in Digital Realty's strategic footprint as model builders and their providers have urgently sought locations that offer readily available and abundant power as power is the limiting factor for scaling AI.\nThe anticipated pace and scale of these developments are largely unprecedented. Given our experience and track record in the space, we are intrigued as several new market entrants have launched the development of massive and complex remote campuses, often to support a single use case, workload or customer. These facilities hold the promise of developing life-changing technologies, and we are optimistic about their prospects.\nTraining workloads geared toward developing the AI models can be described as latency tolerant as the development of the AI takes precedent over the utilization of the technology, at least for now.\nNow based on conversations that we are having with our customers and industry participants, Al as well as what we are seeing in our broad portfolio, we are increasingly confident that connectivity will become increasingly important over time as model success drives implementation and usage requiring lower latency, inference oriented deployments.\nDigital Realty has landed a meaningful share of AI-oriented deployments over the last 2 years. Since mid-2023, AI has averaged more than 50% of our quarterly bookings, and we continue to expect that the 5 gigawatts of IT load that we have in our power bank will be significantly weighted toward AI workloads over the next several years.\nCritically, our data center capacity is situated in and around the world's most highly connected cloud zonal markets with the highest concentration of population and GDP, and we currently maintain 5 gigawatts of large continuous capacity blocks situated across 40 of our strategic metros across the globe. It's harder to build in these locations for a growing list of reasons, and we expect this capacity will continue to be highly sought after as new applications and use cases continue to evolve.\nOur conviction in our portfolio and in our markets continue to be evidenced through our daily engagement with our 5,000-plus customers.\nDigital Realty continues to see a robust pipeline of demand from AI-oriented use cases. And even without a record hyperscale lease like the one we signed in March of 2025, 50% of our bookings were related to AI use cases in the third quarter.\nIn Q3, we again delivered strong operational and financial performance, underscored by record interconnection bookings, near record new logos and the second highest level of bookings ever in our 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection product set.\nCore FFO per share set a record $1.89 and a robust 13% above last year's third quarter. These strong earnings were driven by 10% operating revenue growth and continued expansion of our high-margin fee income together with disciplined expense management, resulting in the third consecutive guidance increase this year.\nBookings in the third quarter were $201 million at 100% share or $162 million at Digital Realty share. Like last quarter, our 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection category was a strong contributor to our leasing strength with $85 million in new leases, along with a healthy $76 million of greater than a megawatt lease image.\nLeasing was globally diversified, broadly consistent with our existing rent roll with notable activity in the Americas, in EMEA and in APAC. We also added a near record 156 new logos.\nInterconnection leasing of $20 million marked a second consecutive record quarter, which was 13% higher than the last quarter's record, underscoring the growing recognition of our connectivity-driven value proposition. Interconnect and leasing was buoyed by strength in our AI-oriented fiber offering, reflecting an increased demand for high volume movement of data amongst customers as well as momentum in our Service Fabric product. Matt will provide more details on our results in a few moments.\nWhile there's been significant market focus on large-scale AI deployments, Digital Realty's pull of highly sought after larger contiguous capacity blocks are slated to come online in late 2026, 2027 and beyond. We remain actively engaged with hyperscale customers on our largest future leasing opportunities, and we continue to see strong momentum in our colocation and connectivity product offering.\nEnterprise demand for data center infrastructure continues to grow as organizations transition away from traditional on-prem IT environments toward more flexible cloud connected architectures available within Digital Realty data centers. This shift is driven by the need to improve scalability, reduce costs and enable faster innovation. Enterprises are increasingly deploying workloads in colocation and hybrid environments to gain proximity to cloud platforms, partners and end users while maintaining control over mission-critical applications and data.\nDigital Realty's full-spectrum product offering, combined with our global footprint allows us to support this transition, provide the infrastructure and connectivity enterprises need to modernize their IT strategies accelerate digital transformation and AI implementation.\nWe're seeing these trends play out across our customer base as enterprises increasingly turn to Digital Realty to support the evolving -- their involving infrastructure needs. Whether it's enabling real-time data exchange across global operations, integrating with multiple cloud platforms or deploying AI workloads at the edge, our customers are leveraging platform digital to solve complex challenges and accelerate their digital transformation.\nLet me share a few examples that illustrate how our platform is helping enterprises unlock new capabilities and drive meaningful business outcomes.\nIn September, I was honored to join the CEO and CEO of Oxford Quantum Circuits for an important milestone during their recent deployment of New York's first Quantum AI computer in our JFK 10 data center. Oxford Quantum Circus is taking advantage of Platform Digital's colocation and connectivity capabilities to expand their AI capabilities at scale, solving for efficiency and resource constraints. A leading global technology company chose PlatformDIGITAL to deploy their global presence, taking advantage of liquid cooling capabilities required for their HPC AI environments.\nA leading health care analytics and technology solutions company is expanding its Geographic presence on PlatformDIGITAL to solve data localization and sovereignty challenges. A leading higher education research institute is taking advantage of PlatformDIGITAL's liquid cooling capabilities required for their HPC and AI deployment. A leading European technology and network provider is expanding on PlatformDIGITAL, deploying a sovereign cloud solution in the U.S. to support their customers' compliance needs. A global payments provider and new logo for Digital Realty chose PlatformDIGITAL to deploy infrastructure in multiple markets to utilize network and cloud ecosystems while solving for scalability and compliance requirements. And a multinational financial services company is expanding on PlatformDIGITAL, taking advantage of Digital Realty's leading financial and network ecosystems.\nBefore I turn it over to Matt, I'd like to briefly highlight our progress on global sustainability. In the third quarter, we received the EcoVadis Gold rating, the prestigious international recognition for business sustainability. This recognition places us in the 97th percentile of all companies assessed, highlighting our position among the top sustainability performers worldwide.\nWe expanded our renewable energy commitment in Illinois by signing additional contracts that support high-impact local community solar projects being developed by Soltage. These locally sourced solar energy projects will help support local power grids and benefit residents in the communities in and around our data centers.\nAdditionally, in the third quarter, we announced long-term renewable energy agreements with Current Hydro to procure 500 gigawatt hours of clean baseload hydro power from 3 projects along the Ohio River. These agreements highlight our commitment to sourcing new firm 24/7, carbon-free energy in the regions where we operate, enabling us to support our customers' needs.\nAnd with that, I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Matt Mercier.\n\nMatthew R. Mercier\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Andy. For the second consecutive quarter, Digital Realty posted double-digit growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA and core FFO per share, reflecting the momentum in our business, driven by commencements from our substantial backlog strong releasing spreads, modest churn and growing fee income. We achieved these record results while reducing our leverage and maintaining significant liquidity to invest in data center projects across our 5 gigawatt runway of buildable IT capacity.\nIn the third quarter, core FFO per share grew by an attractive 13% year-over-year to a new quarterly record while leasing results were highlighted by their geographic and product breadth as well as continued strength in the 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection category.\nLooking ahead to the fourth quarter, we increased guidance for the full year once again and expect to begin 2026 with significant momentum in the sizable backlog which extends our runway for long-term growth.\nAs Andy touched on, we signed leases representing $201 million of annualized rent in the third quarter, bringing year-to-date leasing to $776 million at 100% share. At Digital Realty share, we signed $162 million of new leases in the third quarter, which is well distributed across our 3 reasons.\nOur 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection product set continued to demonstrate the strong momentum we have been highlighting, posting $85 million of new bookings in the quarter, led by record bookings in the Americas and strength in EMEA.\nWe also posted record AI bookings in this segment this past quarter, demonstrating the continued emergence of AI-oriented demand among our enterprise customers.\nInterconnection bookings also marked a new record, vesting last quarter's record by 13%. Pricing in the 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection category was strong, led by leasing in one of our most highly connected facilities in the U.S. Over the past 4 quarters, we've leased a robust $319 million in this product set.\nWe signed $76 million within the greater than the megawatt category at our share while leasing spread across our regions but notable strength in EMEA. Pricing in the greater than megawatt product was strong, averaging over $200 per kilowatt in the quarter and reflected activity in our top 3 performing markets, Silicon Valley, Amsterdam and Singapore.\nBuilding on our leasing momentum, our backlog at Digital Realty share increased to $852 million at quarter end, with $137 million of commencements more than offset by our new bookings. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect another $165 million of leases to commence with another $555 million scheduled to commence throughout 2026. Our large backlog provides us with strong visibility and predictability for the next several quarters.\nDuring the third quarter, we signed $192 million of renewal leases at a blended 8% increase on a cash basis. Renewals in the third quarter were again heavily weighted toward our 0-1 megawatt category with $138 million of renewals at a 4.2% uplift.\nGreater than the megawatt renewals of $49 million saw an exceptional 20% cash re-leasing spread, driven by deals in Singapore, Chicago, Northern Virginia and New Jersey. Year-to-date, cash renewals averaged 7%. For the quarter, total churn remained low at 1.6%.\nAs for earnings, we reported record core FFO of $1.89 per share, up 13% year-over-year, reflecting strong upside from commencements and positive re-leasing spreads continued growth in fee income and an FX benefit versus last year. On a constant currency basis, we reported core FFO per share of $1.85 in the third quarter or 11% growth year-over-year.\nData center revenue was up 9% year-over-year, but adjusted EBITDA was even greater at 14% year-over-year, driven by the growth in data center revenue and higher fee income.\nDuring the quarter, operating expenses continued to increase, reflecting both the growing scale of our business, rising employment costs and seasonal effects. As we head toward the end of the year, we expect to see the typical seasonal increase in repairs and maintenance expenses along with the seasonal decline in utility expenses and related reimbursements.\nSame capital cash NOI growth was strong in the third quarter, increasing by 8% year-over-year, driven by 7.8% growth in data center revenue. On a constant currency basis, same-capital cash NOI rose 5.2% in the quarter. For the 9 months, same capital cash NOI grew by 4.5% on a constant-currency basis, which prompted us to notch our full year guidance range up to 4.25% to 4.75%.\nMoving on to our investment activity. During the third quarter, we spent over $900 million on development CapEx when including our partner share and approximately $700 million on a net basis to Digital Realty. During the quarter, we delivered about 50 megawatts of new capacity, 85% of which was pre-leased. While we started about 50 megawatts of net new data center projects leaving 730 megawatts under construction.\nAt quarter end, our gross data center development pipeline stood at $9.7 billion at an 11.6% expected stabilized yield. Our runway for future growth including land, shell and ongoing development stands at roughly 5 gigawatts of sellable IT load. For clarification, IT load difference from the gross utility feed figures being tiered by newer entrants to the data center development world as utility feed must also be used to cool a data center and to provide redundancy.\nDuring the third quarter, we pruned a few small noncore facilities in Atlanta, Boston and Miami for a total of $90 million. And earlier in October, sold a noncore facility in Dallas for $33 million. We redeployed $67 million of that capital into land in Chicago and Los Angeles to bolster our development capacity.\nTurning to the balance sheet, leverage fell to 4.9x, well below our long-term target of 5.5x while balance sheet liquidity remained robust at nearly $7 billion. which excludes the $15 billion of private capital we have arranged to support hyperscale development and investment through our joint ventures and new U.S. hyperscale data center fund.\nOur next debt maturity is EUR 1.1 billion notes at 2.5% in January 2026. Beyond that, we have a smaller CHF 275 million note at 0.2% that matures in the second half of next year. Looking further out, our maturities remain well laddered through 2035.\nLet me conclude with our guidance. We are increasing our core FFO guidance range for the full year 2025 by roughly 2% at the midpoint to a new range of $7.32 to $7.38 per share to reflect better-than-expected operating performance and updated FX assumptions for the full year. We are also increasing the midpoint of our constant currency core FFO guidance range by 2% to $7.25 to $7.30 per share.\nDespite our enthusiasm and outperformance in the quarter, we expect fourth quarter core FFO per share to be tempered by seasonally higher repairs and maintenance expenses, headwinds from a noncore asset sale and lower interest income associated with lower rates and cash balances.\nThe midpoint of our increased core FFO per share guidance represents approximately 10% year-over-year growth, reflecting the momentum in our underlying business and the benefit of the weaker U.S. dollar year-to-date.\nOn a constant currency basis, core FFO per share growth is expected to be over 8% at the midpoint, reflecting a 200-plus basis point improvement from the growth that we forecasted at the beginning of this year.\nSupporting the bottom line improvements in guidance, we are increasing the midpoint of our revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance ranges for 2025 by $75 million a piece. We are raising the midpoint of our cash and GAAP re-leasing spread guidance ranges to 6% and 8%, respectively, to reflect the continued strength in market fundamentals. We are also increasing our constant currency same-capital cash NOI growth assumption by 50 basis points at the midpoint to 4.5%. Lastly, we are increasing the midpoint of our G&A assumption by $7.5 million for full year 2025.\nIn summary, we are very proud of our third quarter performance and the continued momentum across our platform. The strength of 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection product set, combined with disciplined execution across our 5 gigawatt power bank and a growing backlog positions us well to deliver durable growth through the rest of 2025 and 2026. We remain focused on executing our strategy to deliver the capacity that our customers require and to maintain the financial discipline to drive long-term value for our stakeholders.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. And now we would be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session?"

Please note this event is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Jordan, please go ahead.\n\nJordan Sadler\n\nAnalyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Digital Realty's Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on today's call are President and CEO, Andy Power; and CFO, Matt Mercier; Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Colin McLean, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A.\nManagement will be making forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain certain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website.\nBefore I turn the call over to Andy, let me offer a few key takeaways from our second quarter results. First, we posted $177 million of new bookings in the quarter at 100% share, including $135 million of Digital Realty share. Record performance in the 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection product set stole the show in the quarter with $90 million of bookings. Second, core FFO surged to a record $1.87 per share, outperforming expectations for the quarter and contributing to an increase in our revenue, adjusted EBITDA and core FFO per share guidance for full year 2025.\nAnd third, we continue to extend our runway for better long-term growth with oversubscribed LP equity commitments for our first U.S. hyperscale data center fund, additional development site acquisitions in key U.S. markets, and a robust balance sheet that is highlighted by more than $7 billion of liquidity and below target leverage.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Andy Power.\n\nAndrew P. Power\n\nCFO, Digital Realty Trust, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. As enterprise digital transformation, cloud computing and AI adoption continue to accelerate, Digital Realty's global platform is uniquely positioned to meet the full spectrum of customer needs while delivering differentiated value. With our 20-year track record of execution as a data center operator, 5 gigawatts of development capacity and more than $15 billion of private capital supported, digital Realty has the wherewithal to service its growing enterprise and hyperscale customer base for the years to come. .\nOver the past 2.5 years, we have been focused on driving better, long-term sustainable growth in core FFO per share, and we are starting to see the fruits of our labor. A key pillar of our full spectrum strategy is our 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection business which is anchored by connectivity-rich metro campuses. These campuses typically located near where data is created and consumed, host mission-critical deployments that support hybrid multi-cloud IT, vital network infrastructure, industry-specific latency-sensitive applications and AI inference among other workloads.\nThe common thread across these use cases is connectivity, and we have made it a priority to enhance our interconnection capabilities and services across the platform. Our focus on strengthening the customer value proposition is delivering results. Bookings in our 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection products have seen consistent growth with momentum accelerating over the past year even as large AI-oriented leases have been in the spotlight.\nAt the beginning of last year, we set an ambitious goal to double our colocation bookings, and we're well on our way to achieving it. In the second quarter, we signed $177 million of gross leases, including $135 million at share. Digital Realty share of bookings were led by $90 million in our 0 to 1-megawatt plus interconnection category, a record result that is 18% higher than our prior record set only 2 quarters ago.\nOver the past 4 quarters, we have booked over $300 million in this category, up from approximately $200 million in 2023. This quarter's success wasn't driven by any single deal or even a dominant metro. Instead, leasing was broad-based with equal contributions from EMEA and the Americas along with a healthy dose from APAC. Importantly, we also delivered record interconnection bookings in the quarter as the momentum we've seen in the 0 to 1-megawatt category is starting to pay off as customers have deployed their [ gear ] in our facilities and need to support the underlying workloads with connectivity. The bottom line output of this success is our core FFO per share growth.\nWe earned a record $1.87 per share this quarter, a robust 13% increase over last year's results and 6% higher than last quarter. While the rate of acceleration and bottom line growth this quarter is notable and demonstrates the significant momentum we have in our business, our growth will be best measured in years.\nWith our backlog at $826 million, we have strong visibility through the end of 2025 and beyond. Matt will provide details on the financials in a few minutes. The demand environment for data center capacity remains strong and broad based, both geographically and by product type, driven by secular tailwinds in digital transformation, cloud and AI. Demand for both sub 1 megawatt and large capacity blocks continues unabated. For sub-1 megawatt capacity, our pipeline is broad and deep across all regions and as evidenced by a 4-month book-to-bill this quarter, these deals can typically be deployed much more quickly.\nWe continue to position our large capacity blocks to support the growing needs of our hyperscale customers as we work to align development deliveries with the availability of power, and this approach has served us well so far. In North America, near-term capacity blocks continue to be the most in demand, and we've had great success in placing our near-term development, so most of the discussions that we are having are focused on late 2026 and early 2027 deliveries.\nIn EMEA, demand from AI deployments is growing, but is still well behind the U.S. Consistent with historical trends, the larger capacity blocks in this region tend to be smaller than those in the U.S. In APAC, hyperscale demand is expanding, particularly in Tokyo and Singapore. Similar to EMEA, AI deployments are growing in APAC, but like the U.S.\nAnother sign of the strong demand environment is the tremendous success that we have enjoyed in launching our U.S. hyperscale data center fund, the latest evolution of our strategic objective to bolster and diversify our capital sources. Since our last earnings report, we have continued to receive commitments to the fund from a broad array of global institutions, including sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, insurance companies, endowments and other institutional investors.\nWe have received more than $3 billion of LP equity commitments to date and are on target for our final closing well ahead of our target raise and our original schedule. We are truly humble that so many of the world's leading investors chose to invest their long-term capital in Digital Realty's inaugural fund. The early success of our U.S. hyperscale fund improves our strategic position by enabling us to continue to meet the growing and diverse needs of our hyperscale customers without overtaxing our balance sheet.\nWhile execution across our colocation and interconnection category will serve as the primary lever for growth in 2025 and 2026, we expect our substantial [indiscernible] capacity to bolster our backlog and to extend our run rate for core FFO growth into 2027 and beyond. In today's competitive business environment, enterprises need the ability to scale quickly and securely across regions, and that's exactly what Platform Digital enables.\nMany of our customers start with a single deployment but rapidly expand across our global footprint to interconnect with clouds, partners and data at the edge. This seamless scalability is not only solving real customer challenges, it's also enhancing our value proposition, evidenced by more customers, lower churn, deeper wallet share and growing recurring revenue streams. This strategic advantage continues to set Digital Realty apart, driving the addition of 139 new logos in the second quarter.\nNow as we announced this morning, we are providing enterprises with additional state-of-the-art services through our partnership with Oracle Solution Centers to further optimize these deployments and accelerate their hybrid IT and AI adoption. Key customer wins in the quarter include a global financial services company is expanding its presence on Platform Digital to another metro to solve compliance and data localization challenges.\nA leading blockchain providers deploy edge nodes in multiple locations on Platform Digital to support decentralized private and public networks. The health care services company has expanded its presence on platform digital to solve its data resiliency and locational challenges. An autonomous vehicle developer is expanding to 2 more metros on platform digital to take advantage of the available cloud and network ecosystems.\nA global cloud provider has expanded its presence on Platform digital by creating a new edge availability zone to support their growing customer base. And having grown up a Star Wars fan, I'm particularly delighted to share that Lucasfilms is expanding their presence on Platform Digital, taking advantage of high-performance compute and AI capabilities to solve video [indiscernible] rendering, transfer and [ editing ] challenges.\nBefore turning it over to Matt, I'd like to briefly highlight on our progress on global sustainability. In the second quarter, we maintained strong execution against our sustainability goals and were once again [indiscernible] recognized by [ Times and Statista ] as one of the world's most sustainable companies of 2025, a reflection of our continued leadership in the space. In late June, we published our 2024 impact report which showcases Digital's ongoing commitment to clean energy, resource conservation and other sustainable business practices.\nAmong the highlights in the report, we further expanded our renewable energy supplies with 185 data centers now match with 100% renewable energy, while 75% of our global electricity needs were met with renewable energy in 2024, a 9% increase from the prior year. We achieved a 14% year-over-year reduction in water usage intensity in our North American colocation portfolio by implementing water free-based cooling systems and water conservation projects.\nWe expanded our portfolio of certified sustainable data center developments, adding 1.9 million square feet in 2024 and bringing our global total to a cumulative 15 million square feet. These initiatives reflect our ongoing commitment to minimize Digital Realty's environmental footprint while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders.\nAnd with that, I'd now turn the call over to our CFO, Matt Mercier.\n\nMatthew R. Mercier\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Andy. Digital Realty posted double-digit growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA and core FFO this quarter, reflecting the momentum that we've built up over the past year. These results were driven by record lease commencements, low churn and higher fee income. We achieved these results while substantially increasing our liquidity, maintaining below target leverage and also preserving a large backlog and development capacity that provides strong visibility through the second half of the year and beyond.\nIn the second quarter, core FFO jumped by 13% year-over-year to a new quarterly record, while leasing results were highlighted by a notable new record in our 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection category. Looking ahead, we've increased our guidance for 2025, and we expect to exit the year with significant momentum and a sizable backlog.\nDigging a bit deeper on leasing. We signed leases representing $177 million of annualized rent in the second quarter, bringing the year-to-date leasing to $575 million at 100% share. At Digital Realty share, we signed $135 million of new leases in the second quarter. Of this, $90 million fell within our 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection product set, which exceeded our prior quarterly record by 18%.\nRelative to the prior 4 quarter average, quarterly leasing in this product set was up by 36%. We signed $45 million within the greater than the megawatt category at our share with leasing spread across our regions. Our top 5 leases in this segment range from 2 to 12 megawatts, and saw steady to improve pricing. Notably, average pricing in this segment was skewed lower in the quarter by the exercise of an expansion option by a large enterprise customer in North America, which was committed to more than 3 years ago.\nConsistent with our objective of improving Digital Realty's long-term sustainable growth, more than 70% of bookings included fixed rent escalators of at least 4% or were linked to CPI. Our backlog at Digital Realty share totaled $826 million at quarter end. A record $220 million of commencements was only partially offset by our new bookings. Looking ahead to the second half of 2025, we expect another $241 million of leases to commence, which are more heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter. For 2026, we currently have $461 million scheduled to commence while an incremental $124 million is already slated to commence in 2027 and beyond. providing strong visibility for multiyear growth.\nDuring the second quarter, we signed $177 million of renewal leases at a blended 7.3% increase on a cash basis, above the high end of our original 4% to 6% full year guidance. Renewals in the second quarter were again heavily weighted towards our 0 to 1-megawatt category with $130 million of renewals at a 4.2% uplift. Greater than megawatt renewals of $41 million saw a robust 14% cash re-leasing spread.\nFor the quarter, total churn continued to decline to just 1% with negligible churn in our greater than a megawatt category. As for earnings, we reported record quarterly core FFO of $1.87 per share, up [ 13% ] year-over-year, reflecting strong upside from hyperscale commencements, better-than-expected progress on 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection bookings and $0.03 of FX benefit. On a constant currency basis, we reported core FFO per share of $1.84 in the second quarter.\nDuring the quarter, we saw an approximately $0.03 benefit in fee income tied to large scalable deliveries of data center capacity, which corresponded with our record leasing commencements. While our operating expenses picked back up from last quarter's unusually low levels. The uptick was consistent with our growing book of business and repair and maintenance expenses remain on pace for a seasonal ramp in the second half of the year.\nData center revenue was up by a robust 11% year-over-year as the combination of strong renewal spreads, rent escalators and new lease commencements more than offset the drag associated with the dispositions completed over the last 12 months. The increase in adjusted EBITDA was even greater at 13% year-over-year, reflecting the growth in data center revenue and higher fee income.\n[indiscernible] Same capital cash NOI growth was also healthy in the second quarter, increasing by 4.4% year-over-year, driven by a 5.9% growth in data center revenue. On a constant currency basis, same capital cash NOI rose 1.8% in the quarter. Results were influenced by a bad debt reserve associated with broader macroeconomic and geopolitical factors and a prior year cash rent payment.\nFor the first half of 2025, same capital cash NOI was up 3.4%. Moving on to our investment activity. During the second quarter, we spent over $900 million on development CapEx on a gross basis, which includes our partner share and approximately $700 million on a net basis to Digital Realty. During the quarter, we delivered a record 96 megawatts of new capacity, 98% of which was pre-leased while 16 megawatts of new data center projects started construction, leaving 734 megawatts under construction.\nAt quarter end, our gross data center development pipeline stood at $9 billion and a 12.2% expected stabilized yield. Data center shells under construction increased to 610 megawatts during the quarter, while our land bank grew to 3.7 gigawatts, extending our runway for capacity growth to a record 5 gigawatts.\nAs Andy noted earlier, we are also pleased with the success we've had to our U.S. hyperscale data center fund, which has the potential to support approximately $10 billion of total data center investment from the existing commitments. In the second quarter, digital contributed a 40% share of the 5 existing operating assets, along with an 80% share of 2 development sites, resulting in a $900 million of gross proceeds to Digital Realty.\nSubsequent to quarter end, we also sold a noncore data center in Atlanta for $65 million. With the fund contribution and the noncore asset sale completed, we exceeded the midpoint of our prior disposition guidance for 2025.\nTurning to the balance sheet. By evolving our funding model, we are able to extend our reach to better serve the needs of our hyperscale customers without overly taxing our balance sheet. Leverage remains at 5.1x so well below our long-term target of 5.5x, while liquidity remained robust at more than $7 billion, excluding the war chest of private capital we have amassed to support hyperscale development.\nWe raised another $850 million of euro bonds at the same 3.875% coupon, as we did in January, a slot in this bond into 2034 to maintain our well-laddered maturity schedule. We used most of these funds last week to pay off the EUR 650 million of maturing, 0.625% Eurobonds. So unfortunately, we'll be facing a 325 basis point refinancing headwind beginning in the third quarter.\nThis finishes off our maturing debt for 2025 with our next maturity arriving in January. Looking further out, our maturities remain well laddered throughout 2035.\nMoving on to our debt profile. Our weighted average debt maturity increased slightly to 4.6% years and our weighted average interest rate kicked up to 2.7%. approximately 84% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and our FX hedging strategy. Approximately 94% of our net debt is fixed rate and 96% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling.\nI'll now turn to our guidance. We are increasing our core FFO guidance range for the full year 2025 by $0.10 to $7.15 to $7.25 per share to reflect better-than-expected operating performance and our updated FX assumptions for the full year. We are also increasing our constant currency core FFO guidance range by $0.05 to $7.10 to $7.20 per share, consistent with the better-than-expected operating performance. The midpoint of our core FFO per share guidance represents approximately 7% year-over-year growth reflecting the momentum in our underlying business, balanced by increased development spend and a reduction in leverage year-over-year.\nAs a result of the year-to-date outperformance versus our expectations, strong momentum within our 0 to 1 megawatt business and better-than-expected fee income, along with our updated FX assumptions for the year, We are increasing our revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance ranges for 2025 by $100 million and $75 million, respectively. We are raising our cash and GAAP re-leasing spread guidance ranges to 5% to 6% and 7% to 8%, respectively, to reflect the performance we have seen year-to-date.\nWe are also increasing our G&A assumption by $15 million while maintaining the rest of our operating assumptions for 2025. In sum, Digital Realty is extraordinarily well positioned with ample momentum to continue to drive the business into the future. Consistent with how we framed it here 18 months ago, our growth has accelerated so far in 2025 and is poised to continue through '26 and beyond. Visibility surrounding our growth potential over the next several quarters is supported by our robust backlog of signed but not yet commenced leases, while upside will stem for better-than-expected execution within the colocation product segment.\nLooking further out, we have crafted a comprehensive funding model for our hyperscale business, including the sourcing of private capital to support more than $15 billion of additional hyperscale development capacity which will help to support our customers' sizable and growing data center infrastructure requirements and extend Digital Realty's runway for growth. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session?"

Please note, this event is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Jordan, please go ahead.\n\nJordan Sadler\n\nAnalyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Digital Realty's First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on today's call are President and CEO, Andy Power; and CFO, Matt Mercier. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Colin McLean, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management will be making forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call.\nForward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website.\nBefore I turn the call over to Andy, let me offer a few key takeaways from our first quarter results: First, we posted strong overall leasing in the first quarter of $242 million, consistent with the record pace set in 2024 and driving our backlog of booked-not-billed leases to a new record of $919 million. Activity was robust across our primary product segments; second, Core FFO per share growth accelerated ahead of our expectations for the quarter and with our record backlog have strong visibility for the remainder of 2025 and growing momentum for 2026; and third, we further evolved our funding model this quarter, following the successful formation of our first U.S. hyperscale fund, enabling us to meet the growing needs of our customers while scaling our balance sheet and enhancing our returns.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Andy Power.\n\nAndrew P. Power\n\nCFO, Digital Realty Trust, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. The first quarter of 2025 was fraught with the tension grabbing headlines focused on advances in AI and the potential implications for the ongoing AI infrastructure build-out. But Digital Realty continued to execute our full spectrum meeting place strategy and posted strong results with the strength of our 1Q results, and the visibility provided by a record backlog, we remain confident in our 2025 growth targets and are encouraged by the 40-plus percent increase in our 2026 backlog since the beginning of this year.\nAt 100% share, our backlog of signed but not commenced leases exceeded $1.3 billion at March 31, 2025. Despite the headlines, demand for data center capacity remains strong, and our value proposition continues to resonate, evidenced by nearly $400 million of new leasing completed in the quarter, or $242 million of new leasing at digital share with healthy contributions from both our major product categories. Leasing in our 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection segment was $69 million, our second highest ever behind only last quarter's record. This quarter's total included $15 million of interconnection bookings.\nThe leasing achieved in the first quarter in this segment was ahead of pace relative to last year's record $250 million of leasing, which is a reflection of our team's intense focus and execution on our median place strategy. We completed nearly $325 million of greater than 1 megawatt leasing in quarter, reflecting the demand we are capturing and executing across platform digital in the quarter. At our share, greater than megawatt leasing was $172 million. Demand for low capacity blocks remains strong and diverse. Over the past 5 quarters, we've topped $100 million of leasing volume in the greater than a megawatt category 4x with four different customers signing the largest lease in each of those quarters, including this quarter.\nIn fact, the single largest lease in the first quarter of 2025 set a new record for Digital Realty in terms of total annualized rent signed. In our experience, hyperscale customer activity is more like to rhyme rather than repeat. Each customer typically to its own drum. So when some slower pause, others push forward. Today, we continue to be encouraged by the cellular demand drivers of digital transformation, cloud and AI, which have been in place for the last several quarters, and are supporting consistent interest across our portfolio, including large capacity blocks.\nReflecting this dynamic, pricing reached a new milestone in the quarter, with the overall rate on new data center leasing reaching $244 per kilowatt per month, up 10% from the prior record, reflecting strength within the greater than a megawatt category. Looking ahead, our pipeline remains healthy and diverse. Customer and partner interest and engagement were high throughout the quarter and continued into 2Q. Customers continue to see significant value and contiguous capacity in core markets that can support multiple use cases from network optimization to hybrid clouds to artificial intelligence.\nWhile it is important to acknowledge the risks posed by elevated uncertainty and [ cattle ] markets volatility, Digital Realty's product pipelines remain near record levels. In the meantime, we continue to focus on serving our 5,000-plus customers in the major markets around the world. This quarter, bookings were strongest in North America hyperscale, but we are seeing demand from all regions and for both products. To meet this growing demand, we increased our development pipeline by another 170 megawatts since year-end to 814 megawatts at 100% share.\nOf this total, 63% is pre-leased with the lion's share of the remaining hyperscale availability focused in Northern Virginia. We continue to see healthy inter-region activity across our global platform in the first quarter. EMEA was the biggest importer with strong activity from all other regions. We also had very strong enterprise export activity from the Americas and APAC with EMEA as the preferred destination from each region. It is clear that our global full spectrum data center platform is a key differentiator for Digital Realty is a key component of our value proposition as customers may onboard to platform digital with just a cabinet, but can then scale to a case that leverages hyperscale cloud compute and will soon provide access to AI for all customers.\nDuring the first quarter, we added another 119 new logos, including a leading global semiconductor equipment manufacturer, deploying high-performance computing in Paris to take advantage of the developed cloud and network communities along with an emerging AI community on platform digital. Other key wins in the quarter include a leading high-frequency trading fintech is extending on Platform Digital, to add private AI by increasing their HPC platform to a new market while improving cloud access and business continuity. And [indiscernible] partner is expanding its footprint on Platform digital to Zurich to support Oracle's dedicated region integrated solution for private cloud to address data localization and data sovereignty.\nA leading blockchain provider is also expanding to a new metro on platform digital, to deploy infrastructure to support decentralized private and public networks. A Fortune 500 payments and transactions company is expanding their global presence on Platform Digital into the Nordics to solve compliance and data localization needs. And an AI inference and training company and a new logo is utilizing the connectivity available on Platform Digital, to provide a scalable solution for their AI inference applications. We continue to expand the reach and connectivity of Platform Digital during the first quarter with our entrance into Indonesia.\nWe partnered with a leading Jakarta-based carrier-neutral data center platform to create Digital Realty Bersama, which will expand its connected campus, offering direct access to a wide array of networks and services including a direct connection to Indonesia's largest Internet exchange provider. Supported by a young and large population, growing cloud adoption and access to multiple subsea cables Jakarta is an attractive expansion location that complements our existing APAC footprint.\nWe also launched our Heraklion 1 data center in Creek earlier this month, which complements our Athens campus and adds a key connectivity hub in the Eastern Mediterranean, strategically linking Europe with Asia, the Middle East and East Africa via a dense network of highly connected subsea cables. Also during the quarter, Digital Realty and Console Connect announced a strategic collaboration that will expand the reach of service fabric to more than 100 new third-party data centers with access to more than 75 new cloud on-ramps, enriching the global connectivity options available to enterprises across Platform Digital.\nAnd closing out our connectivity-oriented advances, this morning, we announced the addition of three new Azure onramps, one in Atlanta, one in Brussels and one in Vienna. These onramps expand our global relationship with Microsoft as we now host 15 cloud onramps across four continents. Moving over to the financing side of the business. After more than a year of hard work across our team, this year, we announced our first U.S. hyperscale data center fund, continuing to evolve our funding model and further expanding the pool of capital available to support the growth of hyperscale data center capacity.\nThe fund offers a unique opportunity for private institutional investors to invest directly in hyperscale data centers alongside the world's largest data center provider. It is dedicated to investing in high-quality hyperscale data centers located across top-tier U.S. metros, including Northern Virginia, Dallas, Atlanta, Charlotte, New York Metro and Sillicon Valley. We exceeded the portfolio with five operating assets and four land sets for data center development and have received very strong interest and limited partner commitments from some of the world's savviest investors, including sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, insurance companies, endowments and other institutional investors.\nThe investors have done their due diligence, committed capital and placed their trust in Digital Realty. We are targeting $2.5 billion of equity commitments from our LPs and we expect to maintain a 20% or greater interest to ensure alignment. All told, the fund will support approximately $10 billion of hyperscale data center investment, enabling us to serve the robust demand of our customers while enhancing our returns through fees. We received more than $1.7 billion of commitments through our first closing, placing us ahead of schedule relative to our year-end target and we continue to feel investor interest.\nAs Matt will discuss in a moment, our progress puts us well on track to meet our capital recycling guidance for 2025 and to fund growth in 2026 and beyond. Before turning it over to Matt, I'd like to touch on our goal sustainability progress. During the first quarter, we opened [ Friday team], a 16-megawatt data center, adaptively reusing the historic and iconic site while delivering cutting-edge technology solutions with a deep focus on sustainable performance and water conservation. [indiscernible] is optimized for AI and high-performance compute applications with advanced liquid corn along with the integration of Service Fabric for enhanced data security and connectivity.\nImportantly, this state-of-the-art brownfield development is powered by 100% renewable sources as are all our facilities in EMEA. This sustainable building in Frankfurt continued Digital Realty's leadership in the industry, with high-performance green buildings. We added 190 megawatts of third certified green data centers in 2024. Also in the first quarter, Digital Realty reached 100% renewable energy coverage for our operations in Singapore, a top priority in that market given the country's resource constraints and its Smart Nation initiative. We have installed solar on our facilities over the past couple of years and in the first quarter, signed a PPA with [ Tuas Power ] for biomass and other really sourced renewables to fully cover our it.\nThis further expands the more than 150 data centers around the world that are matched with 100% renewable electricity and adds to our portfolio of 1.5 gigawatts of contracted renewable capacity. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Matt Mercier\n\nMatthew R. Mercier\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Andy. Digital Realty continued to post healthy results in the first quarter as strong leasing pushed our backlog is signed but not yet commenced leases to a new record, while the formation of our first hyperscale fund added a new horse to our funding stable. These milestones enhance our visibility and predictability of earnings growth, improve our returns and further reduce our reliance on any single capital source while enabling digital to responsibly invest to serve the needs of our customers.\nIn the first quarter, we grew core FFO by 6.1%, posted strong leasing results and increased the capacity under development by another 26% and despite delivering nearly 50 megawatts of new capacity during the quarter, a great start to the year. We signed aggregate leases representing nearly $400 million of annualized rent at 100% share in the first quarter, which was the second highest in Digital Realty's history. At our share, we signed $242 million of new leases in the first quarter, with notable strength across each of our two segments.\nWe completed nearly $69 million of bookings in our 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection segment, which marked the second highest quarter for digital following last quarter's record. This activity also exceeded the prior 4 quarter average bookings by nearly 10%. We also signed $172 million within greater than a megawatt category at our share largely driven by hyperscale leasing in North America. Consistent with our objective of improving Digital's long-term sustainable growth, more than 85% of bookings included fixed rent escalators of at least 4% over linked to CPI. Our backlog at Digital Realty share totaled $919 million at quarter end, an increase of 7% above our record as $119 million of commencements was more than offset by our strong new bets.\nLooking ahead to the rest of 2025, we expect to see strong commencements in the next 2 quarters, providing momentum into the end of the year and beyond. For 2026, we currently have $440 million scheduled to commence while another $100-plus million commences in 2027 and beyond, providing strong visibility for multiyear growth. For context, our 2026 backlog is already more than double the backlog we had for 2025 at this time last year. During the first quarter, we signed $147 million of renewal leases at a blended 5.6% increase on a cash basis, consistent with our 40% full year guidance.\nRenewals in the first quarter were heavily weighted toward our 1 megawatt category with $127 million of renewals at a 3.8% uplift. Greater than megawatt renewals were relatively sparse at only $5 million with a 4.6% uplift. We remain on track to meet our full year guidance. For the quarter, churn declined and ended at 1.5%. As for earnings, we reported first quarter core FFO of $1.77 per share, up 6% year-over-year, reflecting strong same capital operating results, combined with new commencements over the past year. On a constant currency basis, we reported core FFO per share of $1.79 in the first quarter.\nDuring the quarter, operating expenses were $0.01 to $0.02 lower than expected due to a slower ramp in repair and maintenance spend following an uptick in the fourth quarter, while property taxes benefited from a $0.01 refund in the quarter. Data center revenue was up 7% year-over-year as the combination of strong renewal spreads rent escalators and new lease commencements more than offset the drag associated with the dispositions completed over the last 12 months. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 11% year-over-year reflecting the growth in data center revenue combined with expense controls. Same-capital cash NOI growth was healthy in the first quarter, increasing by 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, driven by 5.7% growth in data center revenue.\nMoving on to our investment activity. During the quarter, we spent approximately $1 billion on development CapEx on a gross basis, including our partner share and roughly $700 million on a net basis to Digital Realty. We delivered nearly 50 megawatts of new capacity, 83% of which was preleased, while we started another 219 megawatts of new projects highlighted by 200 megawatts in Northern Virginia that is 50% preleased. At quarter end, our data center development pipeline increased to $9.3 billion at a 12.5% expected stabilized yield. In addition, as Andy highlighted, we invested approximately $95 million for a 50% interest in Digital Realty Bersama, expanding into a highly connected platform in Indonesia.\nWe are also pleased to announce the formation of our first U.S. hyperscale data center fund, which has the potential to support up to $10 billion of data center investments. In the second quarter, Digital expects to contribute a portion of 5 existing operating assets with an aggregate agreed value of more than $1.5 billion, which will satisfy the majority of our disposition guidance for 2025. Turning to the balance sheet. We spent the last 2.5 years positioning digital for the opportunity that lies ahead by deleveraging our balance sheet and bolstering and diversifying our capital sources. Leverage is still well below our long-term target at 5.1x, while liquidity remained robust at more than $5 billion before considering the capital from our new fund.\nEarly in the quarter, we raised EUR 850 million of 3.875% notes, which was used to pay off the GBP 400 million of maturing 4.25% gilts with the much used to reduce outstandings on our credit facility. This leaves us with EUR 250 million of maturing debt through the rest of 2025. Looking further out, our maturities remain well laddered through 2035. Moving on to our debt profile. Our weighted average debt maturity was 4.5 years, and our weighted average interest rate ticked down to 2.6%. Approximately 83% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and our FX hedging strategy. Approximately 93% of our net debt is fixed rate and 96% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling.\nLet me conclude with our guidance. We are increasing our core FFO guidance range for the full year 2025 by $0.05 to $7.05 to $7.15 per share to reflect our updated FX assumptions for the full year. The new core FFO per share guidance now aligns with our constant currency guidance. It is worth noting that while our constant currency core FFO per share is trending toward the high end of the range in the first quarter, we have chosen to maintain this guidance range, given the heightened degree of macro and geopolitical uncertainty today. The midpoint of our core FFO per share guidance represents approximately 6% year-over-year growth, reflecting the underlying strength in our business, balanced by a meaningful step-up in development spend and the substantial reduction in leverage year-over-year.\nOn a normalized and constant currency basis, we continue to anticipate total revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth of more than 10% in 2025, reflecting the strong underlying fundamentals of our business. In accordance with our updated FX assumptions for the year, we are increasing both our revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance ranges for 2025 by $25 million, while our G&A assumption increased by $5 million. We are maintaining the rest of our guidance assumptions for 2025.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. Now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session."

Please note, this event is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Public & Private Investor Relations. Jordan, please go ahead.\n\nJordan Sadler\n\nAnalyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Digital Realty's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on today's call are President and CEO, Andy Power; and CFO, Matt Mercier; Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Colin McLean, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A.\nManagement will be making forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain certain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website.\nBefore I turn the call over to Andy, let me offer a few key takeaways from our fourth quarter results. First, we posted a second consecutive quarter of record leasing in our 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection segment, contributing to a record $1 billion of total leasing completed in 2024. The 0-1 megawatt product continues to be a significant focus for Digital Realty, and we are encouraged by the growing strength and momentum of our execution. Second, in the quarter, we raised over $2 billion of new debt and equity capital as well as over $500 million of net proceeds from asset sales and JV contributions, boosting our liquidity to over $6 billion and reducing our leverage to 4.8x at year-end. And third, we posted 6% core FFO per share growth in the fourth quarter, foreshadowing our expectations for 2025.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Andy Power.\n\nAndrew P. Power\n\nCFO, Digital Realty Trust, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. 2024 was a breakout year for Digital Realty, as we capitalized on a surge in demand for data center infrastructure positions the company for the opportunity that lies ahead and continue to execute on the key strategic priorities that we outlined on this call 2 years ago to enhance our long-term sustainable growth.\nBack then, we said that we would strengthen our customer value proposition, and we are doing just that. The evidence from 2024 lies in over $1 billion of bookings, a convincing new record for us, the few [ several ] hyperscale transactions and nearly $250 million from the 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection category, another record. Not to be outdone by new bookings, we also saw record lease renewal activity in 2024 which also approached $1 billion with cash rents rolling up 9% on average.\nWe added a record number of new logos during the year, nearly 600, while expanding our connectivity-rich solutions. We expanded the capacity of our total portfolio by over 200 megawatts in 2024, while scaling our development pipeline by over 75% to $7-plus billion of projects underway that are 70% pre-leased in order to serve our customers' growing data center needs.\nI also talked about innovating and integrating across our unmatched global portfolio, and we've rolled out new products and services, such as high-density colo 2.0, the cooling solution to support densities of up to 150 kilowatts per rack, the expansion of ServiceFabric to 38 metros around the world, and Private AI Exchange, an open platform available through ServiceFabric, which enables enterprises to seamlessly integrate their data with AI capabilities and other technology solutions.\nBy combining these leading-edge solutions with our global full spectrum strategy of connected campuses and offer colo, scale and hyperscale capacity, customers can count on Digital Realty to meet all of their data center needs.\nFinally, we vow to diversify and bolster our capital sources to expand our capacity to support our customers' growing requirements, improve capital efficiency, and reduce our leverage while increasing the returns to Digital Realty's shareholders. We've done this by adding to the menu of debt and equity capital options, opportunistically recycling capital out of stabilized and noncore assets and partnering with a diverse and high-quality list of private capital providers. Some of these activities have resulted in short-term headwinds to our results, but all of them have enhanced our operating momentum and financial position, enabling us to accelerate our bottom line per share growth. But there is still tremendous opportunity to be seized upon as we [ lead ] this dynamic in an increasingly global industry.\nDemand for data center capacity remains robust, both for larger AI-oriented and capacity blocks and to support growth in cloud and digital transformation while data center supply remains tight. Highlights for the fourth quarter include $100 million of new leases signed at Digital Realty share, driven by a 16% sequential uplift in the 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection bookings for a new record of $76 million. Unsurprisingly, greater-than-a-megawatt bookings dipped sequentially following last quarter's blowout, though the pipeline remains strong.\nLooking inside our 0-1 megawatt bookings, we experienced strong and balanced growth in both the Americas and in EMEA, with both regions [ pursuing ] new records in the quarter. We continue to some a growing healthy mix on various size deployments within our 0-1 megawatt business, reflecting how our full spectrum strategy enable Digital to provide solutions for large and small deployments along with everything in between.\nSome customers might simply need a network node to utilize our robust connectivity in the central city hub, while smaller enterprises might choose to locate a [ sub ] 1-megawatt deployment for compute or storage requirements in a facility outside of the city center. Interconnection bookings were also strong at $15 million, nearly matching last quarter's record.\nFinally, the strength and breadth of data center demand and the progress of our go-to-market initiatives are also reflected in our addition of a record 166 new logos. We continue to see healthy inter-region activity across our global platform. Hyperscalers drove a portion of this activity with our largest global customers driving record export activity to other regions around the world.\nEMEA exports were again at record levels with heightened transatlantic bookings [ for ] deployments [ landed ] in the Americas. Our record bookings in 2024 pushed [ our ] backlog of booked but not yet billed leases up to roughly $800 million at year-end, providing strong revenue visibility for this year and beyond.\nAs Jordan mentioned, we also continue to bolster our balance sheet and diversify our capital sources during the fourth quarter with support from asset sales, hyperscale development joint ventures, and highly successful debt and equity raises. These activities helped to push leverage below 5x. Matt will provide more details on these activities in just a few minutes.\nOver the past few weeks, we have seen commitments for data center spending continue to grow. New administration announced a $500 [ billion ] effort to support American-based AI development and others around the world are following suit. Earlier this week, I was pleased to join French President, Emmanuel Macron, in Paris, along with U.S. Vice President, J.D. Vance and many other heads of state and industry leaders for France's AI Action Summit, which was geared toward convening the international community to discuss the use of AI for the common good.\nAs I highlighted a few years ago, on my first earnings call as CEO, technology begets technology. In the past, innovation has typically led to greater efficiencies that ultimately spur incremental demand. At the time, we noted that we are at the precipice of the next wave of innovation that we thought might drive the next decade of data center demand.\n2024 we saw data center leases that were 80% higher than the next highest year, driven by steady growth in cloud and digital transformation as well as a surge in AI-related use cases. Today, we see a similar dynamic playing out to what we've witnessed in the past as the race for [ innovation ] remains in full effect, while recent efficiency [ gains ] appears poised to facilitate the proliferation of AI to the enterprise.\nWe heard from hyperscalers earlier in this reporting season, and [ none seem ] ready to moderate the pace of investment as data center infrastructure remains a critical resource to support AI innovation. Within our sales organization, we continue to see robust demand for data center capacity, including large capacity blocks driven by digital transformation, cloud and AI. AI innovation is [ occurring ] on both the hardware and software side, and Digital Realty is pleased to support and enable this innovation. One of our wins this quarter was [indiscernible], a developer of scalable AI accelerators for both cloud and edge computing.\nDuring the fourth quarter, [indiscernible] leveraged PlatformDIGITAL to host their R&D labs in a 2-megawatt high-density colocation suite in a new metro that addresses their stringent engineering and time-to-market requirements. As they develop their leading-edge chips, [ 10store ] works with a number of partners, consistent with our [ medium-pay ] strategy, they improve their efficiency by interconnecting with their partners on PlatformDIGITAL. So together, we partnered to deploy an AI hosted desktop solution for AI model development and testing that included another [ 10 store ] partner, resulting in another new logo to PlatformDIGITAL. That's an example of the network effect of being the [ meeting place ].\nOther key wins in the quarter included a Global 2000 international banking group expanding on PlatformDIGITAL to improve cloud connectivity and localizing data for hybrid cloud. A world-renowned research and cultural institution was brought to us by a partner as they update their [ HPC ] infrastructure supporting biology and physics research workloads by taking advantage of PlatformDIGITAL's high-density colocation capabilities. And a Global 2000 insurance and reinsurance provider has expanded their presence on platform digital to take advantage of robust networks and cloud ecosystems.\nBefore turning over to Matt, I'd like to touch on our global ESG progress. During the fourth quarter, Teraco, our South African affiliate started construction on a 120-megawatt [indiscernible] solar power plant, the first time a data center operator will own and utilize a solar power plant to support its data center alone. The plant is expected to begin generating power in late 2026. This project will upgrade existing transmission infrastructure and enable the plan to add renewable energy into the grid and to be distributed to Teraco's campuses, improving [ digital ] liability and keeping Teraco on course to meet its clean energy goals.\nIn Chicago, we [ sought ] community solar agreements for a share of 3 separate solar projects totaling nearly 20 megawatts under the Illinois Science program. This new and local clean energy supply for our data centers in Chicago supports our 100% clean and renewable energy coverage there.\nBoth actions in the fourth quarter add to Digital Realty's leadership and commitment to renewable energy. We now have more than 150 data centers around the world that are matched with a 100% renewable electricity with more than 1.5 gigawatts of contracted solar and wind capacity. But sustainability is not just about renewable energy. We are also excited about our collaboration with Ecolab to deploy an AI-driven water conservation solution in 35 of our U.S. data centers to further enhance our water use efficiency. We expect this solution to reduce water use by up to 15% at those sites while also [ extending ] the life of our equipment.\nFinally, Digital Realty was awarded Nareit's Leader in the Light award for the eighth consecutive year, while our VP of Sustainability, Aaron Binkley will serve as Chair of Nareit's Real Estate Sustainability Council in 2025. Big congratulations to Aaron.\nAnd with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Matt Mercier.\n\nMatthew R. Mercier\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Andy. As Andy noted earlier, 2024 was a transformative year for Digital Realty. Over the past 12 months, we posted record leasing results and increased the capacity under development by over 75%, while at the same time reducing our leverage from 6.2x to 4.8x.\nThis achievement was a direct result of our strategy to bolster and diversify our capital sources. By recycling capital out of stabilized, slower growth hyperscale and noncore assets and bringing in private capital to support hyperscale development, combined with the support of our public shareholders, we were able to simultaneously accomplish seemingly incompatible goals. We dramatically ramp development to better serve the needs of our customers while delevering the balance sheet below our long-term leverage target and by the fourth quarter, meaningfully accelerating our bottom line growth.\nAs we sit here today, with more than $6 billion of liquidity, below target leverage and a broad and diverse array of capital sources we are positioned to fund the investments that are underway and the attractive opportunities that we continue to see ahead. Like other challenges, this achievement took a tremendous amount of teamwork. So I want to thank my fellow Digital Realty teammates for their efforts in 2024.\nLet's jump into fourth quarter results. We signed $100 million of new leases in the fourth quarter, led by a record $76 million of bookings at our 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection segment, which exceeded the prior quarter's record by 16%. We also signed $23 million within the greater-than-megawatt category which was mostly weighted toward EMEA and APAC following last quarter's outsized strength in the Americas.\nPricing in our 0-1 megawatt category was strong, led by transactions in APAC and Americas while pricing in the greater-than-a-megawatt category reflected the modest sample size and market mix. Importantly, nearly 60% of leases signed include annual rent escalators of 4% or greater, or are linked to CPI, which bolsters our objective to drive better long-term sustainable growth. Our backlog at Digital Realty share totaled $797 million at year-end, modestly below the third quarter record as $147 million of commencements exceeded new bookings.\nLooking ahead of the nearly $400 million backlog that is scheduled to commence in 2025, about 2/3 is slated to commence by midyear, with the balance starting in the second half. Looking further out, we are already -- we already have over $300 million scheduled to commence in 2026 and another $100 million slated to commence in 2027, setting a strong foundation for multiyear growth.\nDuring the quarter, we signed $250 million on renewal leases at a blended 4.7% increase on a cash basis. Renewals were fairly straightforward and largely consistent with the original 4% to 6% uplift in cash re-leasing spreads in our original 2024 guidance provided 1 year ago. For full year 2024, re-leasing spreads were 9%, aided by packaged deals that we have highlighted on prior calls. Excluding those deals, our full year renewal spreads were still a healthy 5.2%, which is consistent with the guidance that we are issuing for 2025.\nBreaking down renewals by product category, cash renewal spreads in the 0-1 megawatt were a healthy 4.9% in the fourth quarter, while re-leasing spreads in the greater-than-a-megawatt segment were up by 3.7%. For the quarter, churn remained well controlled at 2%.\nIn terms of earnings, we reported fourth quarter core FFO of $1.73 per share up 6.1% year-over-year, reflecting continued healthy growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Data center revenue growth accelerated to 8% year-over-year as the combination of strong renewal spreads rent escalators and new lease commencements more than offset the drag associated with more than $1 billion of dispositions throughout 2024.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by 7.4% year-over-year, broadly consistent with our growth in data center revenue. Normalized total revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth were 10% and 13%, respectively, in full year 2024. Same capital cash NOI growth increased by 1.4% year-over-year in the fourth quarter as 2.5% growth in data center revenue was partially offset by higher property operating costs in the quarter. For all of 2024, same capital cash NOI increased by 2.8%, which was approximately 200 basis points higher when normalized for the outsized utility margin realized in 2023.\nMoving on to our investment activity. During 2024, we spent approximately $3 billion on development CapEx on a gross basis, including our partner share and roughly $2 billion on a net basis to Digital Realty. In the fourth quarter, given the strong demand for data center capacity, we backfilled all of our deliveries with new starts, ending the year with the same 644 megawatts under construction.\nMore specifically, we delivered 42 megawatts of new capacity in the quarter while we added another 42 megawatts of new starts. The overall pipeline is 70% pre-leased with average expected yields hedging up to 12.1%. Consistent with the third quarter's record bookings, almost all the development underway in the Americas today is pre-leased with expected stabilized yields ticking up slightly to 13.7%. Some development capacity remains available both EMEA and APAC, with both currently expecting double-digit stabilized deals.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet in the fourth quarter, driving leverage below our long-term target and substantially enhancing our liquidity with nearly $3 billion of fresh capital raised since the end of September.\nOn the debt side, in November, we successfully issued $1.15 billion of 1.875% 5-year exchangeable notes, and we repaid the remaining $500 million outstanding on our U.S. dollar term loan. We also raised over $900 million of equity under our prior ATM program during the fourth quarter. In January, we issued another EUR 850 million of 3.875% notes during 2035 and then repaid 400 million gilts at 4.25%. This leaves us with only EUR 650 million of maturing debt through the rest of 2025. Looking further out, our maturities remain well laddered through 2035.\nOur net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio fell to 4.8x by year-end 2024, and today, we have over $6 billion of total liquidity available.\nMoving on to our debt profile. At year-end, our weighted average debt maturity was over 4 years, and our weighted average interest rate ticked down to 2.7%. Approximately 83% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and our FX hedging strategy. Approximately 91% of our net debt is fixed rate and 96% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling.\nLet me conclude with our guidance. We are establishing our core FFO guidance range for the full year 2025 at $7.05 to $7.15 per share on a constant currency basis. The midpoint represents 5.7% year-over-year growth reflecting the underlying strength in our business, balanced by a meaningful acceleration in development spend, along with a substantial reduction in our overall leverage.\nOn a normalized and constant currency basis, we anticipate total revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth of more than 10% in 2025, reflecting the strong underlying fundamentals of our business. Same capital cash NOI is expected to grow 3.5% to 4.5% on a constant currency basis.\nAs for other guidance items, we expect the positive operating environment for data centers to continue. Cash renewals are again expected to be up approximately 4% to 6% as upside is partially mitigated by relatively high expiring rates in our greater-than-a-megawatt portfolio. Occupancy should improve by another 100 to 200 basis points. CapEx, net of partner contributions are expected to rise to between [ $3 billion and $3.5 billion ], while gross CapEx will reach approximately [ $4.5 billion ], with development yields expected to remain in double digits. And we will also continue to recycle capital with $500 million to $1 billion of dispositions and JV capital expected this year.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session?"

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jordan Sadler. Please go ahead.\n\nJordan Sadler\n\nAnalyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Digital Realty's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on today's call are President and CEO, Andy Power; and CFO, Matt Mercier; chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and the Chief Revenue Officer, Colin McLean, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management will be making forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nFor a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Andy, let me offer a few key takeaways from our second quarter.\nFirst, we continue to execute within a very favorable demand environment with $164 million of new leasing executed in the quarter, again, marking one of the top quarters in our history, which, together with last quarter's record leasing drove a record first half of the year. Second, our operating momentum continued through the second quarter as a record level of commencements translated into meaningful improvement in both total and same capital occupancy while cash releasing spreads remain firmly positive, and continued growth in cross-connects drove interconnection revenue to a new record in the quarter. And third, through capital recycling and demand-driven equity issuance in the quarter, we reduced our leverage to 5.3x at quarter end, below our long-term target level, helping to position Digital Realty to the opportunity that we continue to see in front of us.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Andy Power.\n\nAndrew P. Power\n\nCFO, Digital Realty Trust, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. The momentum we experienced in the first quarter continued in the second quarter. The first half of 2024, our new leasing was up over 100% from the activity we saw in the first half of 2023, with a strong and steady contribution from our 0-1 megawatt plus Interconnection segment.\nDemand for data center capacity remains as strong as we've ever seen, especially for larger capacity blocks in our core markets. We are well positioned to take advantage of this favorable demand environment, given our track record of execution across 6 continents, a robust land bank and shelf capacity that could support 3-plus gigawatts of incremental development, reduced leverage and our growing and diverse array of capital partners.\nDuring the second quarter, we remain focused on our key priorities. We signed $164 million of new leasing in the second quarter, which excluded another $16 million of bookings within one of our newest hyperscale private capital ventures. While bookings in the greater than a megawatt category were once again the primary driver, there was no contribution from our largest hyperscale market, Northern Virginia as Dallas led the way in the second quarter. Importantly, we posted one of our strongest quarters ever in the 0-1 megawatt plus Interconnection segment, with the record new logos and near record bookings in each of the 0-1 megawatt and Interconnection categories.\nThis leasing strength is a positive reflection of the value that our 5,000 and growing base of customers realize from our full spectrum product strategy. We also delivered strong operating results with 13% data center revenue growth year-over-year pro forma for the capital recycling activity completed over the last year.\nIn addition, we have enjoyed healthy growth in recurring fee income associated with our new hyperscale ventures. In the first half, fee income was up 26% over the first half of 2023, primarily reflecting the formation of almost $10 billion of institutional private capital ventures over the last year. And we would expect this line item to continue to gather momentum. With the record commencements in the second quarter and the healthy backlog of favorably priced leases ready to commence in the second half, we are well positioned for accelerating top line and bottom line growth for the remainder of 2024 and into 2025. Subsequent to quarter end, we also strengthened our value proposition in Europe through our entrants into the Slough submarket of London with the acquisition of a densely connected enterprise data center campus, which we expect to be highly complementary to our existing colocation capabilities in the city and Docklands.\nThe new campus supports an existing community of more than 150 customers utilizing over 2,000 cross connects. Consistent with our key priorities, we continue to innovate and integrate as we unveiled our HD Colo 2.0 offering in the second quarter with advanced high-density deployment support for liquid-to-chip cooling across 170 of our data centers globally. In addition, just last week, we announced the deployment of a new Microsoft Azure ExpressRoute Cloud OnRamp at our Dallas campus, along with the launch of the new Azure ExpressRoute Metro service in the Amsterdam and Zurich market. We also bolstered our balance sheet and significantly diversified our capital sources, availing Digital Realty of more than $10 billion of private capital over the past year through our new hyperscale ventures and noncore dispositions.\nDuring the quarter, we expanded our existing Chicago hyperscale venture with the sale of a 75% interest in CH2, the remaining stabilized data center on our [indiscernible] campus. We also sold an additional 24.9% interest in a data center in Frankfurt to Digital Core REIT, increasing their total position in the campus to just under [ 15% ]. These 2 transactions together raised over $0.5 billion. Finally, we raised approximately $2 billion of equity since our last earnings call, including the $1.7 billion follow-on offering in early May and proceeds raised under our ATM.\nThese transactions, together with the others of the past year, have positioned our balance sheet to capitalize on this unique environment and construct the capacity that our customers demand. Artificial intelligence innovation is reshaping the global data center landscape. As new applications are developed and proliferate across industries and around the world, AI is driving the incremental demand for robust computing infrastructure. Quoting the Gartner, global spending on public cloud services is projected to grow over 20% to reach $675 billion in 2024 and is forecast to grow another 22% in 2025, with AI-related workloads driving a significant portion of this growth. Digital transformation, cloud and AI are fueling demand for data center capacity worldwide.\nTraditional data centers were already being pushed to the limits by demand for cloud and digital transformation where demand for AI-oriented data center infrastructure is being accommodated in upgraded suites in our existing facilities and in newly built facilities. These AI workloads are taking place on specialized hardware with massive parallel processing capabilities and lightning-fast data transfer speeds. Fortunately, Digital Realty's modular data center design can accommodate these evolving requirements. The growth in demand is global.\nWe're seeing strong demand across our North American metros first, but it is spread and beyond with interest in locations like London, Amsterdam and Paris in EMEA and Singapore and Tokyo in APAC. Our global footprint is well suited to capture this growing demand, whether it be for major cloud service providers adding to an availability zone, a major enterprise digitizing their business processes or AI model being trained or be it put into production.\nHowever, this exponential growth in data center demand is not without its challenges. The environmental impact of these energy-intensive facilities are growing alongside the scaling of user requirements. According to the IEA, data centers consumed almost 2% of global electricity in 2022, a figure that could double by 2026 absent significant efficiency improvements. I will touch on Digital Realty's latest sustainability highlights in a moment. As we look to the future, the interplay between AI advancements and data center evolution will continue to shape the global technology landscape.\nIDC predicts that by 2027, worldwide spending on digital transformation will reach nearly $4 trillion driven by AI, further accelerating the demand for data center infrastructure. We believe that the providers who can officially scale their capacity while addressing sustainability concerns, we'll be best positioned to benefit from these 3 key drivers: digital transformation, cloud and AI in the years to come.\nCustomers and partners are recognizing the value that Digital Realty can bring to their applications around the world. During the second quarter, we added 148 new logos, marking a new quarterly record. A growing number of these new logos are being sourced by our partners who efficiently expand our sales team to reach into enterprises and around the world. The wins this quarter include a Global 2000 advanced engineering and research enterprise, developing a private AI sandbox on PlatformDIGITAL to enable experimentation and development by federal agencies and brought to us by one of our large connectivity partners, Lumen Technologies.\nAnother partner bought a new logo that is an AI-enabled SaaS provider, repatriating all public cloud to save costs and enable growth. That same partner was also assisting 2 large financial institutions to increase their capacity on PlatformDIGITAL in APAC and North America. And yet another example of our growing partnerships, an AI SaaS provider and recognized leader in natural language speech synthesis is growing their commitment to PlatformDIGITAL, with an expansion of current AI workloads where proximity is the driving requirement. A Global 2000 manufacturer is rearchitecting their network on PlatformDIGITAL, with a regional hub to improve efficiency, lower their network costs and implement controls while eliminating the capital cost of maintaining their own facilities. And 2 leading financial services firms are both leveraging PlatformDIGITAL to extend their respective virtual desktop infrastructure environments to improve performance and user experience across the North American and EMEA employee base.\nBefore turning it over to Matt, I'd like to touch on our ESG progress during the second quarter. We continue to make meaningful progress on ESG performance. We were recognized by [ Time and Statista ] as one of the world's most sustainable companies of 2024. We also released our annual ESG report in June, highlighting our ongoing efforts to develop and operate responsibly. As described in our ESG report, we further increased our renewable energy supplies with 152 data centers now matched with 100% renewable energy. We improved water efficiency and expand the use of recycled water, which accounted for 43% of our total water consumption last year.\nWe also launched a new supplier engagement program to drive sustainability and decarbonization through our supply chain. We remain committed to minimizing Digital Realty's impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders.\nWith that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Matt Mercier.\n\nMatthew R. Mercier\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Andy. Let me jump right into our second quarter results. We signed $164 million of new leases in the second quarter, with 2/3 of that falling into the greater-than-megawatt category, the majority of which landed in the Americas, with healthy contributions from both EMEA and APAC. Not to be overlooked, however, with the $40 million of 0-1-megawatt leasing and a standout $14 million of interconnection bookings.\nOur fourth consecutive quarter exceeding $50 million in our 0-1 megawatt plus Interconnection segment. Turning to our backlog. We commenced a record $176 million of new leases this quarter, which was largely balanced by the strong second quarter leasing. As such, the $527 million backlog of signed but not yet commenced leases moderated by only 2% from last quarter's peak and remains robust and more than 9% of our total revenue guidance for full year 2024.\nLooking ahead, we have over $175 million scheduled to commence through the remainder of this year with over $230 million already scheduled to commence next year. During the second quarter, we signed $215 million of renewal leases at a 4% increase on a cash basis, driving year-to-date renewal spreads to 8.2%. Re-leasing spreads were once again positive across products and regions. Last quarter, we noted that the underlying renewal spread after stripping out 2 outliers was 3.4%. Our cash renewal spread in the 0-1-megawatt segment were up 3.8% in the second quarter, while the greater than a megawatt segment was up 3.9%.\nAs a reminder, the 0-1-megawatt segment is the primary driver of our overall re-leasing spreads, given the heavier weighting of lease expirations in this category, which are typically shorter-term leases with inflationary or better escalators. 1 megawatt deals renew reliably and predictably making them track closer to market over time, thereby reducing the outsized movements that could come with larger or longer-term lease renewals.\nOn the greater than 1 megawatt side, renewals reflected the strong pricing environment with leases renewed at $159 per kilowatt compared to the $133 per kilowatt achieved on greater than a megawatt renewals last quarter. The key difference between the quarters was the rate on the expiring leases. This quarter, leases in this segment expired at $153 per kW, while last quarter's leases expired at an average of $112 per kilowatt.\nFor the quarter, churn remained low and well controlled at 1.6%, and our largest termination was immediately backfilled at an improved rate. In terms of earnings growth, we reported second quarter core FFO of $1.65 per share, reflecting continued healthy organic operating results, partly balanced by the impact of the meaningful deleveraging and capital raising activity executed over the course of the last year. Revenue growth in the quarter was tempered by the decline in utility expense reimbursements, a comparison that is likely to persist throughout this year, given the decline in electricity rates in EMEA year-over-year, along with the impact of substantial capital recycling activity.\nDespite the deleveraging headwinds, rental revenue plus interconnection revenues were up 5% on a combined basis year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA also increased 5% year-over-year through the first half and remains well on track to meet our 2024 guidance. Pro forma for the capital recycling completed since last July, Rental plus Interconnection revenue and adjusted EBITDA grew by 13% and 14% year-over-year, respectively, in the second quarter.\nStabilized same capital operating performance saw continued growth in the second quarter, with year-over-year and cash NOI up 2% as 3.6% growth in data center revenue was offset by a catch-up in rental property operating costs, which were flat last quarter. Year-to-date, Same capital cash NOI has increased by 3.5%. We have previously highlighted same capital NOI growth is expected to be impacted by nearly 200 basis points of power margin headwinds year-over-year, given the elevated utility prices in EMEA in 2023.\nMoving on to our investment activity. We spent $532 million on consolidated development in the second quarter plus another $90 million for our share of unconsolidated JV spending. We delivered 72 megawatts of new capacity across the globe for our customers in the quarter, while we backfilled the pipeline with 71 megawatts of new starts. Blended average yield on our overall development pipeline moderated [ 20 ] basis points sequentially to 10.4% as a result of a market mix shift of completions and starts in North America during the quarter.\nIn the first half of the year, we spent a bit over $1 billion in development CapEx, tracking closely towards our full year guidance as the second half should see a ramp from newly commenced projects along with the typical seasonal uplift. Turning to the balance sheet. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet in the second quarter. With the closing of the 2 transactions in April that we disclosed during last quarter's earnings report and was referenced earlier by Andy, together, these 2 transactions raised just over $500 million of gross proceeds.\nAdditionally, since our last earnings report, we sold 14.7 million shares, including a 12.1 million share follow-on offering in early May and incremental ATM issuance raising $2 billion of net proceeds while using cash on hand to pay off a EUR 600 million bond that matured in April and a GBP 250 million bond that matured last Friday. At the end of the second quarter, we had more than $4 billion of total liquidity, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio fell to 5.3x, which is below our long-term target.\nMoving on to our debt profile. Our weighted average debt maturity is over 4 years and our weighted average interest rate is 2.9%, approximately [ 84% ] of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and our FX hedging strategy. Approximately 86% of our net debt is fixed rate and 96% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling.\nFinally, after paying off the euro notes in April and Sterling notes last week, we have 0 remaining debt maturities through year-end. Beyond that, our maturities remain well laddered through 2032. Let me conclude with our guidance. We are maintaining our core FFO guidance range for the full year of 2024 of $6.60 to $6.75 per share, reflecting the continued strength in our core business, partly balanced by the front half weighted capital recycling and funding activity, which helped to reduce our reported leverage by a full turn to better position the company to fund development in 2024 and beyond.\nWe are also maintaining our total revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance ranges for 2024 as well as the operating, investing and financing expectations that we previously provided. Looking forward to the balance of 2024, core FFO per share remains poised to increase in the second half as the backlog commences and the impact of prior deleveraging moderates. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A?"

First, our customer value proposition continues to resonate as reflected by an AI-driven acceleration in leasing activity that drove our overall leasing volume to a new record. First quarter leasing was more than 40% above our prior record, principally driven by an improvement in pricing.\nSecond, our fundamental strength picked up where 2023 left off with record cash re-leasing spreads and strong, stabilized same-capital cash NOI growth of 4.7%, reflecting continued strength in data center fundamentals combined with the benefit of the improvements that we have made to our portfolio over the past year.\nAnd third, we've made meaningful progress on our 2024 funding plan [ already ], with just over $1 billion of fresh capital raised from asset sales and joint ventures to date, putting us above the low end of our guidance range for 2024, just 1/3 of the way through the year.\nAs a result of our efforts, reported leverage fell from 6.2x at year-end to 6.1x at March 31 and remains at 5.8x on a pro forma basis, reflecting completed and announced transactions.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Andy Power.\n\nAndrew P. Power\n\nCFO, Digital Realty Trust, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. Following the successful course we set in 2023, Digital Realty experienced accelerating momentum in the first quarter of 2024, headlined by a collection of multifaceted AI opportunities that drove a number of new leasing records as demand for our capacity in core markets remains elevated [ while ] visibility surrounding competitive [ new supply ] remains [ cloudy ].\nAt Digital, we continue to focus on our strategic priorities and on delivering on behalf of our expanding list of 5,000-plus customers across our 50-plus markets in 25-plus countries on 6 continents.\nDuring the first quarter, we posted record leasing results surpassing our prior record by more than 40% and exceeding our leasing results for all of 2019 in just this 1 quarter. We also delivered strong operating results as evidenced by healthy stabilized same-capital growth and the highest re-leasing spreads in the company history.\nWe continue to innovate and integrate a further expansion of ServiceFabric through the launch of our Service Directory marketplace, which has seen the addition of over 90 members offering more than 150 services, including secure and direct connections to over [ 225 global cloud on ramps ], creating a vibrant community for [indiscernible], interconnection and collaboration.\nAnd just last week, we launched Private AI Exchange powered by ServiceFabric, which enables enterprise data to be at the center of an AI architecture, directly adjacent and interconnected with AI capabilities. This architecture are leading the data [indiscernible] barriers that emerge as data is generated and exchange with multiple applications across end-to-end AI-enabled digital workflows.\nWe also continued down the path of bolstering our balance sheet and diversifying our capital sources with the expansion of one of our stabilized hyperscale joint ventures and the addition of a new hyperscale development JV, together with our first transaction with our perpetual capital partner, Digital Core REIT and well over the year. These transactions help to fund development pipeline capacity that our customers are seeking while reducing our overall leverage.\nOperating and financial results in the first quarter were encouraging. We posted sequential growth in our core data center revenues, while growing adjusted EBITDA and core FFO per share. Development returns also continued to improve and we further enhanced the product mix of our portfolio, while maintaining strong liquidity and lower leverage.\nBookings and renewal results were even better with a number of metrics reaching new records, reflecting a strong demand environment and [ limited new ] capacity. Total bookings were $252 million, well ahead of our prior quarterly record of $176 million, reflecting the impact from the acceleration of AI and the improved pricing environment.\nImportantly, when comparing this quarter's leasing to the prior record set in 3Q 2022, we leased an incremental 10% of IT load capacity while [ rates ] in a greater than 1 megawatt segment for approximately 60% higher than those achieved 18 months prior.\nPerhaps have been overshadowed by these record-setting results was another strong quarter in our 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection segment, which delivered a third straight quarter of over $50 million. Demand for connectivity-oriented capacity remains healthy and pricing remains [indiscernible].\nOur mark-to-market renewal spreads were up by 11.8%, aided by a record 18.5% increase in our greater than 1 megawatt category. Churn remained low and well controlled at 1.7% [ for the ] quarter.\n[ In ] -- [ cash NOI growth ] also remained healthy, growing by 4.7% year-over-year in the quarter. And marking our fifth consecutive quarter of positive same capital growth. A year ago, data center demand was strong, driven by the growth of cloud and digital transformation while supply was tightening [ and ] power transmission constraints, supply chain delays and other factors. Since then, AI has become a significant driver of demand as hyperscalers race to develop, deploy and implement the technology while enterprise begin to explore the potential of this wave of technological evolution.\nMcKinsey recently forecasted data center demand growth at a double-digit CAGR through 2030. This growing secular demand is broad and deep in both enterprises and service providers need a significant new data center capacity to accommodate their expanding needs, Fueled by trends such as enterprise AI adoption, AI as a service, IoT and the relentless growth in data creation.\nReflecting these trends, I want to highlight 2 highly strategic AI [ signs ] that came to fruition during the quarter. First, we were selected to host one of the most powerful AI supercomputers in one of our data centers in Copenhagen in a collaboration spearheaded on the Novo Nordisk Foundation and the Export and Investment Fund of Denmark, researchers from Denmark's public and private sectors, access to a cutting-edge NVIDIA-powered AI supercomputer in addition to NVIDIA software platforms, training expertise.\nSecond, Digital Realty further strengthened its collaboration with Oracle to accelerate the growth and adoption of AI among enterprises, aiming to develop hybrid integrated solutions that address data gravity challenges, expedite time to market for enterprise deploying next-generation AI services and unlock data and AI-based business outcomes. Oracle will deploy critical GPU-based infrastructure with Digital Realty that leverages PlatformDIGITAL's open, purpose-built global data center solution and caters to enterprise and AI customers critical NVIDIA and AMD deployments among others.\nOur [ 01 ] interconnection customers also continue to recognize our [indiscernible] strength and value proposition whether that related to power dense applications, a network of globally-connected data centers or other critical infrastructure requirements.\nDuring the first quarter, we added over 128 new logos. Our wins included a leading Fortune 500 AI component maker, is expanding their presence on PlatformDIGITAL to a new EMEA market to support their streaming service capabilities.\nA global cloud computing and content distribution provider are leveraging the leading connectivity proposition of PlatformDIGITAL in [ Mubasa ] to support their global edge pop expansion project.\nA global 120 manufacturing company is building an AI HPC environment in Frankfurt to support its autonomous vehicle project.\nA leading [ French ] cloud service providers deploying on PlatformDIGITAL to build out its edge cloud offering across the globe to support their enterprise customers' hybrid infrastructure by delivering low latency performance while retaining [ mobile ] data residency.\nFortune 500 technology distributor in [indiscernible], IT service provider chose PlatformDIGITAL and Phoenix to support data exchange and interconnect with key partners.\nAnd a Fortune 500 health benefits provider has expanded into 2 additional North America metros to take advantage of cloud and network [indiscernible] available on PlatformDIGITAL.\nMoving over to a quick update on our largest market, Northern Virginia. During the first quarter, we leased approximately 80 megawatts of capacity in a supply-constrained quarter in Eastern [indiscernible]. Demand for our capacity remains strong. And while hyperscale leasing is typically lumpy, we continue to see healthy traction on the remaining capacity, and we are focused on helping our customers and partners source the incremental data center infrastructure that they require.\nDuring the first quarter, we worked with Dominion Energy to help address the transmission [ model ] at Ashburn by providing them with a easement to land a southern line at the Mars substation that they plan to construct on a quarter [ parcel ], [ along ] 450-acre [ digital deltas ] [indiscernible] .\nWe remain cautiously optimistic about getting access to additional power with Dominion's current forecast for completion of the Southern Line transmission project by late 2025.\nToday, we have roughly 80 megawatts of remaining capacity available for lease within our first building on our Digital Dallas campus in [indiscernible] building center. And we have almost 200 megawatts available for development for our [indiscernible] campus in Manassas, which was contributed to our JV with last [indiscernible] in the first quarter.\nAs a reminder, [indiscernible] is currently outside of the constrained area and [indiscernible] is accessible there.\nBefore turning it over to Matt, I'd like to touch on our ESG progress during the first quarter. We continue to make meaningful progress and be recognized for our strong ESG performance in 2024. We went live with a switch to 100% renewable energy supplies for our Texas, New Jersey and Sydney data center portfolios, benefiting 30 sites and addressing more than 10% of our mobile electricity footprint.\nWe are recognized by the EPA as Energy Star Partner of the Year [ with ] sustained excellence for the fourth year, and we added a new [ grid ] building certification at our MRS 4 development and Marseille, France. We also announced a partnership with a leading global energy solution provider to use our UPS systems to support Ireland's transition to renewable energy.\nAnd we've announced a significant expansion of our use of HVO diesel, a cleaner fuel made from waste cooking oils and [indiscernible] to power our backup generators. This will help our use of HVO to 20 global sites and 15% of our global portfolio by IT capacity.\nWe remain committed to minimizing Digital Realty's impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders.\nWith that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Matt Mercier.\n\nMatthew Mercier\n\nSVP of Finance & Accounting, Digital Realty Trust, Inc.\n\nThank you, Andy. Let me jump right into our first quarter results. We signed a record $252 million of new leases in the first quarter, led by $175 million of greater than 1 megawatt leasing in the Americas and another $53 million of 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection leasing, with interconnection bookings remaining firm at $13 million.\nTurning to our backlog. Given the record leasing, the backlog of signed but not yet commenced leases swelled to a new record of $541 million at quarter end, with new leasing outstripping a record $156 million of commencements during the quarter. Looking ahead, more than half of the record backlog is slated to commence during the remainder of 2024, indicating that commencements are likely to remain elevated.\nDuring the first quarter, we signed a record $248 million of renewal leases at a record increase of 11.8% on a cash basis. Re-leasing spreads were once again positive across products and regions, with particular strength in the Americas. Re-leasing spreads have been increasing steadily for well over a year now, and while we expect that they will remain very healthy, they're likely to moderate in this quarter's record given the significant weighting of lease expirations in the 0 to 1-megawatt segment for the remainder of the year.\nIn addition, we think it is important to consider a normalized view of the headline renewal spreads as 2 separate items skew our reported spreads higher in the first quarter. First, there was a notable outlier in the other category that should not be considered recurring or repeatable and removing this transaction would reduce our overall reported spreads by [ 250 ] basis points to 9.3% for the quarter.\nSecond, there was a significant early renewal transaction in our greater than 1 megawatt segment that was part of a large package deal as we work to support this customer's broader data center capacity needs in one of our tightest markets. While this transaction enabled us to opportunistically pull forward some of our below-market expirations from the outer years, our forward year lease expiration schedule remains dominated by our 0 to 1 megawatt segment, which tends to experience spreads in the low to mid-single digits, akin to what we saw in the first quarter.\nExcluding both the outlier transaction and the packaged deal renewal, re-leasing spreads in the quarter would have been up 3.4% on a cash basis. We feel that this is a more predictable aspect of our portfolio, that we will continue to see opportunities and may periodically be able to capture the growing mark-to-market opportunity in our greater than 1 megawatt portfolio.\nIn terms of earnings growth, we reported first quarter core FFO of $1.67 per share, reflecting strong organic operating results, partly balanced by dilution associated with the stabilized asset sales and JV contributions completed early in the year and the ongoing deleveraging of our balance sheet.\nAnd normalizing for the sale or JV of $3 billion of stabilized assets completed since the beginning of last year, total revenue growth was 7% year-over-year in the first quarter due to the benefit of improved leasing spreads, along with favorable new leasing. Revenue growth in the quarter was tempered by the decline in utility expense reimbursements as electricity rates fell sharply in EMEA year-over-year.\nNormalized adjusted EBITDA increased 9% year-over-year, reflecting the strong revenue growth and modest increase in operating expenses. As Andy noted earlier, stabilized same-capital operating performance saw continued strength in the first quarter, with year-over-year cash NOI up 4.7% driven by 4% growth in rental plus interconnection revenues and further supported by expense control.\nMoving on to our investment activity. We spent $550 million on consolidated development in the first quarter, plus another $23 million for our share of managed unconsolidated JV spending while delivering 32 megawatts of new capacity across the globe for our customers.\nIt's worth mentioning, the approximate $300 million of sequential decline in our development spending this quarter which highlights the effects of the contributions of our 3 development JVs. However, seasonal and other timing-related factors also contributed to less CapEx spending in the first quarter.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet in the first quarter with the closing of previously disclosed transactions, including the Cyxtera transaction, the first phase of the Blackstone hyperscale development JV and the sale of an additional [ 50% ] share of the 2 stabilized hyperscale assets in our Chicago JV to GI Partners.\nDuring the quarter, we also completed a hyperscale development JV with Mitsubishi for 2 assets in the Dallas Metro. In terms of new news, we also sold a piece of land in Sydney, Australia for $65 million, and we provided an easement to Dominion Energy to build the Mars substation on our Digital Dallas campus for $92 million, which all contributed to a reduction in our reported leverage to 6.1x at the end of the first quarter versus 6.2x at the end of 2023.\nThen in April, we continue to recycle capital by selling 75% of [ CH2 ], the third and final stabilized hyperscale facility on our Elk Grove campus at a 6.5 cap rate to GI Partners, raising nearly $400 million. And [ result at ] Digital Core REIT, an additional 24.9% interest in our Frankfurt site, for Digital Core REIT previously owned 25%, raising another $129 million.\nIn addition, we used some of our cash on hand to pay off the $600 million of maturing euro notes. After adjusting for these transactions, along with the anticipated closing of Phase 2 of the Blackstone transaction later this year, pro forma leverage is 5.8x.\nWe continue to keep significant cash on the balance sheet with approximately $1.2 billion on hand and over $3 billion of total liquidity at March 31 to support ongoing investment opportunities.\nMoving on to our debt profile. Our weighted average debt maturity is over 4 years, and our weighted average interest rate is 2.9%. Approximately 85% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and our FX hedging strategy. Approximately 86% of our net debt is fixed rate and 97% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling.\nFinally, after paying off the [ earnouts ] in April, we have [ $316 ] million of debt maturing through year-end 2024. Beyond that, our maturities remained well [ levered ] through 2032.\nI'll finish with guidance. We are maintaining our core FFO guidance range for the full year 2024 of between $6.60 and $6.75 per share, reflecting the continued improvement we are seeing in our core business. Positive underlying operating trends are partly balanced by potential acceleration in development spending and additional capital recycling, as we move our leverage down towards the long-term target and position the company for the accelerating opportunity in front of us.\nWe are maintaining our total revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance ranges for 2024, so we are notching up our cash and GAAP re-leasing spreads along with our same capital cash NOI growth expectations, reflecting better-than-expected execution on the leasing front in the first quarter, and the strength in fundamental conditions that we continue to see across our portfolio.\nSpecifically, cash re-leasing spreads are now expected to increase 5% to 7% in 2024, up 100 basis points at the midpoint from the prior 4% to 6% range. And same-capital cash NOI is now expected to increase by 2.5% to 3.5%, up 50 basis points from the 2% to 3% range we provided in February.\nHighlighted in our investor presentations, excluding the nearly 200 basis points of power margin headwinds that we have previously discussed, our same-capital cash NOI growth for 2024 would be 4.5% up to 5.5%.\nWhile these improvements and stronger core FFO per share realized in the first quarter bode well for the balance of the year, there are a few mitigating factors to consider as you're refining your models. First, we will see a modest drag on the $500-plus million of capital recycling completed in April. Second, we are only 1/3 of the way into the year, and there is still significant potential for both development spend and asset sales guidance to reach the high end of their guidance ranges.\nIn addition, it is worth pointing out that the interest rate outlook and [indiscernible] have changed considerably since we provided guidance and remains another source of uncertainty for the balance of this year.\nJust one final reminder and update. Over the course of 2024 and 2025, we expect that our $6 billion development pipeline will become increasingly accretive as higher-yielding projects are complete and stabilized. The expected yield on our stabilized pipeline ticked up another 20 basis points sequentially, reflecting the addition of higher-yielding projects and the completion or contribution to joint ventures of lower-yielding projects.\nTo help provide increased transparency around this important and evolving aspect of our company, we have enhanced our development life cycle schedule on Page 25 of our supplemental to: one, reflect our proportionate share of total data center development, including our unconsolidated joint ventures; and two, to provide increased disclosure around our developable capacity in terms of [ IQ logo ]. We hope you find this helpful.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. And now we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator, could you please begin the Q&A session?"

Please note, this event is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Jordan, please go ahead.\n\nJordan Sadler\n\nAnalyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Digital Realty's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on today's call are President and CEO, Andy Power; and CFO, Matt Mercier. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Colin McLean, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A.\nManagement will be making forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will also contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website.\nBefore I turn the call over to Andy, let me offer a few key takeaways from our fourth quarter and our full year. First, we are seeing a robust wave of demand across our platform, and we are optimistic about our ability to execute. Leasing in the quarter was healthy, highlighted by strong volume in the 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection segment, record pricing in the greater than megawatt category and the second highest quarter ever of new logos added.\nSecond, our fundamental metrics capped off the year on a high note with the strongest cash re-leasing spreads and same capital cash NOI growth we've seen in years as our unique and differentiated value proposition continued to resonate. And lastly, in the fourth quarter alone, we announced nearly $8 billion of new development joint ventures and completed over $1 billion of equity issuance under our ATM bringing total capital sources raised during the year to more than $12 billion and reducing pro forma leverage below our year-end 2023 target.\nThe execution on our funding and capital plan in 2023 has positioned Digital Realty to be able to support our customers' data center infrastructure needs as the next generation technology unfolds.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Andy Power.\n\nAndrew P. Power\n\nCFO, Digital Realty Trust, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. 2023 was a milestone year for Digital Realty. As we made strong progress toward our strategic objectives despite significant volatility in financial conditions and broader uncertainty around the world. For me, 2023 will be reverted as the year of AI's arrival to the data center forefront. [ Australian ] an unprecedented new wave of data center demand, driving a step function of change across the industry's landscape. The year that Digital Realty enhanced its customer value proposition by adding connectivity-rich solutions while also scaling our capacity for hyperscale and AI workloads.\nWe expanded our footprint with new connectivity-oriented locations around the Mediterranean and elsewhere. Enhanced our joint venture in India with the addition of Reliance Jio and increased the number of direct access points on our campuses to the leading cloud and service providers. We accelerated the growth of service fabric with more than 70 discrete services added to the platform and over 100 unique services available by year-end and enhance its capabilities with new composes like service directory.\nWe also added 9,000 new cross connects in the year, indicative of our growing connected data communities. 2023 was a year that we integrated and innovated at a faster pace than ever before. We strengthened our leadership team and aligned our platform to 3 regions to be consistently structured around the world. We adapted our product portfolio to meet market demand, evolving our offering to efficiently support next-generation chips like the NVIDIA H-100 in numerous data centers.\nOur high-density colo capability deployed across 32 markets spending all 3 regions is equipped to handle 3x the H-100 requirements. And we continue to add green energy solutions to power many of these power dense applications. like our large solar PPA in Germany and our agreement supporting 100% renewable power in Texas, San Francisco, New Jersey and Sydney. And 2023 was the year that Digital Realty took decisive action to strengthen our balance sheet by developing a portfolio of private capital partnerships and vehicles that diversified our capital sources while enabling us to support our customers' fast-growing requirements.\nAnd we did all of that while continuing to provide the operational excellence that is expected of a global data center leader and that our customers rightfully demand. On this call a year ago, I outlined the plan to Bolster and diversify our capital sources. Our goals were to reduce our leverage towards 6x by the end of the year. Increase our liquidity to fund our development program and diversify our capital sources to limit our reliance on the capital markets, increasing our ability to meet the accelerating demand for data center capacity and to enhance our returns on invested capital.\nWe outperformed on each of these goals, sourcing over $12 billion of new capital and commitments for new investment and debt repayment, reducing pro forma leverage to just 5.8x when adjusted for transactions that have been announced or closed since year-end. We also ended the year with 5 new JV partners and expanded some of our existing relationships. To round out the year, we announced three significant transactions in the fourth quarter, including two development joint ventures and the successful resolution to our relationship with Cyxtera, we also raised $1.2 billion of equity under our ATM since the end of September. I will quickly run through the highlights of these transactions.\nIn early January, Greg completed his famed Triple Lindy with the Cyxtera transaction by selling $275 million of assets to Brookfield along with the purchase of Cyxtera's leasehold positions in Singapore and Frankfurt for $55 million, yielding net cash of $220 million to Digital Realty. In addition, Brookfield assumed three existing leases and amended three others in our portfolio to accelerate their expiration to the end of September 2024.\nFinally, Digital Realty obtained and exercised an option to purchase a Cyxtera data center and the slow trading estate adding on its highly sought-after submarkets to Platform Digital's connectivity and enterprise colo offering. This transaction remains subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close towards the end of the first quarter.\nIn November, Realty Income purchased an 80% interest in [ 2,400,000,000 ] data centers that are under development and leased to an investment-grade financial services company. The tenant has the option to expand the facility up to an estimated potential cost of $800 million. We received $200 million upon closing and reduced our funding obligations for the remainder of this project to just 20% of the total capital, enabling us to reinvest the capital in higher-return projects.\nFinally, the $7 billion development joint venture with Blackstone is our largest and most forward-looking transaction and accelerates the monetization of nearly 20% of our 3-plus gigawatt land bank. This JV involves the sale of an 80% interest in nearly 500 megawatts of capacity across 4 campuses in Paris, Frankfurt and Northern Virginia and enables us to better support our hyperscale customers' needs.\nApproximately 20% of Ventures total potential data center capacity is expected to be delivered through 2025. We will retain a 20% interest in the developments and earn fees for developing, leasing, operating and managing these facilities. All told, in 2023, we announced or completed joint ventures and asset sales driving leverage down roughly 1.3 turns from the first quarter peak accelerating our ability to deliver needed capacity to our customers and enhancing our returns on invested capital.\nI would also be remiss if I did not mention Digital Core REIT's successful $120 million follow-on equity offering last week which will support the REIT's planned acquisition of an incremental 24.9% interest in our jointly owned asset in Frankfurt for $125 million. Let's shift to a brief recap of our results and offer some insights into the trends we are seeing across our business. I'm pleased with our results for 2023, which helped to lay the foundation for an acceleration in long-term sustainable growth in earnings and free cash flow that should take shape as we head into 2025.\nOur fourth quarter results were broadly consistent with the first 3 quarters of 2023 with continued strength in our operating performance KPIs and an incremental improvement in our financial position as we continue to execute on our value proposition with the goal to support the increased demand for data center capacity. Leasing remained healthy, especially in our targeted [ 01 ] plus interconnection segment with 134 new logos, bringing our total new levels for 2023 to a new annual record of more than 500. Renewal spreads were strong for the fifth consecutive quarter, remaining positive across product types and regions. Same capital cash NOI growth continue to demonstrate the underlying strength of our business with 9.9% year-over-year growth in the quarter.\nAnd churn remained low and well controlled at 1%, while occupancy was impacted by the delivery of significant vacant development capacity. The combination of cloud and AI is driving unprecedented demand for scale and hyperscale capacity alongside the steady enterprise and connectivity-oriented demand we're experiencing within our 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection segment.\nSupply constraints driven by limited availability of power and global supply chain delays have continued to drive the pricing pendulum in our favor or our growing value proposition is increasing interest in our existing inventory and the new development that we have underway. Ongoing conversations with customers protend a significant potential acceleration of leasing and development, and we believe we are well positioned.\nThe demand seems to be spilling across most markets, particularly for larger capacity blocks, though there are a few pockets of strength worth knowing, including Northern Virginia, Santa Clara, New Jersey, Paris, Frankfurt, Singapore and Seoul. Our new capacity is concentrated in core markets aligned with our global meeting place strategy. While the scale of data center infrastructure opportunities has increased alongside AI's arrival, we remain disciplined and thoughtful prioritizing locations that enhance platform Digital connectivity and our connected campus communities.\nDuring the fourth quarter, Digital demonstrated the benefits of collaborating with our partners with the signing of an Oracle Cloud infrastructure dedicated region deployment by a financial services customer, showcasing the potential of the collaboration between Oracle and Digital Realty to fulfill enterprise customers' hybrid cloud requirements. Other customers are recognizing the growing value of Platform Digital's broad and open structure. An AI service provider leveraged Platform Digital's pre-provisioned high-density colo offering to improve their time to market in order to extend our North America and AI cloud offering that provides managed AI as a service for a global manufacturing client.\nA global service provider and partner targeting enterprise customers added more connectivity for their hybrid offerings on platform Digital, enabling them to upgrade their IT environments to a consumption-based IT infrastructure and managed services model. A Global 2000 leader in material sciences for industrial and scientific applications needed a data center provider with global interconnectivity and access to cloud providers in Seoul and shows platform Digital to enable them to deploy and interconnect a private AI node.\nA Global 50 financial services company is migrating from an on-prem data center to platform Digital and utilizing service fabric to improve sustainability, resiliency, scalability, security and carrier diversity. And a leading Global 2000 consumer goods manufacturer grew their presence on Platform Digital by adding two additional metros to support their IT workloads and cloud connectivity.\nMoving over to a quick update on our largest market, Northern Virginia. We have over 100 megawatts available for lease today in Loudon County and nearly 200 megawatts of capacity available for lease in Manassas. We are currently in active negotiations with a handful of customers for substantially all of our capacity in Loudon, though in contrast with the rumor mill, nothing has been finalized just yet. Beyond this capacity, we have another 900 megawatts of buildable capacity at Digital dose, which we are cautiously optimistic will gain access to power in 2026 and beyond. We also expect to benefit from the active and ongoing management of our existing 500-megawatt portfolio in this market over time.\nBefore turning it over to Matt, I'd like to touch on our ESG progress during the fourth quarter. We continue to be recognized for our strong ESG performance in the fourth quarter and in 2024. We placed second on Sustainability magazine's list of top 10 sustainable data center providers. We improved the #8 on the U.S. EPA's Green Power partnership National Top 100 for renewable energy use and we were named as a top rated regional performer in North America by a leading global ESG ratings provider. We remain committed to minimizing Digital Realty's impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders.\nWith that, I'm pleased to turn over the call to our CFO, Matt Mercier.\n\nMatthew Mercier\n\nSVP of Finance & Accounting, Digital Realty Trust, Inc.\n\nThank you, Andy. Let me jump right into our fourth quarter results. We signed a total of $110 million of new leases in the fourth quarter with $53 million of 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection leasing, led by strength in the EMEA region. Interconnection bookings rebounded sequentially to $13.5 million, and we finished the year with 220,000 cross-connects despite continued network grooming.\nTurning to our backlog slide. The current backlog of signed by [indiscernible] commenced leases increased to a new record of $495 million at quarter end as new leasing outran $84 million of commencements in the quarter. We expect commencements to pick up as nearly 2/3 of the backlog is scheduled to commence in 2024, with the majority coming in the second half of the year. During the fourth quarter, we signed $210 million of renewal leases with pricing increases of 8.2% on a cash basis, setting the high watermark for the year, though this was skewed over 100 basis points by shorter-term renewals in one market.\nFor the full year, cash renewal spreads were up 6.8% and or 5.5% when normalizing for short-term extensions. Re-leasing spreads were positive across product, market and region in 2023, setting the foundation for an acceleration in long-term sustainable growth. In 2024, we expect the pricing environment to remain firm and renewal spreads to remain positive, principally reflecting the near 80% weighting of lease expirations in the 0 to 1 megawatt segment. In terms of earnings growth, we reported fourth quarter Core FFO of $1.63 per share and $6.59 for the full year within our guidance range.\nEarnings reflect the continued strong organic results, together with the impact from capital recycling, deleveraging and increased development spending throughout the year, as discussed on our third quarter call. Total revenue was up 11% year-over-year despite the incremental drag from the stabilized JV contributions and the noncore asset sales that closed in the third quarter. As we also noted last quarter, year-over-year revenue growth continued to be positively impacted by the significant volatility in utility costs and reimbursements, particularly in Europe. Energy dynamics proved to be a tailwind for our results in 2023. Assuming more normalized energy prices, we expect the related upside impact will moderate in 2024. Interconnection revenue was $106 million, up 9% year-over-year, reflecting continued unit growth and price increases.\nMoving over to the expense side. Utilities were 5% lower sequentially, reflecting the joint venture contributions over the summer, combined with seasonal impacts. Operating expenses increased due to seasonally elevated maintenance spending in the fourth quarter. Property taxes fell back toward normalized levels, reflecting the onetime property tax reassessment experienced in the third quarter. Net of this movement, adjusted EBITDA increased 9% year-over-year. Improvement in our stabilized same capital operating performance continued in the fourth quarter.\nWith a year-over-year cash NOI up a strong 9.9% and up 7.7% on a constant currency basis. For the full year, results were also strong with cash NOI growth of 7.5% and 6.5% on a constant currency basis. Focusing on investment activity, we spent $3 billion on development in 2023, net of the proceeds received from our first development JV closing in November, and we delivered over 230 megawatts of new capacity across the globe.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We continued to strengthen our balance sheet since the end of the third quarter. With the sale of $1.2 billion of equity through the ATM at an average price of $133 per share, achieving our goal of lowering our leverage towards 6x in finishing the year at 6.2x. After year-end, we made further progress on the balance sheet with the closings of the Cyxtera transactions in the first phase of the Blackstone joint venture. GI Partners also exercised their option and closed on an additional 15% share of the two stabilized assets in our Chicago JV, bringing their stake to 80%.\nPro forma for these activities, year-end leverage was 5.8x. S&P recognized our progress in December and upgraded our outlook. Early in the fourth quarter, we paid off our $100 million swiss franc notes and closed the Realty Income joint venture, which generated $200 million of gross proceeds and reduced our CapEx commitments for the remainder of the project's development. We continue to keep significant cash on the balance sheet with over $1.6 billion at year-end as we continue to prioritize liquidity and to support ongoing development spend.\nMoving on to our debt profile. Our weighted average debt maturity is nearly 4.5 years, and our weighted average interest rate is 2.9%. Approximately 84% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and our FX hedging strategy. Approximately 85% of our net debt is fixed rate and 97% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling.\nFinally, we have less than $1 billion of debt maturing in 2024 and beyond that, our maturities remained well laddered through 2032. I'll finish with guidance. We are providing an initial Core FFO per share guidance range for the full year 2024 of $6.60 to $6.75. Reflecting the underlying growth of our business, offset by the impact of the deleveraging activities we completed or announced in 2023. As a reminder, over the course of 2024 and 2025, we expect that our $6 billion development pipeline will become increasingly accretive as higher-yielding projects deliver.\nFor 2024, we expect total revenue to grow by 2% and adjusted EBITDA to grow by 4% at the midpoint of our guidance ranges. When normalizing this growth for the impact of capital recycling, total revenue and adjusted EBITDA are anticipated to grow by 7% and 10%, respectively, in 2024. We expect both our cash and GAAP re-leasing spreads, along with same capital cash NOI growth to remain solidly positive. While occupancy is expected to improve steadily throughout the year as our record backlog commences and available capacity is leased.\nSpecifically, cash re-leasing spreads are expected to increase by 4% to 6% in 2024. Same capital cash NOI is expected to grow by 2% to 3%, and given the tougher base year comparison versus last year's 7.5% growth and our expectations for FX and energy pricing in our colo segment. Total portfolio occupancy is expected to improve by 100 to 200 basis points by the end of 2024 while total occupancy slipped to 81.7% in the fourth quarter of 2023. This was predominantly driven by the delivery of substantial vacant development capacity that is slated to be occupied as same capital occupancy was stable quarter-over-quarter.\nWe also expect to continue to recycle capital in 2024 with noncore asset sales and stabilized joint ventures raising $1.25 billion at the midpoint of our guidance range. Nearly 1/3 of this activity was completed in early January, while the balance should close throughout this year. Along with cash on hand and retained cash flow from operations, this capital is expected to be the primary funding source of our $2 billion to $2.5 billion net development CapEx program for 2024.\nTo be clear, this approximately 25% reduction in development spend year-over-year represents Digital Realty's share of CapEx spend. The total development spend on these projects will be higher when including our partners pro rata share. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session?"

Please note, this event is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Jordan, please go ahead.\n\nJordan Sadler\n\nAnalyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Digital Realty's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on today's call are President and CEO, Andy Power; and CFO, Matt Mercier; chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Colin McLean, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A.\nManagement may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC.\nThis call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website.\nBefore I turn the call over to Andy, let me offer a few key takeaways from our third quarter. First, our customer value proposition continues to resonate. Leasing was strong across both our primary product category with record overall bookings in the 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection segment, and an acceleration in our greater than megawatt segment.\nSecond, we saw a further continuation of the improvements in our fundamental metrics. Strong demand and tight supply remains supportive of pricing, and this is evident in our results. Same capital cash NOI growth was the best in more than a decade at 9.4%, while cash releasing spreads eclipsed 7% in the quarter, which caused us to raise full year guidance for these metrics for the second consecutive quarter.\nThird, we continue to diversify and bolster our balance sheet with almost $4 billion of capital raised to date, including two hyperscale core joint ventures announced in July, and another almost $200 million of noncore sales, bringing total dispositions to $2.5 billion year-to-date. The capital that we've raised this year has enabled us to increase our liquidity and and delever while expanding our investment in development that we expect to generate double-digit unlevered returns.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Andy Power.\n\nAndrew P. Power\n\nCFO, Digital Realty Trust, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. The third quarter marks 9 months since being appointed to my current role as CEO, and this marks the fourth official earnings call. While there has been about as much volatility in a single year as I can recall from my 20-plus-year career, it has been a privilege and an honor to have the opportunity to visit and work with and to watch my digital realty colleagues across the globe execute on behalf of our customers and stakeholders during these extraordinary times.\nAt the outset of this year, I highlighted three key priorities for our company. While we've got two months left in the year, I am very excited about our progress to date and look forward to finishing strong.\nAs you recall, our key strategic priorities are: first, to demonstrably strengthen our customer value proposition, which means that we are adding connectivity-rich solutions and scale capacity to drive our global meeting place strategy. We are executing this through the addition and launch of new on-ramps, the expansion of our [ colo ] capacity end markets and also by providing visibility into longer-term hyperscale capacity in our largest core markets.\nWe are making strides and our customers are recognizing this by landing and expanding their IT infrastructure within our facilities. For example, over the past few months, we've added on ramps from a number of the largest cloud service providers, including AWS and Oracle.\nOur second priority is to integrate and innovate. For the first time, we created an Americas region and formally organized the company into 3 regions to improve overall management and accountability. In addition, we moved global operations under an experienced Digital Realty leader, bringing the standardization and consistency across our global platform. We also reorganized all things technology under our CTO organization.\nConsistent with our aim to bring innovation to our customers end market, in the third quarter, we announced the launch of our first Nvidia DGX H100-Ready data center in Osaka, Japan. We also rolled out our new high-density colo offering across 28 global metros to support high-performance compute infrastructure, addressing data and AI-related growth challenges.\nWe are also partnering with other leaders around the world to enhance our open platform. In this vein, we recently added BT and Lumin to our Service Fabric platform, which connects our data centers globally extending the reach of our customers and partners. And we made some nice progress on the sustainability front in the quarter, which I'll circle back to in a moment.\nFinally, we set out to bolster and diversify our capital sources. And to date, we've reduced leverage by 0.8 turns of EBITDA from the 1Q peak and increased liquidity to $3-plus billion, including $1 billion of cash on hand. We executed on our funding plan that included the completion of 2 stabilized hyperscale JVs this quarter, tapping into some of the deepest pools of private capital, and we remain confident in our ability to add to this progress with development JVs in the near future. If we deliver on our key strategic priorities, we expect that this will translate into better long-term sustainable growth for our customers, team members and in turn, our shareholders.\nDigital Realty continues to make progress in the third quarter with further improvement in our operational results highlighted by 9-plus percent same capital cash NOI growth strong leasing results with record 0 to 1-megawatt [ suns ], the highest greater than megawatt pricing since 2016, record leasing in APAC with broad strength in the Americas, and record interconnection revenue with the strongest growth since 2018.\nThe momentum across the data center infrastructure landscape is strong. Demand for our data center capacity remains broad-based both geographically and by product, as reflected in our leasing results. New supply in our top markets remains constrained and is likely to remain so due to limited availability of power, growing supply chain challenges and tighter financial conditions.\nWhile the demand drivers we have enjoyed for the last several years, including cloud, digital transformation and hybrid IT remain largely intact AI applications have added a meaningful new layer, which is just beginning to materialize in our leasing results this quarter, and we are ready for it.\nWhen Chris first started speaking publicly about AI and high-performance compute at our Investor Day in December 2017, we are already in the process of architecting and designing our facilities to support the evolving densities and our most innovative and leading-edge customers.\nWhile there are multiple high-density workloads running in our portfolio since at least that time, in the last quarter alone, we were able to accommodate a handful of high-density compute deployments from one of our service provider customers in a 10-plus year old data center in one of our smallest markets. And we are currently supporting one of our customers' AI infrastructure deployments that will incorporate 32,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs.\nThis doesn't mean that Digital Realty will be chasing large AI deployments far and wide, as we will continue to assess the longer-term opportunity set of remotely located single-tenant non-differentiated data centers. But it does mean that there has been an increase in demand for our highly connected campuses in core markets. We're being thoughtful in how we approach these opportunities.\nAs we consider leasing our capacity, I expect that we will seek to support our long-term engaged partners that have become embedded within our meeting place community that value our strategic locations and the connectivity across platform digital. At the same time, in certain markets, we will selectively support customers that have a differentiated product offering as we've always been at the forefront supporting leading technology companies as they push their infrastructure capabilities.\nLet's move to our third quarter results. This quarter continued to demonstrate the fundamental recovery that we've been highlighting throughout this year. Leasing activity was strong and broad-based across product types and reflected the pricing recovery we have seen throughout our portfolio.\nWhile we routinely lead with our headline leasing figures, it is important to point out the record posted in the 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection segment in the quarter, which increased by more than 9% sequentially and nearly 28% over the prior year period.\nTotal new leasing during the quarter was $152 million with record 0-1 megawatt signings representing just over 1/3 of total signings. Greater than a megawatt science moved higher for the second consecutive quarter led by the Americas region, while our team also put up a record quarter in APAC.\nPricing remains firm with notable highs achieved across the greater than 1 megawatt segment with strength in the 0-1 megawatt category. Growing recognition of our value proposition, including our comprehensive product offering, along with strong demand trends and reduced availability are supportive of pricing and are helping to drive better core growth and higher returns on investment.\nIn the third quarter, we saw re-leasing spreads climbed to 7.4% on a cash basis contributing to the strongest same capital cash NOI growth in more than a decade. During the third quarter, churn remained low at 1.1%, and we added 117 new customers extending our string of 100-plus new logos per quarter to 3.5 years. Another strong validation of the value that enterprise customers around the world recognize in platform digital. Our focus on deepening the value of our campus has resulted in enhanced cloud access for Digital Realty.\nRecently, 4 out of 5 top B2B cloud providers complete multisite on-ramp and edge expansions to serve data-intensive workloads on 2 continents via Platform Digital. In addition, AWS announced a direct connect location in Seoul, the first carrier-neutral facility in the market, while we announced the Oracle FastConnect availability in Madrid to their EU sovereign cloud.\nOther key wins during the quarter included a speech to text AI provider completed their second HD colo deployment in 6 months on Platform Digital, multiple new logos in the health care vertical in the quarter, two Global 2000 health care companies deployed on Platform Digital, one supportive data-intensive AI workloads and the other implementing a 2-site data compliance solution. An international Tier 1 telco added a multi-metro expansion across 2 continents of Platform Digital to support their retail enterprise customers. A Global 2000 Bank is implementing multi-site, multi-region network hub deployments now totaling 15 metros and a Global 2000 insurance company is expanding a distributed data hub on Platform Digital to support M&A data compliance.\nMoving over to our largest market, Northern Virginia. More than a year since we learned the power constraints in this market, we have continued to work constructively with the power providers to confirm the commitments that we made to our customers and to provide growth capacity for our customers through new development and select churn opportunities. As discussed on our last earnings call, we identified almost 100 megawatts of development capacity in Loudoun County that we expect to be able to bring to market prior to 2026. This includes 56 megawatts of available capacity underway within the current development pipeline and the potential to move forward on another 40 megawatts.\nIn addition to this [ ash ] from focused capacity, we continue to advance the ball on our 192-megawatt development in site in Manassas, and we are now officially underway and will soon be patent ready to support construction of the first of two buildings on the site in early 2024. We are very excited to be able to offer this availability to our customers.\nMoving on to our investment activity. Digital Realty investment team has already had an extraordinarily productive year, including the $2.3 billion of JVs and noncore asset sales completed in the third quarter. Within the noncore bucket, we sold two facilities during the quarter, including one in the U.K. and the other in Chantilly, Virginia, totaling almost $200 million, including the $150 million noncore disposition in Texas that we completed last quarter, we're tracking well towards our $500 million target for the noncore asset sales in 2023.\nWe closed two separate stabilized hyperscale joint ventures in July with the contribution of two assets in Chicago and three in Northern Virginia, raising $2.1 billion of proceeds. We've also made substantial progress on the third bucket of our funding plan, the development joint ventures, and we expect to have more to say about this in the fourth quarter.\nBefore turning it over to Matt, I'd like to touch on our ESG progress during the third quarter. We've continued to make progress on our water conservation initiatives, including a water saving initiative for cooling towers and our SIN10 facility in Singapore. The project won the inaugural Green Innovations, Water Solutions Award at the Singapore Environment Council's Environmental Achievement Awards.\nThe project is expected to save over 1.2 million liters of water each month and improved water usage efficiency by 15%. The solution has now been evaluated for wider rollout across our portfolio.\nIn the third quarter, we also announced that we are ranked in the top 10 on a U.S. EPA's National Top 100 list of the large green power users from the Green Power partnership. The company also ranked seventh on the EPA's list across technology and telecommunication providers.\nWe remain committed to minimizing Digital Realty's impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Matt Mercier.\n\nMatthew R. Mercier\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Andy. Let me jump right into our third quarter results. We signed a total of $152 million of new leases in the third quarter with broad-based strength across each of our two primary product groups and geographic strength in the Americas and APAC. We leased a record $54 million in the 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection category, accounting for 35% of total bookings. This product segment remains a consistent and steady source of growth as we continue to execute on our global meeting place strategy.\nInterconnection bookings were strong once again at over $12 million as we added another 2,000 cross connects in the quarter, finishing with 218,000 total cross-connects, greater than a megawatt bookings totaled $97 million in the quarter with outsized contributions from Portland and Hong Kong. This was our highest greater than a megawatt signings quarter since we discussed sharpening the lens with regard to capital allocation decisions one year ago.\nOur greater focus and increased threshold have resulted in higher average returns in the greater than a megawatt category as implied by the growing expected stabilized returns in the Americas that we present on the development life cycle schedule in our supplemental. Pricing continues to improve across most markets globally with outsized pricing power experienced within the greater than the megawatt segment, which saw pricing on signed leases at the highest level since the first half of 2016.\nTurning to our backlog slide. The current backlog of signed but not yet commenced leases increased to a new record of $482 million at quarter end. As commencements of $110 million were more than offset by elevated new leasing volume in the quarter. We expect nearly 15% of the backlog to commence in the fourth quarter with a little over 50% commencing throughout 2024.\nThe lag between signings and commencements in the quarter ticked up to 12 months, driven by new development and build-outs to support larger scale leases. During the third quarter, we signed $156 million of renewal leases with pricing increases of 7.4% on a cash basis, the strongest re-leasing spreads achieved since 2015.\nWhile renewal pricing was strong across product segments and across our 3 regions, the overall result was upwardly skewed by a single transaction within our other category. Excluding this outlier, renewal, releasing spreads in the quarter would have been up 4.5% on a cash basis and 6.4% on a GAAP basis. We feel that this is a more representative picture of the renewal spreads that we are seeing throughout the portfolio, which is consistent with the broad-based improvement we've seen throughout this year.\nWith renewal rates trending higher over the first 9 months of the year, we are raising our full year guidance for renewal spreads to reflect the success year-to-date and today's improved fundamental environment. Renewal spreads in the 0-1 megawatt category continued their steady climb with 4.4% growth on a cash basis in the third quarter on $125 million of volume. Greater than a megawatt renewals continued to post strong results, with cash renewals higher by 5.6%, albeit on lighter volume of $19 million in the third quarter.\nIn terms of earnings growth, we reported third quarter core FFO of $1.62 per share, broadly consistent with consensus expectations, but down $0.06 per share versus the second quarter, primarily reflecting the impact of the asset sales and the equity raised in the quarter and the redeployment of capital into accelerated and increased development. On a constant currency basis, core FFO was $1.60 per share relative to the $1.67 we reported in the third quarter of 2022.\nTotal revenue was up 18% year-over-year and 3% sequentially despite the impact of the more than $2 billion of asset sales completed early in the quarter as the benefits of improved pricing are starting to take hold. Importantly, Year-over-year revenue growth also continues to be impacted by the significant volatility in utility costs and reimbursements, particularly in Europe. Most of these energy costs are directly passed through to customers.\nExcluding the impact of utility and other reimbursements, total revenue was up 13% year-over-year. Interconnection revenue of $107 million marked another quarterly record and was 12% higher than the year ago period. Excluding Teraco, interconnection revenue was up 11% year-over-year, the highest interconnection growth since 2018 and and reflects the ongoing organic strength in our core footprint. Quarter-over-quarter interconnection revenue was up almost 3% and as 2,000 new cross connects were added, increasing the total global installed base to 218,000.\nMoving over to the expense side. Utilities were seasonally high given the warmer summer months and off an already elevated 2023 base. Rental property operating expenses remained essentially flat for the second consecutive quarter, partly reflecting the benefit of the removal of expenses related to the dispositions and joint ventures. However, on the noncontrollable expense front, property taxes spiked higher quarter-over-quarter to $72 million, driven by an elevated reassessment on some of our properties in Chicago. While these expenses will be largely passed on to our underlying customers, it will also be disputed over the coming years.\nNet of this movement, adjusted EBITDA increased 10% year-over-year. One nonrecurring item worth noting in the quarter was the $113 million noncash impairment charge related to the lower value of our holdings in digital core REIT stock. The Singapore REIT IPO-ed in December 2021 at $0.88 per share, but was valued at $0.53 per share at the end of September, driving the noncash adjustment in our carrying value of the investment.\nImprovement in our stabilized same capital operating performance continued in the third quarter, with year-over-year cash NOI up a strong 9.4% but moderating by 1.5% sequentially due to the expected increase in utility bleed during the seasonally warmer months. Even on a constant currency basis, year-over-year cash NOI growth was strong at 6.6%. These results demonstrate the strongest period of organic growth in our same capital pool since 2014, and extends the [ turn and ] fundamentals that we have been highlighting throughout this year.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We meaningfully strengthened our balance sheet during the third quarter, driven by the success that we've had on our funding plan. This progress continues today, and as a result, we have raised our full year capital raising target for the second consecutive quarter.\nIn the third quarter, we generated over $2.6 billion proceeds from JV closings, noncore asset sales and settlement of the equity forward. Roughly $1 billion was redeployed into our development program and a little over $500 million was used to repay higher cost USD borrowings on our credit facility. The remaining amount was kept in cash, earning interest at a rate in excess of the remaining borrowings under our credit facility.\nAs a result, at quarter end, we had over $1 billion of cash on our balance sheet and our leverage fell to 6.3x net debt to EBITDA, down from 6.8x at the end of the second quarter and we are now within spitting distance of our near 6x leverage goal that we set out to achieve by year-end. Since the end of the quarter, we paid off CHF 100 million notes that matured in October and are confident in our ability to execute on additional asset sales and development joint ventures that are left in our upwardly revised funding plan.\nMoving to our debt profile. Our weighted average debt maturity is over 4.5 years, and our weighted average interest rate is 2.9%. Approximately 84% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and our FX hedging strategy. Approximately 86% of our net debt is fixed rate and 97% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, we have less than $1 billion of debt maturing in 2024 and beyond that, our maturities remain well laddered through 2032.\nLastly, let's turn to our guidance. We are tightening our core FFO per share guidance range for the full year 2023 by $0.03 at the high and low ends to a new range of $6.58 to $6.62 per share, maintaining the midpoint of $6.60 per share. We are also tightening the range for full year adjusted EBITDA, affirming our full year guidance midpoint of $2.7 billion.\nOur full year revenue guidance range is being adjusted down by about 1% at the midpoint to a new range of $5.475 billion to $5.525 billion to reflect the impact of lower pass-through oriented tenant utility reimbursements given the moderation in electricity pricing in EMEA.\nImportantly, you'll recall that last quarter's core FFO per share guidance reflected a $0.05 to $0.07 per share impact from a bankrupt customer, including $0.02 that was realized in the second quarter. In the third quarter, we received all of the rent due from this customer across our portfolio, but we did incur a $0.01 write-off related to unpaid utility expenses and we expect that we could see up to another $0.02 of dilution related to this customer in the fourth quarter. In addition, we could see up to $0.01 of drag related to the carryforward of increased Chicago property tax assessment and $0.01 of drag related to the acceleration and increase of development spend as we capitalize on the opportunities we are seeing in front of us.\nWith the continued improvement in our fundamentals during the quarter, we are also updating the organic operating metrics supporting our full year guidance, including cash and GAAP re-leasing spreads of over 5%, up from 4%. Same capital cash NOI growth of 6% to 7%, representing a 200 basis points increase versus prior guidance and a reduction in year-end portfolio occupancy to between 83% and 84%, reflecting the delayed timing of the sale of a vacant nondata center asset in our portfolio.\nGiven the successful leasing executed in the third quarter and the increased level of demand embedded within our pipeline, we are increasing our full year development spend guidance to $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion for 2023, representing the $400 million increase at the midpoint. Similarly, reflecting the continued execution on our funding plan to date, we have also updated our guidance for dispositions and JV capital to $2.7 million to $3.2 billion, representing a $350 million increase at the midpoint, which is in line with the increase in our expected development spend for this year. While development has been an important driver of our growth for the last decade, in the short term, we are experiencing the headwinds from the sharp regime change in interest rates.\nThis year, we've sold assets at [ 6 caps ], and new borrowings on our [ liner ] at similar levels, whereas GAAP requires us to capitalize interest at our weighted average borrowing cost of less than 3%. In other words, increasing our development spend today, to capitalize on the growing opportunities we are seeing is dilutive to near-term earnings.\nThese projects underway are completed at incrementally higher yields and the relatively low rate of capitalized interest burns off. We expect development completions will become increasingly accretive to core FFO per share. The good news is that fundamentals are helping to mitigate a portion of this dilution.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, please begin the Q&A session."

Please note, this event is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJordan Sadler\n\nAnalyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Digital Realty's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on today's call are President and CEO, Andy Power; and CFO, Matt Mercier; Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Colin McLean, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. .\nManagement may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC.\nThis call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website.\nBefore I turn the call over to Andy, let me offer a few key takeaways from our second quarter. First, our customer value proposition continues to resonate. We delivered yet another strong quarter of leasing in our 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection segment and saw a healthy rebound in greater than megawatt leasing. And second, this past quarter confirmed the continued inflection in fundamentals we have been speaking about for much of the past year, supported by a strong pricing environment. Re-leasing spreads were the strongest in 3 years and stabilized same cash NOI grew by 5.6%, marking the second consecutive quarter with positive growth and the best growth in almost 9 years.\nAnd third, we bolstered our total liquidity, which now stands at more than $4 billion and further diversified our capital sources and reduced our leverage well off of peak levels through more than $2 billion of dispositions and [ JVs ] and over $1 billion of equity issued under our [ ATM ].\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Andy Power.\n\nAndrew P. Power\n\nCFO, Digital Realty Trust, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. Against the backdrop of an extraordinarily dynamic first half of the year, we have remained focused on advancing our strategic priorities and delivering on behalf of our 5,000-plus customers. Digital Realty made strong progress in the second quarter with improved operational results, progress on our funding plan and increased liquidity, continued organizational improvements and increasing recognition of the critical role that data centers will play in support of both digital transformation and artificial intelligence. .\nWe posted sequential growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA and CFFO per share while improving development returns, bolstering liquidity and delevering the balance sheet. During the quarter, we made progress on each of the 3 key strategic priorities that I laid out earlier this year. First, we strengthened our customer value proposition by enhancing our communities of interest with more connectivity options, posting record double-digit interconnection revenue growth, and the second highest quarter of new logo additions in company history.\nSecond, we innovated and integrated, delivering enhancements designed to support high-performance compute, including AI by enabling data centers to support liquid cooling solutions while also broadening our existing partnership with NVIDIA with the certification of our first [ DGX H-100 ] ready data center and integrating with additional organizational enhancements designed to deliver a consistent structure and experience while leveraging data to improve our effectiveness and efficiency.\nThird, we access diverse capital sources during the quarter, including the sale of a [ noncore ] asset in Texas and an attractive 4.4% cap rate and equity raised under our [ ATM ]. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we formed a stabilized hyperscale data center joint venture with a new private capital partner that acquired an interest in 2 facilities in Chicago.\nAnd today, we announced a similar joint venture transaction alongside a second new private capital partner for 3 stabilized hyperscale data centers in Northern Virginia. Just a little more than halfway through the year, we are now well ahead of the midpoint of our original funding plan for 2023. And we remain focused on putting Digital Realty's balance sheet into positions to support the growing opportunity that lies ahead.\nThe current state of the data center infrastructure landscape is very healthy. There is widespread demand for our data center capacity across various regions and products. However, there is limited new supply due to decreased power availability and tight financial conditions. The global expansion of cloud computing paired with continuous digital transformation of enterprises underscores the escalating importance of both data and AI in shaping demand.\nPresently, we are collaborating with numerous clients on AI-focused request for proposals and implementations. The initial surge is anticipated in power-intensive training applications, followed by a rise in inferencing applications, including access to private data sets which are expected to necessitate enhanced performance and reduced latency.\nAdditionally, the intricate nature of these models is necessitating larger capacity blocks, which aligns seamlessly with our extensive product suite. As the global meeting place for data exchange and a full-spectrum provider of data center solutions, Digital Realty stands at a strategic vantage point. This allows us to cater to the needs of enterprises, facilitating their efficient integration of applications within their digital transformation journeys.\nIn the second quarter, we unveiled data gravity index [ 2.0 ] which represents our extended commitment to data science. This tool is designed to assess the effects of enterprise data generation and consumption in both public clouds and private data centers, offering enterprises a framework to manage and drive insights from their data. Moreover, our innovative approaches in Data Gravity and comprehensive data center architecture were recognized as we secured a patent for these. Our patent further offers enterprises a road map to ensure their architectures remain relevant in the future.\nThe evidence is clear we have shifted from a physical economy to a digital economy, which now is entering a new form, the data economy. Our research shows that the surge and server demand can be attributed to the rising needs of both public and private cloud infrastructure further augmented by AI training and inference processes. At the same time, demand for storage devices is poised to grow due to data regulation.\nLet's move to our second quarter results. This quarter continued the inflection in the fundamental recovery we have been highlighting in our core portfolio over the past several quarters. Our pipeline remains strong during the quarter, helping to drive a sequential rebound in leasing volume but also supporting strong pricing with re-leasing spreads positive again across all product types and in all regions.\nNew leasing during the quarter was $114 million, with continued strength in the 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection leasing, which represented 43% of total signings. Greater than a megawatt increased by over 60% sequentially, led by one of our strongest quarters ever in [ EMEA ]. Strong demand trends and reduced availability, along with growing recognition of our value proposition, continue to be supportive of pricing and are enhancing our expected returns.\nIn the second quarter, we saw re-leasing spreads climbed to nearly 7% on a cash basis. helping to drive the best same capital cash NOI growth that we have seen since I joined Digital Realty in 2015. During the second quarter, churn remained low at 1.5%, and we added 133 new customers, our second best quarter ever and a nice continuation of the 100-plus new logos [indiscernible] we have going. This is a strong validation of the stability of enterprise IT spend and digital transformation that we are seeing and of the value that customers recognize in PlatformDIGITAL.\nOur key wins included an innovative sustainability-oriented infrastructure provider that taps into [ stranded ] energy to support module edge compute sites chose Digital Realty for AI applications, utilizing PlatformDIGITAL's network control and data hub solutions. Data-intensive workloads are being deployed on PlatformDIGITAL by a major U.S. federal agency to reduce costs and improve sustainability while interconnecting with their key ecosystem partners.\nA leading European bank chose PlatformDIGITAL to help simplify and secure their hybrid IT strategy in compliance with data sovereignty regulations while leveraging the available cloud connectivity. A Fortune 500 quick-serve restaurant chain is updating their internal infrastructure on PlatformDIGITAL to improve reliability and security, support existing systems and connect with key cloud to support the strong growth of their e-commerce business.\nA Global 2000 pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution services company is expanding to a new [indiscernible] platform digital to ensure global data governance compliance. And a Global 2000 auto manufacturer chose PlatformDIGITAL to upgrade their network architecture in Central Europe by adding key points of presence for the largest and most important production centers.\nMoving over to our largest market, Northern Virginia. In the year since we learned the power constraints in this market, we've continued to work constructively with the power provider to confirm the commitments that we made to our customers and to provide growth capacity for our customers through new development and select churn opportunities.\nOver the course of the last several months, with the support of our local utility partners, we have been able to identify nearly 100 megawatts of incremental billable capacity that we expect to be able to bring to market prior to 2026. This includes 40 megawatts of available capacity underway within the current development pipeline, and the potential to move forward on almost another 60 megawatts.\nIn addition to this, [ Ashburn ] focused capacity, we've made meaningful progress on our 192-megawatt development in [ sight ] in Manassas, which is now nearly in position to begin development. We are optimistic about the near-term potential to offer this availability to our customers.\nMoving on to our investment activity. As we outlined in February, 2023 was poised to be an active year for our investments team and some of the fruit of their labor has been harvested since our last call. During the second quarter, we acquired the land and shell associated with a [ previously leased ] data center in [ Amsterdam ], where we previously held a leasehold interest for $18 million. In a separate future proofing transaction, we purchased additional land adjacent to our highly connected [ Skipple ] campus in [ Amsterdam ] which could support another 40 megawatts of potential IT load, providing ample runway for both enterprise and service provider growth.\nWe also closed on the first noncore [ decision ] of the year in mid-May at a 4.4% cap rate, resulting in $150 million of net proceeds to Digital Realty. This facility was previously leased as a powered shell and was sold to one of its primary occupants.\nIn July, we saw a significant acceleration in our capital recycling initiatives. closing on 2 separate stabilized hyperscale joint ventures in Chicago and [ Ashburn ]. These deals were executed at just over a 6% cash cap rate on average and raised more than $2 billion of net proceeds for Digital Realty. These transactions are an important validation of our current strategy as we remain focused on delivering shareholder value through the development of new data centers at double-digit unlevered returns and the monetization of stabilized hyperscale assets at a premium.\nBut equally as important, we've substantially bolstered and diversified our sources of private capital so that we can execute on the opportunity that lies ahead without being overly reliant on any individual avenue of capital while also increasing the efficiency of our balance sheet.\nWhile we've had remarkable traction on these transactions and all due credit goes to Greg Wright, his top-notch team and the rest of our platform for executing through a tumultuous capital markets environment, we are not resting on our laurels. We are well ahead of our plan on our stabilized hyper sale joint venture plan, but we see ample demand for the hyperscale development joint venture bucket that we have previously discussed and we'll provide updates as appropriate.\nBefore moving on, I'm also delighted to welcome [indiscernible] and [ Reliance ] Industries Company as our newest partner to our joint venture in India. The expanded partnership builds on the strong foundation laid by [ BAM ] Digital Realty, through the addition of [ GEO's ] massive digital connectivity ecosystem and strong enterprise relationships with 80% of large private enterprises in India.\nBefore turning it over to Matt, I'd like to touch on our ESG progress during the quarter. During the second quarter, we issued our fifth annual ESG report outlining our initiatives for 2022. The report highlights the progress we have made toward our science-based targets, commitment to reduce our global carbon emission by 68% by 2030. We've enabled our success by contracting for renewable energy wherever possible so that we have 1 gigawatt of solar and wind energy under contract in the U.S. This has enabled us to match 126 of our data centers with 100% renewable energy.\nIn the second quarter, we also received a certificate of adherence from the climate neutral data center pack. As a founding member of the pack, Digital Realty worked with independent auditors to certify that we are on track to meet the overarching goal of the pack for the industry to become climate neutral by 2030. We remain committed to minimizing Digital Realty's impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders.\nWith that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Matt Mercier.\n\nMatthew R. Mercier\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Andy. Let me jump right into our second quarter results. We signed $114 million of new leases in the second quarter, with broad-based strength across the 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection segment in each region. We leased approximately $50 million in the 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection category, accounting for 43% of total bookings and becoming a larger part of our overall bookings since last year. .\nInterconnection bookings were strong once again at over $12 million, concluding a record 12-month period. 0-1 megawatt bookings, excluding interconnection, were among our strongest ever at $37 million. Digital Realty has come a long way over the past 4 years, more than tripling our bookings in the 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection segment through a combination of organic and inorganic growth. These results demonstrate that our full spectrum strategy is working.\nGreater than the megawatt bookings totaled $61 million in the quarter, a meaningful bounce back from last quarter's timing-oriented pause. EMEA was the standout, including strong contributions from Johannesburg, Paris and [ Marseille ] while we also saw notable strength in Northern Virginia and Tokyo. We also continue to overindex towards CPI-based escalators within our new leases with 35% of the newly signed leases in the quarter contained inflation-linked increases with fixed rate escalators on the balance.\nPricing has improved in many markets. With our largest market, Northern Virginia, seen nearly a doubling of rates over the past year in response to supply constraints. Illustrating the changing tide in [ Ashburn ] during the quarter, we opportunistically took back 8 megawatts of lease capacity from an existing customer and re-leased it to another customer at a substantial premium. The original lease was signed in the first quarter of last year.\nAccordingly, our new leasing for the quarter only represents the uplift in rent achieved versus the prior lease rather than the full annualized value of the new lease. While we have previously tempered enthusiasm around the potential mark-to-market opportunity in Northern Virginia, we are encouraged by this recent transaction and our increased development potential and growing colocation and connectivity offering in this market.\nAside from the shift seen in Northern Virginia, we have also seen an improvement in rates across the Americas as well as in EMEA and APAC. Looking forward, our demand funnel remains healthy with strength across product types and geographies. We expect ongoing and newly approved development capacity to be an important contributor to our growth through next year.\nTurning to our backlog slide. The current backlog of signed but not yet commenced leases was $437 million at quarter end as commencements were once again well over $100 million, balanced by new leasing. We expect the remaining $150 million of commencements in the second half of 2023 to be somewhat evenly weighted between the third and fourth quarters. The lag between signings and commencements in the quarter was 11 months as certain hyperscale customers await build-out completions.\nDuring the second quarter, we signed $211 million of renewal leases with pricing increases of 6.9% on a cash basis, our strongest renewal pricing in 3 years. This strength was shared across both product segments and across our 3 regions, continuing the broad-based improvement we saw last quarter with renewal rates trending over 5% during the first half combined, we are raising our full year guidance for renewal spreads to better reflect the success year-to-date in today's improved fundamental environment.\nRenewal spreads in the 0-1 megawatt category continued to climb for the sixth consecutive quarter to an increase of 4.8% in the second quarter on $133 million of volume. Greater than 1 megawatt renewals were even stronger in the second quarter as cash re-leasing spreads increased by considerable 8.7% on $73 million of renewals, the largest increase within this category since the third quarter of 2019.\nTurning to our operating results. Our operating and financial performance in the second quarter was a bit better than our expectations highlighted by many of the same factors we highlighted last quarter. The continued improvement in our core operating performance, another record quarter of interconnection revenue and well-controlled expenses.\nIn terms of earnings growth, we reported second quarter core FFO of $1.68 per share, 2% better versus the prior quarter and consensus expectations. On a constant currency basis, core FFO was $1.69 per share relative to the $1.72 we reported in the second quarter of 2022.\nTotal revenue was up 20% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The year-over-year revenue growth was impacted by both the inclusion of Teraco this year and the significant volatility in utility costs and reimbursements, particularly in Europe over the past 12 months. Most of these energy costs are directly passed through to our customers. Excluding utility reimbursements, total revenue was up 12% year-over-year.\nCritically, our rental revenues in the second quarter included a $25 million onetime write-off of noncash straight-line rent and the $6 million bad debt reserve related to a tenant that declared bankruptcy during the quarter. We also wrote off $3 million of noncash straight-line rent related to the re-leasing opportunity we executed in Northern Virginia. These write-offs of noncash straight-line rent of approximately $28 million combined are excluded from core FFO per share.\nInterconnection revenue was at a record level in the quarter, increasing by 12% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Excluding Teraco, interconnection revenue was up 8% year-over-year, reflecting the ongoing organic strength in our core footprint. Bookings were higher in all 3 regions and ServiceFabric activations doubled in the quarter.\nOther than utility costs, expenses were well contained as rental property operating expenses and insurance were both flat sequentially, resulting in adjusted EBITDA growth of 14% year-over-year and 4% sequentially.\nImprovement in our stabilized same capital operating performance continued in the second quarter, with year-over-year cash NOI up 5.6% and 1.7% sequentially. This marked the strongest year-over-year growth in our same capital pool since 2014, demonstrating the turn and fundamentals that we have been highlighting. The improvement was driven by an 80 basis point increase in occupancy as commencements outpace churn with upside from rent escalators and stronger-than-expected re-leasing spreads. While we're very encouraged by the improvement we've seen to date in this metric and the trend does indeed appear to be our friend, our enthusiasm for the second half of 2023 is tempered by the uncertainty related to a recent customer bankruptcy filing. We expect to know more about the potential impact by the time we report third quarter results.\nTurning to the balance sheet. As Andy outlined in his remarks, as of this week, we are meaningfully ahead of the funding plan that we laid out for you in February. We have already closed an approximately $2.2 billion of asset sales and stabilized joint ventures and expect to make additional progress on development joint ventures in the second half of this year.\nSpecifically, earlier in July, we closed on the sale of a 65% interest in 2 stabilized hyperscale data centers on our Chicago campus, raising $743 million of gross proceeds. And as announced this afternoon, we sold an 80% interest in 3 stabilized hyperscale data centers on our [ Ashburn ] campus, raising another $1.3 billion of gross proceeds.\nIncluding proceeds from the sale of the noncore asset in Texas, we announced last month, we've raised over $2 billion in capital at a blended average cap rate of just over 6% so far this year. In addition to this capital recycling activity, during the second quarter, we raised $1.1 billion of proceeds from the sale of 11 million shares of equity under our [ ATM ]. Included in this total was approximately 3.5 million shares or $335 million that was structured as forward equity issuance. These shares were settled earlier this week.\nOur reported leverage ratio at the quarter end was 6.8x, while fixed charge coverage was 4.2x. Pro forma for the [ JV ] transactions and the settlement of the forward equity outstanding at quarter end leverage was 6.3x, putting us on track toward our near 6x target by year-end.\nMoving on to our debt profile. Our weighted average debt maturity is nearly 5 years and our weighted average interest rate is 2.7%. Approximately 84% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform. Approximately 83% of our net debt is fixed rate and 97% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling.\nFinally, we have minimal near-term debt maturities with only $100 million maturing during the rest of this year and a well-laddered maturity schedule throughout the out years.\nLastly, let's turn to our guidance. We are affirming our full year revenue guidance range of $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion, an adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.7 billion at the midpoint as the recent acceleration in capital recycling has been balanced by better-than-expected re-leasing spreads and same capital cash NOI. We are, however, adjusting our core FFO and constant currency core FFO per share guidance ranges for the full year 2023 by $0.10 per share to a new range of [ 6.55 to 6.65 ]to reflect the following: $0.03 per share tied to the acceleration of our funding plan, including greater-than-expected stabilized joint venture sales and over $1 billion of equity issuance. $0.05 to $0.07 per share for the write-off of unpaid rent and additional near-term uncertainty related to recent customer bankruptcy and about $0.01 per share of lower noncash straight-line rent tied to the opportunistic termination and re-leasing in Northern Virginia.\nGiven the continued progress on the turn in our fundamentals during the quarter, we are also updating the organic operating metrics supporting our full year guidance, including cash and GAAP re-leasing spreads moving up to greater than 4% and greater than 8%, respectively, An increase in our same capital cash NOI growth guidance by 100 basis points to a revised range of 4% to 5% despite the potential impact of the customer bankruptcy this quarter, partly balanced by a reduction in our year-end portfolio occupancy assumption to 84% to 85%, largely reflecting the greater than anticipated sales of stabilized hyperscale assets into joint ventures.\nGiven the better-than-expected execution on our funding plan to date, we have also updated our guidance for dispositions in [ JV ] capital. We now expect total disposition, a [ JV ] capital raised to fall within the range of our current $2.2 billion, up to $3 billion. We've also reduced the amount of long-term debt financing needed to support our full year funding plan, given the nearly $4 billion of liquidity currently available as a result of asset sales, [ JVs ] and [ ATM ] equity raised.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session?"

Please note, this event is being recorded.\n[Operator Instructions]\nI would like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJordan Sadler\n\nAnalyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Digital Realty's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on today's call are President and CEO, Andy Power; and CFO, Matt Mercier. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Corey Dyer are also on the call, and will be available for Q&A.\nManagement may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nFor a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain certain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website.\nBefore I turn the call over to Andy, let me offer a few key takeaways from our first quarter. First, our customer value proposition is resonating as we delivered yet another strong quarter of nearly $50 million of leasing in our 0-1 plus interconnection segment, including our second strongest quarter of bookings in EMEA and record interconnection bookings, helping to push interconnection revenue over $100 million in the quarter for the first time.\nSecond, the first quarter delivered on the inflection and fundamentals we have guided to for 2023 as demonstrated by 4.5% re-leasing spreads on renewals and a 3.4% increase in stabilized portfolio cash NOI growth.\nAnd, third, we remain confident in our funding plan for 2023. We are deeply engaged in the process with multiple institutional buyers, including new and existing partners and we'll update you on specifics once we finalize the transactions. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Andy Power.\n\nAndrew P. Power\n\nCFO, Digital Realty Trust, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jordan. Thanks to everyone for joining our call. Digital Realty remained focused on our customers and executing our strategic plan while delivering a strong first quarter despite global uncertainty.\nThis included reaching another major milestone with our platform now supporting 5,000 customers worldwide. We posted strong sequential growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO, and remained focused on disciplined capital allocation while benefiting from strong secular trends supporting the data center industry.\nLast quarter, I identified strengthening our customer value proposition as one of our key strategic priorities. Let me expand on this a bit. Digital Realty has been on a journey since 2015 when we acquired Telx to expand our product offering and global footprint in order to provide the full spectrum of data center solutions to our customers.\nAt the time, we said that we were seeking to expand our product mix and presence in the attractive colocation and interconnection space. When we announced that deal, our annual colocation revenues were about $88 million, which is less than the bookings we posted in the last 2 quarters in the 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection segment.\nSince 2015, we've expanded our colocation and connectivity capabilities, both organically and through acquisitions, including the [indiscernible] city portfolio, Interxion, the Westin Building, Altus IT, Lambda Helix, Medallion and Teraco.\nToday, our 0-1 megawatt segment revenues are well over $1 billion and represent 35% of total annualized rent, including a few colo and connectivity oriented organic new market additions that are currently underway and other important subsea cable landing station oriented to facilities.\nWe expect to soon have a presence in more than 30 countries across 6 continents. Importantly, according to [ Cloud City's ] H2 2022 Data Center Ecosystem Leaderboard results, which ranks operators based on their data center footprint and performance with a focus on service providers and cloud owners within their ecosystem, digital Realty ranked in the top 2 slots within North America Europe and LATAM are taking the top spot in the Middle East and Africa region.\nMeanwhile, we've also shed noncore assets, recycled capital out of stabilized core assets and created joint ventures with some of the leading institutions around the world to own, operate and develop data centers. Along the way, we've added connectivity-related product capabilities, such as service exchange, Cloud Connect, and last summer, ServiceFabric, while talking to the additions of cloud owners in our data centers around the world.\nThese initiatives have meaningfully improved our customer value propositions and bolstered our results within the colo and connectivity segment. Since the end of 2015, our interconnection revenue has grown nearly 150%, while our colo and connectivity bookings have increased almost 400%. We now have 214,000 cross connects across our portfolio, an increase of over 250% over the same period.\nBut there is more to do. Our vision is to serve a large and growing customer base that is focused on digital transformation and empowering their business through technological advancements at global scale today, tomorrow and for years to come. To do that, we served the meeting place offering the full spectrum of data center solutions globally, enabling our customers with a colo capacity and connectivity solutions leases to support their hybrid multi-cloud deployments and also providing line of sight to future availability of scale capacity and infrastructure advancements.\nConsistent with our strategic priorities, strengthen our customer value proposition, we are pleased to announce the hiring of Steve Smith as Managing Director of our Americas region. Steve joins us following nearly 8 years at CoreSite, where he most recently served as Chief Revenue Officer.\nSteve's experienced expertise within the colo and connectivity segment in the U.S. will be invaluable as we look to accelerate and enhance the offering in our largest market. We welcome Steve and the team, and look forward to an upcoming start in July.\nLet's move to our first quarter results. This quarter marks an important inflection in the fundamental recovery we have been anticipating in our core portfolio, as re-leasing spreads were positive across all products and in all regions, and scheduled price escalations translated into a positive inflection in our stabilized same capital portfolio growth year-over-year.\nNew leasing during the quarter was $83 million, led by a strong 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection leasing, representing 57% of total signings, helped by the best quarter of interconnection science in company history.\nWe continue to overindex towards CPI-based escalators within our new leases with over 40% of the new [ defined ] leases in the quarter containing inflation length increases with fixed rate escalators on the balance.\nDuring the first quarter, churn remained low at 1.1%, and we added 122 new customers, continuing with the strength of 100 net new logos that we've added in quarter since closing the Interxion transaction.\nRPU wins included a Global 500 pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution services company, who are exiting their legacy data centers and expanding on platform digital to ensure European data governance and compliance; a Global 2000 insurance provider, doing a campus migration from a competing provider. A key differentiator for this new customer was improved resilience over the incumbent provider, together with robust multi-cloud connectivity and expansion capabilities.\nOne of the largest public power companies in the U.S. and a new logo for Digital Realty is leveraging PlatformDIGITAL to modernize its infrastructure with network and control hubs. This company is modernizing its infrastructure to embrace AI, improve analytics, and provide data to its B2B customers.\nOne of the largest [ leasing ] services firms is building a new trading platform with Digital Realty, driving an entirely new ecosystem to capture global trading as it happens. Their requirements include low latency and high performance.\nOne of the largest global retailers also joined PlatformDIGITAL to support its local business presence diversified transit nodes and rearchitect their network topology. Moving over to the power transmission issue in our largest market, Northern Virginia.\nWe've continued to work constructively with the power divider in this market. And last quarter, we were pleased to be able to confirm the commitments that we have made to our customers. While the overarching conditions in this market have changed, We continue to work in partnership with the local providers to maximize potential availability within our 500-plus megawatt footprint.\nAnd we remain cautiously optimistic that we uniquely will be able to provide growth capacity for our customers in this market through new development and select churn opportunities. For now, Ashburn remains highly constrained and pricing is reflecting the decreased availability of data center capacity.\nMoving on to our investment activity. During the first quarter, we acquired a 3-acre parcel win in Osaka, Japan, through our AMT Digital Realty joint venture to support future development. We also monetized the 10% interest in the data center in Ashburn, Virginia, in the quarter alongside our joint venture partner.\nWhile the transaction was driven by our partner and is not a meaningful component of our capital recycling plan for 2023, it did indeed demonstrate the appetite for well-located data centers and strong valuations. This asset was sold at a valuation of nearly $17 million per megawatt which represents a substantial premium to our development cost today for new data centers in this market and significant value creation.\nGiven the ongoing process that we are undertaking to bolster our capital sources and increase the efficiency of our balance sheet, we remain confident in the institutional appetite to invest in data centers.\nNotably, over the course of the last few weeks, we have seen the announcement of the sale of a European hyperscale data center platform to a well-known global institutional investor on multiples that are consistent with where similar platforms have traded over the last few years.\nAnd we have witnessed the recapitalization of another data center platform by other institutional investors. We know that investors are eager to hear updates on our progress, and we will provide those once we have a transaction to announce. Since our IPO in 2004, concerns have been periodically raised about various potential risks to data centers, including technology, customers, demand, supply and obsolescence.\nThis is somewhat par for the course for a relatively nascent and growing asset class. Over the last year or so, we have witnessed the latest misinformation campaign cast upon the data center sector by those interested in seeing the price of our stock goes down.\nI'd like to clarify a few important points. First, we operate a global portfolio of carrier-neutral and cloud-neutral data centers to facilitate communication and the exchange of information and data among and between enterprises, service providers and individuals all over the world.\nWhile we are focused on building what we call the meeting place for service providers and enterprise customers who are in pursuit of hybrid multi-cloud end-of-state IT architectures, we are also facilitating the connectivity and communities of interest supporting latency-sensitive applications and platforms.\nThese are things that cannot happen in a stand-alone on-prem data center and aren't serviceable by a single cloud service provider. Second, and conscious of the amendment that hyperscalers have forced prices lower, after a few years of negative same-store growth, the tide is turning. As the supply of data center capacity in the low-cost abundant capital environment that exists for the [indiscernible] [ 10 ] years, has slowed meaningfully now that rates are higher and capital is more precious.\nWith continued robust demand, strong net absorption is [indiscernible] vacancy lower, which has been supportive of data center rents. Accordingly, our re-leasing spreads have inflected positively as have our same capital core growth metrics.\nOur team delivered on our objectives in the first quarter, and we reiterate the recoveries we anticipate for these metrics for 2023. Lastly, despite plans almost a year ago that hyperscalers would soon resource their data center requirements, 2022 was a record leasing year for Digital Realty, partly driven by demand from hyperscale customers.\nWe believe the demand from these and other customers within our pipeline, driven by digital transformation and soon artificial intelligence remains robust. Data center support the growth and evolution of technology that is improving our standard of living, productivity and the overall quality of our lives.\nWe have now [indiscernible] a meaningful and sustained pullback in demand in the nearly 20 years that we've been in business, and we are not seeing a pullback today. While an economic recession could slow capital spending, third-party data centers also benefit from the trend towards outsourcing.\nCustomers often make the decision to lease rather than build on the availability of capital tenants. We saw the same thing during the great financial crisis. For many of our customers, data centers can also help drive revenue growth will facilitate lower costs or even enhance overall productivity.\nWe are optimistic that our business will remain resilient in 2023 and for years to come. Before turning it over to Matt, I'd like to touch on our ESG progress during the quarter. During the first quarter, a leading ESG ratings provider included Digital Realty in their 2023 top-rated ESG company list, noting that we are in the top 6.5% of companies in the U.S. and Canada region.\nIn addition, Digital Realty continues its efforts to incorporate renewable energy resources. We were named by the United States Environmental Protection Agency as one of the EPA's Top 25 Green Power Partners. We furthered our commitment to sustainability by signing a 10-year power purchase agreement for 115-megawatt share of a new solar project in Germany to increase our total solar and wind power under contract to over 1 gigawatt of renewable capacity.\nSubsequent to quarter end, we announced additional renewable to support our portfolio in Australia, while our business in Japan also announced renewable procurement for a portion of its portfolio. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Matt Mercier.\n\nMatthew R. Mercier\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Andy. Let me jump right into our first quarter results. We signed a total of $83 million of new leases in the first quarter, highlighted by a second consecutive quarterly record in interconnection signings and continued strength in the 0-1 megawatt category, particularly in EMEA, which nearly matched the record level from last quarter.\n0-1 megawatt plus interconnection accounted for a robust 57% of total bookings. Our greater than a megawatt bookings moderated to $35 million in the quarter. Though this activity was broadly dispersed throughout our global portfolio with leases signed in Toronto, the U.S., Mexico, Europe and South Africa, but nothing in Northern Virginia.\nThese deals can be lumpy and the downtick in the greater than a megawatt leasing follows a record year in 2022, in which we signed more than $370 million and 288 megawatts of new leases. Importantly, our demand funnel remains quite strong as a number of our highly strategic customers remain actively engaged and are seeking to add capacity across our global portfolio.\nOf course, as we have discussed on the last few calls, our largest scale market, Northern Virginia, is experiencing capacity constraints as a result of the power transmission issues that emerged last summer.\nOver the course of the last 3 years, including the second half of 2022, we signed approximately $20 million per quarter of new leases in Northern Virginia, versus $2.5 million of new leases signed in this market in 1Q '23. As I'll expand on in a moment, we expect the ballast to lower new lease volume to show up in better pricing including renewal spreads.\nTurning to our backlog slide. The current backlog of signed but not yet commenced leases was $434 million at quarter end, as commencements were once again well over $100 million, partly balanced by new leasing.\nWe expect the remaining $200-plus million of commencements in 2023 to be somewhat evenly weighted throughout the balance of the year. The lag between signings and commencements in the quarter was 16 months, principally due to a few larger long-term leases that require buildouts.\nDuring the first quarter, we signed $155 million of renewal leases with pricing increases of 4.5% on a cash basis, our strongest renewal pricing quarter since the early days of the pandemic. The strength was shared across both products and also across our 3 regions.\nSo we're off to a good start relative to our full year 2023 guidance. Renewal spreads in the 0-1 megawatt category continued accelerating up 4.6% in the first quarter on $118 million of volume, nearly 400 basis points faster than it was in the final quarter of 2021, but also more than 100 basis points better than full year 2022.\nGreater than a megawatt renewals were similarly strong in the first quarter, as cash re-leasing spreads increased by 4.4% on $30 million of renewals. We were also pleased to see 100% of the leases signed in the quarter roll up in this category, and we remain optimistic about the potential for the rest of this year.\nTurning to our operating results. Our performance in the first quarter was a bit better than our expectations, highlighted by the continued improvement in our core operating performance, higher development returns and a record quarter in interconnection revenue.\nIn terms of earnings growth, we reported first quarter core FFO of $1.66 per share, $0.01 better versus prior quarter and a $0.01 light relative to last year. On a constant currency basis, core FFO was $1.69 per share relative to the $1.67 we reported in the first quarter of 2022.\nTotal revenue was up 19% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. As discussed on the last call, this revenue growth is somewhat distorted due to the significant increases in utility costs and reimbursements as the impact of last year's energy price increases went into full effect in January.\nAs most of you understand, the large majority of energy costs are directly passed through to our customers. Excluding utility reimbursements, total revenue was up 13% year-over-year and 4% sequentially.\nThe while reimbursements remained a relatively consistent percentage of utility expenses at 92%. Due to a decline in spot energy prices between the fourth and first quarters, our top line revenue, including utility reimbursements from our customers, was more than $40 million below our original forecast, but this was directly mirrored by lower-than-expected utility expenses, since these expenses are directly borne by our customers.\nInterconnection revenue was up 5% sequentially, reflecting the ongoing improvement in our core operating performance. Other than utilities, expenses were well contained as NOI margins, excluding utilities, remained steady, resulting in adjusted EBITDA growth of 10% year-over-year and 4% sequentially.\nOn our last 2 calls, we've highlighted the improvement in operating performance that started to emerge with our stabilized same capital portfolio, but was largely masked by FX headwinds. These positive trends strengthened further in the first quarter despite continued year-over-year currency headwinds.\nSame-capital cash NOI grew 3.4% in the first quarter compared to 1Q '22, demonstrating the turn in our core operations that we have been discussing. The step-up was driven by a 90 basis point improvement in same-store occupancy as commencements outpace churn, upside from annual rent escalators and the benefit of positive re-leasing spreads.\nTurning to our currency slide, 51% of our first quarter operating revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars, with 25% in euros, 6% in British pounds, 5% in Singapore dollars, 3% in South African rand and 2% in each of the Brazilian real and Japanese yen.\nThe weakening of the U.S. dollar in the first quarter provided a slight sequential tailwind, but the dollar's strength through much of 2022 resulted in a continued headwind to year-over-year results. As a result, the dollar strength negatively impacted our reported revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA growth by about 300 basis points apiece on a year-over-year basis, whereas core FFO per share saw just under 200 basis points headwind.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Our reported leverage ratio at quarter end was 7.1x, while fixed charge coverage was 4.4x. In January, we completed a $740 million 2-year term loan with an initial maturity date at March 31, 2025, plus a 1-year extension option and an effective rate of 5.6%.\nLeverage remains above our historical average and our long-term target, and we intend to reduce our leverage toward our long-term target over the course of 2023. Our plan hasn't changed. We are in active discussions on our asset sale and joint venture plans and remain confident in our ability to execute on these plans over the course of the year so that our leverage moves back towards the 6x area by year-end.\nOur weighted average debt maturity is at 5 years, and our weighted average coupon is 2.8%. Approximately 82% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar-denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform. Over 80% of our net debt is fixed rate and 97% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling.\nFinally, we have minimal near-term debt maturities with only $100 million maturing in 2023, together with a well-laddered maturity schedule. Lastly, let's turn to our guidance. We are maintaining our core FFO and constant currency core FFO per share guidance ranges for the full year 2023 of $6.65 to $6.75.\nAnd our first quarter results were consistent with this range. We are also affirming our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance of [ $2.7 billion ] at the midpoint as the downward adjustment in our overall revenue guidance is purely due to lower utility expenses driven by lower spot electricity rates that are passed on directly to our customers.\nWe are also modestly tweaking our year to U.S. dollar exchange rate expectations for the year to reflect the relative appreciation of the euro year-to-date. We also made meaningful progress on the turn in our fundamentals during the quarter, providing strong support to the organic operating metrics supporting our full year guidance, including cash and GAAP re-leasing spreads over 3%, same-capital cash NOI growth of 3% to 4% and year-end portfolio occupancy between 85% and 86%.\nAs I mentioned a few moments ago, we remain confident in our funding plan for the year. So we have reiterated our guidance for dispositions and JV capital. We have tweaked our debt financing cost expectation to be consistent with the move in rate seen since the banking sector fall out last month, which will be largely mitigated by the upside we saw versus our core FFO expectation the first quarter. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session?"

Please note, this event is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Jordan, please go ahead.\n\nJordan Sadler\n\nSVP of Public & Private IR, Digital Realty Trust, Inc.\n\nThank you, Andrea, and welcome, everybody, to Digital Realty's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on today's call are President and CEO, Andy Power; and CFO, Matt Mercier. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Corey Dyer, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A.\nManagement may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website.\nBefore I turn the call over to Andy, let me offer a few key takeaways from our fourth quarter. First, the combination of strong demand and tightening levels of supply are translating into broad-based price improvements, which is reflected in the increased re-leasing spread expectations and the positive inflection stabilized NOI growth that we are forecasting for 2023. Second, we remain focused on achieving the highest potential returns on investment, and some progress on this front is evident in the sequential improvement in our development pipeline yields. And third, as most of you already know, we've made some changes to our management team since we last reported. Andy and Matt both have a long history with Digital, and as expected, the transition has been seamless. But just as important, they also bring fresh perspective and energy to their new roles, and the team remains excited about the opportunity that lies ahead.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Andy Power.\n\nAndrew P. Power\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Digital Realty Trust, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. While my voice is probably pretty familiar to most of you, this is my first earnings call as CEO of Digital Realty. I'm honored to lead Digital Realty's incredible global team, and I'm as optimistic and excited as ever about the opportunity that lies ahead. I want to thank both the Board for their confidence in me and the support that they provide in executing our strategy and thank Bill Stein, who I first met in 2004 as we worked together on Digital's IPO, for his leadership over these many years. Finally, I want to thank the numerous customers, partners, team members and shareholders for the kind words of support and encouragement that I've received over the past 2 months.\nWhen I joined Digital in 2015, we are primarily a North American scale data center provider. Since then, we've evolved the company to be a global provider of the full spectrum of scale, colocation and interconnection solutions to better serve the growing needs of our 4,000-plus customers. Today, Digital is the global data center leader with an unmatched footprint of over 300 data centers in over 50 metro areas in 28 countries on 6 continents. Globally, our portfolio comprises of more than 2.3 gigawatts of IT load, and we have another 400-plus megawatts under construction. I'm extremely proud of the success that we've had and the position that we are in. But now is not the time to rest on our laurels as the path that has brought us to where we are today will not get us to where we want to be.\nIn that vein, we've swiftly taken action on a few fronts. First, we quickly backfilled the role of CFO with my long-time finance partner, Matt Mercier. Matt has played a leadership role across Digital's global finance organization for well over a decade, including the successful integration of multiple platform acquisitions and the implementation of systems that will provide the foundation for our operations and evolving strategy.\nSecond, we aligned and combined our strategy of business segments and investments team to assure that we have the right capabilities and are making the right investments in order to deliver the global meeting place for service providers and enterprises.\nThird, we moved to align all technology under our Chief Technology Officer, including our CECO and our recently appointed Chief Information Officer, which will support the acceleration of our journey and identity as both a technology and a real estate company. Recent product launches, including ServiceFabric, demonstrate the potential of bringing together innovation and technology to help drive our customers' growth.\nLastly, we further streamlined our global operations' capabilities to maximize the potential of Digital Realty's 300-plus data centers and our people under the trusted hand of a long-time digital leader with a track record of bringing global teams together. And here's what's next on the agenda in terms of the top strategic priorities.\nFirst, as depicted on Slide 3, we will demonstrably; strengthen our customer value proposition. Through the continued execution of our meeting place strategy by delivering sustainable, connectivity-rich solutions to our enterprise and service provider customers, which will translate into better organic growth over the medium and long term.\nAlong these lines, yesterday, we announced a new AWS Direct Connect on-ramp at Digital Realty's Ashburn campus, landing one of the highest consumption markets and adding coast-to-coast U.S. coverage to our robust existing portfolio of AWS Direct Connect locations across EMEA. And earlier this month, we advanced our commitment to sustainability with a new 10-year power purchase agreement for 116 megawatts of renewable energy, supporting the construction of a new solar park in Germany.\nSecond, we are integrating and innovating our capabilities across our entire unmatched global asset portfolio and have topped the largest open network platform in the world. Many of these integration and innovation efforts will benefit both our customers as they seek to deploy new and complex workloads on the leading data center platform and our own internal team, unifying our ability to deliver value to the market.\nLastly, many of you are familiar with my many fishing poles in the water mantra. And in this vein, we plan to further diversify and bolster our sources of capital in order to support our customers' rapidly growing digital infrastructure needs while improving capital efficiency and returns for Digital Realty investors.\nThe opportunity before us is tremendous. We have all the key ingredients at our fingertips and a long runway for growth. When I assess the digital infrastructure landscape today, including its fundamental prospects and then how Digital Realty is positioned within this sector, I'd say the following. First, demand for our product remains quite strong and well supported by ongoing digital transformation, migration to the cloud, and the overall evolution towards centralized compute.\nAs it goes, technology begets technology, and the growth in high-performance compute infrastructure has driven innovation that tends to spur the next wave of growth in technology that in many respects, advances productivity and hopefully, over time, driving improvement to the overall quality of our lives. While the demand drivers we have enjoyed for the last decade continue, we may now be on the precipice of the next wave of demand that will drive our sector for the next decade. For years, we have referenced new technology like artificial intelligence and machine learning as potential drivers of demand, but there have been relatively few identifiable workloads or specific infrastructure requirements tied to those specific technologies.\nThe launch of ChatGPT 3.0 is a seemingly important milestone. Microsoft's incorporation of ChatGPT in the Bing last week, Google's coming launch of Bard, and Baidu's ERNIE Bot all suggest that we are on the forefront of the broader introduction of AI, which could spawn a wave of adoption and a proliferation of use cases and ultimately drive demand for compute infrastructure at scale.\nThis is our domain expertise. We are in the very early days of this technology and its potential and have yet to see the effects of its introduction in the data center sector, but we are well positioned to support our customers and partners, and we are working diligently to understand how their requirements will evolve and making sure to incorporate these into our latest designs.\nImportantly, as we experienced with the cloud, the advent of new technology can play out over a very extended time frame. We have built Digital Realty with these time frames in mind and plan to be there to support our existing and growing customer base across the globe in the future.\nLet's move to the quarter. Our core FFO landed within the implied guidance range that we provided last quarter as the turn that is taking shape in our core portfolio continued to gain momentum. Capping off another record year of bookings, new leases signed moderated from the record we achieved in the prior quarter, but remained quite strong and were highlighted by a nice rebound in our 0-1 megawatt segment and record interconnection bookings.\nDemand was geographically broad-based with strong contributions from APAC, the Americas and EMEA. This demonstrates the breadth and momentum that we are seeing in this business, which is a reflection of our ongoing effort to deliver the meeting place for our service provider and enterprise customers. During the fourth quarter, we added 106 new customers, continuing the streak of 100-plus new logos that we've added each quarter since closing the Interxion transaction nearly 3 years ago.\nOne of our key wins during the fourth quarter was an expansion of our relationship with Avnet, a leading global technology distributor and solution provider and a member of the Fortune 500. Avnet Integrated has standardized on PlatformDIGITAL for an initial 3 market deployment in Northern Virginia, Dallas and Silicon Valley. This partnership enables high-performance, cost-effective computing solutions that can be deployed quickly in Digital Realty facilities globally while mitigating risk and complexity.\nA major global automotive manufacturer deploying internationally chose PlatformDIGITAL, leveraging Digital Realty's unrivaled global footprint and ability to manage complex deployments. Four of the world's largest financial institutions, including 3 of the 10 largest in Europe, selected PlatformDIGITAL, seeking network-oriented solutions ranging from hybrid IT, trading and market data support to high-performance computing and more. A leading global asset manager and service provider leveraged Digital Realty's HPE GreenLake alliance to significantly reduce network and IT infrastructure complexity.\nImportantly, pricing on new leases signed increased yet again in the fourth quarter in each of our business segments, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of price improvements in 2022. We also continue to add more CPI-based escalators with approximately 25% of the newly signed leases in the quarter containing inflation-linked increases with fixed rate escalators on the balance. We also saw another quarter of positive leasing spreads on renewals in the fourth quarter, helping to support a positive inflection for the full year 2022.\nWhile we acknowledge that the turn was driven by the strength in the 0-1 megawatt renewals, we are beyond the point of excuses and call-offs and prefer to highlight the forest rather than the trees and point to the overall inflection in market rents and re-leasing spreads that took place in 2022 as a whole. We expect market conditions to remain supportive this year, and our guidance reflects a further inflection in this positive trend as Matt will lay out in a few minutes.\nSpeaking of better pricing, I'd like to provide an update on our largest market in Northern Virginia. We've continued to work constructively with the power provider in this market, and we are now pleased to be in a position to say that we fully expect to be able to deliver on the commitments that we've made to our customers within our development pipeline. So while conditions are far from business as usual in this market, we are encouraged by the progress made over the last 90 days and remain hopeful that we will continue to be able to work with a local utility provider to support the growing needs of our mutual customers.\nMoving on to our investment activity. During the fourth quarter, we sold a 25% interest in a data center in Frankfurt, Germany to Digital Core REIT. The facility was valued at nearly $500 million, and the transaction generated about $150 million of proceeds for Digital Realty. We also acquired land in 5 different metros for future development, including 2 organic new market entries into Rome and Accra. Rome is one of the largest cities in Europe by population, but has been essentially ignored by international data center providers. We've acquired a parcel within 15 kilometers off the coast that will make it an ideal interconnection point for future subsea cables that land in Rome, thereby, enhancing our position in the Mediterranean while serving as a connectivity hub in the middle of the country.\nBefore turning it over to Matt, I'd like to reiterate my focus on ESG and share some of our recent progress with you. We were recognized by a variety of organizations for our ESG success, including, for the sixth consecutive year, Digital was recognized by Nareit with the Leader in the Light Award for data center sustainability. Sustainalytics recently included Digital Realty in the 2023 top-rated ESG company list. Newsweek recently named Digital as one of America's most responsible companies for 2023. And once again, Digital is one of the JUST Capital's most just companies.\nIn addition to these awards, given the importance of energy security, availability and sustainability, Digital remains keenly focused on supporting the development of renewable power projects. During 2022, we contracted for a total of 470 megawatts of renewable energy, adding green access to the energy grid. And we already added another 160 megawatts of solar power to our portfolio in 2023. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders.\nBefore I turn it over to our new CFO to review our financial results, let me introduce Matt Mercier to those of you who don't already know him. Matt joined Digital in 2006 and has been my right-hand man, helping me run Digital's finance team. Matt has been intimately involved in nearly every facet of finance at Digital from capital markets to M&A, FP&A, IR and all things global finance.\nWith that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to our new CFO, Matt Mercier.\n\nMatthew Mercier\n\nCFO, Digital Realty Trust, Inc.\n\nThank you, Andy. I'm privileged to succeed Andy as CFO and humbled by the opportunity to lead an incredibly capable team. Over the years, I've had a chance to meet and spend time with many of you, and I look forward to catching up with all of you over the course of the next several months at industry conferences and events that we are slated to attend.\nLet me jump right into our fourth quarter results. We signed a total of $117 million of new leases in the fourth quarter, highlighted by a strong rebound in our 0-1 megawatt segment and record interconnection signings, which accounted for 40% of total bookings. Demand was geographically diverse, particularly within the greater than a megawatt segment, which saw nearly even contributions across the Americas, EMEA and APAC regions. 9 of our 10 largest deals in the quarter landed outside of North America, with strong contributions from Japan, South Africa, Latin America and Europe, demonstrating the increasingly global nature of our footprint and customer base.\nAt the other end of the scale, somewhat in contrast to the hesitation we noted on our last call, we saw a nice bounce back within our smallest customer segment under 500 kilowatts, which delivered the second best quarterly leasing volume of 2022 at the highest average rate seen all year. Geographically, our 0-1 megawatt deals play to our strengths in EMEA and the Americas, with EMEA setting a quarterly record for 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection bookings. Importantly, pricing on new leases signed increased for the fourth consecutive quarter in each of our 0-1 and greater than a megawatt segments, reflecting improving fundamentals and tightening conditions across our regions.\nIn the fourth quarter, we experienced nearly 90% customer retention and a further reduction in churn to just 0.8%, marking the lowest level in nearly 3 years, as our customers' digital infrastructure requirements continue to increase, but the prospect of future availability is decreasing.\nTurning to our backlog. On Page 9, the current backlog of signed but not yet commenced leases increased to a record $477 million at year-end, principally due to the inclusion of Teraco as other signings were largely offset by commencements. The lag between signings and commencements moderated slightly in the quarter, but remained elevated relative to historical levels at nearly 15 months due to a few larger longer-term leases that require build-outs. Approximately 60% of our record backlog is slated to commence throughout this year, split fairly evenly throughout the first and second halves.\nMoving on to Page 10. We signed $195 million of renewal leases during the fourth quarter with pricing increases of 0.8% on a cash basis. For the full year, we renewed nearly $700 million of existing business at a 1.8% increase on a cash basis, a touch better than our upwardly revised guidance of slightly positive for 2022. Renewal rates in the fourth quarter for 0-1 megawatt renewals remained strong across each of our 3 regions and were up 4.1% overall, the strongest quarterly increase since adding interaction.\nAs Andy referenced, we did see a 3.6% decline on renewals in the greater than a megawatt category in the quarter, entirely due to a single lease at a single asset. However, we saw a better-than-anticipated improvement in market rents and an inflection in re-leasing spreads in 2022. More importantly, market conditions improved throughout the last year, and our guidance for 2023 reflects this positive trend.\nTurning to our results. Digital Realty delivered operating and financial performance in the fourth quarter that was largely consistent with our expectations, highlighted by improving core operating performance, progress toward enhancing our returns on investment and increased liquidity.\nLet's jump into the metrics on Page 11. In terms of earnings growth, we reported fourth quarter core FFO per share of $1.65, consistent with the low end of our implied guidance range for the fourth quarter and down 1% on both a sequential and year-over-year basis, given a seasonal acceleration in operating expenses, a significant uptick in interest rates and a full quarter's dilution associated with the acquisition of Teraco on August 1.\nOn a constant currency basis, core FFO was down 1% sequentially, but was up 2% year-over-year. For the full year 2022, we reported constant currency core FFO per share of $6.91, representing 6% growth over 2021. The improvement in operating performance is best gauged by our stabilized same-capital portfolio, which was challenged in the first half of the year, but improved meaningfully in the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter when stripping out the noise related to FX.\nFocusing on top line, data center revenue growth on a constant currency basis improved steadily throughout 2022, increasing by 4% year-over-year in the fourth quarter compared to a 1.8% decline in the first quarter, demonstrating the turn in our core operations that we flagged last quarter. The sequential step-up from 3Q to 4Q was largely driven by an 80 basis point improvement in occupancy as commencements outpace churn as well as the benefit of positive re-leasing spreads and growing interconnection revenues.\nTurning to our currency slide on Page 12. 56% of our fourth quarter operating revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars, with 20% in euros, 7% in British pounds, 6% in Singapore dollars and 2% in Japanese yen. The U.S. dollar reversed course from the strength we have seen throughout the first 9 months of the year, removing the headwind on reported sequential growth. Nevertheless, the dollar was meaningfully stronger than it was versus 2021, negatively impacting our reported revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA growth by approximately 500 basis points a piece.\nTurning to the balance sheet on Page 13. Our reported leverage ratio at quarter end was 6.9x, while fixed charge coverage was at 4.9x. Given the sharp recovery in the euro and the pound in the fourth quarter and the convention of how leverage is calculated with the average exchange rate used for calculated adjusted EBITDA and the spot rate used to mark our debt at year-end, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was inflated by approximately 0.2 turns. Using the average exchange rate to mark our debt at year-end, our leverage would be 6.7x net debt to adjusted EBITDA.\nSince our last call, we drew the remaining $500 million outstanding from our 2021 forward equity offering and tapped our 5.55% 2028 notes for an additional $350 million to bring the total amount raised on that bond to $900 million. Since year-end, we also closed a $740 million 2-year term loan with a 1-year extension option. It's also worth mentioning that our investment-grade credit ratings were affirmed with stable outlooks by all 3 rating agencies since our last call.\nWhile leverage is above our historical average and our long-term target, we have bolstered our liquidity, and we intend to reduce leverage towards our long-term target over the course of 2023. Our weighted average debt maturity is over 5 years, and our weighted average coupon is 2.7%. Approximately 86% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar-denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform. Over 80% of our net debt is fixed rate and 97% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, we have minimal near-term debt maturities with only $100 million maturing in 2023, together with a well-laddered maturity schedule.\nLastly, let's turn to our guidance on Page 14. We have provided an initial core FFO per share guidance range for the full year 2023 of $6.65 to $6.75, reflecting flat growth at the midpoint of the range, as the recovery in our stabilized portfolio is balanced by the impact of higher interest expense and capital recycling. Focusing in on the organic recovery we forecast for 2023, we expect cash and GAAP re-leasing spreads to improve to greater than 3%, same-capital cash NOI growth of 3% to 4% and an 80 basis point uplift in total portfolio occupancy at the midpoint of our expected range by year-end.\nImportantly, as Andy referenced at the outset, one of our key priorities is to further diversify and bolster our capital sources, which is geared toward increasing our capital efficiency and investment returns while reducing leverage toward our long-term target. As reflected in this guidance, throughout 2023, we expect to recycle capital from a combination of noncore dispositions, joint ventures of core assets and joint ventures of scale development in select core markets. In addition, we expect to benefit from high single-digit adjusted EBITDA growth, the retention of free cash flow and the moderation of recent currency headwinds.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session?"

One important item to note this quarter, while Teraco's results are consolidated into our financial statements since closing on August 1, we have excluded the platform's contribution from leasing backlog and other portfolio statistics that will be cited on this call and within our third quarter earnings materials.\nBefore I turn the call over to Bill, let me offer a few key takeaways from our third quarter. First, we achieved another quarter of record bookings, led by robust demand within the greater than a megawatt segment. Second, the signs of improvement in our core portfolio continued to emerge in the quarter with 120 basis point sequential improvement and base data center revenues on a constant currency basis. Third, with the closing on our investment in Teraco, we cemented our position as a leading provider of colocation and connectivity in South Africa. And lastly, our management team guided by decades of experience remains focused on navigating the current environment and maximizing the opportunity that lies before us.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Stein.\n\nArthur William Stein\n\nCEO & Director, Digital Realty Trust, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jordan, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call. The world has experienced significant change so far in 2022, and Digital Realty is adapting to that change. Our business continues to be levered to powerful long-term secular demand trends, broadly driven by ongoing digital transformation and the growth in IT and data as our record leasing results underscore.\nWe also have an unmatched global operating footprint that is supported by a strong development pipeline that allows us to capture opportunities wherever they may emerge. As you all understand, global capital markets have become extraordinarily volatile and interest rates have risen sharply from historic lows to levels that we have not seen since 2008.\nAt the same time, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against the euro to levels not seen in nearly 20 years. While you've had to look back over 30 years to find the last time the dollar was this elevated against the pound or the yen. This volatility is being driven by a number of factors from a global economy emerging from the pandemic to the war in Ukraine and of course, the heightened resolve of central bankers to tap down on elevated global inflation.\nAnd while the underlying fundamentals of our business remain strong and fortune can indeed favor the brave, experience has taught us that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. And we feel that it is most prudent today to adapt to the current environment by: one, prioritizing and sharpening the lens through which we view new investments to ensure that we are focused on the most strategic transactions that offer the highest potential risk-adjusted returns; two, by pressing our newly gained advantage on pricing and improving our internal growth profile and the longer-term durability of our cash flows; and three, by enhancing liquidity to ensure that we have the capital to meet the commitments that we have made to our customers while maintaining a comfortable cushion.\nWith over 300 data centers around the world and a revenue base of over $4.5 billion, Digital Realty remains focused on how to best position ourselves for the long run. Our third quarter results were strong with a record $176 million of new bookings, making the third time in the past 4 quarters that our bookings have exceeded $150 million.\nCore FFO per share was $1.67 despite stiff FX and interest rate headwinds. On a constant currency basis, we see evidence of the turn that is starting to take shape in our core portfolio.\nDigital Realty's global platform enables us to capture demand wherever it emerges. North America was the standout this quarter with our largest deals landing in the region. Multinational companies are using platform digital to enable digital transformation across multiple regions and metros globally. A good example of this is a large multisite enterprise build-to-suit transaction signed with a top 5 financial services company that was inked in the quarter.\nLooking ahead, sales activity remains healthy as the secular trends driving data center demand remain in place. Enterprises continue their digital transformation with a growing preference for hybrid cloud architecture while cloud and connectivity providers continue to expand their infrastructure to better serve their customers around the world.\nBut the world is changing. We are seeing sales cycle lengthen and global uncertainty extends decision times. Importantly, we are pushing prices higher to reflect tightening supply and rising costs. Admittedly, some of the deals this quarter have been in process for many months and do not fully reflect today's environment.\nToday, new leases are being priced to reflect current market conditions. And while this will likely be in an iterative process, we expect the strong secular trends driving demand toward third-party data centers to continue for years to come. Andy will provide further color on our results and our outlook shortly.\nDuring the third quarter, we successfully completed the acquisition of a majority interest in Teraco, a leading carrier and cloud-neutral data center and interconnection services provider in South Africa. Teraco is a gem. With 7 data centers across 3 metros and robust interconnectivity including more than 22,000 cross connects, 7 cloud on-ramps and direct access to 7 subsea cables with more on the way. Teraco co has plenty of room to expand and is expected to generate some of the best growth within our portfolio.\nTeraco uniquely enhances our position in EMEA, complementing our existing operations in Eastern Africa through iColo, Western Africa through Medallion and in Europe and the Mediterranean with Interxion, Altus IT, Lamda Hellix and our newest JV with Mivne in Israel. These are all highly connected assets that leverage subsea cable landing and brings the world closer together, linking Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa.\nConsistent with that strategy, we recently acquired land on the Greek island of Crete to create an interconnection hub in the Eastern Mediterranean to complement our existing hub in Marseille, along with developing hubs in Barcelona and Israel, which will feed additional traffic into Greece, the Balkans, Turkey and Northern Africa. We expect that this highly differentiated project will generate strong double-digit returns while enhancing the value of our existing facilities in the region.\nMoving to our dispositions in the quarter. We sold a noncore mixed-use data center property in Dallas for $206 million and reached an agreement with digital core REIT to sell a 25% interest in our Frankfurt data center campus for $140 million with an option to acquire up to 90% of the same campus plus a 90% share of one of our Dallas data centers in a larger transaction's valued at approximately $750 million. Both transactions are subject to unitholder approval with a vote expected for November.\nFunding organic new market entry through the disposition of stabilized facilities is our preferred source of capital. It enables us to leverage platform digital to capitalize on value creation opportunities and harvest capital once those facilities have stabilized.\nWe also favor joint ventures like the one in Israel, where we leverage the local knowledge and expertise of our partner and pair that with PlatformDIGITAL to expand our global footprint and to better serve our customers.\nBefore turning it over to Andy, I'd like to update you on our ESG success shown on Page 3 of our earnings presentation. We were honored to be recognized by GRESB as the sector leader for technology and science category in the Americas for the second consecutive year, maintaining our 5-star rating from this leading investor-driven ESG benchmarking organization. We are proud of our ESG-related efforts. And while the awards and recognition are nice, we are focused on ESG because our customers demand it, and because quite simply, it is the right thing to do. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.\n\nAndrew P. Power\n\nPresident & CFO, Digital Realty Trust, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bill. Turning to Page 5. As Bill noted, we signed record bookings of $176 million, with a $13 million contribution from interconnection during the third quarter, excluding the results from Teraco. The greater than a megawatt business in the Americas was the big driver of this quarter's record leasing at nearly $100 million signed. Sub-1 megawatt plus interconnection accounted for 24% of the record quarterly bookings while the shell portion of a large multisite enterprise build-to-suit deal fell into our other category.\nImportantly, as we've discussed, we have meaningfully shifted our cadence toward further insulating our portfolio from the effects of inflation through the addition of CPI-based escalators into our new leases. While more than 95% of our portfolio includes rent escalation causes, less than 20% are specifically tied to CPI, while the balance are fixed. And our highest leasing volume quarter ever, we were able to achieve CPI-based escalators on 40% of the leases signed in the quarter, which demonstrates our resolve and our customers' acknowledgment of this important factor. The balance of our leases signed in 3Q include fixed rent escalators.\nMoving on to markets. In North America, Portland and Dallas were particularly strong with large deals landing in each of those metros, while demand in Northern Virginia also remained high. In EMEA, totals were consistent with expectations with particular strength in Paris. While São Paulo led in LATAM, and Osaka led the APAC region. These deals drove additional starts within our development pipeline, which grew to over 400 megawatts, but is also now more than 60% pre-leased mitigating much of the risk related to this capital spend and providing significant visibility into future revenue.\nAs Bill touched on in his remarks, we signed 4 leases in the quarter with a large multinational financial services customer that has fully embarked upon its digital transformation journey. This large multi-site, multi-market build-to-suit transaction drove the upside in our greater than 1 megawatt North America leasing and also served to increase our development pipeline sequentially while reducing our anticipated yields.\nImportantly, this deal is structured as a yield on cost development supported by a long-term triple net lease to a strong investment-grade credit with fixed escalators, which serves to insulate Digital Realty from construction costs, and operating expense volatility. Excluding this transaction, our development life cycle average yield will be closer to the yield we presented last quarter.\nDuring the third quarter, we added another 103 new customers, continuing the 100-plus new logos we've added each quarter since the closing of the Interxion transaction 2.5 years ago. Key customer wins in the quarter include a Global 2000 luxury goods maker is expanding its capabilities on PlatformDIGITAL to add data exchange with its strategic cloud providers to its existing capabilities.\nA Global 2000 multinational technology manufacturer is expanding its hybrid IT capability in multiple metros across 2 global regions with PlatformDIGITAL. A Global 2000 retailer is rationalizing its data centers and joining Platform Digital as part of its hybrid IT architecture to have greater proximity to a key cloud service provider while enhancing both performance and ecosystem benefits. A Global 100 top insurance company is rationalizing its data centers and moving to PlatformDIGITAL to gain strong access to 2 leading cloud service providers.\nLanding with us as a new logo in 4Q '21, a Global 2000 U.S. energy provider expanded into 2 more metros with Digital Realty as it continues to rearchitect its network as part of a long-term hybrid IT transformation. And a Global 2000 aerospace and defense contractor is rationalizing its data center portfolio while supporting the re-architecture of its network and interconnecting with cloud providers on PlatformDIGITAL.\nTurning to our backlog on Page 7. The current backlog of signed but not yet commenced leases grew to $466 million by quarter end as our record signings were partially offset by $90 million of commencement. The lag between signings and commencements moved up to 17 months for the leases signed in the third quarter due to the large multisite enterprise build-to-suit deal discussed by Bill a moment ago.\nExcluding this deal, our sign to commence live was under 8 months, consistent with our historical average. Approximately 25% of our record backlog is slated to commence in the fourth quarter. While another 45% will commence in 2023, split fairly evenly throughout the first and second halfs of next year.\nMoving on to Page 8. We signed $154 million Sic [$156 million] of renewal leases during the third quarter that rolled down 0.5% on a cash basis. Renewal rates for 01-megawatt renewals were positive across each region and up 3.1% overall, demonstrating the criticality of these deployments and the differentiation of our facilities. This product segment has historically experienced steadily positive renewal rates and cash renewal rates have steadily increased throughout this year.\nAfter 2 consecutive 3-plus percent bumps in 1Q and 2Q, the cash mark-to-market was weighed down by the greater than 1 megawatt segment in the third quarter. Despite this result, we are confident in a slightly positive cash releasing spread for the full year 2022.\nImportantly, we are encouraged by the general trajectory of market rents across our product line. We expect that the dislocation and volatility of capital markets coupled with rising costs and the reduced availability of power in several markets, including the world's largest market,Loudoun County, Virginia, is constraining the ability to bring on new data center capacity despite the secular demand for data center infrastructure.\nWith regard to power delivery in Northern Virginia, we are continuing to work with the primary power provider to ensure appropriate allocations with an acute focus on capacity needed to support our customers in this market. We have an incredibly unique footprint in Loudoun and a set of capabilities that we are working to tap into in order to take advantage of this backdrop of continuing tightening market fundamentals.\nIn terms of operating performance, total portfolio occupancy rebounded by 80 basis points sequentially, driven by the strong commencements. These improvements in our occupancy come despite our active intention to grow our global colocation inventory in order to meet the growing demand of our expanding customer base.\nSame capital cash NOI growth fell 7.3% in the third quarter, negatively impacted by another 480 basis point FX headwind. This is disappointing on the surface but once the noise is removed, the improving operating picture that we have been painting starts to emerge.\nOn a constant currency basis, data center operating revenue, rental revenue interconnection was actually up 10 basis points year-over-year and improved by 120 basis points sequentially, demonstrating the turn that has started to take hold in our core operations. The sequential step-up was supported by a 50 basis point occupancy improvement over the second quarter, along with the benefits of the positive releasing spreads we've seen year-to-date.\nTurning to our risk mitigation strategies on Page 9. 56% of our third quarter operating revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars, with 21% in euros, 6% in Singapore dollars, 5% in British pounds and 2% in Japanese yen.\nThe U.S. dollar continued to strengthen over the last few months, negatively impacting same capital revenue growth by 530 basis points and NOI growth by 480 basis points year-over-year, as shown in our constant currency analysis on Page 10. This strong headwind contrasts with typical FX impacts of 50 to 100 basis points in either direction during the periods with more normal FX volatility.\nWhile the outsized depreciation of the euro this year has been a major driver of the headwinds for our P&L, it also represents the lion's share of our development pipeline. To be clear, we are operating and then investing locally rather than repatriating proceeds into U.S. dollars.\nOur operations, investment pipeline and funding in locally-denominated debt serve as a natural hedge. As we discussed on our call last quarter, given the growth of our global portfolio, along with heightened FX volatility, we took a closer look at our hedging strategy during the third quarter and executed additional swaps to mitigate our remaining FX exposure.\nIn August, we executed a U.S. dollar to euro currency swap against an existing $1 billion tranche of 2027 notes outstanding. And in late September, alongside our USD 550 million bond, we swapped those borrowings in the euro and Japanese yen, which also reduced the effective interest rate on those 5-year notes to just 3% versus the 5.55% coupon achieved via the offering.\nIn terms of earnings growth, we reported third quarter core FFO per share of $1.67, which is 1% higher on a year-over-year basis and 3% lower sequentially due to the negative impact of FX, higher interest and operating expenses and the initial dilution we incurred from the closure of Teraco, which is consistent with the forecast we provided last quarter.\nOn a constant currency basis, core FFO was 6% higher year-over-year but down $0.01 sequentially. The reported core FFO underperformance versus our prior expectation for the quarter was purely a function of greater-than-expected FX headwinds.\nLooking forward, we expect core FFO per share will remain under pressure from stiff FX headwinds given the appreciation of the U.S. dollar, though this should be offset by core growth. As you can see from the bridge on Page 11, we expect FFO will remain flat sequentially in the fourth quarter as FX and interest expense headwinds are partly balanced by NOI growth.\nAccordingly, we've adjusted our underlying guidance assumptions to reflect the continued pressures of FX and interest rates. We are also updating our core FFO per share guidance range for the full year 2022 to $6.70 to $6.75, reflecting a $0.075 per share adjustment at the midpoint of the range. Importantly, due to the sharper-than-expected move in interest rates since our last call, we are reducing our constant currency core FFO per share range by $0.025 at the midpoint to a new range of $6.95 to $7 for 2022, which represents approximately 7% growth over 2021. We expect currency headwinds could represent a 400 to 500 basis point drag on full year 2020 revenue and core FFO per share growth.\nA review of our leverage is on Page 12. Our reported leverage ratio at quarter end was 6.7x, while fixed charge coverage is at 5.5x. We drew $400 million down from last September's forward equity offering as part of our funding for Teraco. So pro forma for the remaining forward equity and adjusting for our full quarter's contribution from Teraco, our leverage ratio drops to 6.4x while pro forma fixed charge coverage is 5.7x.\nWhile leverage is above our historical average, we have bolstered our liquidity to ensure that we have the capital in hand to fund our committed development spend throughout the end of next year and maintain a comfortable cushion. Since our last earnings call, we have raised or received commitments for approximately $2 billion of debt capital at an effective blended average of just over 3%. These include more than $650 million of term loan commitments received subsequent to quarter end.\nWith cash and forward equity outstanding totaling more than $700 million, we have increased our current available liquidity to approximately $3 billion. We expect to see leverage moderate back towards our longer-term target over time through a combination of noncore dispositions, joint ventures of core holdings, lease-up of available capacity and the retention of free cash flow.\nAs Bill discussed, the current capital markets environment and increased cost of capital have led us to sharpen our lens and prioritize new investments to those that are the highest strategic merit and offer the best potential risk-adjusted returns. Our financial strategy includes a diverse menu of available capital options while minimizing the related cost of our liabilities. The execution against this financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital and enables us to fund our strategic objectives.\nAs you can see from the chart on Page 13, our weighted average debt maturity is about 5.5 years, and our weighted average coupon is 2.4%. Approximately 3/4 of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform. More than 80% of our net debt is fixed rate and 97% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling.\nFinally, we have no meaningful near-term debt maturities and a well-laddered debt maturity schedule. We repaid the remainder of our 2022 debt earlier this month and have only a small Swiss bond maturing in 2023.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session."

Please note this event is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler. Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJordan Sadler\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Digital Realty's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on today's call are CEO, Bill Stein; and President and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Corey Dyer are also on the call and will be available for Q&A.\nManagement may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website.\nBefore I turn the call over to Bill, let me offer a few key takeaways from our second quarter. First, the overarching trend of digital transformation remains a secular driver for our business, which was highlighted by yet another quarter of greater than $110 million of bookings and over 100 new logos added, which was well diversified in terms of product and GO; second, the improved re-leasing spreads we saw last quarter continued in 2Q, and we remain focused on offsetting the impacts of rising costs throughout our pipeline of new opportunity and development; third, our transformation into a leading global data center solution provider remains on track with our investment in Teraco expected to close within the next 2 weeks; and finally, our core FFO per share results exceeded consensus for the quarter, though we tempered our expectations for the second half and full year 2022, principally due to continued FX headwinds as we reaffirmed our constant currency core FFO per share guidance for 2022.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Stein.\n\nArthur William Stein\n\nCEO & Director, Digital Realty Trust, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. Digital Realty is levered to powerful long-term secular demand trends, broadly driven by ongoing digital transformation and the growth in IT and data. We have an unmatched global operating footprint along with a strong development pipeline to continue to deepen and expand that footprint to meet our customers' growing needs.\nThose customers are a growing community of more than 4,000 organizations across the globe, including the world's largest cloud service providers, communication providers that enable the global transport of data, Global 2000 enterprises as well as many multinational and industry-leading companies. Our second quarter results were strong with $113 million of new bookings and core FFO per share of $1.72, a 12% increase over the second quarter of last year and a 3% sequential increase, despite stiff FX headwinds.\nThe dialogue with our customers surrounding the evolving supply-demand dynamic and our compelling value proposition has started to translate with price increases driving positive cash renewals, supporting our push for appropriate rent escalators and helping to maintain stable development returns. Despite generally higher prices, demand for data center solutions remains strong around the world. with notable productivity in each of our regions.\nEMEA was a standout this quarter with all 5 of our largest deals landing in the region as the world's leading cloud service providers continued to utilize our platform to expand their infrastructure and support their growing needs. Looking forward, our pipeline remains robust as enterprises continue their digital transformation with a growing preference for hybrid cloud architecture, while cloud and connectivity providers continue to expand their infrastructure to better serve their customers around the world.\nAndy will provide more color on our results shortly, but first, I want to touch on the recent launch of Service Fabric Connect, an open interconnection solution and orchestration platform designed to support the wider industry shift to a hybrid data-centric architecture. This product launch empowers our enterprise and service provider customers to connect to anyone, anywhere at any time through an open and neutral digital marketplace.\nService Fabric Connect is the first of several related interconnection-oriented products that we have on our roadmap and was launched with availability in over 30 markets around the world. We are excited to bring this product to life, and we look forward to delivering these enhanced connectivity benefits to our customers.\nLet's turn to our investment activity on Page 4. We continue to invest in our global platform through a combination of organic new market entries that enhance our global productivity offerings as well as existing market expansions that are designed to meet our customers' longer-term capacity and connectivity solution requirements. Along these lines, in the second quarter, we acquired land in 3 European markets for ground-up development to support strong demand.\nIn addition, we announced our entry into Israel with the formation of a joint venture with Mivne, a leading Israeli real estate group. Together, we plan to develop a data center campus in Peta Tikva, the primary connectivity hub in Israel. Our presence in Israel will complement our facilities across the Mediterranean and will support the emergence of new connectivity routes that subsea cable operators are developing between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea.\nFinally, we have received the necessary regulatory approval in South Africa to close on the acquisition of Teraco, a leading colocation and interconnection provider in South Africa. We now expect to close the transaction within the next 2 weeks. Our active development pipeline remains robust and grew by more than 10% sequentially with 41 projects underway, supporting over 360 megawatts of IT capacity in 18 strategically important metros around the world.\nMore than half of this capacity is already presold, reflecting strong customer demand. Given the dynamism of the current environment, we know how important it is to make sure that we are being appropriately compensated for the elevated risk throughout the capital markets and the broader economy.\nWe have sought to mitigate these risks through our VMI program, appropriate pricing adjustments and CPI-based rent escalators that help insulate us from the impact of higher operating costs throughout the life of our customer contracts.\nFinally, as we have discussed in the past, we remain focused on opportunistically culling our portfolio. Since the end of 2019, we have monetized over $4 billion of assets through a combination of outright sales, joint ventures and more recently, through the contributions to our Singaporean Capital Partner Digital Core REIT. We view these sales and contributions as an important source of capital raising as we continue to expand our diverse global portfolio and accelerate our growth.\nBefore turning it over to Andy, I'd like to highlight an important update to our Board and then discuss the success we were having with other ESG initiatives shown on Page 5 of our earnings presentation. In June, Mary Hogan Preusse, a 30-year REIT industry veteran was named Chairman of the Board, succeeding Lawrence Chapman. Mary has served on our Board since 2017 and has played a critical role in driving Digital Realty's expansion and innovation as we have pursued our transformation to being a global full spectrum data center provider.\nWe are fortunate that Lawrence will continue to serve on our Board of Directors to provide his deep well of experience, understanding and leadership. Mary's appointment aligns with Digital Realty's commitment to strong governance, our focus on sustainability and the aim to balance fresh thinking with experience and continuity. I look forward to working with Mary in her new role.\nWe also continue to advance the ball towards our sustainability goals in the second quarter. In addition to publishing our fourth annual ESG report, we became the first data center operator to achieve the milestone of 1 gigawatt of sustainably certified data center capacity. We also further expanded our renewable portfolio in the U.S. by contracting for 158 megawatts of new solar energy before the recent run-up in power prices, supporting our data centers in California and Georgia. Globally, 119 of our data centers are powered by 100% renewable energy. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.\n\nAndrew P. Power\n\nPresident & CFO, Digital Realty Trust, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bill. Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 7. As Bill noted, we signed total bookings of $113 million with a $12 million contribution from interconnection during the second quarter. New business was healthy across product types as sub-1 megawatt plus interconnection accounted for 42% of the quarter's bookings, while deals larger than a megawatt accounted for 57% of this quarter's bookings.\nThe weighted average lease term on new leases was more than 7 years. EMEA accounted for well over half of this quarter's new business as Frankfurt continued to set the pace in the region, while Paris was also a meaningful contributor. Leasing was also geographically broad based during the quarter with significant contributions from Northern Virginia, Athens, Zurich, Tokyo, Sao Paulo, New York, Dublin and Amsterdam.\nReflecting the strength of demand from our customers, we grew the size of our development pipeline to more than 360 megawatts under construction as we started over 100 megawatts of new projects in EMEA and North America, including 35 megawatts in Frankfurt and 38 megawatts in Paris. Nearly 1/3 of our sub-1 megawatt plus interconnection bookings were exported from one region to another, reflecting the value customers realize from our global platform. North America was the most common export region with most of those exports landing in EMEA, followed by Asia Pacific and Latin America.\nDuring the second quarter, we added another 108 new customers, bringing the total to more than 1,000 new logos since closing the Interxion transaction a little over 2 years ago. We see a growing trend of multinational companies deploying and connecting large private data infrastructure footprints on platform digital across multiple regions and metros globally.\nIn terms of specific customer wins during the quarter, a leading IT service provider has experienced the full range of benefits of PlatformDIGITAL from greater performance and scalability to cost savings. These customers expanded their capabilities across 3 metros in 2 geographic regions, emphasizing hybrid IT by integrating bare metal and cloud storage. Two, leading Global 2000 financial services firms chose PlatformDIGITAL for multi-set deployments in multiple metros across North America and Asia Pacific.\nOne of the world's leading video game developers is expanding on PlatformDIGITAL to access our global footprint, scalability and low latency performance. A Global 2000 reinsurer is expanding on PlatformDIGITAL with full-spectrum benefits from the strong community to top cloud providers and robust security being key drivers. And a life sciences organization is switching to PlatformDIGITAL in 2 markets across North America to reduce network costs while implementing artificial intelligence and high-performance computing applications.\nTurning to our backlog on Page 9. The current backlog of signed, but not yet commenced leases, tapered at $393 million by quarter end as record level of commenced leases outpaced new signings. A lag between signings and commencements moved up to 13 months due to one larger signing into a new campus development in Frankfurt. Excluding that lease, the sign of commencement period was more in line with our recent experience of about 8 months.\nMoving on to Page 10. We signed $173 million of renewal leases during the second quarter at a positive 3.4% cash re-leasing spreads compared to 3.3% positive last quarter. Renewal rates were positive in each product segment and also in each of our 3 regions. The majority of total renewals were sub-1 megawatt deals, reflecting the higher unit price contracts that are characteristic of that segment. These renewals climbed by 3% during the second quarter. Among larger deals, rates increased by 1.1%.\nWe are encouraged by the positive trajectory of renewal spreads as well as our constructive engagement with customers on the current inflationary environment and our highly compelling value proposition. In terms of operating performance, total portfolio occupancy rebounded by 60 basis points sequentially, driven by the strong commencements from our record backlog.\nThese improvements in our occupancy come despite our active intention to grow our global colocation inventory in order to meet the growing demand of our expanding customer base who continue to solve for complex IT infrastructure connectivity and data integration challenges. Same capital cash NOI growth fell 5.5% in the second quarter, primarily driven by a 400 basis point FX headwind in the last leg of a previously discussed sizable churn event. Most of this space has already been re-leased and will more fully commence over the next several quarters, which should drive an improved trend in revenue growth on a constant currency basis.\nTurning to our risk mitigation strategies on Page 11. 57% of our second quarter operating revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars, with 22% in euros, and 7% in Singapore dollars, 6% British pounds and 2% in Japanese yen. We have also actively mitigated interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt or longer-term fixed-rate financing.\nTurning back to currency. The U.S. dollar continued to strengthen over the last several months, and FX represented a 400 to 450 basis point drag on year-over-year growth in our second quarter reported results from a top to the bottom line, as shown in our constant currency analysis on Page 12. As we've highlighted in the past, currency fluctuations has more typically served as a 50 to 100 basis point headwind or tailwind to earnings in periods of lower volatility.\nWhile the outsized depreciation of the euro this year has been a major driver of the headwinds for our P&L, it also represents the lion's share of our $4 billion-plus development pipeline. To be clear, we are operating and then investing locally rather than repatriating proceeds into U.S. dollars. Our operations and our investment pipeline along with our capital funding and locally denominated debt serve as a natural hedge.\nOf course, given the growth of our global portfolio, along with the heightened FX volatility, we will continue to evaluate our hedging strategy on an ongoing basis. In terms of earnings growth, second quarter core FFO per share of $1.72 was 12% higher on a year-over-year basis and 3% higher sequentially, despite increased FX headwinds.\nThe outperformance versus our prior expectations for the quarter was principally a function of lower-than-expected's OpEx spend and a short delay in the closing of the Teraco transaction. Looking forward, we expect core FFO per share will remain under pressure from stiffer than expected FX headwinds given the appreciation of the U.S. dollar.\nAs you can see from the bridge chart on Page 13, we expect FFO will dip down a couple of pennies in the third quarter, principally due to FX, but also as a result of the delayed normalization of OpEx spend, near-term dilution from closing the Teraco transaction and higher interest rates. Accordingly, we have adjusted our underlying guidance assumptions that remain under pressure from foreign currency exchange and interest rates.\nWe are also updating our core FFO per share guidance range for the full year 2022 to $6.75 to $6.85, reflecting a $0.05 per share adjustment at the low and high end of the range. Importantly, we are reaffirming our constant currency core FFO per share range of $6.95 to $7.05 for 2022. Given the continued strength of the U.S. dollar, we expect currency headwinds could represent a 300 to 400 basis point drag on full year 2022 revenue and core FFO per share growth.\nLastly, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 14. Our reported leverage ticked down to 6.2x as of June 30, while fixed charge coverage increased to 6.0x. Adjusting for the proceeds from the last September's forward equity offering, our pro forma leverage drops to 5.8x, while fixed charge coverage improved to 6.2x. We remain focused on our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related cost of our liabilities.\nThe execution against this financial strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from the pack and enables us to prudently fund our strategic objectives. As you can see from the chart on Page 15, our weighted average debt maturity is nearly 6 years, and our weighted average coupon is 2.2%. Approximately 3/4 of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform. Nearly 90% of our debt is fixed rate and 99% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling.\nFinally, as you can see from the left side of Page 15, we have modest near-term debt maturities and a well-laddered maturity schedule for the foreseeable future. Our balance sheet is poised to weather the storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session?"

Please note this event is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Jordan, please go ahead.\n\nJordan Sadler\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Digital Realty's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on today's call are CEO, Bill Stein; and President and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Investment Officer Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer Corey Dyer are also on the call and will be available for Q&A.\nManagement may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC.\nThis call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website.\nBefore I turn the call over to Bill, let me offer a few key takeaways from our first quarter. First, we kicked off the year on a high note with record bookings of $167 million, led by strength in the leases greater than 1 megawatt and supported by steady bookings in the 0 to 1 megawatt and interconnection category.\nSecond, we saw a notable and broad-based improvement in our re-leasing spreads in the quarter, reflecting a healthier pricing environment but also the active engagement we are having with customers on the Digital Realty value proposition. Third, we remain poised to continue our expansion in Africa with plans to close our investment in Teraco later this quarter. And finally, our core FFO per share results exceeded consensus' expectations despite FX-related headwinds.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Stein.\n\nArthur William Stein\n\nCEO & Director, Digital Realty Trust, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jordan, and welcome to the Digital team. Our formula for long-term value creation is a global, connected, sustainable framework, and we made further progress on each front during the first quarter.\nFirst, we continue to globalize our business with the announcement of our definitive agreement to acquire a majority stake in Teraco in early January. We also continue to grow our business organically around the world. We posted another record quarter of global bookings totaling $167 million of annualized rent, including our second highest quarter in each of the Americas and Asia Pacific regions, together with another solid quarter in EMEA. Bookings this quarter were led by strong results in the greater than 1 megawatt category, particularly in the Americas, while sub-1-megawatt bookings remain steady and in line with our 2021 average.\nLet's discuss our sustainable growth initiatives on Page 3 of our earnings presentation. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment and simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors, our employees and broader society while advancing our goal of delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders.\nDuring the first quarter, Digital Realty was named one of America's Most Just Companies and third overall in the real estate industry by Just Capital and CNBC. We also maintained our status as a member of the FTSE4Good Index, which measures the performance of companies demonstrating strong ESG practices, continuing our record of recognition for our leading sustainability initiatives.\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, Digital Realty continued our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts through our employee-led DEI council, which seeks to promote inclusion and create opportunities for each of our employee communities. Through the DEI council, Digital Realty has expanded its philanthropy and community engagement activities with strategic donations and partnerships with global charitable organizations.\nDigital Realty has also taken a stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine and those impacted by the Russian vision. We do not have any data centers or operations in Russia or Ukraine, and our company will abide by sanctions against Russia. Until the peaceful and legal resolution of this conflict, we will not invest in Russia. Furthermore, we are funding philanthropic organizations to support Ukrainian refugees, those displaced within Ukraine and the growing humanitarian crisis.\nLet's turn our investment activity to Page 4. We continue to invest in our global platform. We acquired land in 3 markets for organic development, including the first location for our joint venture with Brookfield in India, along with 2 parcels in Europe to support the strong demand in that region. After the quarter, we purchased 3 additional land parcels in Europe, including a beachhead in Barcelona, marking our organic entry into this complementary Mediterranean metro.\nOur active development pipeline reached an all-time high in the quarter with 44 projects underway supporting over 300 megawatts in of IT capacity in 28 metros around the world. 58% of this capacity is already presold, reflecting strong customer demand.\nWe've expanded our development in the Americas, adding further capacity in New York, Northern Virginia and Toronto. Demand remains very strong in EMEA, and we are continuing to invest across this region with active development projects in 17 of our 18 markets. Frankfurt is still the most active development market in EMEA, followed by Paris. We continue to make good progress toward closing the Teraco transaction, which we still expect to close in the first half of this year.\nLet's turn to the macro environment on Page 5. We are fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers. We are also proactively managing risks to help insulate Digital Realty against the impact of the current inflationary and rising interest rate environment. We are well protected against the impact of rising energy costs given the pass-through nature of substantially all of our customer contracts, and we are effectively managing against rising input costs through our vendor-managed inventory program and the expansion of our prepurchase equipment pool.\nWe are constructively engaging with new and existing customers on the impact of rising costs, which is translating into better pricing. This is partly reflected in the broad-based and improved cash leasing spreads we experienced in the first quarter but is also showing up in new lease transactions across most of our markets.\nOur leadership position provides us with a unique vantage point to detect secular trends as they emerge globally on Platform Digital. Our customers continue to solve the most complex IT infrastructure in activity and data integration challenges. We see a growing trend of multinational companies across all segments deploying and connecting large private data infrastructure footprints on platform digital across multiple regions and metros globally.\nRecently, industry research firm, IDC, updated their global data sphere forecast for 2025, Predicting the annual data creation rate will exceed 180 zettabytes per year or roughly triple the '21 rate. IDC concludes that companies of all sizes will need to prioritize data sharing and security to improve business resiliency and create a differentiated experience for their customers.\nEarlier this week, we published our inaugural Global Data Insights survey with strategic insights from 7,200 companies across 23 countries and 9 industries about the role of data in their business agenda. According to the survey, 70% of these companies are prioritizing secure data exchange in their current plans. The global data survey will augment our Data Gravity Index to provide telemetry for our customers, partners and their respective industries as they evolve their business platforms to harness the power of data and co-located infrastructure to unlock a new era of growth through connected data communities.\nIn addition, Digital Realty recently joined the iMasons Climate Accord as a founding member. This coalition of leading companies is united in their views on carbon reduction in digital infrastructure. The group will establish an independent governing body to define an open standard that provides transparency, traceability and measurement of progress toward reducing carbon from sourced power and embodied carbon found in materials, products and operations of digital infrastructure. This is another great example of our commitment to the continuous innovation and execution of our platform digital road map to provide a sustainable and differentiated value proposition for our customers, partners and the broader industry.\nGiven the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our platform in meeting these needs, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees whatever the macro environment may hold in store.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.\n\nAndrew P. Power\n\nPresident & CFO, Digital Realty Trust, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bill. Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 7. As Bill noted, we signed total bookings of $167 million with an $11 million contribution from interconnection during the first quarter. This is our second consecutive quarterly record, and the seventh time in the last 8 quarters we have delivered bookings over $100 million.\nWhile our new business was healthy across product types, larger deals accounted for 70% of the quarter's bookings, while sub-1 megawatt plus interconnection accounted for 30% of the total. The weighted average lease term on new leases was more than 7 years.\nDemand was particularly strong in the Americas with Northern Virginia and Toronto leading the way. Fundamentals continue to tighten in both metros, as reflected by the high levels of pre-leasing on our development pipeline. In EMEA, Frankfurt remains the standout, while in APAC, demand remains robust in Singapore and Japan. Nearly 1/3 of our sub-1-megawatt plus interconnection bookings were exported from one region to another, reflecting the value customers realize from our global platform. North America was the most common export region, with most of those exports landing in EMEA followed by Asia Pacific and Latin America.\nWe landed 128 new logos during the first quarter, maintaining the momentum we have built over the last several quarters, which has been a strong validation of Platform Digital and our global strategy. In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, Zenlayer, a global edge cloud provider, is expanding on Platform Digital across 3 continents to improve its geographic coverage, scale and access to customer communities across various industries.\nA Global 2000 consumer financial services firm continue to expand with Digital Realty, leveraging Platform Digital's full suite of capabilities, including rationalizing data centers, implementing IT controls and interconnecting with key business communities.\nBox Technologies, a leading innovator of high-performance desktop-as-a-service applications, is deploying on Platform Digital, supporting enterprise data architecture applications, serving the manufacturing, construction and engineering industries.\nA leading IT company is leveraging our full product spectrum by utilizing our connectivity offerings to support data exchange across 3 metros in North America and Lat Am to improve performance and scalability and reduce costs. Magnite, a global independent advertising platform is expanding our platform digital in multiple metros across EMEA to enable their hybrid IT transformation. And a Global 2000 reinsurer selected Platform Digital for mainframe migration with seamless connectivity to top cloud providers and robust security being key drivers.\nTurning to our backlog on Page 9. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced grew by 15% and from $378 million to a record $436 million, driven by the strong first quarter signings, which outpaced commencements. The lag between signings and commencements moderated to 7 months with nearly 2/3 of our $436 million backlog scheduled to commence later this year.\nMoving on to Page 10. We signed $177 million of renewal leases during the first quarter at a positive 3.3% cash re-leasing spread. Renewal rates were positive across the board, were spread in the black across product types in all 3 regions. 2/3 of total renewals were sub-1-megawatt deals, resulting in a smaller sample size for the 1-plus megawatt category in the quarter.\nExcluding one larger short-term extension, our cash renewal spread would have been positive 2.5%. We are encouraged by the positive trajectory on renewal spreads as well as constructive engagement with customers on the current inflationary environment and our highly compelling value proposition.\nIn terms of operating performance, portfolio occupancy ticked down by 30 basis points sequentially, driven by previously reported churn events, most of which has already been re-leased. Consistent with our full year guidance, same capital cash NOI growth was negative 3.1% in the first quarter, primarily driven by 220 basis points of FX headwinds, the timing of no move-outs and a customer bankruptcy.\nThe U.S. dollar continued to strengthen over the last several months, and FX represented a 200 to 250 basis point drag on the year-over-year growth in our first quarter reported results from the top to the bottom line, as shown on Page 11. Our operations, along with our capital funding and locally denominated debt act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective.\nTurning to our risk mitigation strategies on Page 12. A little less than 60% of our first quarter operating revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars, followed by approximately 25% in euros and roughly 5% each in Singapore dollars and British pounds.\nIn addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in SOFR would have roughly a 75 basis point impact on full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed, and our capital plan is fully funded.\nIn terms of earnings growth, first quarter core FFO per share of $1.67 was flat on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. Despite FX headwinds, a $0.01 impact related to a customer bankruptcy and a difficult comp due to the contribution of assets to digital core REIT. In terms of the quarterly run rate, we expect the split between the first half of the year and the second half of the year to be approximately $49.51.\nIn other words, as you can see from the bridge chart on Page 13, we expect to dip down a couple of pennies in the second quarter due to normalized OpEx spending and near-term dilution from closing the Teraco transaction before bouncing back in the second half of the year as leases from a record backlog commenced.\nMost of the drivers underlying our guidance remain unchanged, but given the improving pricing environment, we are bumping up our outlook for cash re-leasing spreads for the full year to slightly positive compared to flat last quarter. We are maintaining our existing core FFO per share range of $6.80 to $6.90 despite the customer bankruptcy and stiffer FX headwinds. Given the continued strength of the U.S. dollar, we expect currency headwinds could represent a 250 to 300 basis point drag on full year 2022 revenue and core FFO per share growth.\nLast but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 14. We were active again in the capital markets during the first quarter. We took advantage of favorable OEM market conditions to lock in EUR 750 million at 1.375% for 10.5 years. And later in the quarter, we completed a dual tranche Swiss bond offering, raising a total of CHF 250 million at a blended coupon of approximately 1.25%. We used a portion of the net proceeds to redeem 450 million of bonds at 4.75%.\nReported leverage ratio is 6.3x while fixed charge coverage is 5.5x. Adjusting for the proceeds from the forward equity offering last September, our pro forma leverage ratio drops to 5.9x, while fixed charge coverage improves to 5.7x. We continue to execute our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related cost and extending the duration of our liabilities to match our long-lived assets.\nThis successful execution against our financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the chart on Page 15, our weighted average debt maturity is over 6 years and our weighted average coupon is 2.2%. A little over 3/4 of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform while also acting as a natural FX hedge for investments outside the U.S. Over 90% of our debt is fixed rate, guarding against a fixed a rising rate environment, and 99% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling.\nFinally, as you can see from the left side of Page 15, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks, and now we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session?"

Please note, this event is being recorded. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Huseby, Digital Realty's Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJim Huseby\n\nHead of IR, Digital Realty Trust, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Digital Realty's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on today's call are CEO, Bill Stein; and President and CFO, Andy Power; Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Corey Dyer are also on the call, and they will be available for Q&A.

Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website.\nBefore I turn the call over to Bill, I'd like to hit the tops of the waves on our fourth quarter results. We further strengthened connections with customers with $156 million of new bookings with record results in both a 0 to 1 megawatt and greater than a megawatt category and ended the year with $500 million in new bookings, a 15% increase over the prior year. We also continue to enhance our global platform with the completion of organic development projects in multiple metros despite the continued challenges presented by the pandemic and the global supply chain in addition to strategic investments, establishing Digital Realty as the leading pan-African provider.\nFinancially, we had a solid quarter with full year results above the high end of the guidance range that we provided this time last year. And finally, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet by raising equity capital through the establishment of Digital Core REIT in a highly successful IPO on the Singapore Stock Exchange and the related sale of a 90% interest in 10 fully utilized core data centers. As a perpetual capital partner, Digital Realty and Digital Core REIT can continue to work together while providing our customers with a seamless experience. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.\n\nArthur William Stein\n\nCEO & Director, Digital Realty Trust, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. Our formula for long-term value creation is a global, connected, sustainable framework. And we made further progress on each front during the fourth quarter. First, we continue to globalize our business with record global bookings and strength across all regions and all product types, including quarterly highs in both our sub-1 megawatt and greater than 1 megawatt categories.\nWe also announced 2 significant global initiatives. First, in December, we announced the successful listing of Digital Core REIT as a stand-alone publicly traded company on the Singapore Stock Exchange. Digital Realty contributed a 90% interest in a portfolio of 10 core data centers concentrated in top-tier markets across the U.S. and Canada, valued at $1.4 billion at a 4.25% cap rate. We generated net proceeds of over $950 million from the transaction, and we retained a 35% equity interest in the publicly traded REIT.\nThe offering was very well received, and Digital Core REIT has traded up approximately 30% since the IPO, enhancing the gain on our remaining ownership stake. In addition to providing investors a stable cash flow stream from a portfolio of high-quality core data centers, Digital Core REIT offers key strategic benefits to Digital Realty. First, Digital Core REIT is a perpetual capital partner. It has a long-term investment horizon and a global mandate to invest in stabilized income-producing data centers. Second, Digital Core REIT has been carefully crafted to provide a seamless customer experience. Digital Core REIT is sponsored by and externally managed by Digital Realty.\nWe will continue to manage the properties providing the same level of operational excellence, and we will earn fees for asset and property management as well as acquisitions, dispositions and development. From a customer perspective, nothing changes when we contribute an asset to Digital Core REIT. Third, Digital Core REIT is an ideal partner vehicle for Digital Realty. We expect to contribute additional stabilized core assets to Digital Core REIT in the future, and we may also co-invest alongside Digital Core REIT on future investment activity.\nFinally, our interests are aligned. As mentioned, Digital Realty will continue to own a 10% direct ownership stake in each of the assets in addition to 35% in the publicly traded vehicle. Digital Core REIT is led by 2 long-time Digital Realty team members, John Stewart, who most of you know well, along with an Dan Tiv. We are excited about their opportunity to create value for Digital Core REIT unitholders, including Digital Realty.\nOur second global initiative, which we announced just after quarter end, is the definitive agreement to acquire roughly a 55% stake in Teraco, Africa's leading carrier-neutral colocation provider. This acquisition immediately establishes Digital Realty as the leading colocation and interconnection provider on the high-growth African continent and builds upon our earlier investments in Africa with iColo, in both Kenya and Mozambique and in Medallion in Nigeria. Teraco complements these investments as well as our highly connected facilities in the Mediterranean by hosting the key strategic landing endpoints for subsea cables circling Africa. From Marseille and Athens in the North; Mombasa and Maputo along the east; Durban and Cape Town in the South; and Lagos along the Western Coast, PlatformDIGITAL is supporting the growth of our customers as well as the broader digital transformation of the entire African continent.\nTeraco has 7 state-of-the-art data centers across 3 key metros in South Africa and serves over 600 customers, including more than 275 connectivity providers, over 25 cloud and content platforms and approximately 300 enterprises. Teraco facilitates approximately 22,000 interconnections between customers and hosts 7 cloud on-ramps and provides direct access to 7 subsea cables. Teraco has historically generated healthy double-digit growth in revenue and EBITDA.\nIn addition, more than half of Teraco's in-service portfolio was developed within the past 2 years. The current development pipeline will expand the existing asset base by over 25%. And Teraco owns land adjacent to its highly connected campuses in Johannesburg and Cape Town that will support another doubling of the in-place capacity, representing significant embedded growth potential and providing considerable runway to support our customers' growth.\nLeading global cloud and content platforms have recently begun making significant investments in Africa, given the existing capacity within the in-service portfolio, the incremental capacity currently under construction and the strategic landholdings to support future expansion. Teraco is uniquely positioned to support the expected growth of digital infrastructure in Africa over the next several years. Let's discuss our sustainable growth initiatives on Page 3. During the fourth quarter, Digital Realty earned Nareit's Leader in the Light Award for the fifth consecutive year, complementing the company's 5-star GRESB rating and top ranking within the technology and science sector.\nDigital Realty was also named one of America's most responsible companies by Newsweek and was the #1 ranked data center company. We continue to advance our sustainable financing strategy, recasting and upsizing our credit facility with improved terms while incorporating a sustainability-linked pricing component with pricing subject to adjustment based on annual performance against certain green targets. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment, while simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors and our employees, along with the broader society and advancing our goal of delivering sustainable growth for all these stakeholders.\nLet's turn to our investment activity on Page 4. We continue to invest in the expansion of our global platform. In addition to the Teraco transaction, we've grown our presence along the Eastern Coast of Africa with iColo and supplemented our acquisition of Medallion data centers in Nigeria with 2 land purchases in Lagos for future development. Over the next decade, we expect to see huge opportunity for global businesses to tap into Africa's rapidly growing Internet economy, and Digital Realty is uniquely positioned to enable this growth.\nWe also continue to invest in the organic growth of our platform. We spent $580 million on growth CapEx in the fourth quarter, our largest quarterly growth CapEx investment to date. We currently have 44 projects underway, totaling more than 250 megawatts of IT capacity in 27 metros around the world. This capacity was 46% presold as of year-end. Geographically, we continue to invest most heavily in EMEA with 27 projects underway, totaling more than 140 megawatts across 16 metros. In Asia Pacific, we delivered several development projects during the fourth quarter, including facilities in Singapore and Hong Kong.\nIn January, we opened Digital Seoul One, our first data center in South Korea and the first carrier-neutral facility in the country. This facility will serve as a connectivity gateway for latency-sensitive customer workloads, but can be connected to hyperscale applications hosted in our second facility in Korea, totaling over 60 megawatts of capacity currently under construction just outside of the city center. The 2 facilities will be tied together with fiber to create a connected campus and will complement each other by providing solutions for the full customer spectrum, from small performance sensitive co-location customers to huge hyperscale deployments.\nIn North America, our development pipeline is diversified by product mix as well as geographically with projects underway in 7 different markets. We continue to see strong hyperscale demand in Hillsboro, while we are expanding in Downtown Atlanta to bring on additional colocation capacity at one of the most highly connected destinations in the Southeastern United States. We are bringing capacity online in both these markets, among others, given the robust demand backdrop and our tightening inventory position.\nLet's turn to the macro environment on Page 5. We're fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers. Our leadership position provides us with a unique vantage point to detect secular trends as they emerge globally on platform digital. Our customers continue to solve some of the most complex IT infrastructure connectivity and data integration challenges. We are witnessing a growing trend of multinational companies across all segments, deploying and connecting large, private data infrastructure footprints on PlatformDIGITAL across multiple regions and metros globally.\nIndustry research firm Gartner recently updated their global IT spending forecast for 2022, projecting a 5.1% increase to $4.5 trillion, driven by companies investing in digital data growth strategies. Additionally, Gartner believes that by 2024, 75% of organizations will have deployed multiple data hubs to drive mission-critical data analytics sharing and governance in support of digital data growth strategies. These forecasts are consistent with our view of where the puck is headed. Our market intelligence tool, the Data Gravity Index, forecasts similar growth in the intensity of data creation and its gravitational pull on global IT infrastructure.\nIn addition, our industry manifesto, enabling connected data communities serves as the global playbook for industry collaboration to tackle data gravity challenges head on and unlock a new era of growth opportunity for all companies. Digital Realty was recently named Company of the Year by (inaudible) data center best practices. This award reflects our continued focus on operational excellence, underpinned by continuous innovation and execution of the PlatformDIGITAL road map.\nWe are honored by the strong validation of the differentiated value proposition we are creating for customers and partners. Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our platform in meeting these needs, we believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold in store. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.\n\nAndrew P. Power\n\nPresident & CFO, Digital Realty Trust, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bill. Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 7. As Bill noted, we delivered record bookings of $156 million with an $11 million contribution from interconnection during the fourth quarter. Volume was elevated across both of our primary reporting categories in the quarter with a healthy mix between enterprise and hyperscale business. For the full year, we booked $0.5 billion of new business with roughly a 60-40 split between greater than 1 megawatt and less than 1 megawatt plus interconnection.\nThe EMEA region had a particularly strong quarter accounting for approximately 60% of total bookings led by Frankfurt with standout performance across product types. The fourth quarter was also notable for the strength of cross-selling between regions. Nearly 30% of our sub-1 megawatt plus interconnection bookings were exported from one region to another, a strong indication of the value customers derive from our global platform. Not surprisingly, the Americas was our biggest exporter with most deals landing in EMEA, followed by APAC.\nBoth EMEA and APAC had strong export quarters as well, with over 15% of their sub-1-megawatt plus interconnection bookings landing out of region. The weighted average lease term was nearly 10 years primarily driven by hyperscale pre-leasing in EMEA. We landed over 130 new logos during the fourth quarter, our second best quarterly result and just shy of last quarter's record 140 for our full year total of 480 new logos. We are encouraged by the consistent organic growth of our customer base, and we view these results as strong validation of platform digital and our global strategy.\nIn terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, Graphcore, a British semiconductor company that develops accelerators and systems for AI and machine learning, selected PlatformDIGITAL to address their density, security and scale requirements. The initial deployment will land in Amsterdam to be followed by a global rollout, and we are also collaborating on solution engineering and joint go-to-market activities. A leading high-frequency trading shop is expanding on PlatformDIGITAL to extend their high-performance computing platform across 2 continents and expand trading into 2 new international metros, while approving cloud access and business continuity state side.\nA Global 2000 U.S. energy provider is expanding with Digital Realty, consolidating their own on-premise facilities and using PlatformDIGITAL to scale their business across multiple metros. A leading aerospace manufacturing and services company is expanding on PlatformDIGITAL, leveraging dense interconnection to support data exchange across 4 new markets. A Global 2000 insurance brokerage is consolidating their data center footprint and has adopted PlatformDIGITAL to remove data gravity barriers and interconnect with clouds across multiple metros.\nAn IVY League university is expanding on PlatformDIGITAL to exit their own on-premise facility and enhance their access to the health care provider community for data exchange. And finally, a major APAC food services organization selected PlatformDIGITAL to improve cloud connectivity and leverage the local centers of data exchange in Japan. Turning to our backlog on Page 9. The current backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced, rose from $330 million to $378 million as our fourth -- record fourth quarter signings more than offset commencements. The lag between signings and commencements was unusually high at nearly 14 months primarily driven by long-term leases on recent development starts in EMEA as customers accelerated efforts to secure a long-term runway for growth against a backdrop of steadily dwindling inventory.\nMoving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 10. We signed $151 million of renewal leases during the fourth quarter in addition to the record new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the fourth quarter was nearly 4 years. Renewal rates rolled down 4%, driven by a handful of large deals in North America as negative re-leasing spreads on greater than 1 megawatt renewals more than offset the positive releasing spreads on the sub-1 megawatt renewals. In terms of operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy ticked down 60 basis points, almost entirely due to development deliveries placed in service during the quarter.\nSame capital cash NOI growth was negative 6.6% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by churn in North America as well as higher property operating and net utilities expense. As a reminder, the 2021 same-store pool did not include the Westin Building in Seattle, the Interxion platform in (inaudible), Lamada Helix in Greece or Altus IT in Croatia. Each of these businesses will be included in the same-store pool beginning in the first quarter of 2022, and each is expected to contribute to improving same-store growth going forward, partially offset by higher property taxes as well as FX headwinds expected in 2022.\nTurning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 11. The U.S. dollar strengthened during the fourth quarter relative to prior year exchange rates, and FX represented roughly a 130 basis point headwind to the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line. As a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to the currency risk from an economic perspective.\nIn addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed-rate debt, a 100 basis point move in base rates would have roughly a 50 basis point impact on our full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed with a well-diversified menu of public and private capital sources available to fund the growth of our business.\nIn terms of earnings growth, fourth quarter core FFO per share was up 4% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially, driven by solid operational execution, cost controls and a reduction in financing costs due to proactive balance sheet management over the past 12 months. For the full year, core FFO per share was up 5% year-over-year and came in $0.03 above the high end of our initial guidance range, which did not contemplate the contribution of $1.4 billion of assets through Digital Core REIT in early December.\nAs a reminder, full year core FFO per share excludes the $20 million promote fee on the Prudential joint venture in the third quarter as well as the $25 million PPA settlement in the first quarter. Looking ahead to 2022, we expect core FFO per share will be between $6.80 and $6.90, including the 1% dilution from Teraco as well as 100 to 200 basis points of expected FX headwinds due to the strength of the dollar relative to 2021. We expect to deliver revenue between $4.7 billion and $4.8 billion in 2022 and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2.5 billion.\nGiven the tightened supply environment, we expect flat cash renewal rates in 2022, up from slightly negative in 2021. And we expect overall portfolio occupancy to remain within the current range despite the significant new capacity scheduled to come online during the year in addition to the embedded lease-up potential within the Teraco portfolio. We are off to a great start on our financing plans for the year with a highly successful 750 million bond offering in early January of 10.5-year paper at 1 3/8% coupon.\nFinally, we expect to raise $500 million to $1 billion from capital recycling whether through contributions to Digital Core REIT, noncore asset sales to third parties or a combination of both. In terms of the quarterly dividend, the distribution policy is ultimately a Board-level decision. Given the continued growth in our cash flows and taxable income, we would expect to see continued growth in the per share dividend, just as we have had each and every year since our IPO in 2004.\nLast, but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 12. As of year-end, our reported leverage ratio stood at 6.1x, while fixed charge coverage was 5.4x. Pro forma for settlement of the $1 billion September forward equity offering, leverage drops to 5.7x, while fixed charge coverage also improved to 5.7x. We continue to execute on our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related costs and extending the duration of our liabilities to match our long-lived assets.\nAs Bill previously mentioned, we recast our credit facility during the fourth quarter, upsizing from $2.35 billion to $3 billion, extending the maturity by 3 years and tightening pricing by 5 basis points. We also incorporated a sustainability-linked pricing component subject to adjustment based on annual performance targets, further demonstrating our commitment to sustainable business practices. Subsequent to quarter end, we raised approximately $850 million from the 10.5-year euro bonds at 1.375%, and we used a portion of the proceeds to redeem all $450 million of our outstanding 4 3/8% U.S. dollar bonds due 2025.\nThis successful execution against our financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund growth. As you can see from the chart on Page 13, our weighted average debt maturity is over 6 years and our weighted average coupon is just over 2%. A little over 3/4 of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform while also acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S.\n94% of our debt is fixed rate, guarding against a rising rate environment. And 99% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 13, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session?"

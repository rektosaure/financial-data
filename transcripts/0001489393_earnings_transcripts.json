At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.\n\nDavid Kinney\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to today's call. Before we begin the discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies the call and is available on our website at investors.lyondellbasell.com. Today, we will be discussing our third quarter results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides in our regulatory filings, which are also available on our Investor Relations website.\nComments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results using non-GAAP financial measures, such as EBITDA and earnings per share, excluding identified items. Additional documents on our Investor website provide reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release and our business results discussion.\nA recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1 p.m. Eastern Time today until December 1 by calling (877) 660-6853 in the United States and (201) 612-7415 outside the United States. The access code for both numbers is 13746-207. Joining today's call will be Peter Vanacker, LyondellBasell's Chief Executive Officer; our CFO, Agustin Izquierdo; Kim Foley, our Executive Vice President of Global Olefins and Polyolefins; Aaron Ledet, our EVP of Intermediates and Derivatives; and Torkel Rhenman, our EVP of Advanced Polymer Solutions.\nWith that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter.\n\nPeter Z. E. Vanacker\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman of the Executive Board, Neste Oyj\n\nThank you, Dave, and thank you all for joining today's call as we discuss our third quarter results. The LYB team is making excellent progress on managing the cycle with meaningful progress from our cash improvement plan, which contributed to our very high cash conversion of 135% in the third quarter. We're well on our way to delivering on our $600 million target by year-end. And our actions are expected to increase cash flow by at least $1.1 billion by the end of 2026.\nLet us first take a moment to review LYB safety performance with Slide #3. Safe operations are fundamental to our core values and essential for our future success. This is demonstrated by our September year-to-date total recordable incident rate of 0.12 which is even better than last year's top decile results. Safety performance improved year-on-year, and this sustained trend is a direct reflection of the dedication and commitment of all our employees and contractors to operational excellence.\nPlease turn to Slide 4 as we discuss our financial performance. During the third quarter, cash generation improved as LYB continued to navigate the cycle. Earnings were $1.01 per share with EBITDA of $835 million and $983 million of cash from operating activities. We returned $443 million to shareholders in the form of dividends.\nTurning to Slide 5. Let's discuss some encouraging trends developing in polyethylene markets. In recent months, PE demand has started to improve following the multiyear post COVID downturn in both North America and Europe, 2025 domestic demand for polyethylene is the strongest we have seen since the start of the downturn in the third quarter of 2022. Despite the recent volatility in U.S. exports, caused by shifting trade and tariff policies, third quarter year-to-date North American demand is up by 2.5% relative to 2024. After a prolonged weakness following the onset of the Russia Ukraine conflict, August year-to-date polyethylene volumes in Europe are up approximately 3% compared to the same period last year.\nConsumer packaging demand remains resilient, reflecting the essential role of polyolefins and everyday applications despite changing consumer behavior. At the same time, investments in durable goods to support trends in energy, digitalization and infrastructure are also driving demand growth. Renewable energy and data center construction requires durable, high-performance polymers for wire and cable jacketing, conduits and water piping. Electric vehicles use approximately 10% more plastic by weight than vehicles powered by internal combustion engines.\nLYB's broad portfolio of innovative polymers position us well to meet the stringent performance and sustainability benchmarks required to address these attractive and growing market opportunities. Let me be clear, these are not yet green shoots for our financial results. Markets will need to absorb new capacity and operating rates will need further improvement before suppliers develop meaningful pricing power. But these inflections in demand trends are encouraging and could be the early indicators of our market recovery.\nWith this in mind, let's turn to Slide 6 and take a longer view on demand growth for polyethylene and polypropylene. As shown in the top chart, global polyethylene demand has consistently grown at GDP plus rates of over 3% for at least 35 years. Unlike other markets like automobiles, our housing polyethylene markets have exhibited consistent growth. Even after recessionary downturns and pandemic-related spikes, polyethylene demand quickly returns to its long-term trajectory. This reflects the power of the underlying trends driving global consumption, population growth, deurbanization and a rising middle class. Some observers questions whether the flatter growth rate seen in 2022 and 2023 after the 2021 spike were reflective of a secular change. But as you can see, in 2025, we are reverting to long-term global historic growth rates of over 3%. Most consultants are predicting continued growth through at least 2035 with some shifts in share of production from fossil-based feeds towards circular feedstocks.\nLooking at the bottom chart, mature markets such as North America and Europe, leads in per capita consumption aligned with established demand patterns. Meanwhile, emerging regions, such as India and Africa, provides significant long-term growth opportunities as living standards improve in these regions. China continues to demonstrate strong volume growth, supported by its extensive manufacturing base and industrial activity. In contrast, South America reflects comparatively lower consumption, which can attribute it to a smaller manufacturing footprint and lower industrial intensity relative to other regions.\nThese trends reinforce the importance of regional dynamics, shaping the growth of polyolefins in the global market. While mature markets remain critical for stability, demand growth within these regions will be increasingly driven by infrastructure developments. Electrification, EV mobility, home care and pharma, while emerging economies will drive meaningful volume growth. Importantly, this demand growth is not negatively impacted by circularity. In fact, we are seeing growth shifting towards innovation, efficiency and circularity in these markets. LYB continues to lead in sustainable solutions by investing in innovative feedstock sourcing, positioning us to capture value across diverse markets as we advance our strategy.\nOn Slide 7, let's shift to the supply side and discuss how capacity rationalization trends are accelerating and reshaping the global ethylene supply landscape. As seen on the chart to the left, announced and anticipated closures and idling from 2020 through 2028, add up to more than 21 million tonnes of ethylene capacity representing roughly 10% of global supply. Asia is leading the way with recent government announcements highlighting the magnitude of this trend. South Korea is targeting closures of up to 25%, while Japan recently announced closures of 1.5 million tonnes. China is also a critical driver for global rationalization. With high costs for feedstocks, much of the Chinese petrochemical industry is on the wrong end of the cost curve. China's anti-involution measures core focused on reducing uncompetitive capacity and approvals for new facilities are facing increased scrutiny.\nIn Europe, regulatory burdens, persistently high operating costs and weak margins are driving massive reductions in petrochemical capacity. Announced rationalizations total approximately 20% of regional capacity and we expect more announcements will follow. The domino effect of these rationalizations is leading to an acceleration. Smaller petrochemical clusters are finding that the economics for cogeneration or industrial gas partners no longer work when a few assets are shuttered in smaller industrial parks. About 30% of our global closures have been announced in just the past 12 months, underscoring the speed and magnitude of this shift. We're confident that these closures will help to partially offset the overhang from the substantial capacity additions underway in China.\nAt LYB, we're leveraging the market trends that reinforce our strategy. We're growing our presence in cost-advantaged regions, upgrading our challenged positions and leveraging our technology to ensure a strong presence in attractive markets. We're also cultivating deep partnerships with governments and regulators to ensure a fair trade environment and working towards smart policies, especially in Europe that will provide critical support for our industry.\nNow with that, I will turn it over to Agustin to discuss capital allocation and the progress on our cash improvement plan.\n\nAgustin Izquierdo\n\nSenior vice president, Olefins & Polyolefins Americas & Refining\n\nThank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with Slide 8 and review the details of our third quarter capital allocation. As Peter mentioned, we generated $983 million of cash from operating activities, an improvement of over 2.5x relative to the prior quarter. During the quarter, we returned $443 million through dividends while funding $406 million of capital investment. Our team remains focused and committed to balanced and disciplined capital allocation as we navigate the cycle. Our investment-grade balance sheet remains our priority while we invest in safe and reliable operations and work to preserve shareholder returns. We continue to advance our strategic initiatives to build a stronger and more resilient LYB.\nToday, we are announcing a further reduction in our 2026 capital expenditures to $1.2 billion. We will continue to work to complete our MoReTec 1 chemical recycling facility in Germany as we work to optimize our 2026 spending on maintenance. We are continuing to make good progress on the value enhancement program, which remains on track to exceed our target for 2025. Similarly, our cash improvement plan is on track to deliver our $600 million target of incremental cash flow. Year-to-date, we have achieved $150 million in fixed cost reductions. I will review the progress on our cash improvement plan in more depth on the next slide. We are taking clear actions to ensure that we can continue to successfully navigate the cycle with a commitment to our investment-grade credit rating as the foundation of our disciplined capital allocation framework.\nPlease turn to Slide 9, and let's continue by reviewing the progress on our 2025 cash improvement plan. For this year, we are targeting $600 million of improvement through a combination of working capital, fixed costs and CapEx reductions as part of our total commitment to deliver $1.1 billion of improvement by the end of next year. We are making progress on working capital reductions through our traditional levers of managing inventories and payables. With this in mind, we are on track to meet our target of realizing approximately $200 million of working capital reductions.\nAs you all know, LYB has historically led the industry with a low-cost operating model. Nevertheless, we have identified further opportunities to streamline our operations and are on track to exceed our $200 million fixed cost reduction target by the end of 2025 and with year-to-date fixed cost reductions at approximately $150 million relative to our 2025 plan. And from a CapEx reduction standpoint, we are making progress to reduce spending on an accrued basis, but these reductions are impacted by timing of payments with cash realization currently trailing. We continue to prioritize safe and reliable operations while making progress on MoReTec 1 and delaying construction of Flex-2 and MoReTec 2 until we see market conditions improve. Together with working capital and fixed cost initiatives, these actions position us to deliver on our target to achieve $600 million of incremental cash flow in 2025.\nNow please turn to Slide 10 as we outline our cash generation. Over the past year, LyondellBasell generated $2.7 billion of cash from operating activities. Our team converted EBITDA into cash at a rate of 99% over the past 12 months and 135% during the third quarter, well above our long-term target of 80%. In the third quarter, we were able to maintain robust shareholder returns with dividends and share repurchases totaling $2 billion over the last 12 months. Our cash balance increased during the third quarter to end at $1.8 billion. We will continue to take proactive steps to protect our investment-grade balance sheet as we navigate the cycle.\nNow let's turn to Slide 11, and I'll provide a brief overview of our segment results. Our business portfolio generated $835 million of EBITDA during the third quarter. Profitability in Olefins and Polyolefins Americas improved with lower cost of ethylene due to co-product contributions coupled with less downtime following the successful completion of turnarounds at our Channelview complex in the second quarter. In Intermediates & Derivatives, improvements in oxyfuel margins were partially offset by planned maintenance at our La Porte, Texas acetyls facility and the normalization of unusually high second quarter styrene margins. In technology, subdued licensing activity impacted third quarter profitability, and all segments benefited from our progress on fixed cost reductions.\nThird quarter results included identified items of $1.2 billion, net of tax, primarily associated with asset write-downs in our O&P EAI and Advanced Polymer Solutions segments. Related to the prolonged downturn in the European petrochemical and global automotive industries. We have also updated the guidance for our 2025 full year effective tax rate to negative 13% primarily due to these noncash impairments recognized during the third quarter. In addition, our cash tax rate is expected to be substantially lower than our prior guidance. Please refer to our updated 2025 modeling guidance in the appendix to this slide deck describing impacts from planned maintenance and other useful financial metrics.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Kim.\n\nKimberly A. Foley\n\nEVP of Intermediates, Derivatives & Refining, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you, Agustin. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 12 with the performance of the Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment. During the third quarter, O&P Americas EBITDA was $428 million, an improvement of 35% quarter-on-quarter. Seasonally higher demand and increased utilization following our Channelview turnarounds supported sequential growth. For third quarter operating rates for the segment was approximately 85%, with our crackers running at approximately 95%. During the third quarter, North American olefins industry operating rates remained high, driven by -- 3% quarter-over-quarter supported by the restart of the Channelview assets.\nDuring 2025, operations of our Hyperzone polyethylene plant in La Porte have significantly improved with more uptime higher rates and increased on-spec production of the full range of premium products. We will perform some modifications at the plant in early 2026 that should allow our Hyperzone PE technology to reliably deliver high-quality premium products with performance advantages that our customers desire. This is part of our portfolio transformation towards more specialized applications.\nIn the fourth quarter, we expect typical seasonal trends of softer demand and customers' desire to minimize year-end inventories will pressure sales volumes. Nonetheless, producers are also seeking to minimize inventories and reductions in the industry operating rate are providing evidence of adjustments to market conditions. The balance of supply/demand will ultimately determine the success of our price increase initiatives. Sequentially higher natural gas and ethane prices are likely to result in somewhat higher costs during the fourth quarter, but we expect that this will be partially offset by our fixed cost reduction initiatives. Despite volatile oil prices, the favorable oil to gas ratio continues to provide an advantage to North American ethylene producers relative to oil-based production in other parts of the world. We remain focused on aligning our operating rates to manage working capital while serving domestic and export market demand. We expect to reduce our operating rates by 5% and are targeting 80% utilization across the segment during the fourth quarter.\nPlease turn to Slide 13 as we review the results of the Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. During the third quarter, the segment generated EBITDA of $48 million. Altogether, EBITDA for both O&P segments improved by 31%. In EAI, segment EBITDA remained relatively flat as operational improvements helped offset margin pressures in polymers due to weak demand. Despite fewer operational constraints on some of our own assets, polymer margins declined due to increased competition from imports originating in cost-advantaged regions such as North America and the Middle East. We continue to advance our strategic objectives in the regions as we progress on the proposed sale of the select European assets.\nAs part of this transaction, I am proud to share that we have achieved a major milestone with the signing of the sales and purchase agreement. This marks another step towards closing the transaction, which we expect to occur in the first half of 2026. The transaction is another example of our strategy to grow and upgrade the core through optimizing our portfolio for long-term value creation. Additionally, as part of our second strategic pillar to build a profitable CLCS business, we are making good progress on the construction of our MoReTec 1 facility in Wesseling, Germany. Major equipment deliveries are underway and structural steel is being installed to position us for a successful ramp-up in 2027.\nLooking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect similar seasonal softness in Europe. Rising feedstock costs are expected to add further pressure on margins. In response, we are taking steps to significantly reduce fourth quarter production. We intend to idle the larger of the 2 crackers in Wesseling, Germany, OM6, for at least 40 days during November and December. As such, we are targeting operating rates for approximately 60% across the segment during the fourth quarter.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Aaron.\n\nAaron Ledet\n\nExecutive Vice President of Intermediates & Derivatives\n\nThank you, Kim. Please turn to Slide 14 as we look at the Intermediates and Derivatives segment. In the third quarter, segment EBITDA sequentially increased to $303 million as improved margins for Oxyfuels were partially offset by planned maintenance downtime at our La Porte acetyls assets. Oxyfuels margins were supported by planned and unplanned outages that reduced the supply of high octane gasoline blend stocks in the Atlantic Basin. Our Bayport facility had a 3-week unplanned outage related to a third-party supplier, impacting EBITDA by approximately $15 million, while other notable outages included competitors along the Gulf Coast and in Western Africa.\nAs a result of our downtime, LYB operating rates across the segment fell 5 percentage points short of our goal of 80% rates for the third quarter. Styrene margins normalized following second quarter supply disruptions across the industry. In September, we began a planned turnaround of our acetyls assets that will continue into the fourth quarter. The turnaround will support the first steps of our catalyst conversion initiative aimed at improving margins and productivity while reducing our reliance on costly precious metals. As we navigate the cycle, our focus on operational excellence continues to deliver results.\nIn addition to executing on the La Porte turnaround, we recently achieved a milestone with our Channelview PO/TBA facility exceeding benchmark production rates during the quarter, reflecting focused execution and reliability across the site. Moving into the fourth quarter, we expect oxyfuels margins to moderate as typical year-end trends take hold in both gasoline and butane prices, although perhaps not as pronounced as in previous years. As part of our work to manage inventories, we will idle one of our PO/SM units in Channelview at the beginning of November for approximately 40 days. With this additional downtime, we expect to operate our I&D assets at a weighted average rate of approximately 75% during the fourth quarter.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Torkel.\n\nTorkel Rhenman\n\nExecutive Vice President of Advanced Polymer Solutions\n\nThank you, Aaron. Please turn to Slide 15 as we review results for the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $47 million as our cost discipline supported margin improvement to overcome headwinds in automotive markets. Global automotive production volumes declined as OEMs experienced typical downtime in the third quarter, and our volumes slightly declined due to lower demand from customers in the construction and electronics industries. EBITDA for the first 9 months of 2025 exceeded full year results for 2023 or 2024 clearly demonstrating the excellent progress the APS team is making to transform the business despite the challenging market environment.\nLooking ahead, we expect near-term demand to remain soft across key sectors and regions. Pricing pressures are partially offsetting the benefits of fixed cost reductions achieved through our cash improvement plan. The slightly challenging market backdrop, we remain laser focused in our work to transform our APS segment to a customer-centric growth business. With a 75% improvement in our Net Promoter Score with customers since 2023 and having been recognized with supplier excellence awards by customers like Toyota, Nissan and Stellantis amongst others, we continue to increase our growth funnel and improve our win rates to gain new project qualifications. We are proactively managing the business portfolio and remain confident that the work we are doing will profitably transform the APS business and enable us to achieve our long-term goals.\nWith that, I will return the call to Peter.\n\nPeter Z. E. Vanacker\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman of the Executive Board, Neste Oyj\n\nThank you, Torkel. Please turn to Slide 16, and I will discuss the results for the Technology segment on behalf of Jim Seward. Third quarter EBITDA of $15 million was lower than the guidance we provided during our second quarter call. Licensing profitability decreased as revenues declined and market dynamics remain challenging with very low licensing activity and lower catalyst volumes. We see licensing activity has dropped nearly 2/3 since its cyclical peak in 2018, with current levels comparable to the lows seen in the early 2000s. Underscoring the significant slowdown of investments in global petrochemical capacity. In contrast, margins for our catalyst increased on sales mix improvements. .\nIn the fourth quarter, we expect improved profitability as previously sold licenses achieved revenue milestones. Additionally, catalyst demand is expected to improve from the unusually low level seen in the third quarter. As a result, we estimate that the fourth quarter Technology segment results will be similar to the first quarter results.\nLet me share our views on our key regional and product markets on Slide 17. In line with earlier comments, we expect typical year-end seasonality and our actions to proactively reduce operating rates will create headwinds across most businesses, resulting in lower fourth quarter profitability. In the Americas, exports will continue to play a critical role in balancing markets. Despite a small uptick in fourth quarter ethane costs, the U.S. feedstock-based cost advantage is durable and will sustain regional competitiveness despite trade volatility.\nAs global trade flows adjust these structural advantages will continue to allow LYB to capture opportunities from cost advantaged U.S. production. Within Europe, fourth quarter demand is particularly weak and polyolefin pricing remains under pressure from increased imports from the Middle East and North America. Nonetheless, circularity initiatives continue to benefit from supportive regional regulations reinforcing consumer preferences for sustainable products in the region. In addition, accelerating capacity rationalizations will help to improve supply and demand balances across the industry.\nIn Asia, near-term capacity additions will continue to pressure regional supply and demand dynamics. That said, we remain cautiously optimistic as recent rationalization efforts in the region as well as China's anti-involution measures could provide partial offsets over the medium term. Within packaging markets, demand remains good even amid broader economic uncertainty has a shift towards value-driven consumption for packaged foods and other essential products sustained steady demand for our products. In building and construction markets, while lower interest rates are driving an increase in mortgage applications, affordability continues to constrain pent-up consumer demand for new and existing homes.\nIn automotive markets, forecasts have become less pessimistic in the industry as recent trade agreements are providing greater clarity and reducing uncertainty across the sector. Lastly, in oxyfuels, despite a strong October, the seasonal compression in gasoline crack spreads are expected to reduce profitability for the remainder of the year. However, we expect industry downtime will provide some modest support for margins relative to typical fourth quarter trends.\nAs we conclude today's call, I would like to acknowledge the resilience and discipline our team continues to demonstrate. Throughout the third quarter, we faced market headwinds and we will undoubtedly face more challenges before the year is done. But our team continues to make smart decisions while operating our assets safely and reliably to deliver on their commitments and provide value for customers. We continue to navigate the cycle with discipline, agility and a clear vision that will position LYB to emerge stronger and deliver lasting value for all our stakeholders. I am proud to lead this dedicated team as we continue taking strategic actions to reshape LYB, create value and position our company for sustainable success.\nNow with that, we are pleased to take your questions."

With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter.\n\nPeter Z. E. Vanacker\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman of the Executive Board, Neste Oyj\n\nThank you, Dave, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our second quarter results. Let's begin with Slide 3, where we highlight our continued leadership in safety performance at LYB.\nOur operational success starts with our core focus on safety. This is demonstrated by our June year-to-date top decile total recordable incident rate of 0.12 and we're proud of our improving safety records. Having maintained this track record during one of our largest turnarounds at our Channelview complex, despite significantly higher staffing levels underscores our commitment to safety and the fantastic performance of our team\nOur best safety performance enables our employees and contractors to return home safely day after day, keep our operations reliable and underpins financial value. On Slide 4, we highlight the strategic criteria to grow and upgrade the core, which we outlined at our Capital Markets Day in March 2023.\nYou may recall that growing and upgrading our core businesses is 1 of the 3 pillars of our strategy: to earn a place in our growth portfolio, assets should have leading market positions, exposure to growing end markets and offer an attractive rate of return. We're focusing our portfolio around assets with low-cost feedstocks in the United States and the Middle East while increasing our access to circular and renewable feedstocks in Europe and other regions, to support our strategy to grow our profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business.\nOver the past 3 years, we have established a track record of shaping our portfolio through acquisitions, divestitures and shutdowns in line with these consistent strategic priorities. We have been steadily transforming our company. And we're confident we are taking the appropriate steps to build a stronger and more resilient LYB.\nOn Slide 5, we give an overview of how we are repositioning our portfolio to enhance our cost advantage across key global reels through focused investments that increase our efficiency while preserving our long-term competitiveness and optionality. As shown in the chart on the top right, North America and the Middle East enjoy structural advantages with access to low-cost NGLP feedstocks and energy costs that can serve global markets supporting attractive returns throughout the cycle.\nAt the bottom right chart illustrates that operating rates are expected to remain high and stable in these advantaged regions. This is where LYB is growing its capacity in a disciplined way. We expect our capacity share in these regions will continue to increase and exceed 70% as we begin the next decade.\nIn Europe, high feedstock and energy costs, coupled with insufficient regulatory support has challenged the region's global competitiveness. Closures amounting to more than 20% and of European Italy capacity have been announced since the beginning of the decade. Capacity rationalization will help improve regional supply and demand balances, but will not change the fundamentals.\nLYB strategy in Europe is to increasingly focus our production on recycled and renewable feedstocks to produce profitable and sustainable solutions to serve the local markets. Recycled and renewable feedstocks sourced in Europe are expected to be cost advantaged relative to other regions in the world. We also expect markets for circular plastics to be dominated by local drivers rather than global ones.\nWe are rightsizing our European asset base and alignment with our strategy and focusing our resources on innovation and growth in sustainable solutions that create value. An example of this is our commercial scale MoReTec 1 chemical recycling plants currently under construction in Germany, which uses LYB's proprietary advanced recycling technology to meet the current and growing demand for circular plastics.\nThe rapid growth of petrochemical capacity in China has created much concern regarding the impact of overproduction on global markets. With high cost of production, Chinese polyethylene has not been globally competitive and growing capacity in China has been accompanied by falling local operating rates.\nWe're closely following the latest actions from the NDRC in China that potentially could lead to closures of the least competitive assets. Despite a significant growth in capacity, China has shown over the past several years that China remains a net importer of Polyethylene from cost-advantaged regions.\nOur strategy in China is to ensure our access to this important global markets by maintaining a strong technical and commercial presence with a relatively light asset footprint that includes APS and circular solutions to effectively support our local customers. These regional trends reinforce our strategy, to maintain and grow our presence in cost-advantaged regions, optimize our European footprint and ensure strong market access in Asia.\nTurning to Slide 6. Let's review the cumulative cash impact of our actions to conserve and strengthen cash flows into 2026. During last quarter's call, we introduced our cash improvement plan, which is focused on delivering near-term enhancements to cash flow.\nFor 2025, we are targeting approximately $200 million of reductions in working capital driven by the traditional levers of inventory and payables management. But we also have unique opportunities to improve cash flow, such as the monetization of excess precious metals inventories made possible by the innovation of a new catalyst for our vinyl acetate production.\nIn parallel, our fixed cost reduction initiatives remain on track to deliver at $200 million through organizational streamlining. We've also decided to delay activities on selected growth investments until market conditions improve. For 2025, this will result in an additional $100 million reduction in CapEx and bring our 2025 CapEx guidance down to $1.7 billion.\nThis reflects a $200 million reduction from our initial guidance for 2025. We will continue to invest in sustaining capital to ensure our assets run safely and reliably when the cycle inevitably rebounds. These actions mean that our cash improvement plan is on track to achieve a run rate of $600 million and incremental cash flow for 2025 compared to the $500 million we announced last quarter.\nAnd we're taking further steps to maximize our cash flows into 2026. We're identifying measures to free up an additional $200 million through working capital and fixed cost reductions by the end of 2026. In addition, we expect that a timely and successful closing of the sale of our European assets will further free up cash.\nWe're also reducing our 2026 CapEx by $300 million from 2025 levels down to $1.4 billion, largely by deferring construction of our Flex 2 project.\nEconomics for the Flex 2 projects continue to be highly attractive and our strategic rationale remains intact. We will reassess timing once market conditions inevitably improve, preserving this real option for profitable growth. In total, these incremental actions combined with the original cash improvement plan are expected to increase cash flow by at least $1.1 billion during 2025 and 2026 to further protect our resilient balance sheet, navigator cycle and preserve maximum financial flexibility.\nOur liquidity position remains strong and our debt maturity profile is very favorable. Please turn to Slide 7 as we review the financials for the quarter. Earnings were $0.62 per share with EBITDA of $715 million. EBITDA improved sequentially with less downtime and lower feedstock costs. As expected, cash generation resumed this quarter.\nCash returns to shareholders remain robust at more than $500 million as we increased our ordinary dividend and continued our opportunistic share repurchases. I will now hand over the call to Augustin to elaborate on our capital allocation strategy and financial progress.\n\nAgustin Izquierdo\n\nSenior vice president, Olefins & Polyolefins Americas & Refining\n\nThank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 8, we start with a longer-term view of our CapEx. We continually assess our capital allocation strategy as we navigate the ups and downs of the petrochemical cycle. This is not an activity we started this year. These assessments are part of our continual efforts to optimize our business.\nAs you can see from the chart, we have reduced our cumulative CapEx budget by approximately $2.4 billion relative to the plans we described at Capital Markets Day in March of 2023, supporting cash shareholder returns. Our first priority for capital investment is to always maintain safe and reliable operations across our existing asset base.\nThis commitment ensures we maintain flexibility and readiness to capture the commercial opportunities when market conditions improve. Following the planned sale of our European assets in 2026, we expect to invest approximately $1.1 billion per year on sustaining capital for our asset base.\nIn addition, investment in our MoReTec One chemical recycling asset in Cologne, Germany continues as planned. Construction is going well, and we look forward to operating this innovative technology at scale and contributing to our profitability. Outside of these 2 key priorities, we are making significant adjustments to our CapEx profile.\nFollowing board approval in November last year, we remain confident that Flex 2 is an attractive project that helps address our monomer balances while generating strong returns. However, having finalized front engineering and design, but not yet started construction, we have made the decision to defer this project until market conditions improve.\nWe have also decided to defer a final investment decision on MoReTec 2. This project would be a second commercial scale chemical recycling plant using our proprietary MoReTec technology to be built on the site where we previously operated the Houston refinery. We continue to believe that the combination of our proprietary MoReTec technology and our existing infrastructure will provide LYB with a material competitive advantage as we establish ourselves as a profitable leader in the circular economy.\nBut given uncertainty in the timing of the market recovery, we will postpone this investment decision until market conditions improve. This delay allows our teams the necessary time to ensure that offtake commitments from brand owners are in place prior to a final investment decision.\nUpdates to our capital plan and other modeling information are described in the appendix to this slide deck. Now let's continue with Slide 9 and examine a broader overview of our capital allocation in the second quarter. We are navigating this prolonged cyclical downturn while continuing to advance our strategic initiatives to build a stronger and more resilient LYB.\nAs Peter mentioned, we made significant progress on our portfolio management in Europe. The value enhancement program remains on track, and our cash improvement plan is on target to add $600 million of cash flow to fund our progress. During the quarter, positive cash from operations helped fund capital investments, dividends and share buybacks as we continued to repurchase our shares at attractive prices.\nWe are taking [indiscernible] actions to ensure that we can continue to navigate the cycle successfully with a commitment to our investment-grade credit rating as the foundation of our disciplined capital allocation framework.\nPlease turn to Slide 10 as we outline our cash generation. Our team converted EBITDA into cash at a rate of 75% over the past 12 months, close to our long-term target of 80%, while our average since 2020 remains well above our through-cycle target. In the second quarter, we maintained strong shareholder returns with dividends and share repurchases totaling $2.1 billion over the last 12 months. At the end of the second quarter, our cash balance was $1.7 billion. This is higher than our cash balance of $1.5 billion, and we have sufficient financial flexibility to navigate lower levels if necessary.\nNow let's turn to Slide 11, and I'll provide a brief overview of our segment results. Our business portfolio generated $715 million of EBITDA during the second quarter. Lower feedstock costs provided a modest tailwind for our global olefins and polyolefins and intermediates and derivatives segments. Profitability in Olefins and Polyolefins Americas improved with less downtime following the successful completion of several turnarounds at our Channelview complex in the second quarter. With that, I will turn the call over to Kim.\n\nKimberly A. Foley\n\nEVP of Intermediates, Derivatives & Refining, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you, Augustin. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 12 with the performance of Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment. Second quarter O&P Americas EBITDA was $318 million, a more than 25% improvement relative to the first quarter, largely due to the higher integrated polyethylene margins following less downtime.\nPlanned maintenance continued in the second quarter as we completed safe and successful turnarounds at our Channelview complex on time and on budget in April. Our second quarter operating rate was in line with guidance at 85% with our crackers running at approximately 90%.\nDuring the second quarter, the American polyolefins industry experienced volatility as markets adapted to an evolving tariff landscape. Tariff announcements pressured export volumes and drove a decrease in April polyethylene contract prices. In May, higher domestic demand, declining inventories and improving export volumes generated positive momentum resulting in a successful price increase during June.\nSecond quarter domestic sales for the U.S. and Canada polyethylene industry rebounded to the highest volumes since the second quarter of 2022, effectively bridging this prolonged downturn. And despite rising production, Producers' inventories for the North American PE industry declined by 3 days of sales during the second quarter.\nIn the near term, we expect continued steady demand and a June price increase to provide tailwinds for the integrated polyethylene margins during the third quarter. Our operating rates are expected to remain strong with higher cracker operating rates following our Channelview turnaround, and we are targeting 85% utilization across the segment during the third quarter.\nPlease turn to Slide 13 as we review the results of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. During the second quarter, the segment generated EBITDA of $46 million. Segment EBITDA improved as lower naphtha and LPG feedstock costs drove margin improvements, rising seasonal demand provided pricing support. We continue to make progress on our strategic objectives, and we're pleased to announce the proposed sale of our 4 European O&P assets in June.\nThe significant milestone is another example of our progress over the past 3 years to optimize our portfolio as we grow and upgrade the core. In the early weeks of the third quarter, our order books reflect steady summer demand for olefins and polyolefins. Nevertheless, we remain watchful for the potential effects of volatile trade policies. We are targeting operating rates at approximately 75% during the third quarter. With that, I will turn it over to Aaron.\n\nAaron Ledet\n\nExecutive Vice President of Intermediates & Derivatives\n\nThank you, Kim. Please turn to Slide 14 as we look at the Intermediates and Derivatives segment. In the second quarter, segment EBITDA was $290 million, an increase of $71 million, primarily driven by improved margins for styrene and propylene oxide. Starting margins benefited from lower benzene feedstock costs as well as short-term supply disruptions across the industry.\nIn contrast, oxyfuels margins remain near winter lows as low crude prices, weak gasoline crack spreads and trade volatility limited typical summertime seasonal improvements. As we move through the third quarter, planned industry outages and oxyfuels could provide some margin improvement, although margins are likely to remain low compared to normal summertime levels. Styrene margins are likely to decline as industry operating rates return to typical levels following unplanned downtime.\nIn September, we will begin a planned turnaround of our [La Porte acetyls]indiscernible] assets. The turnaround includes initiatives to begin converting our vinyl acetate monomer, or VAM, production to an innovative LYB catalyst that improves margins and reduces our utilization of costly precious metals.\nSales of precious metal inventories have contributed at least $50 million towards our cash improvement plan during 2025. As we continue to match our production with market demand and start our planned maintenance, we expect to operate our IND assets at a weighted average rate of approximately 80% during the third quarter. With that, I will turn the call over to Torkel.\n\nTorkel Rhenman\n\nExecutive Vice President of Advanced Polymer Solutions\n\nThank you, Aaron. Please turn to Slide 15 as we review results for the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $40 million, similar to the improved profitability levels we delivered in the first quarter despite ongoing challenges in automotive markets.\nAutomotive production volumes remains sluggish, and our volumes slightly declined due to lower demand from construction and electronics. Looking ahead, we expect demand in our key regions and sectors to remain soft. Auto production is expected to decline due to typical third quarter downtime. However, we expect our cost-saving measures will improve cash generation during the third quarter.\nDespite the challenging market backdrop, we remain steadfast in transforming our APS business. We have already made strong progress on increasing win rates with customers and gaining new project qualifications. Additionally, we are focusing on cost reductions to improve the resilience of the business. We are on the right track to deliver on our long-term goals to profitably transform the APS business. With that, I'll return the call to Peter.\n\nPeter Z. E. Vanacker\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman of the Executive Board, Neste Oyj\n\nThank you, Torkel. Please turn to Slide 16, and I will discuss the results for the Technology segment on behalf of Jim Seward. Second quarter EBITDA of $34 million was lower than the guidance we provided during our first quarter call. Catalyst volumes improved, but margins declined due to inventory cost adjustments and changes in sales mix.\nSecond quarter licensing profitability remained flat as polyolefin licensing activity across the industry remained subdued, showing a substantially low depth of new petrochemical capacities. We expect third quarter results for the Technology segment will be similar to the second quarter results as margins improve on Catalyst sales mix offset by the low activity in licensing markets.\nNow let me share our views on our key regional and product markets on Slide 17. As we enter the third quarter, we expect global 3 flows will continue to adapt to a dynamic tariff and trade policy landscape. We're hopeful that the trade environment will stabilize and enable higher consumer confidence and trade flows.\nIn the Americas, solid domestic and export demand is expected to drive improved pricing. Notably, polyethylene prices rose in June, reflecting the strengthening market environment and providing tailwinds for third quarter profitability. Second quarter U.S. and Canada domestic sales volumes the polyethylene industry were the highest since the beginning of this downturn in the second quarter of 2022.\nOur producer inventories are falling as we enter the peak months of the U.S. hurricane season. Within Europe, favorable costs for naphtha and other feedstocks coupled with steady summertime seasonal demands are supporting modest improvements in integrated polyethylene margins. Additionally, capacity rationalizations across the region continue to improve supply and demand balances across the industry.\nIn Asia, near-term capacity additions are still pressuring regional supply and demand balances. That said, we're cautiously optimistic on China's stimulus programs and longer-term rationalization efforts, which could provide support in future quarters. In packaging markets, global demand remained steady even amid broader economic uncertainty as consumer needs for packaged foods and other essential products support underlying resilience.\nHowever, in building and construction markets, demand remains constrained, with new housing starts and existing home sales showing continued weakness. Within automotive markets, we continue to monitor the impact of tariff volatility, which is contributing to ongoing uncertainty. Late summer downtime across the industry typically pressures third quarter production volumes.\nFinally, oxyfuels this summer driving season has not generated expected margin improvements. Margins are expected to remain low for the remainder of the summer season due to low crude prices and weak gasoline crack spreads. Our disciplined approach to optimizing operations across our global network ensures we are well positioned to capitalize on market dynamics.\nWe are closely monitoring evolving tariffs and global trade flows and we continue to evaluate both the risks and opportunities they present to our business. Now as we turn to Slide 18, let me summarize how we continue to navigate the cycle while executing on our long-term strategy. As we move through the cycle, we are focused on execution and staying disciplined in how we operate.\nLast quarter, we introduced our cash improvement plan, and we are now on track to deliver $600 million in 2025, above our original target of $500 million. We are achieving this by optimizing our organizational structure, improving working capital efficiency and reducing CapEx. This disciplined approach extends to the actions we are taking into 2026 as we make purposeful decisions to preserve cash and protect our balance sheet while supporting shareholder returns. As I previously mentioned, we have made the decision to delay building our Flex 2 project to reduce near-term capital outlays, while preserving real options for future growth.\nAt the same time, we continue to prioritize sustaining capital and reliability investments. These are nonnegotiable and ensure the stability of our operations and the safety of our people. We've also taken strategic actions across our portfolio to strengthen long-term profitability.\nOur VEP continues to remain on track to meet our 2025 targets. And in addition, the planned sale of our 4 European assets will reduce recurring CapEx and other costs in the region. We are rebalancing our global footprint towards more cost advantaged regions while aligning our growth investments with market realities.\nTogether, these steps reflect our discipline as we navigate this cycle. I am proud to lead this dedicated team as we continue taking strategic actions to create value, reshape LYB and position our company for sustainable future success. Now with that, we're pleased to take your questions."

E. Vanacker\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman of the Executive Board, Neste Oyj\n\nThank you, Dave, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our first quarter results. These are challenging and volatile times, but I am proud that our team continues to navigate extremely well. Let's begin with Slide 3, where we highlight continued leadership in safety performance, LYB. Our operational success starts with our core focus on safety. Our goal zero commitment is to operate with 0 incidents through ownership, excellence and teamwork. This is demonstrated by our March year-to-date total recordable incident rate of 0.12, improving on our very low rates from 2023 and 2024.\nWe see continuous improvement across all aspects of our business, but it is particularly meaningful to see this progress in our safety performance, which enables our employees and contractors to return home safely day after day, keeping our operations reliable and underpinning financial value. and deeply grateful for the commitment and dedication our team has shown.\nOn Slide 4, we highlight how we continue to focus on executing our strategy and taking decisive steps while navigating a prolonged downturn and adapting to elevated market uncertainty. Since launching our new strategy at our Capital Markets Day in March 2023, we have been actively reshaping our portfolio. In 2023, we closed our Italian polypropylene assets. Last year, we sold the EO&D business and we see refining operations in February of this year. In March, we announced the closure of our Dutch PO joint venture with Covestro. And we intend to update you on the progress for the remaining 5 assets in our European strategic review by the middle of this year. The portfolio management activities we have executed since 2023 have reduced our annual fixed cost expenditures by approximately $300 million net of onetime costs and the reduced ongoing cost we expect for the Houston refinery side.\nOur value enhancement program, or VEP, continues to build momentum and deliver value to the bottom line as it becomes part of our everyday way of doing business at LB. We are on track to unlock $1 billion in recurring annual EBITDA by the end of this year with $50 million of this coming from fixed cost reductions. Additional fixed cost reductions were expected following our European strategic review. The remaining 5 sites incurred fixed costs of approximately $500 million in 2024. We managed our capital expenditures wisely throughout the cycle. In 2023, we finished the year with CapEx investments that were approximately $100 million below our initial guidance. And in 2024, we reduced our spending by approximately $300 million relative to guidance. Our proactive approach to working capital management delivered $100 million of cash in 2024. This exemplifies our commitment to responsible cash management and capital deployment. We are continuing this momentum while responding to the current market environment with an additional $500 million cash improvement plan that is highly focused on improving cash flows during 2025. This is the deepest and longest downturn of my career. And while this is likely to be prolonged by volatile trade policies, I remain confident that we will eventually see a recovery. Our plan is to navigate the downturn without compromising our strategy and emerge stronger, more resilient and more profitable than before.\nOur 2025 cash improvement plan or CIP, has 3 initiatives. The first is a $100 million reduction in capital expenditures. Our MoReTec 1 and Flex 2 growth projects and sustaining CapEx for safety and reliability will remain priorities as we defer some of our smaller growth investments. Our second initiative of the CIP is an additional $200 million reduction in our working capital targets for the year. In addition to typical levers for managing inventories and payables. One example from our initiative is capturing value from strong markets for precious metals by reducing excess catalyst inventories.\nThe third initiative entails at least $200 million in additional fixed cost savings by further streamlining our organization across our manufacturing, business and corporate functions. These are difficult but necessary decisions required by these challenging times. And as you can see, these types of actions are not new to LYB. We have been steadily transforming our company over the past 2 years, and we are confident that we are taking appropriate steps to build a stronger and more resilient LYB. Needless to say, tariff risk is at top of mind of everyone.\nOn Slide 5, we give some context on why we believe our robust global supply network served as well during prior trade volatility and is well placed to provide resilience across a range of trade scenarios. The company's global supply network is mainly positioned to serve local demands for our polyethylene and polypropylene polymers approximately 75% is sold in local markets and not subject to direct impact from tariffs. In the U.S., our domestic market share for PE is typically 10 percentage points higher than the North American industry.\nGlobally, less than 10% of our polyolefin sales volumes are likely to see direct impacts from escalating tariffs and counter-tariffs involving U.S. trades. And if trade barriers end up impacting our cost advantage U.S. exports, we have the ability to shift supply toward cost advantage production in Saudi Arabia, and then backfill said trade with U.S. volumes. LYB understands the optionality embedded in our global supply network. And just like in the past, our teams have immediately started optimizing trade flows. The same principles apply to our propylene oxide business.\nWe outlined our global supply network on Slide 21 of the appendix to this slide deck. Of course, the secondary effects of tariffs are more complex and remain a source of uncertainty. But even amid global economic volatility, we remain confident in the resilient consumer demand for packaged foods, health care and other essential solutions for everyday life enabled by our products. Our cost advantaged feedstock positions place us at a favorable spot on the global cost curve. And our investment-grade balance sheet enables us to remain steadfast in our strategy and continue to execute projects that will serve us well when markets inevitably recover.\nOn Slide 6, we turn to one of those projects, Flex 2, where we reached a final investment decision milestone in the first quarter. Our new Flex 2 project aligns with our strategic pillar to grow and upgrade the core. The project leverages of our cost advantaged feedstock position and proven technology to convert ethylene into higher-value propylene at the cost of only a few pennies per pound. This technology has greater reliability, lower capital intensity and lower carbon intensity -- 10 competing technologies such as propane dehydrogenation. The project also benefits from the capability to upgrade 4 carbon or C4 streams into high-value coproducts and capture synergies with our existing Flex units to further boost profitability. This new capacity will profitably reduce our net long ethylene position in North America.\nOur net short propylene position, which was increased by the exit from refining will also be reduced. Flex 2 will strengthen our market position and reduce monomer costs for our downstream polypropylene and propylene oxide businesses. We will start construction later this year, and expect to begin operations in late 2028. The financial return profile for the project is strong with an IRR in the mid-teens and an estimated EBITDA benefit of approximately $150 million per year post startup. We plan to spend approximately $800 million in CapEx for the project with peak spend of about $300 million expected next year.\nOn Slide 7, we outlined our awards for a new feedstock allocation in Saudi Arabia that will enable a longer-term joint project with [ Sipchem ]. The allocation from the Saudi Arabian Minister of Energy provides sufficient ethane and butane feedstocks to support a 1.5 million metric ton ethylene cracker with downstream 40 olefin derivatives. The Saudi project is expected to include the LYB proprietary category technology for producing specialized elastomeric polyolefins used in roofing membranes and other high-value applications. We currently operate 4 catalog plants around the world. The plant in Ferrara, Italy is shown in the photograph. LYB and Sipchem have launched a joint feasibility study for a complex in due bail that could start up as soon as 2031 pending FID. With LYBs 40% position, the value of our process technology and catalyst contributions supported by funding from project-based debt, this project with Sipchem fits our strategy for disciplined growth.\nPlease turn to Slide 8 as we review the financials for the quarter. Earnings were $0.33 per share with EBITDA of nearly $600 million. Profitability was impacted by the challenging backdrop and a significant turnaround of our Channelview complex. Cash returns to shareholders remained robust at approximately $500 million. as our ordinary dividend was supplemented by opportunistic share repurchases during the quarter.\nI will now hand over the call to Agustin to elaborate on our financial progress.\n\nAgustin Izquierdo\n\nSenior vice president, Olefins & Polyolefins Americas & Refining\n\nThank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 9, and let me start by discussing our cash generation. Our team converted EBITDA into cash at a rate of 87% over the past 12 months, above our long-term target of 80%. Over the past quarter, LyondellBasell used $579 million of cash from operating activities. Our cash flow was impacted by an expected seasonal build in working capital due to maintenance and improving demand. As Peter mentioned, we are targeting an additional $200 million of working capital reductions from our 2025 plan with the cash improvement plan. First quarter cash taxes were higher than normal as Hurricane Beryl tax relief in 2024 allowed us to defer cash tax payments until February of this year.\nIn the first quarter, we maintained strong shareholder returns with dividends and share repurchases totaling $2.1 billion over the last 12 months. At the end of the first quarter, our cash balance was $1.9 billion.\nNow let's continue with Slide 10 and review the details of our first quarter capital allocation. During the quarter, we returned $433 million to shareholders through dividends and $110 million in share repurchases while funding $483 million of capital investment. Our team remains focused on being responsible stewards of capital. We are growing in a sensible and disciplined way while working to unlock additional cash from our cash improvement plan. As the new CFO, I am totally committed to maintaining our investment-grade balance sheet, which enables us to execute on our strategy while delivering meaningful shareholder returns, including growing the dividend.\nLet's now turn to Slide 11, and I'll provide a brief overview of our segment results. Our business portfolio generated $576 million of EBITDA during the first quarter. In the Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment, planned and unplanned maintenance reduced EBITDA by $200 million with additional headwinds from lower integrated polyethylene margins driven by higher feedstock costs. Improved utilization and margins in our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment and good performance in our APS segment provided a partial offset.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Kim.\n\nKimberly A. Foley\n\nEVP of Intermediates, Derivatives & Refining, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you, Agustin. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 12 with the performance of the Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment. During the first quarter, O&P Americas EBITDA was $251 million. the company's first quarter performance was impacted by planned and unplanned downtime. Our first quarter operating rate was in line with the expectations with our crackers operating at approximately 80%. The turnaround at our Channelview complex significantly impacted results due to the downtime on the olefin unit and the reduced co-product contributions associated with maintenance on our Flex 1 and C4 processing units. We also experienced an unplanned outage at our Lake Charles JV that resulted in several weeks of downtime. And during the last quarter's call, we discussed the impacts of winter storm Enzo in January.\nHigher feedstock costs resulted in additional headwinds for the integrated polyethylene margins. North American industry demand for polyolefins had a soft start in 2025 with March year-to-date polyethylene and polypropylene sales volumes down 2% and 1%, respectively. While domestic PE demand has remained solid and growing tariff uncertainty has led to hesitancy in export markets.\nAs Peter mentioned, if trade policies challenge U.S. polyethylene exports, we are confident our cost advantage will allow USPE to find alternative markets. LYB remains well positioned as a top North American producer with a leading product portfolio a strong domestic market share and robust customer relationships built over decades.\nWhile feedstock and natural gas costs are currently in decline, the forward curve leads us to remain cautious on cost for the remainder of the year. But today, retaliatory tariffs on U.S. ethane shipments to China are serving to reduce exports and benefit U.S. ethane costs. As for we expect our operating rates to improve in second quarter as -- shown remains on track for our successful turnaround and is starting back up as we speak. With this, we are targeting 85% utilization across the segment during the second quarter.\nPlease turn to Slide 13 as we review the results of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. In the first quarter, the segment generated EBITDA of $17 million, of which more than $30 million was generated during the month of March and Europe. Segment EBITDA improved significantly as cracker utilization increased to approximately 80% in the first quarter from the 55% in the fourth quarter. The increase resulted from the completion of a turnaround at our largest European cracker and improved operational flexibility.\nCracker margins improved due to tailwinds from the lower feedstock costs. Polyolefins margins also expanded with higher prices. In the European market, we see modest signs of seasonal improvement but the economic outlook remains uncertain due to the potential impacts from trade volatility. We are encouraged by the German stimulus measures and we remain watchful for signs of this translating into meaningful improvement in the end market demand. We continue to make progress on our strategic objectives in the O&P EAI segment. Our European strategic review is underway, and we should have more to share by the middle of this year regarding the 5 O&P assets under review. With additional seasonal demand improvements balanced by some operating constraints on our assets, we are targeting operating rates of approximately 75% during the second quarter.\nWith that, I will hand it over to Aaron.\n\nAaron Ledet\n\nExecutive Vice President of Intermediates & Derivatives\n\nThank you, Kim. Please turn to Slide 14 as we look at the Intermediates and Derivatives segment. In the first quarter, segment EBITDA was $211 million, a decline of $39 million, primarily driven by margin compression and acetyls and oxyfuels. Oxyfuel margins fell due to lower blend premiums and volumes were impacted by some delays in vessel shipments. Acetyl margins declined on higher costs due to increased natural gas prices. winter demand for aircraft de-icing fluids drove modest volume improvements for propylene oxide.\nLast month, we made the difficult decision to permanently close our Dutch PO JV with Covestro. As we grow and upgrade the core, we need to ensure each of our assets remain a strategic fit for LYB. We take our obligations to our employees, unions and all stakeholders very seriously. And we thank them for the constructive dialogue. We will safely and responsibly shut down the asset and fulfill our obligations to our stakeholders. As we move through the second quarter, we expect improved seasonal demand across most of our IND businesses. And the start of the summer driving season will likely lead to improvements in oxyfuels margins. We will continue to match our production with market demand and expect to operate our IND assets at rates of approximately 85% during the second quarter.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Torkel.\n\nTorkel Rhenman\n\nExecutive Vice President of Advanced Polymer Solutions\n\nThank you, Aaron. Please turn to Slide 15 as we review results for the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. First quarter EBITDA was $46 million, 30% above the prior year and 3x our underlying fourth quarter profitability. Despite challenging end markets, the APS transformation is delivering results. With some help from seasonally stronger demand our team improved profitability and gained market share by focusing on how LYB can add value for our APS customers. The team has made substantial progress in building back trust with strategic customers and increasing our win rate to gain new project qualifications. At the same time, our transformation is taking a sensible approach to optimizing fixed cost and working capital to increase cash flow from the business.\nLooking ahead, underlying demand is likely to remain challenged in our key U.S. and European automotive end markets. Tariffs will likely provide additional headwinds. Nonetheless, we expect our transformation will continue to grow APS volumes at rates that exceed the growth of our end markets while protecting margins and improving cash conversion. We are on the right track to deliver on our long-term goals to profitably transform the ATS business.\nWith that, I will return the call to Peter.\n\nPeter Z. E. Vanacker\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman of the Executive Board, Neste Oyj\n\nThank you, Torkel. Please turn to Slide 16, and I will discuss the results for the Technology segment on behalf of Jim Seward. First quarter EBITDA of $52 million was lower than the guidance we provided during our fourth quarter call. First quarter licensing profitability declines consistent with our guidance. LYB is selling fewer licenses than last year as the pace of global polyolefin capacity additions moderates. First quarter catalyst volumes improved over fourth quarter results, but March shipments were lower than our guidance as some customers delayed orders in response to economic uncertainty. We expect the second quarter results for the Technology segment will be similar to these first quarter results.\nNow let me share our views on our key regional and product markets on Slide 17. As discussed by our business leaders, we expect to see typical seasonal demand improvements into the second quarter across most of our businesses. In the Americas, lower costs for natural gas, ethane and other NGL feedstocks are providing tailwinds for second quarter profitability. At the same time, trade policy volatility is likely to shift trade flows and result in near-term trade disruptions as markets adjust. Within Europe, Margin pressures are expected to ease somewhat supported by lower feedstock costs, while reduced import volumes could contribute to improved pricing power in the region.\nIn the meantime, industry rationalization continues to tighten supply and demand balances. With a recent competitor announcement, Italian capacity rationalizations in Europe are approaching 3 million tons or over 13% of regional capacity. While signals of near-term market recovery remain muted, German stimulus measures are expected to provide a measure of medium-term support for the European chemicals sector. Sentiment in China remain subdued as ongoing trade escalations continue to weigh on market confidence. We are closely monitoring both tariff developments and the additional stimulus measures that could potentially shift market dynamics.\nIn packaging markets, we continue to see steady demand, even amid global economic uncertainty as consumer needs for packaged foods and other essential products support underlying resilience. We continue to have a strong order book. In building and construction markets, modest demand growth for U.S. existing homes is likely to be offset by weaker activity in other regions. Within automotive markets, underlying demand is likely to remain challenged in both U.S. and Europe. The potential for trade disruptions and tariff-related volatility are generating headwinds to growth in the sector. And in oxyfuels, the summer driving season is expected to support improved gasoline crack spreads. However, lower crude prices amid ongoing economic uncertainty and weaker oil to gas ratio are likely to limit the extent of margin recovery.\nOur focus remains on strong operations and optimization across our global footprint, to capture market opportunities. Even amid economic uncertainty, the scale of our asset base and the flexibility of our integrated network provides optionality to navigate shifting market dynamics and an ever-changing landscape.\nNow let me summarize our outlook and our progress on our long-term strategy on Slide 18. We continue to grow and upgrade our core through targeted organic growth projects and portfolio management, including our ongoing European strategic review. The exits from our refining business this year was a key milestone in reshaping our portfolio for long-term value creation. We estimate our portfolio actions thus far provide approximately $300 million of fixed cost reduction. We are pursuing disciplined growth in our circular and low-carbon solutions business as we advance on the construction of MoReTec 1, our first commercial scale chemical recycling facility that will strengthen our technology and cost advantage. Today, we described how we are continuing to adapt to broader macroeconomic uncertainty with the launch of our additional $500 million cash improvement plan. In combination with more than $1 billion in recurring annual EBITDA, we expect to unlock through our value enhancement program by the end of this year. We're building a stronger, more resilient and more profitable LYB. And finally, we will continue our focus on disciplined capital allocation and cash flow optimization to maintain our commitment to a strong and growing dividend as a central component of our shareholder returns. I am proud to lead this dedicated team as we take decisive actions to create value, reshape ARB and position our company for sustainable future success.\nNow with that, we're pleased to take your questions."

At the request of Lyondell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may begin.\n\nDavid Kinney\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Before we begin the discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at investors.lyondellbasell.com.\nToday, we will be discussing our business results when I can reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are also available on our Investor Relations website.\nComments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results using non-GAAP financial measures, such as EBITDA and earnings per share, excluding identified items. Additional documents on our Investor website provide reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release and our business results discussion.\nA recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time today until March 2, by calling (877) 660-6853 in the United States and (201) 612-7415 outside the United States. The access code for both numbers is 13746203.\nJoining today's call will be Peter Vanacker, Lindelpsell's Chief Executive Officer; our current CFO, Michael McMurray; our incoming CFO, Augustine [indiscernible]; Kim Foley, our Executive Vice President of Global Olefins and Polyolefins and Refining; Aaron Lavey, our EVP of Intermediates and Derivatives; and Torkel Raman, our EVP of Advanced Polymer Solutions.\nDuring today's call, we will focus on fourth quarter and full year 2024 results and progress on our strategic initiatives. We will also discuss current market dynamics and our near-term outlook.\nWith that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter.\n\nPeter Z. E. Vanacker\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman of the Executive Board, Neste Oyj\n\nThank you, Dave, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2024 results. I'm very proud of how our people navigated challenges leveraged our strengths and remained laser-focused on our strategy throughout a year that was not easy for our industry, particularly, the fourtth quarter.\nLet's begin, as we always do with our safety results on Slide 3. During 2024, our employees and contractors demonstrated their commitment to outstanding safety performance. I am proud to share that our total recordable injury rate for 2024 was 0.13, our second lowest year for the company. Even more impressive, as LYB continues to grow, we achieved the lowest number of injuries in our history. This truly is a testament to our Goal Zero commitment to safety and operational excellence.\nWith such an impressive safety record, I would like to take a moment to highlight some of the amazing milestones to we have reached this year. We celebrated 6 sites surpassing 10-plus years of no injuries, and our APS segment had record-breaking safety performance, reducing their incident rates by 39% compared to 2023.\nOperating safely is a prerequisite to achieving high reliability and creating shareholder value. I applaud our team for what we have achieved in 2024 and look forward to carrying this momentum into 2025 as we continue to strive for Goal Zero performance.\nLet's now turn to Slide 4 to discuss our financial results. There is no getting around it, 2024 was another challenging year for petrochemicals. However, in spite of the headwinds, our strategic focus on value creation, maximize cash generation, and delivered solid returns to shareholders.\nEarnings were $6.40 per share with EBITDA of $4.3 billion. generated $3.8 billion of cash from operations with an outstanding 90% cash discussion ratio. We returned $1.9 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and repurchases.\nNow let's turn to Slide 5, and take a moment to reflect on where LYB and the industry or in the current cycle. Across our key businesses, fourth quarter industry margins are about 60% of historical averages, underscoring the depth of the current downturn.\nLet me share 3 thoughts on this challenging environment: first, this deep and prolonged downturn is not permanent. Global demand for durable goods will inevitably return following this post pandemic downturn; second, LYB has the potential to capture substantial upside from the cyclical recovery in volumes and margins; and third, LIBs strategic progress in unlocking incremental value could enable us to surpass our historical cycle performance.\nThe opportunity is apparent in our sizable polypropylene business, where fourth quarter margins are less than 50% of historical averages. And operating rates or at least 5 to 10 percentage points below industry norms, reflecting the severity of the downturn.\nFor polyethylene, the margin compression is smaller. -- but the higher unit margins for the integrated value chain provide meaningful upside. In contrast, our oxyfuels business is currently experiencing typical fourth quarter seasonality. But the recent peak seen in 2023, when full year margins averaged $560 per tonne, provide a measure of the upside available for this business.\nWe recognize that certain dynamics represent more than just typical cyclical pressures. They also reflect some structural shifts in the industry relative to prior cycles. Slower global growth, particularly in China, structurally higher energy costs, regulatory impacts in Europe and other regions, along with the potential for capacity additions to outpace demand have introduced sectoral challenges. These shifts are contributing to the depth and duration of the current downturn and will likely moderate future mid-cycle margins relative to the prior decades.\nThis is why our strategic initiatives to unlock sustainable value across our portfolio or essential. These actions are enabling us to pivot to high-value opportunities and respond more effectively to changing market dynamics.\nOur focal points during 2025 for the transformation of our Houston refinery, the strategic review of select European assets and strong execution of our global operating model. We are confident that these actions will lead to a durable uplift of our EBITDA margins and provide lasting benefits for navigating future cycles.\nNow if you turn to Slide 6, we highlight our progress on our strategy during 2024. In nearly 2 years since our Capital Markets Day, Liner Brazil has unlocked approximately $1.3 billion of incremental normalized EBITDA through the execution of our 3-pillar strategy. With focus and urgency we are leveraging our strengths and extending our advantages.\nThe successful start-up of our POTBA plant in 2023 is adding approximately $450 million on a mid-cycle basis to our normalized EBITDA by leveraging our proprietary technology and advantaged feedstock positions in these attractive markets. And I'm very pleased to report that our value enhancement program is exceeding our expectations.\nIn 2024, the VEP unlocked a year-end run rate of more than $800 million of recurring annual EBITDA improvements while contributing approximately $600 million to the 2024 EBITDA. In addition, we successfully completed the divestment of our noncore EU&D business, leveraging the sale proceeds to strengthen our portfolio by acquiring a 35% share in net [indiscernible] a cost-advantaged integrated polypropylene joint venture.\nDuring 2025, you can expect additional progress towards capturing value to our strategic priorities. We are confident in the progress of our VDP program and expect to exceed our goal to achieve a year-end run rate of $1 billion of recurring annual EBITDA improvements.\nAs you have seen, our APS transformation has encountered headwinds from automotive production declines at some of our key customers in North America and Europe. But the improved customer focus of our APS team has allowed LYB to increase our win rate for new project approvals.\nAnd [indiscernible] team is doing an excellent job in growing volumes in our circular and low-carbon solutions business, while our exit from the refining business remains on track. At the same time, we are remaining extremely disciplined in how we allocate capital during this downturn by carefully prioritizing high-return capital projects and remaining steadfast to our highly selective approach towards M&A.\nAs Michael will share, our capital expenditures will be lower than our prior guidance, but we have been mindful to ensure our prudence does not meaningfully impact future growth. And you can be assured that we will not compromise our M&A discipline to fill growth targets with risky or marginal acquisitions.\nOn Slide 7, we provide an update on the growth of our circular and low-carbon solutions or CLCS business. We continue to build CLCS through a focused strategy that leverages our existing infrastructure and our competitive advantages, such as innovative technologies, and leading positions in growing markets with a global network of deep customer relationships.\nOur CLCS business continues to grow at an impressive pace. CLCS volumes increased by 65% during 2024 to over 200,000 tonnes across product lines based on mechanical recycling, chemical recycling and renewable feedstocks. And we are generating attractive margins that are incremental to our fossil fuel-based polymers.\nOur CLCS business is targeting $1 billion of incremental EBITDA from 2 million tons of annual volumes by 2030. Despite the challenges in the chemical industry over the past year, our 2024 CLCS margins [indiscernible]\nPlease turn to Slide 8, and let's take a look at our updated views on the supply and demand [indiscernible]. Market demand for circular plastic remains true [indiscernible] consumer credit and increased utilization cycle plastics is driving demand growth. And European regulation is bolstering demand by mandating increased utilization of recycled content in plastic packaging. But this transition to circularity takes time.\nInfrastructure for plastics waste collection and sorting needs to be built. Large companies like LYB are developing technologies to increase supply, while smaller [indiscernible] are having mixed success in improving new technologies and launching businesses. we believe capacity growth will continue to be outpaced by rising demand.\nAs brand owners discovered the supply of circular plastics is not keeping pace with their growth plans they are pragmatically deferring their targets for utilizing circular plastics. And some brand owners have revised previously ambitious targets to more realistic levels after considering the supply constraints.\nDemand growth is merely being delayed due to lack of capacity, but not being eliminated. As such, LYB and other industry observers are incorporating these constraints by scaling back 2030 forecasts for industry capacity and the addressable market.\nThe mega trends and investment thesis remain intact. The market for circular plastics is expected to be short of supply and supportive of attractive margins for quite some time.\nLYB strategy has not changed, the construction of our first MoReTec chemical recycling facility in Germany is progressing well, and we are planning MoReTec 2 for Houston with regional heps for sourcing and sorting plastic waste in both locations. We are leveraging LYBs technologies, operations and global marketing network to execute our strategy and build a leading position in these attractive markets.\nPlease turn to Slide 9. Let's briefly review the evolving regulatory framework for circular plastics in Europe. While consumer preference is a dominant driver for circular plastics forward-thinking regulation is also strengthening demand growth. In Europe, we see a regulation moving in the right direction with PP WR, the new packaging and packaging waste regulation.\nWith mandatory levels of recycled content in packaging, we expect PPWR will drive meaningful incremental demand for circular plastics on the order of 4 million to 5 million tonnes by 2030, and even more by 2040. The LYB is well positioned through its differentiated technologies and solutions to take advantage of this growing opportunity.\nContact sensitive packaging with circular content is likely to require polymers produced using chemical recycling. Our proprietary catalytic MoReTec technology currently under construction in Germany, will provide a profitable commercial scale solution.\nBefore I turn over the call, I would like to take a moment to share my appreciation for our CFO, Michael McMurray. As we previously announced, Michael has decided to retire in line with his personal plan, after 5 years of service to LyondellBasell.\nMichael has been an incredible friend and thought partner over the past 3 years as we developed and executed a new strategy for the company. In addition, Michael provided outstanding leadership for our global finance team, wise counsel to our commercial leaders and oversaw the recapitalization of our balance sheet to look in the most favorable rates and maturities we're likely to see in our lifetimes. Chief, thank you for your leadership and look forward to continuing our personal friendship for many years to come.\n\nMichael C. McMurray\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Owens Corning\n\nPeter, thank you for your kind words. You have also been a great friend and partner over the past 3 years. Thank you. I also want to thank my team, my colleagues and our Board. The last 5 years have been fun, rewarding and challenging. -- and much has been accomplished. LYV is a great company with great people, and I'm confident the company is positioned for continued success. I look forward to following LYB's progress over the coming years.\nAnd finally, on my 50th and last earnings call as a public company CFO, I thank all of you in the investing community. It has been a good ride.\n\nPeter Z. E. Vanacker\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman of the Executive Board, Neste Oyj\n\nThank you, Michael. I'm also pleased to share that our Board has selected Augustin [indiscernible] to become LyondellBasell's Basil's next CFO effective March 1. Augustin joined LYB in 2022 after 13 years of service in various commercial and financial roles at BSF and nearly a decade in Morgan Stanley's Investment Banking division.\nMore recently, Augustin was responsible for LYB's O&P Americas segment with full P&L responsibility. Prior to that, he was a member of the IND leadership team. We're also pleased that Augustin is LYB's first CFO to have been promoted from within the company. We aim to continue developing top talent across all levels of the organization as we step up our performance and culture.\nAugustin is with us here today. Would you like to say a few words, Augustin?\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nCertainly, Peter. I am humbled, honored and thrilled for this opportunity. And I would like to thank our Board, IB's Executive Committee and the entire finance organization for their warm welcome. I look forward to engaging with the investment community over the coming months and working to build on Michael's strong foundations to drive results for LYB.\n\nPeter Z. E. Vanacker\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman of the Executive Board, Neste Oyj\n\nThank you, Augustin. Michael, can you please continue with a few words about our progress on capital allocation?\n\nMichael C. McMurray\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Owens Corning\n\nAbsolutely, Peter, and good morning again, everyone. Let's continue with Slide 10. As Peter mentioned, we are laser-focused on advancing our strategic priorities while maintaining a robust balance sheet that serves us well throughout the cycle. At the same time, we are committed to returning cash to our shareholders through a growing dividend and share repurchases.\nDuring 2024, we invested $1.8 billion in capital expenditures, carefully prioritizing projects to balance investment and future profitability. Our acquisition of a 35% position in the NATPET joint venture was offset by the divestment of our noncore ethylene oxide and derivatives business.\nWe ended the year with $3.4 billion of cash and short-term investments and $8 billion of available liquidity. Our strong cash conversion enabled us to maintain a resilient balance sheet and fully fund $1.7 billion in dividends and $195 million in share repurchases.\nIn May, we increased our quarterly dividend by 7%, marking the 14th consecutive year of annual dividend growth and continuing our track record of providing a secure, growing and competitive dividend, and we are well positioned to extend our track record of growing our dividend in 2025.\nOur capital allocation priorities are unchanged, and we remain committed to returning 70% of our free cash flow to shareholders over the long term.\nPlease turn to Slide 11, and let me begin by highlighting the strong cash performance from our business during 2024. Over the past year, our business teams generated $3.8 billion of cash from operating activities. Cash on hand remained flat for the year at $3.4 billion. During 2024, we achieved cash conversion of 90%, well above our long-term target of 80%.\nIn addition to typical fourth quarter drawdown of inventories, the company was able to pull forward the release of some of the working capital provided by the closure of the Houston refinery.\nDuring the first quarter, we will utilize some of our cash on hand to rebuild lean year in inventories in support of our upcoming Channelview turnaround and seasonal improvements across our businesses.\nIn the U.S., tax relief associated with Hurricane Burl, allowed us to defer cash tax payments during the second half of 2024, and these tax payments will be settled during February 2025.\nNow I'd like to provide an overview of the quarterly results of each of our segments on Slide 12. LYB's business portfolio delivered $689 million of EBITDA during the fourth quarter. Sequentially higher ethane and energy cost and lower seasonal demand impacted both of our O&P segments. Overall, olefins and polyolefins demand remained soft, particularly in Europe, where utilization rates remained low.\nAdditionally, margin compression on declining gasoline cracks and oxyfuels impacted profitability within the Intermediates and Derivatives segment. In 2025, refining activities will be reported as discontinued operations and our financial results will be reported under the 5 remaining segments.\nThe fourth quarter included identified items of $852 million net of tax. The items included noncash write-downs related to our O&P Europe, Asia and international and Advanced Polymer Solutions segment of $769 million and $42 million, respectively, and costs incurred from plans to exit the refining business.\nThe impairments reflect the challenging market conditions for these businesses and include O&P EAI assets in our European strategic review and an Asian joint venture, while the APS impairment was incurred in our specialty powders business.\nAcross the portfolio, a noncash LIFO inventory valuation charge decreased pretax fourth quarter results by approximately $23 million. As a reminder, our fourth quarter LIFO reconciliations reflect changes in inventory valuation over the full year. The LIFO reconciliation is not necessarily linked to our fourth quarter valuations.\nBefore we discuss our segment results in detail, let me discuss our capital expenditures plan for 2025 and beyond. Given the difficult operating environment and our disciplined approach to capital allocation, we are deferring some growth investments until later in the decade. For 2025, we expect our CapEx will be approximately $1.9 billion.\nOur 2025 capital plan includes approximately $700 million for profit-generating growth projects and $1.2 billion of sustaining investments to keep our assets running safely and reliably. The reduced capital plan prioritizes strategic investments in our CLCS business, our second tranche of flex capacity and high return projects in our value enhancement program.\nWe expect our 2025 effective tax rate will be approximately 17% and our cash tax rate will be approximately 10 percentage points higher. The higher cash tax rate is largely due to the deferral of 2024 U.S. tax payments into 2025, that was provided under Hurricane Burl disaster relief.\nAs we always do during the fourth quarter call, we have provided additional 2025 modeling information in the appendix to the slide deck describing expected impacts from major planned maintenance and other useful financial metrics.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Kim. Kim?\n\nKimberly A. Foley\n\nEVP of Intermediates, Derivatives & Refining, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 13, with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $496 million. During the quarter, integrated polyethylene margins decreased as ethane and natural gas prices increased negatively impacting margins. Strong demand from export markets increased our polyethylene volumes. We operated our assets at approximately 80% of nameplate capacity in line with market demand.\nOur olefins crackers are in at approximately 98% of rates during the quarter. Our strong operational performance allowed us to capture additional spot sales in olefins markets, benefiting our results by approximately $40 million.\nDuring the first quarter, we expect higher ethane and natural gas costs due to winter energy demand with modest improvements in product volumes following seasonal weakness and ongoing strength in export markets. We expect to operate our O&P-Americas assets at an average rate of approximately 80% during the first quarter due to planned maintenance downtime at our Channelview olefin assets, as well as the impact of Winter Storm Enzo.\nAhead of the storm, LYB proactively reduced rates and shut down some assets. We estimate that lost volumes from the storm-related downtime will impact first quarter EBITDA by approximately $45 million.\nIn line with our commitment to both a profitable CLCS business, member, we announced a second investment in cyclyx, a joint venture with LGlexand ExxonMobil reaching final investment decisions to build a second cyclyx circularity center in Fort Worth, Texas. The facility will have the capacity to produce more than 130,000 tons per year of plastic feedstock for advanced and mechanical recycling, and is expected to start up in the second half of 2026.\nNow let's turn to Slide 14, and review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. During the fourth quarter, European markets remained weak with higher feedstock cost and softer seasonal demand. Extended maintenance activities at our vesting site, along with adoption planned downtime in France, reduced volumes and impact EBITDA by approximately $20 million during the fourth quarter.\nDue to this downtime, we operated our assets at rates of approximately 55%. The combined impact of weak demand and lower rates led to an EBITDA loss of $146 million. As we move into 2025, we expect improved European seasonal demand to drive higher volumes and margins. In contrast to 2024, our O&P EAI segment has no major turnaround scheduled for the coming year. Nevertheless, feedstock supply for 1 of our German crackers is currently constrained due to unplanned downtime at a nearby refinery. With those constraints and ongoing soft market demand, we expect to operate our European assets at a rate of 75% during the first quarter.\nOur team in Westling, Germany successfully completed our largest turnaround in the region during 2024. Our European strategic review continues, and we expect to be in a position to issue an update on the progress in the second half of this year.\nOur CLCS business continues to grow. In October, we acquired APK, allowing us to integrate its unique solvent-based low-density polyethylene recycling technology and to our comprehensive portfolio for building a profitable CLCS business. And construction is well underway for our first commercial catalytic chemical recycling plant, MoReTec One in Germany.\nNow let's turn to Slide 15 and discuss the results of the refining segment. During the fourth quarter, we incurred an EBITDA loss of $24 million. Margins remained relatively flat despite falling gasoline and diesel spreads due to improved utilization of our catalytic cracker. During the quarter, we operated the refinery at approximately 90% of capacity following unplanned downtime in the third quarter with an average crude rate of 244,000 barrels per day.\nLooking forward, refinery shutdown activities began following Winter Storm Enzo in January and are expected to be completed within the first quarter. While the storm caused a slight delay, we remain on track as we have already shut down the first train of crude and coker units with the second train, the cat cracker and auxiliary equipment to follow.\nIn light of these activities, we expect final refinery utilization rates to be approximately 35% over the quarter. Our team remains highly focused on a safe and reliable shutdown as we wind down operations of our 107-year old refinery. Our #1 priority has and always will be safety. I would like to case the opportunity to commend our team for an amazing job during this journey.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Arun.\n\nArun Shankar Viswanathan\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, RBC Capital Markets, Research Division\n\nThank you, Kim. Please turn to Slide 16, as we take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $250 million. Fourth quarter Oxyfuel margins were in line with typical winter lows, driven by lower prices for crude oil as well as lower gasoline crack spreads. We experienced modest volume improvement in our PO and derivatives business during the quarter despite weak demand for durable goods.\nStyrene margins remain under pressure given global supply and demand fundamentals, despite declining raw material prices. We operated our IND assets at a rate of approximately 70% during the fourth quarter to match low seasonal demand.\nThe IND business achieved several strategic milestones in 2024, including the divestment of our noncore ethylene oxide and derivatives business and the operation of our newest PO/TBA asset at 78% rates for the year, surpassing our 2024 goal of 70%.\nWith this steady progress, operating rates are expected to run at benchmark rates going forward. These significant milestones highlight the decisive actions we are taking to exit businesses where LIB does not have a path to market leadership, while growing and upgrading our core businesses and assets that are aligned with our long-term strategy.\nAs we began the first quarter, we expect to see moderate demand improvements across most businesses as customers begin restocking after year-end inventory management. Additionally, we anticipate obtained premiums will improve with the end of the winter and the favorable butane accrued ratios will continue to support long-term Oxy Tools fundamentals.\nWe plan to operate our assets at approximately 80% during the first quarter, inclusive of a small amount of unplanned downtime and lost volumes due to Winter Storm Enzo.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Torkel.\n\nTorkel Rhenman\n\nExecutive Vice President of Advanced Polymer Solutions\n\nThank you, Arun. Now let's review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 17. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $15 million, volumes were pressured by significantly lower fourth quarter demand from our automotive customers across all regions, slightly offset by favorable margins.\nLooking ahead, we expect the first quarter will reflect continued progress from our efforts to regain market share with our renewed focus on customer centricity. Our customer-centric approach helped drive approximately 20% EBITDA improvement during 2024 and an increase of 46% in our Net Promoter Score from customers versus the prior year.\nThe team has made substantial progress in transforming our business with strategic customers by building back trust and increasing our win rate to gain new project qualifications. This progress helped us achieve above-market global volume growth for our sizable polypropylene compounds and master batch businesses during 2024.\nIn addition to our focus on transforming the business, I would like to congratulate the APS team for achieving record-setting safety performance in 2024, surpassing our prior record from 2023. I truly believe our progress in refilling our growth funnel and achieving superior safety results reflects our attention to detail and confirms we are on the right path to restoring and exceeding our historical performance.\nWith that, I will return the call to Peter.\n\nPeter Z. E. Vanacker\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman of the Executive Board, Neste Oyj\n\nThanks, Torkel. I would like to thank the entire Lineal team for delivering such resilient results, and it's a very challenging macro environment. To close out on the segments, let's turn to Slide 18 and discuss the results for our technology business on behalf of Jim Fewer.\nDuring the fourth quarter, catalyst volumes moderated on typical seasonality while we achieved higher licensing revenue by reaching project milestones that resulted in segment EBITDA of $108 million. Through this progress, fourth quarter EBITDA exceeded the prior year by approximately 40%.\nFirst quarter results for the Technology segment are expected to decline to levels at or below the third quarter of 2024. While catalyst sales should improve with favorable seasonality, we expect moderating licensing revenue as project approvals for polyolefin capacity additions subside across the world.\nPlease turn to Slide 19 as we discuss the near-term outlook by region and end markets. As you heard from our business leaders, we expect modest seasonal demand improvements across most businesses during the first quarter.\nIn the Americas, we expect typical seasonal demand recovery will be met with tighter supply due to planned downtime across the industry from an unusually high level of spring cracker maintenance, including our Channelview turnarounds.\nIn Europe, we expect rising energy costs will continue to pressure the European markets. seasonal demand recovery and modest restocking of low inventories should provide some support. Moving forward, ongoing capacity rationalization appears likely, and should help improve market balance between supply and demand.\nIn Asia, markets are showing slow but steady improvements in both volumes and margins. We are encouraged by China's targeted stimulus programs, but remain cautious while monitoring for signs that these efforts can translate into more meaningful market improvements.\nFor the packaging sector, we expect to continue seeing steady global demand as we move ahead in the new year. In Building & Construction, the U.S. infrastructure stimulus efforts are supporting increased industrial activity. Additionally, leading indicators for remodeling activity are predicting increased activity for the second and third quarters of 2025.\nIn the automotive sector and modest recovery and seasonal demand could be pressured by elevated inventory levels across the industry. Additionally, we're watchful for changes in trade policies that could impact production as we move through the year.\nFor oxyfuels, stronger crude prices and typical springtime improvements in gasoline crack spreads should provide benefits as we move through the quarter. Our focus remains on reliable operations and continuous optimization across our global footprint to capture market opportunities. And as Michael emphasized, we are maintaining our laser focus on cash generation.\nNow let me provide an overview of our outlook and how we are positioning LYB over the longer term in Slide 20. -- as we move into 2025, we're beginning to see signs of recovery in key end markets after 2 years of declines, domestic demand for U.S. polyolefins had a positive inflection in 2024.\nReduced global interest rates, moderating inflation and pent-up demand, all provide a supportive backdrop for the inevitable recoveries in demand from durable goods, but we remain watchful of the potential impact that tariffs could have on affordability and global trade. Despite these uncertainties, LYB remains well positioned as the favorable oil to gas ratio continues to provide a cost advantage for our U.S. and Middle East production.\nOur portfolio transformation is well underway with strategic initiatives to strengthen and upgrade our core businesses. Recent milestones include the acquisition of Net bet, the divestment of our O&D business, ongoing progress for our European strategic review and our exit from refining.\nDuring 2024, we have made excellent progress toward building our profitable CN LCS business by starting construction of our first MoReTec facility and bolstering our technology position with investments such as APK. Recent assessments by EcoVadis and Sustainalytics rated LYB in the top 10% for our industry. LYB is at the forefront of providing sustainable solutions for our customers.\nAnd our [indiscernible] is now on track to unlock at least $1 billion of recurring annual EBITDA by the end of this year. I am very proud of the progress our teams have made during 2024. And I'm confident that LYB is well positioned to achieve our strategic priorities while rewarding shareholders.\nNow with that, we're now pleased to take your questions."

At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nDavid Kinney\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to today's call. Before we begin the discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies the call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations.\nToday, we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are also available on our Investor Relations website.\nComments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results using non-GAAP financial measures, such as EBITDA and earnings per share, excluding identified items. Additional documents on our Investor website provide reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release and our business results discussion.\nJoining today's call will be Peter Vanacker, LyondellBasell's Chief Executive Officer; our CFO, Michael McMurray; Kim Foley, our Executive Vice President of Global Olefins and Polyolefins and Refining; Aaron Ledet, our EVP of Intermediates and Derivatives; and Torkel Rhenman, our EVP of Advanced Polymer Solutions.\nDuring today's call, we will focus on second quarter results as well as updates on our long-term strategy. We will also discuss current market dynamics and our near-term outlook.\nWith that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter.\n\nPeter Z. E. Vanacker\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman of the Executive Board, Neste Oyj\n\nThank you, Dave, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our second quarter results. Yet again, our people did an excellent job navigating challenging market conditions whilst being laser-focused on the execution of our strategy.\nLet's begin with Slide 3 and discuss our continued leadership in safety performance. LYB has a history of excellence in operational performance with safety being a core part of our success. Going back to 2010, we have consistently delivered industry-leading safety results. But more importantly, we have made significant improvements towards our goal to operate safely each day with 0 incidents, injuries or accidents. LYB's June year-to-date total recordable incident rate for employees and contractors is 0.13. For comparison, in 2010, our incident rate was 0.42, more than 3x higher than today. Safety is foundational to what we do. Getting it right ensures the well-being of our workforce, but also benefits our operational excellence performance and financial returns. Our team has demonstrated outstanding focus to reach this point, and we remain committed to further improvements. Today, I'm excited to discuss our actions to deliver resilient results as well as the excellent progress on our long-term strategy for LYB.\nPlease turn to Slide 4 as we briefly review the quarter. Second quarter underlying business results improved by nearly 30% over the first quarter, driven by increased volumes from our operations. North American demand for polyolefins continues to improve, while feedstock and energy costs remain low. Our European olefins and polyolefins results improved due to our flexibility to increase our utilization of advantaged LPG feedstocks within intermediates and derivatives, the benefits from LYB's expanded TBA capacity are clearly seen in our record quarterly oxyfuel sales volumes. Earnings were $2.24 per share with EBITDA of $1.4 billion. LYB generated an impressive $1.3 billion in cash from operating activities. Core strong cash generation provided support for the disciplined execution of our strategy.\nLet's turn to Slide 5 and review the 3-pillar strategy that is driving our focus on strategic growth and long-term value creation. As we described during fourth quarter earnings, we are making good progress on our goal to add $3 billion in incremental normalized EBITDA by 2027, with nearly 1/3 of that target unlocked during 2023. Last quarter, we took a deeper look into how we are building a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business. Today, we will describe the work underway to grow and upgrade our core businesses. When we talk about growing and upgrading our core, we are very clear about the criteria we use to define businesses that are core to our portfolio.\nMoving to Slide 6. Let's review these criteria. We are working hard to build up a portfolio that is focused on leading market positions and growing end markets that deliver attractive returns well above our cost of capital. and leverages on access to advantaged circular and renewable feedstocks. You will see that once we have executed this transformation we will be a much more profitable, focused and streamlined company. Our decisions on investing in organic growth or disciplined M&A are grounded by our commitment to pursue attractive returns well above our cost of capital. We are leveraging LYB's technology and global market positions to increase our access to advantaged feedstocks typically found in North America and the Middle East. And finally, as we covered last quarter, we're making great progress in building a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business. Historically, we have defined advantaged feedstocks as low-cost NGLs in North America and the Middle East. As we grow our CLCS business, we are expanding this definition to include favorable positions for circular and renewable feedstocks. As you know, we have implemented a lot of actions to grow and upgrade our portfolio in parallel with great focus and speed. May was again a busy month for us. with the completion of the sale of our EO&D business and the acquisition of our stake in the NATPET joint venture. Importantly, we also announced a strategic review of some of our European assets that will reposition our footprint for future sustainable success.\nOn Slide 7, let me highlight our goals for reshaping LYB by simultaneously growing and upgrading our core businesses. We are adding value through growth investments in, for example, our PO/TBA capacity and our formation of the NATPET joint venture in Saudi Arabia. We are also continuously evaluating projects and expect to find more opportunities that will be accretive for LYB. Our value enhancement program is also delivering growth through incremental production capacity and improved margins. LYB's VEP is not a onetime cost-cutting initiative. Our VEP is our new way of working, focused on unlocking value and is becoming embedded in LYB's culture. Michael will share some more details on our VEP progress in a few moments.\nOur motivation for upgrading the portfolio is illustrated on the right side of Slide 7. In some cases, upgrades were accomplished by divesting or exiting noncore businesses. One example is the Houston refinery, a capital-intensive asset that has historically only delivered brief periods of profitability. After we shut down the refinery by no later than the end of the first quarter of 2025, LYB's average EBITDA margin will actually expand by about 4 percentage points. Our divested Ethylene Oxide and Derivatives business did not provide LYB with a leading position and did not fit our criteria for growth. Simply put, we were not the best owners. The strategic review of our European assets will position our footprint for a sustainable future. All of these moves aim towards building a stronger, more focused and more profitable business portfolio for LYB.\nLet's roll into our European strategic review on Slide 8. We are undertaking this review to position LYB's regional footprint for future markets. Our goal is to reshape our European business portfolio and alignment with our long-term strategy for lasting success. Europe remains a core market for LYB. Our analysis determines that the 6 assets listed on the top left in their current configuration do not meet LYB's criteria for our core business. At this point, all options are on the table. Just like our ethylene oxide and derivatives business, these assets could well have a strategic fit and profitable future with another owner. Divestiture of the assets as a group or separately is a possibility, or we may determine that like our Houston refinery, rationalization is the best option for some sites. While it is too early to speculate on the outcomes, the impact on the company's global portfolio is relatively limited. As you can glean from the chart, the assets subject to review only represent about 13% of our global capacity for these product lines. LYB will continue to have a strong European presence. In I&D, our core European assets utilize LYB's world-leading PO/TBA technology. In Germany, we are investing near Cologne to build our first circular and renewable solution set. And our technology segment will maintain a strong presence in Italy and Germany. We will continue productive engagement with all relevant stakeholders at the impacted sites. This includes local governance, our business partners, potential buyers and most importantly, our employees, who continue to demonstrate high commitment to safe, reliable and efficient operations despite the ongoing uncertainty. Our aim is to move swiftly to maximize value for LYB panel stakeholders.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Michael to discuss our financial results in more detail.\n\nMichael C. McMurray\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Owens Corning\n\nThank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. .\nPlease turn to Slide 9, and let me start by discussing our resilient cash generation. Over the past year, LyondellBasell generated $4.4 billion of cash from operating activities. Our team converted EBITDA into cash at an impressive 95% cash conversion rate during the last 12 months. As a result, we were able to return almost $1.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This represents nearly 70% of our $2.6 billion of free cash flow, in line with our long-term target. At the end of the second quarter, our cash balance was $2.9 billion.\nLet's continue with Slide 10 and review the details of our second quarter capital allocation. As Peter mentioned, we generated an impressive $1.3 billion of cash from operating activities. During the quarter, we returned $513 million through dividends and share repurchases while funding $484 million of capital investment. In May, we increased our quarterly dividend by 7% to $1.34 per share, continuing our track record of providing a secure, growing and competitive dividend for our shareholders. Our team is committed to balanced and disciplined capital allocation as part of our long-term strategy. During the quarter, we divested the ethylene oxide and derivatives business or $700 million. Within a few weeks, we invested approximately $500 million to acquire a 35% share of NATPET integrated polypropylene joint venture in Saudi Arabia. We finished the second quarter with approximately $7 billion of available liquidity. In July, LYB successfully amended and extended the maturity of our revolving credit facility to 2029, while further strengthening our liquidity by increasing the size of the facility by $500 million to $3.75 billion.\nLet's continue with a brief update on our VEP progress on Slide 11. The value enhancement program is a highly successful and integral component of our long-term strategy. We are confident in our estimate that the VEP will contribute approximately $400 million to EBITDA in 2024. Our team is rapidly delivering value less than 2 years after first launching this program. To provide more detail on this year's progress, we have broken out contributions by business segment and category. As you might expect, the segment with the largest contribution is also our most profitable segment, O&P-Americas, generating about $265 million of incremental value. In 2024, we anticipate approximately $280 million of benefit across the company from improved product mix and increased variable margins. We anticipate about $95 million of benefit from higher volume, driven by improving reliability and increased rates. While the value enhancement program is primarily focused on increased value generation, the program has also identified opportunities to improve our leading fixed cost position. Overall, we estimate that lower fixed costs across our manufacturing and corporate functions will benefit our results by approximately $25 million this year. As Peter mentioned, LYB's VEP program is a new way of working and unlocking value that is becoming embedded as an evergreen process in our culture.\nLet's turn to Slide 12, and I will provide a brief overview of the results of each of our segments. LYB's business portfolio delivered $1.4 billion of EBITDA during the second quarter, almost 30% higher than the prior quarter. Seasonal summer demand, coupled with higher production from our asset base, led to increased volumes, margins modestly improved across most of our businesses. In early July, Hurricane Beryl impacted our operations across the U.S. Gulf Coast. LYB proactively shut down some of our assets ahead of the storm. Our prudent approach reduces the potential for damage to our assets and the surrounding community during adverse conditions. As a result, we did not experience any workplace injuries and property damage was not material. Nonetheless, we estimate that storm-related downtime will impact third quarter EBITDA by approximately $65 million with approximately 75% in our O&P-Americas segment. We have relatively modest levels of maintenance activity planned for the remainder of the year. In the appendix to the slide deck, we provide updated 2024 modeling guidance for planned maintenance impacts and other financial metrics. With a sharp focus on working capital, we continue to align our operating rates to meet market demand. During the third quarter, we expect operating rates of 85% for our North American olefins and polyolefin assets, 80% for our European olefins and polyolefin assets and 75% for intermediates and derivative assets.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Kim. Kim?\n\nKimberly A. Foley\n\nEVP of Intermediates, Derivatives & Refining, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 13 with the performance of the Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment. During the second quarter, O&P-Americas EBITDA was $670 million. Increased LYB production led to higher volumes and margins. We were pleased to see that integrated polyethylene margins were supported by modestly higher ethylene and polyethylene prices while ethane and natural gas costs remain low.\nDemand for North American polyolefins is strengthening in 2024, with June year-to-date industry polyethylene sales up by nearly 11% over the first half of '23. Strong demand pull from both domestic and export markets is absorbing recent capacity expansions in the region. LYB is well positioned as the third largest polyethylene producer in North America with strong customer relationships built over decades. In the third quarter, we anticipate continued seasonal demand strength. Low feedstock and energy costs are expected to persist, benefiting North American integrated polyolefin margins. Amid a backdrop of relatively high oil prices, the favorable oil to gas ratio provides an advantage to North American producers relative to oil-based production in other parts of the world. Despite disruptions from Hurricane Borough in early July, the U.S. olefins and polyolefins markets remain well supplied. Nonetheless, the U.S. Gulf Coast hurricane season is still young, with potential for additional disruptions over the coming months. During the third quarter, we will remain focused on aligning our operating rates to serve domestic and export market demand, targeting 85% utilization. After a decade of unprecedented growth, North American polyolefins capacity additions have slowed down.\nPlease turn to Slide 14 as we review the changing outlook for our new supply. In the early 2010s, the advent of shale-based oil and gas production triggered a wave of olefins and polyolefins capacity additions to take advantage of the abundant and low-cost NGL feedstocks, with 1 or sometimes 2 world-scale plants coming online nearly every year for over the past decade. North American domestic and export markets for polyethylene and polypropylene became well supplied leading to reduced operating rates and lower margins. Over the next few years, very little new capacity will come online in North America. After 2 years of tepid growth, polyethylene sales volumes are growing at double-digit rates during the first half of this year. Demand growth in Latin America is increasingly served by North American supply. Polypropylene volumes are also improving, but remain constrained as we await the inevitable rebound in demand for durable goods. With North America demand growth returning to long-term trends, and no meaningful local supply on the horizon, tightening supply and demand balances and higher utilization rates bode well for LyondellBasell's core polyolefins business.\nPlease turn to Slide 15 as we review the results of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. In the second quarter, LYB's integrated polyethylene margins expanded with the increased utilization of cost advantaged feedstocks such as LPGs, resulting in EBITDA of $70 million. Approximately 40% of LYB's European ethylene production came from advantaged feedstocks. Additionally, higher prices for olefins and coproducts supported European cracker margins amidst modest seasonal demand improvement for polymers. Red Sea logistic challenges have largely subsided during the quarter but significant higher shipping costs constrain European imports, benefiting local producers. Looking ahead, we anticipate steady olefins and polyolefins demand through the summer in Europe. In September, we will begin planned maintenance at one of our German crackers that will continue into the fourth quarter. As a result, we are targeting approximately 80% operating rates for the third quarter. As part of our strategy to grow and upgrade our core businesses, we completed the acquisition of a 35% share of the Saudi Arabian net pet joint venture at the end of May. The joint venture currently operates 400,000 tons of integrated polypropylene capacity using local cost-advantaged propane raw materials and LYB's ferrous pole polypropylene technology. Together with our partner, Alujain, we are evaluating opportunities to significantly grow the joint venture by leveraging new feedstock concessions in Saudi Arabia. And as Peter discussed in May, we also announced the strategic review of some of our European olefins and polyolefins assets. Our team is working diligently to evaluate our options and order position for future success in the region.\nNow let's turn to Slide 16 and review the results of the Refining segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $15 million. Higher production following the first quarter downtime was more than offset by lower Maya crack spreads. Margins decreased driven by lower distillate cracks, partially offset by slight improvements in gasoline cracks with modest second quarter demand, indicating a slow start to the driving season. Our hedging program benefited second quarter results. Industry operating rates remained relatively high, leading to ample market supply. In the near term, we expect summer demand to support stable gasoline crack spreads and continued high operating rates for refiners. We intend to operate at approximately 90% of capacity in the third quarter. Looking ahead, we remain committed to the safe and reliable operation of these assets until we shut down, no later than the end of the first quarter of 2025. Additional details regarding our ramp-down will be provided during our third quarter update. Our team is making good progress in evaluating projects to transform the site in support of our circular and low-carbon solution growth strategy.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Aaron.\n\nAaron Ledet\n\nExecutive Vice President of Intermediates & Derivatives\n\nThank you, Kim. Please turn to Slide 17 as we look at the Intermediates and Derivatives segment. In the second quarter, segment EBITDA was $501 million driven by increased production and seasonal demand for oxyfuels. We delivered record quarterly oxyfuels volumes by increasing production from our newest PO/TBA asset, which operated at close to benchmark rates during the quarter. Oxyfuels margins remain robust as the summer driving season is underway, with strong octane demand keeping margins well above historical levels. Intermediate Chemicals improved due to higher margins and volumes for acetyls, driven by industry outages and improved production from LYB's assets. Propylene oxide derivatives margins were steady as demand for durable goods remained modest against a backdrop of high interest rates in the impacts of inflation. As we move through the third quarter, we expect seasonal demand will continue to benefit oxyfuels margins through the remainder of the driving season. Low cost for butane raw materials and steady premiums for octane should provide continued support for oxyfuels profitability. In line with our guidance, planned maintenance at one of our Bayport PO/TBA assets will begin later in the third quarter and continue into the fourth quarter. We will continue to match our production with market demand and expect to operate our I&D assets at rates of approximately 75% during the quarter. As Michael mentioned earlier, we completed the sale of our ethylene oxide derivatives businesses to INEOS for $700 million during the second quarter. We recorded a book gain on the sale of $293 million which is reflected as an identified item in our second quarter results. Our work to grow and upgrade our I&D segment continues as we evaluate our Maasvlakte PO/SM joint venture in the Netherlands as part of the ongoing European strategic review. We are working closely with our partner in the JV, Covestro, local stakeholders and our workforce. .\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Torkel.\n\nTorkel Rhenman\n\nExecutive Vice President of Advanced Polymer Solutions\n\nThank you, Aaron. Please turn to Slide 18 as we review the second quarter results for the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $40 million. Margins increased across most APS businesses as our transformation work and seasonal improvements led to modestly higher pricing. Lower automotive production in Europe led to a slight decrease in volumes. Looking ahead, we expect modest improvement in volumes through the remainder of the year driven by our strategic initiatives and focus on restoring our growth pipeline. We anticipate headwinds from typical seasonal downtime at automotive OEMs in the third quarter. But our masterbatch business has shorter qualification cycles and offer more opportunities for near-term improvement. Our team is focused on continuously expanding our growth funnel and increasing the win rate with our customers. We're investing in our core team with a growth and value mindset to deliver on our long-term goals for the APS business.\nWith that, I will return the call back to Peter.\n\nPeter Z. E. Vanacker\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman of the Executive Board, Neste Oyj\n\nThank you, Torkel. Please turn to Slide 19, and I will discuss the results for the Technology segment on behalf of Jim Seward. Second quarter EBITDA of $84 million reflected moderating licensing and catalyst revenue, normalizing after strong first quarter results. In the third quarter, we expect that revenue associated with licensing milestones will increase, coupled with high catalyst volumes. As a result, we estimate that third quarter Technology segment results will be similar to first quarter results.\nNow let me summarize the second quarter, our outlook and our long-term strategy with Slide 20. LYB's second quarter results reflect higher production volumes and modest seasonal improvements in market conditions. Looking towards the second half of the year, we continue to expect a slight improvement over our first half results with a slow recovery in global markets. LYB's assets in the U.S. and Middle East are well positioned, operating in regions where low cost for energy and feedstocks provide a durable competitive advantage relative to oil-based production. Our team remains disciplined in our capital allocation strategy and delivering high returns to our shareholders. Our balance sheet is in great shape and we are well equipped to succeed as market conditions modestly improve. Our value enhancement program is on track to contribute approximately $400 million to EBITDA in 2024. We are thrilled with the enthusiasm and results from our progress so far and look forward to providing a more substantive update on our VEP next quarter as we dive deeper on how we are stepping up our performance and culture at LYB. At our Capital Markets Day last year, we outlined our long-term strategy. Through leading technologies and market positions, we are executing on this strategy to grow our global footprint and upgrade our core businesses. Our strategy will not only grow LYB, but will also reshape our business portfolio to improve profitability and create sustainable competitive advantages. As Kim highlighted earlier, we see North American polyolefin demand improving in 2024, returning towards long-term historical growth rates. As we look ahead, limited capacity additions in North America bodes well for continued improvements in operating rates and associated margins over the coming years. I am proud to lead our high-performing team as we take decisive actions to unlock value, reshape LYB and position our company for sustainable future success.\nWith that, we're now pleased to take your questions."

Earnings Call\n\nLYBNYSEAPR 26, 11:00 AM\n\nOperator\n\nHello, and welcome to the LyondellBasell Teleconference. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nDavid Kinney\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nGood day, everybody, and thank you for joining today's call. Before we begin the discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations.\nToday, we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are also available on our Investor Relations website.\nComments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results using non-GAAP financial measures such as EBITDA and earnings per share excluding identified items. Additional documents on our Investor website provide reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release and our business results discussion.\nA recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time today until May 26 by calling (877) 660-6853 in the United States and (201) 612-7415 outside the United States. The access code for both numbers is 13743073.\nJoining today's call will be Peter Vanacker, LyondellBasell's Chief Executive Officer; our CFO, Michael McMurray; Kim Foley, our Executive Vice President of Global Olefins & Polyolefins and Refining; Aaron Ledet, our EVP of Intermediates & Derivatives; and Torkel Rhenman, our EVP of Advanced Polymer Solutions.\nDuring today's call, we will focus on first quarter results, current market dynamics, our near-term outlook and our long-term strategy. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter.\n\nPeter Z. E. Vanacker\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman of the Executive Board, Neste Oyj\n\nThank you, David, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our first quarter results. During today's call, our leaders will be discussing results in line with the organizational changes we announced on February 19. In addition to her prior responsibilities for Refining and Supply Chain, Kim Foley is now our Executive Vice President for Global Olefins & Polyolefins. Kim will discuss the results for both O&P segments as well as the Refining segments.\nJoining us for the first time on our earnings telephone conference in his new role as Executive Vice President is Aaron Ledet who is taking over responsibility from Kim in leading our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. Over more than 20 years in the petrochemical industry, with 12 of those years at LYB, Aaron has served in a variety of roles in both Europe and the United States. Most recently, Aaron was responsible for the manufacturing and commercial operations for our O&P Americas segment, where he was also responsible for developing future options for our Houston refinery. Please join me in welcoming Aaron to this call.\nBefore we dive into the results, I hope you will invest some time to review this year's edition of our Sustainability Report that we released a few weeks ago. Over the past year, we embedded sustainability into our strategy and made significant progress on our ambitions. This year's sustainability report describes how LYB is making everyday sustainability a reality.\nLet's turn to Slide 3 and begin the discussion with our continued leadership in safety performance. There is no greater accomplishment than having every member of our team return home to their families every day in the same health as when they began their working day. This is a cornerstone of our successful and sustainable business.\nLyondellBasell's first quarter incident rate for employees and contractors improved to a rate of only 1 injury per 2 million hours worked. We believe our safety metrics continue to hold a leading position in our industry. And I want to congratulate our team for their outstanding safety performance.\nMoving to Slide 4. As we discuss our company's performance during today's teleconference, we hope you will take away 2 main messages. First, LyondellBasell continues to generate resilient results while managing challenging market conditions, which have pressured our industry over the past 2 years. In the first quarter, LYB increased its EBITDA modestly over the fourth quarter. Our cash generation was negatively impacted by a build in working capital for good reasons: higher prices and higher volumes.\nAnd we see other encouraging signs that the industry is beginning to recover. The ratio of oil to gas prices strongly favors LYB's advantaged production in North America and the Middle East. Our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment has returned to profitability. And we're seeing early indications of improvements in the performance of our APS segments.\nThe second key message is that LyondellBasell's focused strategy is creating unique opportunities to transform our business. As you have heard me say many times, we are executing on 3 strategic pillars. We're growing and upgrading our core businesses through the startup of our new PO/TBA capacity, and the acquisition of our NATPET joint venture in the Middle East. We intend to give a more substantive update on this pillar of our strategy during our second quarter results.\nAnd we're stepping up our performance in culture to embrace value creation through our value enhancement program and the transformation of our APS segment. As you might recall, we gave a detailed update on our VEP during last quarter's results. But the most impactful transformation is the progress we have made on our strategic pillar to build a profitable Circular and Low-Carbon Solutions business. The so-called CLCS business will move our feedstocks away from fossil fuels towards an increasing share of recycled and renewable sources.\nWe're building this business through a disciplined, capital-efficient strategy that leverages our existing infrastructure and our competitive advantages, such as leading positions in growing markets and a global network of deep customer relationships.\nIn addition to the first quarter improvements in our underlying businesses, I hope you will come away from this call with an improved understanding of our progress in building CLCS and share our excitement for the future of LyondellBasell.\nMoving to Slide 5. Let's focus on the actions we are taking to build a profitable CLCS business. LYB is targeting capabilities across the Circular and Low-Carbon Solutions value chain. We are making a series of strategic investments in plastic waste sourcing, advanced sorting, mechanical recycling and advanced recycling. Slide 5 illustrates how all of these investments fit together to form a comprehensive approach to value creation for LyondellBasell CLCS business.\nLyondellBasell's investments in waste sourcing and advanced sorting enable our company to maximize value from a wide variety of recycled and renewable waste streams. Our network will allow LYB to select the highest value proposition for a particular waste feedstock, whether that involves mechanical recycling, advanced recycling or renewables.\nWe continue to use JV structures where appropriate to improve capital efficiency and builds in supply chain resiliency, while growing scale and gaining access to market-leading technologies.\nConstruction is underway in Germany at our Cologne integrated hub for our first advanced recycling assets using LYB's proprietary catalyst technology, MoReTec, with a final investment decision expected next year for a second unit in Houston that will likely be twice the size of the German facility.\nWe are evaluating options for the potential reuse of the hydrotreaters at our Houston refinery to purify recycled and renewable cracker feedstocks. All of these capabilities enable LYB to leverage to substantial investments in our existing cracker and polymerization capacities to process recycled and renewable feedstocks.\nFinally, in collaboration with converters and brand owners, we bring the recycled and renewable content of these polymers to markets through both direct channels and through the custom compounding solutions offered by our APS business. Using mass balancing, the majority of our sales volumes were sold under our well-known Circulen brands.\nTurning to Slide 6. You can see how the focused execution of our CLCS strategy is resulting in rapid and meaningful growth in sales volumes for LYB's recycled and renewable-based polymers. In 2023, our volumes grew to 123,000 tons, doubling our 2022 sales. And we expect this excellent momentum will continue as we drive towards our 2030 target of at least 2 million tons per year.\nLast year, at our Capital Markets Day, we outlined our financial targets for LyondellBasell's CLCS business. We continue to expect an incremental EBITDA contribution of $500 million by 2027 and $1 billion by 2030 from this business. By expanding our regional hubs with disciplined acquisitions and organic growth, we are confident we can continue to build and strengthen the leadership position to serve this undersupplied market while generating attractive margins to achieve our financial targets.\nLet's turn to Slide 7 and summarize our financial results. During the first quarter, LyondellBasell's businesses delivered resilient results from our well-positioned and diverse portfolio. Earnings were $1.53 per share. EBITDA was $1.1 billion. During the quarter, cash from operating activities consumed about $100 million, and our balance sheet remains robust with $6.5 billion of available liquidity.\nLet me turn the call over to Michael first, and then to each of the business leaders who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail.\n\nMichael C. McMurray\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Owens Corning\n\nThank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8, and let me begin by addressing our cash generation. During the past 4 quarters, LyondellBasell generated $4.3 billion of cash from operating activities. Our team efficiently converted 93% of our EBITDA into cash over the last 12 months. At the end of the quarter, our cash balance was $2.3 billion.\nLYB's investment-grade balance sheet remains strong and enables us to continue to execute on our strategy and grow profitably while increasing returns for our shareholders. Let's continue with Slide 9 and review the details of our capital deployment.\nDuring the first quarter, our businesses consumed about $100 million in cash from operating activities. EBITDA improvement was more than offset by a working capital build of just over $600 million. As Peter mentioned, our working capital build was for good reasons, including higher prices and higher volumes, primarily within our O&P EAI and I&D segments. In O&P EAI, receivables increased with higher sales volumes as we benefited from the Red Sea logistic disruptions. Our I&D segment had higher receivables due to styrene price increases, and we rebuilt some oxyfuel inventories after fourth quarter maintenance.\nOur resilient cash generation has resulted in $1.8 billion returned to shareholders over the last 12 months through both dividends and share repurchases.\nDuring the quarter, we successfully issued $750 million worth of bonds to refinance our 2024 maturity, which reduced our coupon rate by 25 basis points. Our balance sheet is in great shape. We have $11 billion in long-term debt with an average maturity of about 18 years and a 4% average cost of debt.\nI would now like to provide a brief overview of the results from each of our segments on Slide 10. LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered $1.1 billion of EBITDA during the first quarter. Profitability improved quarter-over-quarter in 5 of our 6 segments. In our O&P Americas segment, the absence of fourth quarter inventory valuation benefits sequentially impacted first quarter results. Conversely, our I&D and Refining segments benefited from the absence of fourth quarter inventory valuation charges.\nIn our fourth quarter teleconference, we outlined $105 million of first quarter estimated EBITDA impact from planned maintenance in O&P Americas and Refining. Additional unplanned downtime from winter storm Heather in Houston and other events increased the first quarter estimated EBITDA impact from downtime by approximately $150 million.\nOur estimate for second quarter planned maintenance EBITDA impact remains at $30 million and is focused on a turnaround of one of the POSM units in Channelview.\nWe continue to align our operating rates with market demand to optimize working capital. During the second quarter, we expect operating rates of 85% for our global olefins and polyolefins assets and 80% for our intermediates and derivative assets.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Kim. Kim?\n\nKimberly A. Foley\n\nEVP of Intermediates, Derivatives & Refining, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you, Michael. After more than 35 years in various leadership positions at LYB, I am very excited to assume responsibility for our O&P segments. Earlier in my career, I was the site manager for our largest site here in Channelview, Texas. It is an honor for me to now lead LyondellBasell's work to grow and upgrade these core businesses for our company.\nLet's begin the segment discussions on Slide 11 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment. First quarter O&P Americas EBITDA was $521 million. Lower feedstock and energy costs, coupled with stable domestic polyethylene prices, were offset by lower volumes due to planned and unplanned downtime. Olefins margins were supported by higher co-product pricing. As a reminder, fourth quarter results benefited from LIFO inventory valuation changes of $75 million.\nDuring the first quarter, the North American polyethylene demand continued to strengthen and, with the support of strong export markets, led to stable domestic prices despite new capacity entering the market. For the North American industry, domestic polyethylene sales volumes improved by more than 5% relative to the fourth quarter. The addition of new capacity to the North American market in 2023 has led to much higher exports from the region.\nDuring the first quarter, North American exports of polyethylene were significantly higher than 2023 average. For LYB, our strong domestic share in North America resulted in approximately 30% of our first quarter sales going to the export customers.\nIn the second quarter, we expect feedstock and energy costs will remain relatively low, with LYB targeting higher operating rates following downtime in the first quarter. North American integrated polyolefin producers, including LYB, continue to benefit from a highly advantaged oil to gas ratio, leading to a significantly lower cost relative to oil-derived production.\nWith the remainder of the U.S. polyethylene capacity now online, the market is well supplied, yet demand is keeping the industry inventories relatively balanced at about 40 days of supply. We remain focused on aligning our operating rates to serve domestic and export market demand.\nAs Peter mentioned, we are focused on growing our Circular and Low-Carbon Solutions business to build our leadership in the attractive markets of premium recycled and renewable-based polymers. In February, we announced the acquisition of mechanical recycling assets from PreZero in Jurupa Valley, California. These assets extend our recycling footprint into the Greater Los Angeles Metropolitan area, providing good access to plastic waste feedstock in the region. We believe California offers a favorable backdrop to increase the recovery of plastic waste with better infrastructure, higher recycling rates and supportive policies.\nPlease turn to Slide 12 as we review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. In the first quarter, higher volumes from near-shoring, combined with increased demand from restocking, drove improved results in Europe and Asia, resulting in EBITDA of $14 million. Additionally, throughout the quarter, logistical challenges in the Red Sea proved beneficial for local European producers, resulting in increased volumes and fixed cost recovery. In Europe, variable margins benefited from modest price increases that were mostly offset by higher feedstock costs.\nAs we progress through the second quarter, we expect European Olefins and Polymers results to improve due to firm pricing, lower energy costs and improved seasonal demand. In addition, we continue to monitor the slow and gradual return of Chinese demand.\nFinally, we are staying true to our commitment to grow and upgrade our core businesses. Our acquisition of the Saudi Arabian NATPET joint venture is expected to close in the coming months. The NATPET acquisition is an excellent example of LyondellBasell's strategy to drive long-term growth with advantaged assets.\nIn line with our sustainability goals, we signed another renewable power purchase agreement of 208 megawatts of generation capacity in Germany. With this new agreement, LyondellBasell is rapidly moving towards our 2030 target to supply at least half of our electricity from renewable sources. We now have more than 90% of our 2030 target sourced through agreements for wind and solar electricity capacity.\nNow let's turn to Slide 13 and discuss the results for the Refining segment. First quarter EBITDA was $71 million. Fourth quarter 2023 results were impacted by LIFO charges of approximately $40 million. Improvement in the gasoline crack spread was partially offset by lower volumes related to planned and unplanned downtime. As previously mentioned, we have implemented a hedging program for a portion of our distillate production to mitigate risk throughout 2024. During the first quarter, distillate cracks outperformed expectations and our results include a mark-to-market losses for the program.\nIn the near term, we expect seasonally stronger demand for gasoline amid rising crude oil prices. We intend to maximize crude throughput at the refinery, and operated approximately 95% of capacity in the second quarter.\nLooking ahead, we remain committed to the safe and reliable operation of these assets. We will continue to target high operating rates until ramp-down begins in the first quarter of 2025. Our team is evaluating several new projects to transform the site in support of our Circular and Low-Carbon Solutions growth strategy.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Aaron.\n\nAaron Ledet\n\nExecutive Vice President of Intermediates & Derivatives\n\nThank you, Kim, and thank you, Peter, for the kind introduction at the beginning of the call. Like Kim, I'm honored to have the opportunity to lead the Intermediate to Derivatives segment.\nDuring my career at LyondellBasell, I have served in leadership roles touching on supply chain, APS, Europe, I&D, Refining, and most recently leading O&P in the Americas. I look forward to my new responsibilities to drive value creation and growth across the core businesses within intermediates and derivatives at LYB.\nPlease turn to Slide 14 as we look at the Intermediates and Derivatives segment. In the first quarter, segment EBITDA was $312 million. As a reminder, the fourth quarter results were impacted by LIFO charges of approximately $95 million. Our European propylene oxide and derivatives business benefited from logistics disruptions in the Red Sea, leading to near-shoring of local demand that drove higher volumes and margins in the region, a dynamic which has continued into the second quarter.\nIn the first quarter, oxyfuels margins declined due to lower premiums for oxyfuels relative to gasoline. Despite these headwinds, oxyfuels margins remained more than double the level typically seen during the seasonally slow first quarter. Industry outages during the first quarter led to higher styrene margins that have since normalized in April.\nLooking ahead, we anticipate seasonal improvements across all businesses in the segment including benefits from the summer driving season and lower butane costs, providing support for continued strength in oxyfuels margins.\nIn line with our guidance from the beginning of the year, we have planned maintenance underway at one of our POSM assets in Channelview, Texas. We expect higher volumes across most of our business following unplanned downtime in the first quarter. Our team continues to do a fantastic job in running our new [ PO/TBA ] facility with high reliability and utilization while ensuring superb product quality. After considering planned maintenance, we expect to operate at an average rate of about 80% of I&D capacity during the second quarter.\nThe process to complete the sale of our ethylene oxide derivatives businesses to INEOS is well underway, and we expect to finalize the transaction in the second quarter. We anticipate a book gain on sale of $275 million, which will be reflected as an identified item during the second quarter.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Torkel.\n\nTorkel Rhenman\n\nExecutive Vice President of Advanced Polymer Solutions\n\nThank you, Aaron. Let's review the first quarter results for the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 15. First quarter EBITDA was $35 million. Volumes increased 12% across our portfolio driven by improving seasonal demand and the lack of typical fourth quarter customers' downtime.\nVariable margins increased due to higher pricing and product mix improvements. This was offset by fixed cost investments during the quarter as we moved forward on our APS transformation.\nIn the second quarter, we expect volumes will continue to show modest improvement benefiting from both seasonally higher demand and our growing pipeline of new business. We continue to see good momentum as we expand our growth funnel, with our team highly focused on winning projects with both new and existing customers. Utilizing both our recently acquired metal assets as well as our existing asset base, we are providing customers with innovative and sustainable solutions. We believe that our APS transformation, coupled with market recovery, will deliver results to reach the goals we laid out at our Capital Markets Day last year.\nWith that, I will return the call back to Peter.\n\nPeter Z. E. Vanacker\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman of the Executive Board, Neste Oyj\n\nThank you, Torkel. And please turn to Slide 16, and I will discuss the results for the Technology segment on behalf of Jim Seward.\nFirst quarter EBITDA of $118 million reflected higher licensing revenue and improved catalyst margins. In the second quarter, we expect that revenue associated with licensing milestones will decrease, matching fourth quarter 2023 levels, but will be slightly offset by an increased catalyst volumes. As a result, we estimate that second quarter Technology segment results will be similar or perhaps slightly better than fourth quarter results.\nPlease turn to Slide 17 as we discuss the near-term market outlook by regions and end markets. As you heard from our business leaders, we expect to see typical increases in seasonal demand along with some moderate improvements in markets throughout the year. In the Americas, improving export demand for polyethylene is expected to further tighten domestic markets. And additionally, low ethane costs should continue to strengthen integrated polyethylene margins.\nAs we move through the year, we expect European markets will begin to see modest improvements. Industrial activity in the region is increasing, and we expect demand will continue to recover as [ long ] energy costs gradually improve confidence. The Red Sea logistics disruptions that bolstered first quarter demand continued to influence local purchasing decisions. China markets are exhibiting very slow but steady improvement. We're encouraged by China's targeted stimulus efforts and remain watchful for indications that these measures will deliver meaningful improvements in demand for LYB's products.\nFor the packaging sector, demand for nondurables has been consistent. Given that destocking across the packaging value chain seems to be complete, we look forward to the potential for restocking ahead.\nIn Building & Construction, we expect to see some benefits from moderating and perhaps falling interest rates and the inevitable recovery in demand for durable goods. In the U.S., stimulus funding from the bipartisan Infrastructure Law will begin to support improving demand for commercial construction with growing benefits expected as the year unfolds.\nIn the automotive sector, global production is expected to modestly improve from first quarter levels throughout 2024. Moreover, our APS segment is committed to strategic initiatives focused on winning back customers and growing the business.\nAnd in oxyfuels and refining, gasoline crack spreads are improving from the lows we saw at the end of the fourth quarter of last year. U.S. vehicle miles traveled have returned to pre-pandemic levels and the value for octane from our oxyfuels is strong. At LYB, we continue to optimize our assets on a global scale by aligning our operating rates to meet market demand and maximize cash generation.\nNow let me summarize the first quarter, our outlook and our long-term strategy for the company, with Slide 18. As we move into the summer months, we anticipate seasonal improvements across our businesses in the second quarter. Moving through the year, we expect improvement in the second half driven by stable to lower interest rates and modestly higher demand. LYB's U.S. and Middle East production should continue to benefit from advantaged natural gas-based feedstock and energy costs compared to oil-based peers. Red Sea logistic disruptions were beneficial to our European businesses in the first quarter of 2024 and the time it will take for these tailwinds to fade is uncertain.\nAs we mentioned in our fourth quarter earnings call, we are committed to delivering $600 million of recurring annual EBITDA by the end of 2024 through our value enhancement program. We continue to see enthusiastic support for the program across the company as it becomes an evergreen part of our culture. Our team will continue to remain focused on advancing value creation through the 3 pillars of our long-term strategy.\nProgress continues on growing and upgrading our core businesses. In the coming months, we expect to close on the acquisition of our NATPET propylene and polypropylene joint venture in Saudi Arabia. Our divestiture of ethylene oxide and derivatives business to INEOS is expected to occur during the second quarter.\nAs we discussed today, LYB continues to build a comprehensive business model to support a profitable Circular and Low-Carbon Solutions business. LyondellBasell is making smart investments to build capabilities across every step of the value chain with a global scale in mind.\nWith construction already underway for our first MoReTec advanced recycling assets in Germany, we're building on this momentum with FID for our second larger unit in Houston plans for 2025. Our actions demonstrate LYB's commitment to capture value with Circular and Low-Carbon Solutions.\nOur value enhancement program continues to grow and is a key element of our company culture. Currently, the program is on track to add up to $1 billion of incremental recurring annual EBITDA by the end of 2025, significantly surpassing our original goals. We're laser focused on our target to deliver a more profitable and sustainable growth engine for LyondellBasell.\nNow with that, we're pleased to take your questions."

A recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1 p.m. Eastern Time today until March 2 by calling (877) 660-6853 in the United States and 201612an 7415 outside the United States.\nThe access code for both numbers is 137)42056. Joining today's call will be Peter Vanacker, Lyondell sale's Chief Executive Officer; our CFO, Michael McMurray; Ken Lane, our Executive Vice President of Global Olefins and Polyolefins, Kim Foley, our EVP of Intermediates and Derivatives and Refining; and Torkel Rhenman, our EVP of Advanced Polymer Solutions.\nDuring today's call, we will focus on fourth quarter and full year 2023 results, including an update on NYB's strategic progress. We will also discuss current market dynamics and our near-term outlook. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter.\n\nPeter Z. E. Vanacker\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman of the Executive Board, Neste Oyj\n\nThank you, Dave, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. Let's begin, as we always do, with our safety results on Slide 3. During 2023, our employees and contractors demonstrated their commitment to outstanding safety performance. LYB's total recordable injury rate was 0.14, which is approximately 20% lower than the average of the prior 3 years. I want to congratulate our APS segment where injuries were 38% lower than 2022, a significant improvement from historical levels.\nWe always view safety performance as a leading indicator of operational excellence and business performance. But there is no greater value than seeing every member of our team, return home to their families every day in the same health has -- when they begin to work their working day. Let's now turn to Slide 4 to discuss our financial results. 2023 was another challenging year for petrochemicals. While energy prices moderated in an environment of geopolitical unrest, markets were extremely cautious due to uncertainty about inflation, and the potential for a more pronounced downturn in economic activity.\nReported GDP growth in the U.S. and China improved relative to 2022, but growth in petrochemicals was far below norms for our industry. Against that backdrop, LYB delivered earnings of $8.65 per share with an EBITDA of $5.2 billion. Cash generation was exceptional and resulted in $4.9 billion of cash from operations. We have a highly efficient cash conversion ratio of 98%. We ended the year with $7.6 billion of liquidity, supported by a strong investment-grade balance sheet, and we exceeded our cost of capital with an 11% return on invested capital.\nIn March of last year, we successfully launched our new strategy at our Capital Markets Day in New York. Now let's turn to Slide 5 and briefly review the strategy. Our goal was to create focus, clarity and alignment about their direction LyondellBasell would be moving over the next 5 years and provides a clear vision of what the company would look like in 2027. Our strategy is built around 3 pillars: growing and upgrading the core, building a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business and stepping up performance and culture.\nIn growing and upgrading the core, we are investing in businesses that fit with our competitive advantages and long-term strategy. Our circular and low-carbon solutions business is driving leadership in circularity and addressing the massive demand for these products from our customers and society. In the third pillar, we are transforming the culture of LYB to embed a more comprehensive view of value creation while continuing to recognize that stringent cost management is vital in our industry.\nOn Slide 6, we highlight our progress on our strategy in 2023 and the work underway over the next few years towards our 2027 goals. In just 10 months, since launching our strategy last March, LyondellBasell has unlocked nearly 1/3 of the $3 billion of incremental normalized EBITDA that we are targeting for 2027. The successful start-up of the PO/TBA plant this year is a major step forward in growing and upgrading our core by adding approximately $450 million to our normalized EBITDA.\nAnd I am very pleased to report that our value enhancement program is far exceeding our initial expectations. In 2023, the VEP achieved a year-end run rate of more than $400 million of mid-cycle recurring annual EBITDA improvements. And Michael will share more details on the progress of the VEP in a few moments. As shown on the slide, we have numerous work streams underway to build toward our strategic goals of $2 billion of incremental normalized EBITDA by 2025 and a total of $3 billion by 2027. With the announced sale of the Italian oxide and derivatives business to INEOS for $700 million we are redirecting resources away from non core businesses. The deal we announced in January to acquire 35% of net debt in Saudi Arabia for approximately $500 million is just one example of how we are growing our core cost advantaged olefins and polyolefins businesses.\nWe're making great strides in building strong foundations for our circular and low-carbon solutions business. In 2023, we took a final investment decision for our first tranche of advanced recycling capacity in Germany using our proprietary catalytic [ Mortech ] technology. And we are building partnerships to source waste plastic to supply our app in Germany, while also securing waste plastic in Houston to supply our next investment in advanced recycling capacity.\nAnd the VEP program is not a onetime initiative. Michael will describe our increased targets for 2024 and beyond. While we have a lot of work ahead of us, I want to congratulate our team on the substantial progress we achieved on our strategic journey in 2023, ensuring a robust platform for longer-term value creation and positive leverage to any market turnarounds. On Slide 7, let's take a look at the steps ahead to deliver on our goals. We will continue to grow and upgrade our core businesses by focusing on advantaged feedstocks in growing markets where LYB can build or extend our leading market position. Our new joint venture in Saudi Arabia is 1 example of how we will do this.\nAs we add new positions, we will continue to review our portfolio for businesses and assets that are not aligned with our long-term strategy. The divestiture of EVO and Derivatives business, the sale of our Australian polypropylene business, the shutdown of a polypropylene line in Italy and the exit of the refining business are all examples of how we are sharpening the focus of our business portfolio.\nThe rapid progress of the LYB value enhancement program also contributes to our growth through low-cost capacity debottlenecks and productivity improvements. We are making good progress on building the foundations for our circular and low-carbon solutions business. as we work towards our goal of $500 million of incremental EBITDA by 2027 and $1 billion by 2030. And our VEP is not only delivering growth and productivity. The VEP also supports the third pillar of our strategy to step up performance and culture by instilling a value-based mindset across the company. We have numerous initiatives to improve margins through customer and commercial excellence embedded NDEP. And our work is to transform our Advanced Polymer Solutions business is also an important part of our work to step up performance and culture.\nAll of our progress is supported by our foundations of efficient cash generation, disciplined capital allocation and our investment-grade balance sheet. We're leveraging partnerships where it fits to achieve growth with capital efficiency, and we're pursuing a very value-focused investment program and we remain steadfast in our support for a secure, competitive and growing dividend as part of our commitment to competitive shareholder returns. And now I will turn the call over to Michael to discuss the details of our financial progress.\n\nMichael C. McMurray\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Owens Corning\n\nThank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8, and let's take a look at the progress of our value enhancement program. As Peter mentioned, LIBs value enhancement program far exceeded our initial expectations in 2023. When we launched the program, we thought we could achieve a 2023 year-end run rate of $150 million of mid-cycle recurring annual EBITDA improvement with high engagement and rapid execution, our team achieved a run rate of more than $400 million by year-end 2023.\nWe have a strong management system in place for our VEP program. Our team has screened more than 13,000 ideas and more than 1,900 of these ideas have advanced to the execution ready stage of our process. By the end of 2023, we executed on approximately 450 of these initiatives. Our system is robust and disciplined and our internal and external auditors have validated our processes. We currently believe this effort will add a total of $600 million of recurring annual EBITDA by the end of 2024 and up to $1 billion by the end of 2025.\nThis is a significant increase from our initial target of $750 million that we announced last March driven by the enthusiastic buying of our colleagues and the tangible results that we have delivered so far. The LYB value enhancement program is providing meaningful contributions to our strategic financial goals and will continue to do so as we move forward. On Slide 9, let me share more details about the progress on our BEP program during 2023.\nOur targets for the program are described as year-end run rates relative to 2021 volumes and using average margins from 2017 to 2019, a time period that provides a good approximation of mid-cycle margins. Through more than 450 initiatives, we generated over $300 million of VEP EBITDA from the program based on 2023 margins. This reflects the net recurring improvements throughout the year relative to 2021 volume, product mix and cost. Now let me highlight a few of the initiatives from last year.\nAt our Lake Charles integrated polyethylene joint venture, we automated controls for a water treatment unit that reduced manual operations and water consumption with a small investment we were able to reduce LYB share of cost by $800,000 annually. In our oxyfuels business, our cost advantaged U.S. production is exported in vessels to markets around the world. We worked with one of our terminal providers to encourage their investment in a vapor recovery system that allowed LAB to double vessel loading rates to reduce demerge costs and vapor emissions for a net recurring benefit of $1 million per year.\nBy investing resources to learn more about the needs of our customers, our polymer product development team, allocated resources for new products to serve demanding applications and wire and cable seating for subsea infrastructure markets. This initiative improved recording profitability by at least $300,000 per year. We hope these examples provide you with some insight into the hundreds of small initiatives that we have -- that we expect to add up to $1 billion of mid-cycle recurring annual EBITDA to LIBs run rate by the end of 2025. Please turn to Slide 10 and let me begin by highlighting the outstanding cash generation from our business portfolio during 2023.\nLYB generated a total of $4.9 billion of cash from operating activities over the past year. Cash on hand increased to $3.4 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. During 2023, we achieved cash conversion of 98%, well above our long-term target of 80%. Our cash conversion was bolstered by a working capital reduction of approximately $700 million during the fourth quarter. The majority of the working capital benefit was from lower receivables and inventories. We expect our working capital needs will increase during the first quarter.\nOur efficient cash generation allowed the company to return more than $1.8 billion to LyondellBasell shareholders in 2023, this represents 53% of our $3.4 billion of free cash flow for the year. Let's continue with Slide 11 and review the details of our capital allocation over the past year. As Peter mentioned, we are committed to disciplined capital allocation as we execute our strategy and maintain our robust investment-grade balance sheet.\nDuring 2023, cash from operating activities fully funded $1.6 billion in dividends, $210 million in share repurchases and our capital investment program. In May, we increased our quarterly dividend by 5%, marking the 13th consecutive year of annual dividend growth. This year, we invested $1.5 billion in capital expenditures. We reached an important milestone with the successful start-up of our new PO/TBA asset in 2023.\nWith the completion of this world-scale project our future capital expenditures will be increasingly focused on a portfolio of smaller projects to advance our strategy. This includes investments in small profit-generating projects integrated hubs for circular solutions and hundreds of initiatives within the value enhancement program. We ended the year with $3.4 billion of cash and short-term investments and $7.6 million of cash and available liquidity.\nIn line with our strategic focus on leadership and sustainability, we issued our inaugural green bond for $500 million. LYB's robust balance sheet positions us well to move forward on our long-term strategy during the year ahead. One last comment. We added over $1 billion of cash to our balance sheet in 2023 and as a result of strong execution amid challenging market conditions.\nAs a result, we are carrying about 2x our stated minimum of $1.5 billion. We have built a bit more cash because of the challenging market conditions and uncertain economic outlook that we have been navigating. That said, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged, and we remain committed to returning 70% of our free cash flow to shareholders over the long term.\nNow I would like to provide an overview of the quarterly results for each of our segments on Page 12. LYB's business portfolio delivered $910 million of EBITDA during the fourth quarter. Our lower results reflect a significant decline in gasoline crack spreads and seasonally lower demand during the fourth quarter. Lower gasoline crack spreads negatively impacted our refining results. Oxyfuels and the intermediate [indiscernible] segment and the value of co-product fuels in olefins and polyolefins, Americas.\nDuring the quarter, lower ethane and energy cost and increased polyethylene exports benefited our O&P Americas business. Overall, olefins and polyolefins demand remains soft, particularly in Europe, where utilization rates remained low. Lower demand and higher raw material costs negatively impacted our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment.\nAcross the portfolio, a noncash LIFO inventory valuation charge decreased pretax fourth quarter results by approximately $55 million. As a reminder, the LIFO impact reflects changes in inventory valuation over the full year and is not necessarily limited to fourth quarter valuations.\nBefore we discuss our segment results in detail, let me discuss our capital expenditure plans for 2024. We expect that our CapEx will be approximately $2.1 billion this year, a $600 million increase compared to 2023, our capital plan includes approximately $800 million for profit-generating growth projects and $1.3 billion of sustaining investment to keep our assets running safely and reliably.\nThe increased profit-generating capital includes investments to grow our circular and low-carbon solutions business as well as investments to lower the carbon footprint of our existing asset base, particularly in Europe. Funding required to drive our value enhancement program is included in our CapEx plan.\nWe expect our 2024 effective tax rate will be approximately 20% and our cash tax rate will be a few percentage points higher. In the appendix of this slide deck, we have provided additional 2024 modeling information, including impacts from major plant maintenance costs associated with the exit from our refining business than other useful financial metrics. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Ken?\n\nKenneth Todd Lane\n\nInterim CEO & EVP of Global Olefins & Polyolefins, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 13 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $604 million. During the quarter, a significant decrease in co-product values negatively impacted olefins margins. Polyolefin prices were stable domestically, while a very strong export volume led to some lower pricing in our overall portfolio.\nStrong demand from export markets continues to drive increased polyethylene volumes, and we didn't see the typical seasonal slowdown. We operated our assets at approximately 85% of nameplate capacity to match market demand and continued to actively manage working capital. Fourth quarter EBITDA included a LIFO inventory valuation benefit of approximately $75 million. During the first quarter, we expect polyethylene prices to remain firm with modest improvements in domestic demand and ongoing strength in export markets.\nWe anticipate ethane and energy costs will remain favorable for our assets in the region, providing some margin tailwinds. Overall, we expect to operate our O&P-Americas assets at an average of approximately 80% during the first quarter, slightly lower than fourth quarter 2023 due to planned maintenance. In December, we signed 2 new renewable power purchase agreements. With these agreements, we've achieved almost 90% of our goal to procure at least 50% of our global power from renewable sources by 2030.\nIn total, we have 12 agreements in place, representing more than 1.3 gigawatts of renewable power capacity. As we mentioned last quarter, we announced our investment in cyclyx a joint venture with Agilux and ExxonMobil. This partnership is focused on increasing plastic waste, recycling infrastructure to improve circularity. In December, Cyclyx announced the final investment decision to build the first Cyclyx circularity Center in Houston. The Circularity Center will focus on increasing plastic waste recycling options through better sourcing and sorting of plastic waste.\nThe facility will have the capacity to produce more than 130,000 tons of plastic feedstock per year for advanced and mechanical recycling and is expected to start up in 2025. Now please turn to Slide 14 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. During the quarter, European markets remained weak with softer seasonal demand and lower consumer confidence. Polymer prices were modestly higher with an improved sales mix and stable naphtha feedstock costs.\nDue to the low demand, we operated our assets at rates of approximately 65% during the quarter. The combined impact of the weak demand and low rates led to a fourth quarter EBITDA loss of $87 million. As we move into 2024, we expect weak European demand will persist with ongoing consumer uncertainty. Nonetheless, we are seeing modest improvements in orders as some customers begin to restock and seek local supply as imports moving through the red sea are disrupted. We expect to operate our European assets at a rate of 75% during the first quarter.\nDemand in China remains muted as customers manage inventories with the approach of the Lunar New Year amid a slow economic environment. As Peter mentioned earlier, we are making great progress on our strategy to grow and upgrade our core businesses. Our recent announcement to acquire a 35% share of [ Nat Pet ] reflects our focus on assets that have long-term advantage. But we're also moving away from the assets that can't deliver long-term competitiveness as demonstrated by last year's decision to close 1 of our 2 polypropylene assets in Brindisi Intel. We are also making good progress with building our circular and low-carbon business.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we made the final investment decision to build our first commercial catalytic advanced recycling plant at our [ Wesseling, ] Germany site and just like in Houston, we are collaborating with partners to secure plastic waste feedstock in Germany. In December, we acquired a minority share of SourceOne Plastics, a plastic waste sourcing company in Germany. Source One will provide the majority of the process plastic waste feedstock to our new Mortech asset.\nThrough our integrated hub model, we are establishing an integrated circular value chain at scale. Now please turn to Slide 15, and let's take a closer look at our new NATPET joint venture. A few weeks ago, we announced our agreement to acquire a 35% share of national petrochemical industrial company or NAP PEP from Allergan Corporation in Yanbu, Saudi Arabia. The joint venture is a great example of how we are growing our core businesses with advantaged assets by leveraging LYB's leading technology and global market reach. Today, [indiscernible] consists of 400,000 tons of propane dehydrogenation or PDH capacity that converts cost-advantaged Saudi propane into propylene monomer to feed a 400,000-ton polypropylene unit utilizing LYB's proprietary spare technology. The assets have been operational since 2009 and have generated an annual average of USD 155 million in EBITDA over the 5 years from 2018 to 2022.\nNat Pet's PP products serve a diverse range of customers across global markets. As part of the transaction, LYB will leverage our global marketing network to sell a majority of the product on behalf of [indiscernible] creating a new revenue stream for LYB. [indiscernible] assets are first quartile, that have the advantage of sourcing local Saudi propane feedstock at a discount to global prices. Also, our investment in [indiscernible] provides a platform for continued growth.\nIn 2022, [indiscernible] was awarded a new feedstock allocation that could support additional capacity. The partners are evaluating a second PDH PP asset on the site that would benefit from meaningful synergies. Previously, Allogene selected LYB Sperosone polypropylene technology for the potential expansion. The high-performance polypropylene solutions enabled by our proprietary Sphere Zone technology provides the potential to expand [ Natpet's ] production into new applications and markets. We expect our investment in [indiscernible] will exceed our 12% target for unlevered internal rates of return. Additional capacity could provide even higher returns.\nWe expect the transaction will close in the first half of 2024, following regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. With that, I will turn the call over to Kim.\n\nKimberly A. Foley\n\nEVP of Intermediates, Derivatives & Refining, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you, Ken. Please turn to Slide 16 as we take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $265 million. Oxyfuel margins declined due to a significant decrease in gasoline tax spreads as well as an increased supply of oxyfuels after industry downtime during the third quarter. Styrene margins were pressured due to higher benzene feedstock costs. LIFO inventory charges were approximately $95 million. In the fourth quarter, we recognized an impairment of $192 million related to our PO/SM joint venture in the Netherlands.\nWe operated our assets at a rate of approximately 70% during the fourth quarter due to low demand as well as planned and unplanned downtime across most businesses. As we begin the first quarter, Oxyfuel margins remained similar to fourth quarter levels. We anticipate higher volumes across the segment after downtime in the fourth quarter and plan to operate across the I&D segment at approximately 75% in the first quarter. These operating rates reflect the impact of the recent winter freeze event resulting in unplanned downtime at our U.S. Off Coast assets.\nIn December, we announced an agreement to divest our ethylene oxide and derivative business to [indiscernible] for $700 million. As Peter mentioned earlier, we are taking decisive actions to grow and upgrade the businesses and assets that align with our long-term strategy, while exiting businesses where LIB does not have a path to a leading position. We expect the transaction will close in the second quarter following regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.\nPlease note that the agreed transaction price is pretax and that these assets are heavily depreciated. Now let's turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results of the Refining segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $51 million, including charges of $40 million of LIFO inventory valuation Refining margins compressed due to lower gasoline crack spreads. During the quarter, we operated the refinery at 85% of capacity due to planned and unplanned downtime with an average crude rate of 230,000 barrels per day. In the near term, we expect gasoline crack spreads will improve, offset by lower distillate cracks.\nWe plan to operate the refinery at approximately 80% of capacity in the first quarter, including a planned coker outage with an estimated EBITDA impact of $50 million. Our team remains highly focused on safe and reliable operations as we continue to run our refining assets through no later than the end of the first quarter of 2025. With that, I will turn the call over to Torkel.\n\nTorkel Rhenman\n\nExecutive Vice President of Advanced Polymer Solutions\n\nThank you, Kim. Now let's review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 18. Fourth quarter EBITDA declined to $12 million. Margins were pressured by higher raw material costs and volumes decreased due to seasonally lower fourth quarter demand with a slowdown in December due to customer outages. Life inventory valuations benefits were $10 million.\nLooking ahead, we see signs of market recovery and expect modest demand improvement in the first quarter. This year, we continued our transformation journey with Advanced Polymer Solutions. APS results in 2023 were lower than 2022 and not reflected of our financial expectations for this business. Success with APS customers is largely based on project by project qualification. Today's underperformance is indicative of our low success rate in gaining new qualifications during prior quarters. However, our laser focus on our customers is gaining momentum.\nWe have seen a step-up in our recent surveys of customer satisfaction with an organization that is focused and accountable we're making steady progress as we rebuild our project growth funnel. Our growth pipeline is already delivering. During the fourth quarter of 2023, volumes improved by 2.5% over the prior year. I want to congratulate the APS team for achieving record safety performance in 2023.\nI truly believe our customer focus, as measured by our recent customer satisfaction survey, our progress in refilling our growth funnel and our superior safety results reflects our attention to detail that provides a leading indicator for operational performance and eventual financial results. With that, I will return the call back to Peter.\n\nPeter Z. E. Vanacker\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman of the Executive Board, Neste Oyj\n\nThanks, Torkel. I would like to thank the entire LyondellBasell team for delivering such resilient results during a very challenging year. To close out on the segments, let's turn to Slide 19 and discuss the results for our technology business on behalf of Jim Seward. During the fourth quarter, licensing revenue moderated after exceptionally strong results in the third quarter due to the timing of licensing milestones. Nonetheless, EBITDA for the segment exceeded the fourth quarter of the prior year.\nFourth quarter catalyst volumes were higher than any quarter since the third quarter of 2022. First quarter results for the technology segments were expected to improve due to increased licensing revenue and a further rise in catalyst volumes compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. As Ken mentioned earlier, we will utilize our proprietary [ MoReTec ] technology as we build our first commercial scale advanced recycling plant in Germany. I'm very proud of the work our R&D team embarked on years ago to develop this differential and advantage technology from lab to commercial scale.\nLet me now summarize our outlook with Slide 20. As we begin 2024, the majority of our businesses are continuing to face the slow demand seen in the fourth quarter of 2023. But we are seeing a few early signs of improvement. Our North American O&P business is seeing modest demand improvements. In Europe, order trends were improving from a very low level as our O&P customers begin to pursue modest restocking. For the year, we expect normal seasonal demand improvements to begin near the end of the first quarter and continue through the summer.\nAs we progress through the second half of the year, we expect demand to benefit from moderating interest rates and reduced inflation. Durable goods are a critical market for LYB products. Demand for durable goods lacked the economy during 2022 and 2023. As markets digested the extraordinary high levels of consumer activity that prevailed during pandemic era stimulus. We expect that moderating interest rates, reduced inflation and infrastructure-related stimulus spending will begin to support a gradual return to a healthier demand for durable goods during the second half of this year.\nChina is the largest market for chemicals, exceeding North America and Europe combined, and we continue to watch closely for targeted stimulus and other measures that could drive improved economic growth in China. In the meantime, LYB will continue to advance on our strategic goals. We are actively managing our portfolio to grow and upgrade our core businesses.\nWe will continue to see actions supporting the growth of regional hubs that will serve as the engines for our profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business. And our work to embed value creation into our corporate culture will continue to deliver results through our value enhancement program. We're now pleased to take your questions."

At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. [Operator Instructions]\nI'll now turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nDavid Kinney\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nGood day, everybody, and thank you all for joining today's call.\nBefore we begin the discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations.\nToday, we will be discussing our business results, while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are also available on our Investor Relations website.\nComments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results using non-GAAP financial measures, such as EBITDA and earnings per share, excluding identified items. Additional documents on our Investor website provide reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release and our business results discussion.\nA recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time today until November 27, by calling (877) 660-6853 in the United States and (201) 612-7415 outside the United States. The access code for both numbers is 13739196.\nJoining today's call will be Peter Vanacker, LyondellBasell's Chief Executive Officer; our CFO, Michael McMurray; Ken Lane, our Executive Vice President of Global Olefins and Polyolefins; Kim Foley, our EVP of Intermediates & Derivatives and Refining; and Torkel Rhenman, our EVP of Advanced Polymer Solutions.\nDuring today's call, we will focus on third quarter results, current market dynamics, our near-term outlook and our long-term strategy.\nWith that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter.\n\nPeter Z. E. Vanacker\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman of the Executive Board, Neste Oyj\n\nThank you, David, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our third quarter results. Starting with Slide 3.\nWe have three key messages for today's call. First, LyondellBasell continues to generate resilient results despite challenging market conditions. Our team delivered exceptional cash conversion during the quarter. And our balanced approach to capital deployment was on full display, as we repaid maturing bonds, funded investments to grow and maintain our assets and rewarded shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. At the same time, thanks to great teamwork, we were able to bolster the cash on our balance sheet.\nSecondly, we remain focused on executing our long-term strategy. You will recall that our strategy is built on three pillars. The first pillar reflects our commitment to actively grow and upgrade the core businesses that are aligned with our long-term strategy. We are growing our Intermediates & Derivatives segment through the successful start-up of our new PO/TBA facilities, the largest single train propylene oxide plant in the world.\nIn the third quarter, extremely strong margins for oxyfuels produced from our PO/TBA assets contributed to a record-setting quarterly EBITDA for our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. Kim will provide more details on this in a few minutes.\nThe other half of growing and upgrading our core involve difficult decisions about businesses and assets that do not really fit with our long-term direction. In September, we announced our intent to close one of our two polypropylene production units in Brindisi, Italy. And our plans to exit the refining business and transform the site are very well known.\nThese actions are examples of how the pillars of our strategy reinforce each other. We're actively managing our business portfolio to reallocate resources toward assets and businesses that support the growth of our core, while building the second pillar of our strategy, a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business.\nWe continue to make good progress in this area, producing and marketing over 250,000 ton-site of recycled or renewable-based polymers since 2019. As Jim Seward and Yvonne van der Laan discussed in our MoReTec webinar last month, we're looking forward to a final investment decision later this quarter on our first commercial advanced catalytic recycling plant in Germany.\nAnd we are not sitting still, in just the past few weeks, we've announced joint ventures in two different Dutch plastic waste recycling companies, a stake in a circular plastic venture capital fund and a joint venture in infrastructure and recycled plastic feedstocks that support our plans for an integrated circular and low-carbon solutions here in Houston and also a renewable electricity supply agreement in Spain.\nOur value enhancement program aligns with the third pillar of our strategy, stepping up our performance and culture. I am pleased to announce that our VEP is on track to exceed our target for $200 million in recurring annual EBITDA run rate by the end of 2023.\nAs a reminder, last quarter, we increased our VEP target by $50 million, from our initial target of $150 million that we announced at our Capital Markets Day in March. The new phone value unlocked by the VEP supports our investments to grow our core, while building a profitable and game-changing circular and low-carbon solutions business.\nMy third key message is that LyondellBasell's focused strategy is strengthening our business portfolio to ensure our company is well positioned to capture value today and into the future. Our track record of effective cost management, operational excellence and innovation all provide competitive advantages. With a sharper focus on core businesses that benefit from leading positions in growing markets with attractive returns, we can maximize the impact of these competitive advantages. I hope you share our excitement for the future of LyondellBasell.\nLet's turn to Slide 4 and begin the discussion with our foundational commitment to leadership and safety performance. Safe operations are fundamental to our core values and provide the cornerstone for our future success. LyondellBasell's year-to-date incident rate for employees and contractors is 0.14, which means that our safety performance remains above the top 75th percentile for our industry. I want to congratulate our team for their outstanding safety performance.\nLet's turn to Slide 5 and summarize our financial results. During the third quarter, LyondellBasell's businesses delivered resilient results and strong cash generation from our well positioned and diverse portfolio. Earnings were $2.46 per share. EBITDA was $1.4 billion. At the end of the quarter, our cash from operating activities was $1.7 billion, with $7 billion of available liquidity.\nNow let me turn the call over to Michael first, and then to each of our business leaders, who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail.\n\nMichael C. McMurray\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Owens Corning\n\nThank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 6, and let me begin by describing how we are extending our track record of efficient cash conversion that supports our investment-grade balance sheet and strong shareholder returns.\nDuring the past 4 quarters, LyondellBasell generated $5 billion of cash from operating activities. At the end of the third quarter, our cash balance was $2.8 billion. Our team efficiently converted 102% of our EBITDA into cash over the last 12 months.\nLet's continue with Slide 7 and review the details of our capital deployment during the third quarter. LyondellBasell remains committed to balanced and disciplined capital allocation that supports investment in our long-term strategy, while providing strong returns for our shareholders.\nDuring the third quarter, our portfolio of businesses generated $1.7 billion in cash from operating activities. Robust cash conversion comfortably covered capital expenditures, paid down maturing bonds and enabled a return of $448 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nAs Peter mentioned, our team is focused on growing and upgrading our core businesses, while actively managing our portfolio. With the completion of our new PO/TBA assets, our capital expenditures are now focused on investments in building a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business and smaller profit-generating projects as well as maintaining safe and reliable operations across our existing asset base.\nI would now like to provide a brief overview of the results from each of our segments on Slide 8. LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered $1.4 billion of EBITDA during the third quarter. Our results reflected exceptional oxyfuel margins that fueled record quarterly EBITDA in I&D, offset by lower margins from both O&P segments. Results in our olefins and polyolefins businesses were pressured by higher feedstock cost, new industry capacity and very challenging conditions in European markets.\nIn our last earnings call, we shared our expectation that third quarter EBITDA would decline from second quarter results. Subsequent events led to results that exceeded our expectations, primarily in our I&D segment. During August and into September, unplanned downtime at several assets across the U.S. Gulf Coast oxyfuels industry triggered a significant improvement in margins that increased I&D EBITDA by 50% relative to the second quarter.\nOur third quarter EBITDA for the company did decline slightly, but clearly exceeded the upper end of our expectations. We continue to align our operating rates with market demand to optimize working capital. During the fourth quarter, we expect operating rates of 85% for our North American olefins and polyolefins assets, 75% for our European olefins and polyolefins and 70% for intermediates and derivative assets.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Ken?\n\nKenneth Todd Lane\n\nInterim CEO & EVP of Global Olefins & Polyolefins, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment for discussions on Slide 9 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment.\nThird quarter O&P Americas EBITDA was $504 million. Integrated polyethylene margins were pressured by higher feedstock costs and continued oversupply. Global polyethylene trade flows appear to be slowly normalizing toward pre-pandemic conditions. Increasing export prices and volumes helped to support U.S. polyethylene contract price increases in both August and September.\nIn the fourth quarter, we expect strengthening polyethylene pricing supported by stable domestic volume and continued export strength. We also expect potential headwinds from volatile feedstock and energy costs. The U.S. polyethylene market is well supplied with recent capacity additions entering the market.\nWe remain focused on our disciplined approach to match LyondellBasell's operating rates with market demand. Roughly 2/3 of LyondellBasell's North America polyethylene capacity is high-density polyethylene. So we are pleased to see high-density polyethylene inventories falling across the industry during September.\nIn support of our growth in circular and low-carbon solutions, we announced a venture capital investment in Lombard Odier's Plastic Circularity Fund. The fund aims to reduce pollution from plastics by investing in companies offering innovative solutions to improve the collection, sorting and recycling of plastic waste. This fund is another example of our comprehensive engagement and collaboration across the value chain to increase the availability of recycled feedstocks.\nJust this week, we announced our investment in Cyclyx, a joint venture between Agilux, ExxonMobil and LyondellBasell, to accelerate the development of a nationwide circular economy for plastics. The collaboration aims to capture more plastic waste from landfills and provide infrastructure and recycled materials at scale in support of our plans to build an integrated circular and low-carbon solutions hub in the Houston area.\nPlease turn to Slide 10 as we review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. In the third quarter, weak demand, continued oversupply and higher naphtha costs impacted our European margins, resulting in an EBITDA loss of $45 million. As we approach year-end, we expect European markets to remain challenging, with weak demand that will likely persist. We anticipate modest polymer price increases, offsetting higher feedstock and energy costs. The slow but gradual return of Chinese demand seems to be providing some tailwinds for normalizing global trade flows.\nFinally, we took several steps during the quarter to advance our long-term strategy. As part of our goal to improve our focus on core assets and businesses, we made the difficult decision to close one of our two polypropylene assets in Brindisi, Italy. We also announced the acquisition of 50% stakes in two different Dutch recycling companies, snip out and DePaul sustainable resources. Both companies are involved in the sourcing and processing of plastic packaging waste and support our efforts to build scale by expanding the production of our circular recover products.\nIn line with our sustainability goals, we signed a renewable power purchase agreement for 149 megawatts of solar electricity generation capacity in Spain. With this, LyondellBasell has rapidly achieved 78% of our 2030 target for renewable electricity with over 1.1 gigawatts of wind and solar capacity under agreements.\nI would like to recognize our teams for their quick and decisive actions to advance our strategy.\nNow I will turn the call over to Kim.\n\nKimberly A. Foley\n\nEVP of Intermediates, Derivatives & Refining, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you, Ken. Please turn to Slide 11 as we look at the Intermediates & Derivatives segment. Exceptional oxyfuel margins resulted in record third quarter segment EBITDA of $708 million. During the quarter, unplanned industry downtime for oxyfuels production on the U.S. Gulf Coast led to higher blend premiums for oxyfuels relative to gasoline.\nWhen coupled with higher crude oil prices and relatively low cost for butane raw materials, oxyfuel margins expanded significantly in North America and Europe. The outstanding performance of our oxyfuels business during the third quarter is an example of how our diverse global business portfolio is capable of providing resilient results through market cycles.\nWith our new PO/TBA asset, LyondellBasell's global oxyfuels capacity is now as large as our North American polyethylene capacity, highlighting the diversity of our growing portfolio.\nIn our propylene oxide and derivatives business, additional volumes from the new PO/TBA asset were largely offset by the planned idling of two POSM assets in the U.S. and Europe for approximately 2 months at each asset. These actions reflect our disciplined approach to match production rates with the demands during challenging market conditions.\nLooking ahead, we expect the end of summer driving season and the higher butane costs will cause oxyfuel margins to moderate towards levels seen in the first half of 2023. In line with our guidance from the beginning of the year, we are conducting planned maintenance during the fourth quarter at two of our existing propylene oxide assets. We expect to run our global I&D assets at approximately 70% of capacity in the fourth quarter.\nIn September, we expanded the range of our sustainable offerings with the launch of our +LC brand of low-carbon solutions. These products are sourced from recycled and renewable feedstocks and offer our customers a solution for meeting their greenhouse gas emissions targets with propylene oxide, styrene and other products that provide a lower carbon footprint than fossil-based alternatives.\nPlease turn to Slide 12, and let's review the progress of our new PO/TBA asset. As Peter mentioned earlier, the first pillar of our strategy is to grow and upgrade our core by investing in businesses that fit our long-term strategy. Our new PO/TBA asset in Houston, Texas is a key part of that growth.\nThis facility is the world's largest single-train asset increasing LyondellBasell's global propylene oxide and oxyfuels capacities by more than 35%. Furthermore, we believe that PO/TBA technologies are highly advantaged relative to other widely used propylene oxide technologies.\nBy our analysis, PO/TBA technologies had the lowest operating cost and the lowest carbon footprint for producing propylene oxide. And our strategically located U.S. Gulf Coast assets benefit from the shale advantaged butane and propylene feedstocks.\nDuring the commissioning and the start-up of these assets, we achieved more than 4 million manhours of work without a recordable injury. This relentless focus on safety and the associated attention to detail is a key part of our success. Within 2 months of the plant start-up, we completed the technical acceptance test to prove out the full capacity of our new PO/TBA facilities.\nIn 2023, the ramp-up in our new capacity will be largely offset by planned maintenance at our existing PO/TBA assets, but we expect to see more meaningful volume contribution from the new PO/TBA asset in 2024 and beyond as the demand for durable goods return.\nI am incredibly proud of what our team has accomplished to quickly reach these milestones and look forward to their continued success.\nNow let's turn to Slide 13 and discuss the results of the refining segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $105 million. Modest improvements in the benchmark Maya 2-1-1 crack spread were offset by a mark-to-market impact from a distillate hedging program. As part of our ongoing risk management efforts, we will occasionally use derivatives to hedge commercial or financial risks.\nDuring the third quarter, refinery cracks, particularly distillate cracks, were highly favorable relative to historical levels. And we took the opportunity to lock in attractive margins for a portion of our refinery output through 2024. Distillate cracks in September outperformed our expectations, resulting in mark-to-market losses for our distillate hedging program.\nIn the near term, we expect seasonally slower demand for refined products and the Maya 2-1-1 spreads to decrease. Currently, we are executing planned maintenance on our catalytic cracker, with an estimated EBITDA impact of $25 million in the fourth quarter. We expect crude throughputs at the refinery to be approximately 80% of capacity in the fourth quarter.\nWe remain committed to the safe operation of these assets through no later than the end of the first quarter of 2025, with a focus on high reliability, as we develop new projects to transform the site in support of our circular and low-carbon solutions growth strategy.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Torkel.\n\nTorkel Rhenman\n\nExecutive Vice President of Advanced Polymer Solutions\n\nThank you, Kim. Let's review the third quarter results for the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 14.\nThird quarter EBITDA was $18 million. Margins decreased mostly due to the sales mix for the quarter and lower demand. This was partially offset by incremental volumes from our metal acquisition completed in July.\nIn the fourth quarter, we expect demand to be similar to the third quarter across most APS businesses. With service levels to our customers now restored, our team is highly focused on refilling the growth pipeline for our business. And we are making good progress in increasing the number of sustainable solutions for our customers with high-performing recycled technical compounds from our newly acquired metal assets and product developments from across our existing asset footprint.\nOur expectations for the fourth quarter of this year are modest, but we look forward to steady improvement during 2024, as the projects in our growth pipeline begin to mature and make their way to the bottom line as we work towards the goals we discussed at our Capital Markets Day last March.\nWith that, I will turn the call back to Peter.\n\nPeter Z. E. Vanacker\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman of the Executive Board, Neste Oyj\n\nThank you, Torkel. Please turn to Slide 15, and I will discuss the results for the technology segment on behalf of Jim Seward.\nThird quarter EBITDA of $146 million reflected higher licensing revenue and improved catalyst results. In the fourth quarter, we expect that revenue associated with licensing milestones will be unusually low, and catalyst volumes will decrease. As a result, we estimate that full year 2023 technology segment EBITDA will be approximately $30 million lower than full year 2022.\nAs discussed in the beginning of this call, we are targeting a final investment decision for a commercial scale plant using our MoReTec advanced catalytic recycling technology before the end of this year, and hope to share more details in our fourth quarter telephone conference.\nPlease turn to Slide 16, and I will discuss the near-term market outlook by regions and end markets. As you heard from our business leaders, we expect that challenging market conditions will persist through the remainder of the year and into 2024. In addition, we expect additional pressures from typical fourth quarter seasonality associated with holidays and year-end inventory management.\nIn the Americas, pricing is expected to be supported by increased polyethylene exports and stable demand. Integrated polyethylene margins will likely be constrained by higher feedstock costs and new market capacity. We expect that European markets will remain highly challenged. Weak market demand, coupled with rising feedstock and energy costs, are likely to continue to compress margins.\nIn China, markets are slowly improving, and targeted stimulus initiatives seem to be providing some limited benefits. In our end markets, demand for consumer packaging is slow but steady, supported by the consumer and industrial packaging markets. However, our customers continue to keep their inventory levels low.\nBuilding and construction markets are slow, but we're watchful for potential benefits in the United States, enabled by stimulus from the Inflation Reduction Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Chips & Science Act. We expect demand from automotive production will continue to gain momentum. The UAW strike has not yet materially affected our results.\nOxyfuel margins are expected to remain well above historical averages, but declined from third quarter records to a level similar to the first half of 2023. Distillate inventories are expected to remain on the low end of seasonal averages and gasoline inventories have risen with the end of the summer driving season. We will continue to optimize our operating rates to remain in step with market demand.\nNow let me summarize the third quarter, our outlook and our long-term strategy for the company with Slide 17. Exceptional oxyfuels margins enabled record results from our Intermediates & Derivatives segments. O&P margins were pressured by higher feedstock costs and new industry capacity, amid stable but soft demand. Cash generation was outstanding, with $1.7 billion in cash from operations, which enabled us to return approximately $450 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases as part of our balanced capital allocation framework.\nLooking ahead to the fourth quarter, we anticipate seasonally softer demand across our businesses, but we remain confident in our proven ability to navigate challenging markets and deliver results. Our team will continue to remain focused on advancing value creation through the three pillars of our long-term strategy.\nOur third quarter results demonstrate the benefits from growing our core with new capacity from our PO/TBA assets, and we are upgrading our business portfolio by improving our focus on this core. We are reallocating resources away from noncore assets and businesses.\nAt the same time, we are rapidly building a comprehensive business model to support the profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business, where LyondellBasell benefits from participation up and down the value chain. And we are transforming our performance and culture to embrace a comprehensive approach to value creation. Our value enhancement program is unlocking value at an accelerating pace.\nAnd I am confident we will exceed our 2023 recurring annual EBITDA exit run rate target of $200 million. We are laser-focused in our goal to deliver a more profitable and sustainable growth engine for LyondellBasell.\nWith that, we are now pleased to take your questions."

At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. David Kinney, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nDavid Kinney\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Before we begin the discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation that accompany today's call is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations.\nToday, we will be discussing business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are also available on our Investor Relations website.\nComments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results using non-GAAP financial measures, such as EBITDA and earnings per share, excluding identified items. Additional documents on our Investor website provide reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release and our business results discussion.\nA recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1 p.m. Eastern time today until September 4 by calling (877) 660-6853 in the United States and (201) 612-7415 outside the United States. The access code for both numbers is 13739183.\nJoining today's call will be Peter Vanacker, LyondellBasell's Chief Executive Officer; our CFO, Michael McMurray; Ken Lane, our Executive Vice President of Global Olefins & Polyolefins; Kim Foley, our EVP of Intermediates and Derivatives and Refining; and Torkel Rhenman, our EVP for Advanced Polymer Solutions.\nDuring today's call, we will focus on second quarter results, current market dynamics, our near-term outlook and our long-term strategy. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter.\n\nPeter Z. E. Vanacker\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman of the Executive Board, Neste Oyj\n\nThank you, David, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our second quarter 2023 results. Starting with Slide 3.\nDuring today's call, we will discuss the resilient results that our team delivered during the challenging marketing conditions of the second quarter. And we will also provide an overview of our outlook for the second half of this year as well as our plans to optimize our advantaged positions to navigate volatile markets and feedstock costs. But first, let's take a few moments to review LyondellBasell's foundations and the progress we have made with our long-term strategy.\nLet's turn to Slide 4 and begin the discussion with our foundational commitment to leadership and safety performance. Our team continues to deliver outstanding safety results. LyondellBasell's year-to-date incident rate for employees and contractors is 0.15. While slightly higher than our results for 2022, our focus on safety continues to deliver performance that exceeds the top 75th percentile for our industry. Our leading safety results produce benefits that are reflected in our operations and ultimately, in our financial performance.\nSafety is a fundamental part of our core values and it will continue to be a critical enabler for our strategy and our future success.\nLet's turn to Slide 5 and review the progress on our long-term strategy. As we shared during our Capital Markets Day in March, our strategy is built around 3 pillars: grow and upgrade the core, build a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business and step up performance and culture. We are confident we have the right strategy, and we are not allowing current business conditions to slow our progress.\nLet me highlight some of our actions on these pillars over the past few months. Our value enhancement program is providing benefits for 2 of the pillars in our strategy. The VEP is generating volume growth as part of grow and upgrade the core and margin improvement captured within step up performance and culture. I am pleased to see the rapid progress and execution of these VEP initiatives. We are raising our 2023 VEP target for year-end annual recurring EBITDA run rate by $50 million to $200 million based on mid-cycle margins to reflect our accelerated progress. I will provide more details on this progress in a few minutes.\nIn grow and upgrade the core, we are investing in our business that fits with our long-term strategy. Last quarter, we announced a successful start-up of our new PO/TBA facility, the largest propylene oxide plant in the world. This quarter, our team successfully completed technology performance tests to prove out the full capacity of the new facility. We're also managing our portfolio to ensure that all businesses are aligned with our long-term strategy.\nIn May, we announced that we are extending our refining operations to no later than the first quarter of 2025. Let me be clear, we have not changed our decision to exit the refining business. The extension of operations will allow us to develop options to redeploy the site's workforce and assets in support of the company's sustainable growth strategy.\nNow let's turn to the second pillar of our strategy. We're committed to building a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business to drive our leadership in circularity and address the massive demand for these products from our customers and society. We expect this business will generate at least $0.5 billion of incremental EBITDA by 2027 and $1 billion of incremental EBITDA by 2030.\nThrough multiple acquisitions, partnerships and other arrangements, we are building a comprehensive business model with powerful competitive advantages that come from new technologies, [indiscernible] sources of recycled and renewable feedstocks and downstream relationships with our customers and brand owners.\nThe third pillar of our strategy is to step up our performance and culture. Last October, we streamlined our organizational structure to improve our line of sight with clear accountabilities and improved alignment across our commercial and manufacturing functions. We're leveraging the structure of our VEP to drive commercial excellence and improve our customer focus. And Torkel and his team were making solid progress on transforming the performance of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment.\nAltogether, the 3 pillars of LyondellBasell's strategy are working side by side to provide focus and alignment to drive our progress in capturing value and delivering a more profitable and sustainable growth engine for LyondellBasell.\nLet's turn to Slide 6 and take a closer look at our approach to establishing leadership in circular solutions. As [ Devon ] stated at our Capital Markets Day in March, our circular and low-carbon solutions business is taking a differentiated approach by gaining advantage in 3 key areas: technologies, feedstocks and downstream customer relationships. We believe that our comprehensive strategy based on regional health will establish LyondellBasell as the leader in sustainable solutions.\nWe're expanding our participation further up and down the plastic waste value chain to both gain scale and maximize the returns of various waste streams around the world. Today, our team is building supply chains to bring feedstocks into our existing facilities and driving innovation through investments in new technologies. As you saw on the previous slide, we are investing in both internal and external technologies such as LyondellBasell's proprietary MoReTec advanced recycling process as well as Pryme's pyrolysis process and LMF Nord's mechanical recycling.\nIn line with our sustainability goals, we are advancing our carbon reduction initiatives through partnerships. In June, we signed an MOU with Technip and Chevron Phillips to develop an electric cracker demonstration unit in Channelview, Texas. We have completed power purchase agreements to support the development and procurement of renewable power for LyondellBasell's locations around the world. These partnerships utilize the unique strengths of each party to deliver superior results with a common goal, reducing the carbon intensity of our products to increase the value of our products for our customers. And we are leveraging the unique capabilities of our APS segment to upgrade our mechanical recycling portfolio while offering tailored solutions for our customers.\nMost importantly, we are building a business that provides these solutions at scale. Step by step, we are making progress toward our 2030 goal to sell 2 million tons of recycled or renewable-based polymers annually. Since 2019, we have produced and marketed approximately 220,000 tons of these polymers. LyondellBasell's differentiated approach uniquely positions us to unlock significant value as we address the needs of our customers and society.\nOn Slide 7, we ask that you save the date for a webinar on September 26, with Jim Seward, EVP and Chief Innovation Officer; and Yvonne van der Laan, EVP of circular and low-carbon solutions will share more details on our MoReTec technology and our circular and low-carbon solutions business. We hope that you can join us virtually.\nLet's turn to Slide 8 and discuss this year's updated target for our value enhancement program. Our company has a well-earned reputation for strong operational excellence and cost leadership. Our goal is to build on these strengths to capture untapped value across the company through modest investments. Since the launch of our VEP, we have inspired a more agile and entrepreneurial mindset throughout our workforce.\nWhen we launched the value enhancement program last year, we announced targets to deliver recurring annual EBITDA improvements, run rates of $150 million by the end of 2023 and $750 million by the end of 2025. Our team is progressing ahead of plan for 2023. As we expanded the VEP to Europe and smaller U.S. sites during the first and second quarter, we found the enthusiasm and energy gaining momentum. We now think our recurring annual EBITDA improvement will reach a run rate of at least $200 million by the end of 2023.\nLet's get a bit more specific about a few of these VEP initiatives on Slide 9. At our low-density polyethylene manufacturing facilities in Clinton, Iowa, our team faced recurring reliability challenges related to valve controllers. With an investment of approximately $60,000, our team was able to upgrade the controllers and unlock more than $400,000 of annual value. The project was executed during a planned outage with VEP providing the resources required to rapidly resolve this chronic issue.\nModest investment across our global engineering and procurement teams unlocked an opportunity to expand the supplier pool for electric motors at our manufacturing sites. We expect a direct annual cost benefit of $400,000 as well as an improvement in the security of our supply for these critical motors. These benefits will be realized with a total resource investment of only $70,000 over the next 3 years.\nAt our Channelview facility, we invested the engineering resources required to implement a new process control scheme to improve yields and decrease energy consumption and distillation towers. Through better steam control and increased butadiene yields, we will realize $1.4 million in annual value at a onetime cost of $50,000.\nIn addition to the direct financial benefits, this project supports our sustainability goals by reducing CO2 emissions by over 9 kilotons.\nOne of our larger VEP initiatives will install a filtration system to remove solids from a byproduct stream at our olefins plant in Channelview. By upgrading the byproducts, we anticipate over $5.1 million in recurring annual EBITDA improvement from higher margins and increased utilization through a modest $550,000 investment. These examples are representative of the hundreds of initiatives in our VEP portfolio. The average annual benefit of our initiative is less than $1 million. But the program is supported by rigorous economic analysis, diligent tracking and an evergreen process.\nThe value enhancement program has been the catalyst within our organization to rapidly implement good ideas to create value. We look forward to providing you with regular updates on our progress as these initiatives become more prominent in our results.\nLet's turn to Slide 10 and focus on our financial results for the second quarter. During the second quarter, LyondellBasell's businesses delivered resilient results and strong cash generation despite challenging market conditions. Earnings were $2.44 per share. EBITDA was $1.5 billion. At the end of the quarter, our cash on hand was $2.5 billion with $6.6 billion of available liquidity. Now let me turn the call over to Michael first, and then to each of our business leaders who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail.\n\nMichael C. McMurray\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Owens Corning\n\nThank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 11 and let me begin by describing how we are extending our track record of outstanding cash conversion. During the past 4 quarters, LyondellBasell generated $4.8 billion of cash from operating activities. Our cash balance was $2.5 billion at the end of the second quarter. Our team efficiently converted 103% of our EBITDA into cash over the last 12 months.\nLet's continue with Slide 12 and review the details of our cash allocation during the second quarter. The LyondellBasell team remains committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy while providing strong returns for our shareholders. During the second quarter, our portfolio of businesses generated $1.3 billion in cash from operating activities. Our robust cash generation comfortably covered our capital expenditures of approximately $300 million as well as our $500 million of returns to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nDuring the quarter, we increased our quarterly dividend by 5% to $1.25 per share. 2023 will mark our 13th consecutive year of annual dividend growth. In May, we issued our first green bond to support investments that advance our strategy for leadership in sustainability. After the start-up of our new PO/TBA facilities in the first quarter, we successfully demonstrated full operating rates on these assets. Our capital expenditures are now focused on continued investments in maintenance and smaller growth projects.\nWith the rapid progress in the value enhancement program and the extension of operations at our refinery, we expect capital expenditures for 2023 will increase to $1.7 billion, $100 million higher than our original guidance of $1.6 billion.\nDuring the third quarter, we expect operating rates of 85% for our North American olefins and polyolefin assets. 75% for our European olefins and polyolefins and intermediates and derivative assets and just below 95% for our refinery.\nIn the appendix of the slide deck, we provide updated 2023 modeling guidance, CapEx and several other items, including refresh estimates on cost and capital expenditures associated with extending the operations at our refinery business.\nNow I'd like to provide an overview of the results from each of our segments on Slide 13. The LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered $1.5 billion of EBITDA during the second quarter. Our results reflect modest improvements in O&P margins and higher I&D volumes, offset by weaker refining margins. Results in our olefins and polyolefins businesses benefited from lower feedstock costs. Demand for oxyfuels remained strong, while margins in our refining business declined due to lower refining crack spreads. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Ken?\n\nKenneth Todd Lane\n\nInterim CEO & EVP of Global Olefins & Polyolefins, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 14 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment. During the second quarter, O&P Americas EBITDA increased $138 million to $679 million. North American integrated polyethylene margins increased on higher U.S. sales prices and lower ethane costs, while weak demand for durable goods continued to impact polypropylene margins.\nIn the third quarter, we expect volatile feedstock costs and new capacity entering the market will compress margins. Also, demand is being impacted by cautious buying by our customers due to the uncertain economic outlook. As Peter mentioned, we are not allowing current business conditions to slow our progress on strategy.\nOn June 1, we announced an MOU with Technip and Chevron Phillips to develop an electric furnace demonstration unit at our Channelview, Texas site. The technology could enable the company to use renewable electricity as a heat source for ethylene cracking and significantly reduce the greenhouse gas footprint of our olefins production. This collaboration is just one of many initiatives underway to build a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business for LyondellBasell.\nPlease turn to Slide 15 as we review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. In the second quarter, European ethylene margins benefited from lower feedstock costs but this was offset by weak demand for polymers used in durable products. As a result, O&P EAI second quarter EBITDA increased $7 million to $84 million.\nLooking ahead, we expect the European and Asian markets to remain challenging with consumer uncertainty and energy cost volatility. Slow economic recovery, combined with additional supply in China will continue to be a headwind. Finally, we are growing our portfolio of recycled and renewable based polymers from consolidating our ownership in QCP mechanical recycling, investing in Pryme's plastic waste pyrolysis process, and building a flexible packaging recycling facility through LMF Nord, our CLCS team continues to build out our regional hub model to advance our leadership in circular and renewable solutions.\nHaving said that, I want to emphasize the focus our team has on generating value and cash from operations. Our team is highly seasoned and is doing a great job at both. I want to be sure and acknowledge all of their hard work. Now I'll turn the call over to Kim.\n\nKimberly A. Foley\n\nEVP of Intermediates, Derivatives & Refining, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you, Ken. Please turn to Slide 16 as we look at the Intermediates and Derivatives segment. EBITDA for the segment increased $46 million in the second quarter to $472 million. Additional capacity from our new propylene oxide facility was largely offset by planned maintenance downtime. Propylene oxide and derivative margins decreased on continued weak demand for durable goods. Demand for oxyfuels remains strong when margins were slightly lower.\nIn line with the guidance from the beginning of the year, we are conducting planned maintenance during the third quarter on 2 of our existing propylene oxide assets. We expect to run our global I&D assets at approximately 75% of capacity in the third quarter, which includes the idling of 2 PO/SM assets in the U.S. and Europe for approximately 2 months at each asset.\nIn the second half of the year, we expect oxyfuel margins to compress as cost seasonally increase for butane are key raw material. Last quarter, we discussed the successful start-up of our new PO/TBA plant. This quarter, I'm pleased to report that we have completed the technology performance test to prove out the full capacity of our new PO/TBA facilities. I am incredibly proud of what our team has accomplished to quickly reach these milestones.\nNow let's turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results of the Refining segment. The second quarter EBITDA declined by approximately $200 million to $114 million as the benchmark Maya 2-1-1 crack spreads settled by more than $9 a barrel relative to the first quarter. Spreads for other heavy crude oil run at our refinery, such as the Canadian WCS declined further than Maya, providing additional headwinds to our margins.\nIn the near term, we expect demand for refined products to remain stable and inventories to remain low. The recent elevation of crack spreads will likely moderate as outages in the refining industry are resolved. Nonetheless, we expect Maya 2-1-1 spreads to remain above historical averages. In the third quarter, we plan to operate the refinery at approximately 93% of capacity. This rate provides optimal economics for our asset based on our plans for crudes, products and operations ahead of our maintenance work.\nWe remain committed to the safe operation of these assets with a focus on high reliability. In the fourth quarter, we are planning for FCC maintenance with an estimated EBITDA impact of $25 million. We are extending operations at our refinery to no later than the first quarter of 2025. This extension will help to bridge activities at the site as we develop new projects to transform site in support of our circular and low-carbon solution growth strategy. With that, I will turn the call over to Torkel.\n\nTorkel Rhenman\n\nExecutive Vice President of Advanced Polymer Solutions\n\nThank you, Kim. Let's review the second quarter results for the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 18. Second quarter EBITDA moderately increased to $34 million. Margins for the polypropylene company business increased as product prices improved and energy costs decreased. We saw lower demand from the construction and electronics markets, while demand from the automotive markets gained momentum during the quarter.\nWe expect demand in the third quarter to be similar to the second quarter across most APS businesses. Typical third quarter downtime at OEMs will offset some of the automotive production gains we have seen in the first half of 2023 in Europe and North America. Our #1 priority in APS is to restore service levels to our customers and restore growth in the business. I'm happy to report that we have restored our service levels, and we're making good progress in refilling our growth pipeline. APS has a lot of project-based business and our growth pipeline depends on winning a spot on the next automotive platform launch with the next color design.\nOne KPI that we track is the number of color and concentrate request we service. In Europe, the number of requests increased by more than 50% by the end of the second quarter relative to our performance in the second half of 2022. We still have a long path to complete our transformation, but our team is making tangible progress in delivering improved results.\nIn early July, we completed our acquisition of the Mepol Group, a manufacturer of recycled high-performing technical compounds located in Italy and Poland. Mepol's expertise in sustainable compounding fits perfectly into our strategy to be the leader in providing sustainable solutions for our customers. With that, I will turn the call back to Peter.\n\nPeter Z. E. Vanacker\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman of the Executive Board, Neste Oyj\n\nThank you, Torkel. Please turn to Slide 19, and I will discuss the results for the Technology segments on behalf of Jim Seward. Second quarter EBITDA of $79 million reflected higher licensing revenue and lower catalyst volumes. In the third quarter, we expect that licensing revenue and catalyst volumes will moderately improve. As a result, we estimate that the third quarter Technology segment results will be similar to the quarterly results seen in the first 3 quarters of 2022.\nAs discussed in the previous earnings call, we expect that LyondellBasell's proprietary MoReTec advanced catalytic recycling technology will be a key enabler for scaling up our circular and low-carbon solutions business. Engineering work for our first commercial scale plant in Cologne, Germany is underway. We hope to provide you with further updates and announced an investment decision for a commercial scale plant during the fourth quarter of this year.\nPlease turn to Slide 20 and I will discuss the market outlook by regions and end markets. As you heard from our business leaders, we expect that the challenging market conditions of the second quarter will continue for the remainder of the year. And the America's fundamental demand is [ stopped ] and we see cautious buying from our customers and consumers. Margins are expected to be pressured by near-term volatility in feedstock costs and new capacity. The potential for energy cost volatility and associated consumer caution looms over the European markets, despite moderation in feedstock and energy costs relative to 2022.\nIn China, strength in Consumer Services has not been sufficient to offset slow recovery in durable goods, infrastructure and export activity. Markets are not reflecting much benefit from the initial stimulus measures. Demand for consumer packaging is stable, supported by the service industries. However, our customers continue to keep their inventory levels cautiously low.\nBuilding and construction markets are relatively flat with benefits from new housing starts offset by reduced sales and maintenance for existing homes as owners resist trading into higher mortgage rates. We're watchful for tailwinds in the United States from stimulus enabled by the Inflation Reduction Act, to be part of the infrastructure law and the CHIPS and [ Science ] Act.\nDemand from automotive market seems to be gaining momentum. However, there may be some headwinds from the typical downtime at OEMs in the third quarter. Oxyfuels and refining markets continue to see stable demand as refined product inventories remain low.\nAt LyondellBasell, we optimize our well-positioned assets across the world. We will continue to align our operating rates with market demand and steered through all stages of the business cycle.\nNow let me summarize our second quarter outlook and our long-term strategy for our company with Slide 21. Our second quarter results illustrate how our team is capturing value to our new strategy despite challenging markets. Margins for our O&P businesses moderately improved amid tipid demand. Although lower than the first quarter, our oxyfuels and refining margins remained above historical averages, supported by low inventories and steady demand.\nCash generation in the second quarter was outstanding with $1.3 billion in cash from operations and an impressive cash conversion of 103% over the past 4 quarters. We returned $508 million in dividends and share repurchases, demonstrating our commitment to shareholder returns.\nLooking ahead to the third quarter, we anticipate soft demands and additional polyolefins capacity in North America and Asia will lead to further margin compression. We expect LyondellBasell's third quarter EBITDA will be mid-teens to mid-20 percentage points lower than the second quarter. We remain watchful for near-term risks and opportunities across sectors and geographies.\nAt our Capital Markets Day in March, we shared our excitement around our new forward strategy. And during the call today, we provided updates on our progress to capture incremental value across the 3 pillars of the strategy. I want to emphasize that we are not allowing current conditions to slow us down. Our value enhancement program has generated incredible energy and enthusiasm across our workforce, from frontline operators and manufacturing to engineers developing innovative solutions to sales and support teams serving our customers around the world. LyondellBasell VEP is unlocking value at an accelerating pace.\nWe're making steady progress on our goal to deliver a more profitable and sustainable growth engine for LyondellBasell. We're now pleased to take your questions."

We will begin on Slide #3 with our safety performance. Our workforce continues to deliver excellent safety performance for the start of 2023. LyondellBasell's year-to-date incident rate for employees and contractors is 0.16, which continues to be below the rate seen in prior years. Safety will continue to be a fundamental part of our core values as we move forward with the implementation of our exciting new strategy.\nLet's turn to Slide #4 and review the new strategy that we launched last month at our Capital Markets Day. As you can see, much work was already underway. Our strategy is built around 3 pillars. We're convinced that the successful implementation of our new strategy will increase our normalized EBITDA by $3 billion to $10 billion by 2027. This should ultimately result in a more profitable and sustainable growth engine for LyondellBasell. The 3 pillars for growing and upgrading our core, building a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business; and finally, stepping up our performance and culture.\nAnd the grow in upgrading the core, we are focused on the areas of our portfolio where we have leading positions and competitive advantages that are aligned with our long-term goals. We will reinvest to grow and improve upon those advantaged positions by leveraging our leading technologies to generate returns at scale.\nIn the second pillar, we are committed to building a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business that would enable our leadership in circularity and address the massive customer demand for these products and solutions in a profitable way. We expect this business will generate at least $1 million of incremental EBITDA by 2030.\nThe third pillar of our strategy is to step up our performance and culture. Our company has a well-earned reputation for strong operational excellence and cost leadership. Our goal is to build on these strengths to capture untapped value across the company through modest investments. We have established a value enhancement program that is prioritizing and delivering on these initiatives. Our value enhancement program is on track to deliver more than $750 million of recurring annual EBITDA by the end of 2025.\nThese 3 pillars do not stand alone. The pillars of our strategy are interconnected and reinforce each other. For example, we step up our performance and culture to create value. We will reinvest that value in growing and upgrading our core. Returns from a larger and more profitable core will be allocated to build a more sustainable circular and low-carbon solutions business. And the cash generation from all these activities will continue to provide generous shareholder returns. Our strategy serves the needs of our customers, employees, investors and society. We did not wait until our Capital Markets Day in March to start executing this strategy.\nSlide #4 highlights our actions across 3 pillars over the past year. As part of growing and upgrading the core, we announced in April 2022 that we would exit the refining business. We are now evaluating options to transform the facility to serve our long-term objectives, particularly around circular and low-carbon solutions. Last April, we divested our Australian polypropylene business and at our Capital Markets Day, we announced a strategic review for our [indiscernible] oxide and derivatives business.\nWe are improving our focus with investments in businesses that fit with our long-term strategy. An example is the successful start-up of our new PO/TBA facility, the largest propylene oxide plant in the world over the past month. This project was an enormous undertaking across 2 Houston area facilities. During the height of construction, we had a workforce of more than 3,000 people.\nThis is the sixth PO/TBA plant built by LyondellBasell since inventing the technology in the 1960s. Our plant doubles the scale of our prior plans, improves yields, increases product recovery and incorporates hundreds of design improvements that save energy, reduce emissions and lower costs. The net result is that we believe propylene oxide from our PO/TBA technology has a lower carbon footprint relative to the most widely used PO technologies.\nAnd our cost of production is the lowest in the world. The new plant was producing on-spec products at rates of 70% or above within 1 month from start-up. I want to sincerely thank our team for all the hard work and dedication that went into this extremely successful launch of a new production capacity. The PO/TBA plant is just 1 example of how we are growing and upgrading our core businesses.\nThrough our value enhancement program, our team is unlocking additional production volumes across our business portfolio through hundreds of initiatives to increased capacity and improve reliability. In the second half of last year, we established our circular and low-carbon solutions business unit to address the rapidly growing demand for circular and renewable products.\nSince that time, we have staffed up the organization and announced multiple acquisitions, partnerships and other arrangements. Just this week, we announced that Brazil will acquire the other half of our QCP mechanical recycling joint venture in Europe. This is another step forward in our work to achieve our sustainability goals.\nWe are securing recycled and renewable feedstocks and building regional hubs to leverage our technologies and provide powerful advantages for our comprehensive business model. Last December, we increased our greenhouse gas emission reduction goals to establish a leadership position within our industry by aligning with science-based climate guidance. As part of this, we set a goal to procure at least half of our global electricity from renewable sources by 2030.\nIn just 10 months, we've announced agreements that will achieve 70% of our renewable power target with approximately 1,100 megawatts of renewable generation capacity. The agreements will reduce LyondellBasell's greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 1.1 million tons, and that is nearly 15% of our 2020 Scope 2 emissions. We provide an in-depth look at our progress on sustainability with our newly published 2022 sustainability report.\nAnd as you know, that is available on our website. This report highlights how we can create substantial enterprise value through leadership in sustainability, which is core to our strategy of creating solutions for everyday sustainable living. Our work to step up performance and culture is the third pillar of our strategy.\nIn October, we streamlined our organizational structure to improve line of sight with clear accountabilities and improved alignment across our commercial and manufacturing functions. And at our Capital Markets Day, Torkel describes the work that is underway to transform our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. In addition, we are leveraging the structure of our value enhancement program to drive commercial excellence and improve our customer focus.\nAltogether, the 3 pillars of LyondellBasell's strategy are working side by side to form a growth engine that captures value and delivers a more profitable and sustainable portfolio of businesses. Let's now turn to Slide #5 to discuss our financial performance. During the first quarter, LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered solid results, reflecting moderately improving market conditions.\nEarnings were $2.50 per share, more than 90% at best our fourth quarter results. EBITDA was $1.5 billion, and we generated nearly $500 million in cash from operating activities. We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of cash on hand and $5.8 billion of available liquidity. Our company generated 12% return on invested capital over the past 12 months.\nThe strength of our investment-grade balance sheet and our disciplined approach to capital allocation enable us to confidently move forward with our strategy, while continuing to provide attractive returns to shareholders through all stages of the business cycle.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Michael first and then to each of our business leaders, who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail.\n\nMichael C. McMurray\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Owens Corning\n\nThank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 6, and let me begin by describing how we are extending our track record of outstanding cash generation. In the first quarter, LyondellBasell generated nearly $500 million of cash from operating activities that contributed toward our total of $5.1 billion over the last 12 months. Our cash balance was $1.8 billion at the end of the first quarter. Over the last 4 quarters, our team efficiently converted 89% of our EBITDA into cash.\nDuring the first quarter, our cash conversion dipped to 35% driven by increased sales volumes and additional inventory required to serve customers during upcoming maintenance. Nonetheless, we expect to continue converting approximately 80% of EBITDA to cash over the longer term as we have done in the past. We remain committed to delivering returns to our shareholders. Over the last 12 months, we returned $3.5 billion in the form of dividends and share repurchases.\nLet's continue with Slide 7 and review the details of our cash generation and allocation during the first quarter. The LyondellBasell team remains focused on disciplined capital allocation to provide strong returns for our shareholders. During the past 4 quarters, we returned a 107% of free cash flow to our shareholders. This is well above the annual target of 70% that I shared with you at our Capital Markets Day.\nDuring the first quarter, we returned approximately $460 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividends and share repurchases. First quarter capital expenditures were $352 million, approximately $120 million less than the fourth quarter. With a successful start-up of our world-scale PO/TBA plant, capital expenditures related to the construction of the plant will be replaced with growing cash generation.\nOur continued investments in maintenance and smaller growth projects remain within our plan of $1.6 billion for 2023. Now I'd like to provide an overview of the results for each of our segments on Slide 8. LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered $1.5 billion of EBITDA during the first quarter. Our results reflect moderate margin and volume improvements across most segments due to improving global demand and lower energy costs.\nResults in our olefins and polyolefins businesses benefited from higher asset utilization. Demand for fuels remained strong, and our oxyfuels and refining businesses continued to earn margins above historical averages. Please note that our first quarter segment results reflect the movement of our Catalloy and polybutylene businesses from the APS segment to the O&P Americas and O&P EAI segments, effective as of January 1.\nWe filed an 8-K on March 7 that provides summary historical financial information for the 3 prior years. During the quarter, we recognized $69 million in cost related to the exit from a refining business and a noncash goodwill impairment of $252 million related to our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment.\nAs I mentioned last quarter, we expect to incur approximately $75 million of EBITDA impact as well as $55 million of depreciation related to the exit from our refining business during each quarter of 2023. As a follow-up to our 2023 plant maintenance guidance, we decided to pull forward some planned maintenance in our O&P Americas segment to the second quarter. We expect this will result in an additional impact of $90 million for a total estimated EBITDA headwind of $110 million for the segment during the second quarter of 2023.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Ken.\n\nKenneth Todd Lane\n\nInterim CEO & EVP of Global Olefins & Polyolefins, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 9 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment. During the first quarter, O&P Americas EBITDA increased $157 million to $541 million. North American Olefins margins improved on lower feedstock costs, while polyethylene margins increased on higher pricing.\nIn the second quarter, we expect slightly better seasonal demand leading to modest improvements in volume and margins. The recent start-up delays for new industry polyethylene capacity should tighten markets and benefit margins over the coming months. Costs for feedstocks and energy are expected to remain relatively low during the summer season. LyondellBasell will continue to manage operating rates in line with moderately improving demand.\nWe expect to operate our O&P-Americas assets at a rate of approximately 85% in the second quarter. This is inclusive of the additional planned maintenance mentioned by Michael. In February, we announced a new long-term feedstock agreement with Nexus Circular. This will supply LyondellBasell's low-carbon solutions business unit with 24,000 tons per year of recycled feedstock.\nNexus Circulars new facility will convert mixed plastic waste into recycled liquid feedstock for our ethylene crackers, ultimately producing new plastics under the circular revived brand. This agreement is just 1 component of our rapid multifaceted strategy execution. We'll now turn to Slide 10 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment.\nIn the first quarter, we increased operating rates after the restart of our integrated cracker in France. European margins benefited from lower energy costs, but weak demand for durable products persisted. As a result, O&P EAI first quarter EBITDA increased $225 million to $77 million. Looking ahead, we expect slightly better seasonal demand in the second quarter.\nOur operating rates will reflect that improvement, targeting approximately 85% of capacity for the O&P EAI assets. While Europe remains a challenging environment, especially for durable goods, we are focusing on serving customers and optimizing our assets to deliver highest value. As we mentioned at our recent Capital Markets Day, our teams continue to make good progress developing our regional hub model for circular and low-carbon solutions.\nThrough a fit-for-purpose diverse mix of products and technologies, we will scale this up to become a leader in circular and renewable solutions. With that, let's turn to Slide 11 to discuss the hub model in more detail, the first of which will be located in Cologne, Germany. As Yvonne der Laan described at our Capital Markets Day, our business model is built upon an integrated approach to plastic waste. This begins upstream with advanced waste sorting through our joint venture with SourceOne Plastics and partnership with EEW Energy for Waste, both of which focus on recovering plastic waste that would otherwise be incinerated.\nFrom there, we can utilize our mechanical recycling footprint with our QCP and APK investments, which can be sold under the circular recover brand or move further down the value chain into compounding where we can leverage our APS segment and the newly acquired [ Nepal ] Group to create additional value. Alternatively, these waste sorting operations can take hard to recycle plastic waste to create feedstock for advanced recycling.\nNewly developed technologies such as our catalytic MoReTec process, allow for waste to be converted into pyrolysis oil. In addition to our MoReTec technology, which we hope to FID later this year, we are utilizing long-term feedstock agreements with suppliers like Nexus Circular. This pyrolysis oil from advanced recycling is the feedstock for our ethylene crackers. Most importantly, it allows us to produce materials identical to virgin resins under our circular revived brand. This generates meaningful value for our customers that use polyethylene and polypropylene in applications such as health care, where mechanically recycled plastic waste cannot be used.\nLastly, renewable feedstocks are another sustainable option for our ethylene crackers. Through suppliers such as Neste, we are able to process feedstocks from bio-based sources such as waste and residual oils and fats to produce circular renew polymers with a low-carbon footprint. Advanced recycling and renewables are excellent feedstock sources for ethylene crackers. Both are similar to naphtha or heavier liquids, making LyondellBasell well positioned to capture this value with the feedstock flexibility of our existing assets.\nAll of this is already underway, and our hub model will allow us to scale globally and reach at least 2 million tons per year of recycled and renewable based products by 2030. Since 2019, we have sold nearly 200,000 tons of products. We are convinced that LyondellBasell is uniquely positioned to be the supplier of choice for our customers and brand owners who want to partner with us to lower their greenhouse gas footprint and make their products more circular. We see tremendous value across the entire value chain, and we will continue building on our momentum.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Kim.\n\nKimberly A. Foley\n\nEVP of Intermediates, Derivatives & Refining, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you, Ken. Please turn to Slide 12 as we look at the Intermediates and Derivatives segment. EBITDA for the segment increased by $135 million in the first quarter to $426 million. Propylene oxide volumes increased with higher operating rates after planned downtime last quarter while margins decreased on continued weak demand for durable goods. Oxyfuel margins remained strong, supported by low inventories and steady demand for gasoline. Overall, we operated our assets at approximately 85% for the quarter.\nAs highlighted at our Capital Markets Day in March, we have successfully started up our new PO/TBA plant, which is the largest propylene oxide plant in the world. This start-up was many years in the making, and I am incredibly proud of what our team has accomplished. In line with the guidance from last quarter, a heavy planned maintenance schedule across our propylene oxide assets in 2023 will largely offset the benefits from this new volume during the first year of operations.\nIn 2023, we'll be focused on driving safety, quality and reliability as we fine-tune the operation of this new PO/TBA plant and ramp up cash generation in 2024. For the second quarter, we expect to run our global IND assets at approximately 80% of capacity in line with demand.\nOur new PO/TBA capacity is included in the calculation of our I&D segment operating rates beginning with the second quarter. Now let's turn to Slide 13 and discuss the results of the refining segment. First quarter EBITDA of [ $315 ] million was fairly comparable with the prior quarter, which benefited from a $40 million in tailwinds from a LIFO inventory valuation. In the first quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread remained stable at about $49 per barrel.\nIndustry inventories for fuels remain low following winter weather and significant maintenance, coupled with stable demand. We operated the refinery at approximately 85% of capacity with an average crude rate of 226,000 barrels per day. In the near term, we expect the Maya 2-1-1 spreads to moderate due to declining diesel spreads while remaining well above historical averages. We plan to operate the refinery at approximately 95% of capacity in the second quarter.\nWe remain committed to safe operation of these assets with a focus on high reliability to capitalize on current market conditions. As Peter mentioned earlier, we have started the evaluation of several projects to transform the site to fit with our circular and low-carbon solution strategy.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Torkel.\n\nTorkel Rhenman\n\nExecutive Vice President of Advanced Polymer Solutions\n\nThank you, Kim. Now let's review the first quarter results on Slide 14. First quarter EBITDA increased $52 million to $26 million. Margins for the polypropylene compounding business improved as product sales prices captured a higher share of rising raw material prices. All of our business areas saw moderately higher demand. We expect demand will moderately improve across most APS businesses during the second quarter. After spending time in this role, I've met with many customers who have told us how much they value our products and innovations. We're working every day to improve our service levels and meet our customers' needs to transform this business.\nAs we mentioned last quarter, we have reshaped APS by moving the Catalloy and polybutane businesses into the O&P Americas and O&P EAI segments, which will allow us to focus on what is core to APS, serving customers with tailored solutions. To further support the growing and shaping of APS' core, we announced in March that we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Maple Group. Maple's expertise in sustainable compounding fits perfectly into our overall strategy to be a leading provider of sustainable solutions. We are confident that our APS platform has significant potential. While our team will have some autonomy to install a more customer-centric business model, we will also be highly accountable for delivering value from our initiatives.\nWith that, I will return the call back to Peter.\n\nPeter Z. E. Vanacker\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman of the Executive Board, Neste Oyj\n\nThank you, Torkel. Please turn to Slide 15, and I will discuss the results for the Technology segment on behalf of Jim Seward. First quarter EBITDA of $73 million reflected stable catalyst volumes and lower licensing revenue. In the second quarter, we expect that licensing revenue and catalyst volumes will be moderately better.\nNonetheless, we estimate that second quarter Technology segment results will be similar to the first quarter. As Ken discussed, we believe that LyondellBasell's circular and low-carbon solutions business has a strategic advantage with our integrated hub solution. A key enabler to scale our hubs is LyondellBasell's proprietary MoReTec advanced catalytic-recycling technology. Engineering work for our first commercial scale plant is underway. We hope to provide you with further updates and reach an investment decision for a commercial scale plant during the fourth quarter of this year.\nLet me now summarize our first quarter and the outlook for our company with Slide 16. Our first quarter results illustrate how our teams capturing value through our new strategy with help from moderately improving market conditions. LyondellBasell's foundational commitment to safety remains at the core of our culture and will continue to be a critical enabler for our future success. Our O&P businesses benefited from moderately improving demand. Our oxyfuels and refining businesses continue to see margins above historical averages, supported by low inventories and steady demand.\nDuring the first quarter, we returned approximately $460 million in dividends and share repurchases, demonstrating our commitment to shareholder returns. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate modest seasonal demand improvements. North American polyethylene margins should benefit from delays in industry capacity additions. In response, we're aligning our operating rates to match market demand. We remain watchful for market improvements in China as stronger economic activity could help drive recovery in global markets during the second half of the year.\nLyondellBasell is focused on serving rapidly growing demand for our valuable circling products from our circular and low-carbon solutions business. We're entering multiple arrangements to secure plastic waste feedstocks and build out the regional apps that will drive our advantage. And we are making progress on our climate targets. In less than 1 year since signing our first power purchase agreements, we achieved 70% of our target to procure at least half of global electricity from renewable sources by 2030. At our Capital Markets Day last month, I hope you sense our excitement around our new forward strategy. Last week, we gathered 150 of our global leaders to provide feedback and align on implementation.\nThe energy and enthusiasm around our initial progress is incredible from our frontline operators and manufacturing to engineers developing innovative solutions for our customers to 3 pillars of our strategy for providing focus and clarity for our progress to capture incremental value and deliver a more profitable and sustainable growth engine at LyondellBasell. We're now pleased to take your questions."

With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter.\n\nPeter Z. E. Vanacker\n\nCEO & Executive Director, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you, David, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results. Let's begin with our safety results on Slide #3.\nLyondellBasell's employees and contractors delivered an outstanding safety performance during 2022. Injury rates at our company have consistently been among the lowest for our industry. But last year, we reduced the rate of injuries across our global workforce by roughly 0.5 to 0.12 injuries per 200,000 hours worked.\nAt our Bayport complex outside of Houston, our team finished 2022 with over 6 million consecutive safe work hours, a new company record. Simply put, a consistent focus on safe work is embedded in our company's DNA and provides a solid foundation for extending that shared focus across other dimensions of the company's culture.\nLet's now turn to Slide #4 to discuss our financial results. 2022 was a very challenging year characterized by a war in Ukraine, evolving responses to the COVID pandemic, energy volatility, inflation and rapidly changing monetary policies.\nAt LyondellBasell, our portfolio of businesses continued to provide value for our global customers with products and solutions that are essential for modern society. In '22, LyondellBasell delivered earnings of $12.46 per share with EBITDA of $6.5 billion. Cash generation was exceptional and resulted in $6.1 billion of cash from operations; second only to our 2021 results. We ended the year with $6 billion of liquidity supported by a strong investment-grade balance sheet.\nReturn on invested capital was 16%, far exceeding our cost of capital. In addition to our focus on safety, we are sharpening our strategic focus to maximize value for our customers, shareholders and society under a range of scenarios.\nOn Slide #5, we outlined our progress on delivering value from this strategy over the past year. Our leadership in cost management and operational excellence enabled LyondellBasell to hold fixed costs well below inflation, and quickly adjust operating rates in response to evolving market conditions.\nOur diverse global business portfolio provided outstanding cash generation during a challenging year. And at the same time, we positioned the portfolio for changing times with decisions to exit refining and sell our Australian polypropylene business.\nWe established a new business unit, focused on establishing leadership in providing Circular and Low Carbon Solutions for our customers. And we are advancing our supply chains, production capacity and sustainable assets to serve rapidly growing markets for these Circular and Low Carbon products.\nLast quarter, we announced our increased focus on capturing value as we continue to manage costs. We expect our value enhancement program will generate at least $750 million in recurring annual EBITDA by the end of 2025.\nOur increased focus helped drive a 13 percent point improvement in cash conversion in 2022. That further bolstered our capital structure and supported generous shareholder returns. On Slide #6, I would like to highlight our recent decisions to accelerate progress on our climate targets and create more value by doing so.\nIn order to meet the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, climate scientists believe that global warming should be limited to no more than 1.5 degree Celsius above preindustrial levels. In December, we announced our decision to increase LyondellBasell's 2030 targets for reducing Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions to 42% and established a new Scope 3 emission reduction target of 30% relative to 2020 levels.\nOur targets are now aligned with the science-based guidance and the 1.5 degree Celsius scenario. In addition, as we continue to make progress in sourcing, favorably priced renewable electricity, we have increased our 2030 goal to procure at least 75% of our global power generation needs from renewable and low-carbon sources.\nEarlier this week, we announced our first 2 renewable power purchase agreements in Europe and 2 additional agreements in the United States. Altogether, we now have 8 agreements in place for 930 megawatts of renewable power capacity, which represents roughly 1/3 of our global needs.\nThese agreements will prevent nearly 1 million tons of annual greenhouse gas emissions. All of this work supports our goal to become net zero in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2050. At the same time, we continued to build global businesses that will sell at least 2 million tons of recycled and renewable-based polymers by 2030.\nOn Slide #7, let's take a look at how we are building our Circulen brands of recycled and renewable-based polymers. During the fourth quarter, we announced progress in developing 4 new plastic waste sorting and recycling facilities in Houston, Germany, India and China.\nThese facilities provide a strong foundation for a robust global supply chain for plastic waste feedstocks. And with our 3 product platforms, CirculenRecover for mechanical recycling, CirculenRevive for advanced recycling, and CirculenRenew for renewable-based feedstocks, LyondellBasell will be able to match both feedstocks and products with the highest value solutions for our customers.\nThe combination of our focus, detail, technologies and global platforms provides LyondellBasell with powerful advantages to build the world's leading Circular and Low Carbon Solutions business.\nNow with that, I will turn the call over to Michael first, and then to each of our business leaders who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail.\n\nMichael C. McMurray\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8, and let me begin by highlighting our excellent cash generation from our business portfolio during 2022. LyondellBasell generated a total of $6.1 billion of cash from operating activities over the past year.\nOur cash on hand increased to $2.2 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. During 2022, we achieved cash conversion of 96%, 13 percentage points higher than our 2021 cash conversion. In the fourth quarter, cash conversion reached an outstanding rate of 203%.\nThis efficient and robust cash generation allowed the company to return a total of $3.7 billion to LyondellBasell shareholders in 2022. Let's continue with Slide 9 and review the details of our capital allocation over the past year. Our approach remains focused on disciplined capital allocation and strong returns for our shareholders.\nDuring 2022, cash from operating activities fully funded dividends, share repurchases and capital expenditures. We returned approximately 60% of the cash from operating activities to shareholders. This included $3.2 billion in quarterly and special dividends and $420 million in share repurchases. In May, we increased our quarterly dividend by 5%.\nThis represents our 12th consecutive year of annual dividend growth. We continue to invest in maintenance and growth projects with $1.9 billion in capital expenditures. A significant portion of this capital funded the final stages of construction of our world-scale PO/TBA plant.\nStartup activities remain on track for the end of this quarter. Our transformation of is working across our company to rigorously manage and track the progress of our value enhancement program. We look forward to sharing the progress of this program at our Capital Markets Day in March.\nNow I'd like to provide an overview of the quarterly results for each of our segments on Slide 10. LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered $865 million of EBITDA during the fourth quarter. Our results reflected margins stabilizing at the low levels seen towards the end of the third quarter.\nModerating energy and feedstock costs provided modest offsets for compressed margins in our Olefins and Polyolefins businesses. Overall, O&P demand remained low, particularly in Europe and China. Intermediates and Derivatives results sequentially declined on lower volumes due to the quarterly timing of oxyfuel vessel shipments.\nMargins at our oxyfuels and refining businesses remained above historical averages as demand for fuels remained strong due to increasing global mobility. High cost for utilities and raw materials coupled with low seasonal demand negatively impacted our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment.\nAcross the portfolio, a noncash LIFO inventory valuation charge impacts pretax fourth quarter results by approximately $90 million. Fourth quarter LIFO charges were approximately $15 million for O&P Americas segment, $50 million for the O&P EAI segment, $25 million each for the intermediates and derivatives in APS segments, $15 million for the Technology segment and a $40 million benefit for the refining segment.\nAs a reminder, volatility in natural gas prices impacts our cost for not only gas, but also steam and electricity. We estimate that a $1 per million BTU change in the price of natural gas impacts the energy cost of our directly operated assets by approximately $175 million per year across the company with 80% of this impact in North America and 20% in Europe.\nThese estimates do not include the impact of gas price on feedstock cost. Before I turn the call over to Ken and then to each of our business leaders, who will describe our segment results in more detail, let me address some of your annual modeling questions for 2023 on Slide 11.\nAs our new world-scale PO/TBA plant ramps up, we expect to produce and sell about half of the asset's nameplate capacity in 2023. We remain confident that our value enhancement program can achieve recurring annual EBITDA of $150 million by the end of 2023 through the execution of about 1,000 projects.\nIn order to achieve this benefit, we expect to incur a similar amount of onetime capital and operational cost of about $150 million, with the majority of these costs allocated to capital. Major planned maintenance for 2023 include a turnaround at one of our Midwest ethylene crackers in the O&P Americas segment, turnarounds at our acetyls assets and 3 propylene oxide plant turnarounds within our I&D segment.\nBased on expected volumes and margins, we estimate that lost production associated with all of this maintenance downtime will impact 2023 EBITDA by approximately $290 million. While routine maintenance costs are expensed, maintenance costs arising from turnarounds of major production units are capitalized and included in our capital expenditure forecast.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we recognized costs related to the exit from our Refining business, which impacted EBITDA by $73 million. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect the business will incur similar EBITDA impacts during each quarter of 2023. We will also recognize about $55 million each quarter for depreciation charges to reflect cost accrued for asset decommissioning that will be incurred after the asset shuts down.\nWe expect that our capital expenditures will decline by about $300 million to approximately $1.6 billion this year with the completion of the PO/TBA plant and disciplined spend resulting from the current business environment. Approximately $500 million of CapEx is targeted towards profit-generating growth projects with the remaining balance supporting sustaining maintenance.\nWe expect that this year's capital requirements for the value enhancement program will be funded within our $1.6 billion CapEx budget. Other financial metrics worth noting include net interest expense, depreciation and amortization, pension-related estimates and tax rates. We expect 2023 net interest expense will be approximately $405 million. Depreciation and amortization charges for 2023 are expected to be $1.4 billion, which includes the $220 million of additional refinery depreciation charges related to asset decommissioning.\nWe plan to make regular pension contributions in 2023, totaling about $65 million with approximately $105 million of pension expense for the year. We expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 20% and our cash tax rate will be lower than our ETR. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Ken?\n\nKenneth Todd Lane\n\nEVP of Olefins & Polyolefins, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 12 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment. Fourth quarter O&P Americas' EBITDA was $359 million. Prices and margins stabilized at the low levels we saw at the end of the third quarter. Market demand declined, and we also saw customer destocking during the quarter.\nThat, combined with new polymer capacity resulted in well-supplied markets. We operated our assets at approximately 75% of nameplate capacity to match the reduced market demand and manage working capital. During January, we have seen modest improvements in domestic and export demand. Normalization of logistics constraints have facilitated increased export volumes.\nAlso, moderating feedstock and energy costs are providing some margin tailwinds. As a result, we expect to operate our O&P Americas asset at an average of approximately 80% during the first quarter. Looking back at 2022, I want to highlight our progress on developing our Circulen business.\nWe Have established projects for plastic waste sorting facilities that will be used to provide feedstock for our CirculenRecover and CirculenRevive product lines. We are also moving phoned our usage of olefins feedstocks produced from renewable sources such as used cooking oil.\nDuring 2022, we processed 15,000 tons of renewable feedstocks at our Channelview, Texas cracker, to produce ethylene, propylene and ultimately, polyethylene and polypropylene that we sold to customers at premium prices under our CirculenRenew brand.\nLast year, 4 of our U.S. manufacturing sites attained the ISCC PLUS certification for certain grades of polyethylene and polypropylene. This enables LyondellBasell to offer customers mass balance certificates for these products and serve the market's rapidly growing demand.\nWe are delivering these new CirculenRenew products to our customers and proving that polymers can be more sustainable and used in any application where virgin polymer is used. Now please turn to Slide 13 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International segment.\nIn Europe, macroeconomic pressures were exacerbated by high inflation and energy costs that curtailed operations at our customers and pressured consumer demand. LyondellBasell operated our O&P assets at rates of approximately 60% during the fourth quarter. LIFO inventory charges were $50 million during the quarter. All of this combined to result in a fourth quarter EBITDA loss of $152 million.\nEuropean energy costs have considerably moderated in January, and demand is showing some signs of improvement over the extremely low level seen in December. We have completed repairs and restarted our integrated cracker in France at the end of 2022 and expect to operate our European assets at a rate of 80% during the first quarter.\nAs in the Americas, we continue to focus on long-term strategies to support our Circular and Low Carbon Solutions business in Europe and Asia. During October, we announced new partnerships for plastic waste sorting facilities in Germany and China, and a fully automated mechanical recycling facility in India.\nThese partnerships will allow us to swiftly develop fit-for-purpose plants in each region to supply feedstocks for our Circulen products has serve a rapidly growing market for circular solutions. In November, we announced our decision to move forward with engineering to build our first commercial-scale advanced recycling plant in Germany.\nThis plant will utilize LyondellBasell's proprietary MoReTec technology to convert plastic waste from our waste sorting facility into pyrolysis oil that can be used as a feedstock to produce new plastic resins in a circular process. We are moving rapidly to build Circular and Low Carbon solutions for our industry at an unmatched scale. With that, I will turn the call over to Kim.\n\nKimberly A. Foley\n\nEVP of Intermediates, Derivatives & Refining, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you, Ken. Please turn to Slide 14 as we take a look at our intermediates and Derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $291 million. Styrene margins improved due to lower feedstock costs. Oxyfuel margins remained well above historical fourth quarter averages.\nOxyfuel volumes declined as the timing of the vessel sailings resulted in unusually high third quarter volumes. We operated our assets at rates of approximately 75%. Our propylene oxide and styrene joint venture in the Netherlands is expected to restart this month after 3 months of downtime in response to volatile European energy costs and lower demand.\nWe look forward to initial volumes from the new PO/TBA asset in Houston by the end of the quarter. We plan to operate our assets across the I&D segment at approximately 80% in the first quarter. In January, we are encouraged by unseasonably strong oxyfuel margins with low butane feedstock costs and strong oxyfuel blend premiums.\nWe expect relatively stable margins for the segment for the first quarter. We developed multiyear maintenance schedules to ensure that our plants can safely and reliably serve our customers. As it works out, 2023 will be a heavy year for maintenance across several of our PO/TBA assets.\nMaintenance is scheduled for 2 of our 3 PO/TBA plants at our Bayport, Texas facility in the second and fourth quarters. Our Botlek PO/TBA facility in the Netherlands will also undergo maintenance from September through November. We expect the ramp-up in volumes of our new plant will be partially offset by loss production from this planned maintenance.\nNonetheless, the incremental 2023 PO and TBA volumes should be sufficient to capture typical market growth. In 2024, we expect less scheduled maintenance and the full year of production from our new assets will provide additional volumes to serve market growth.\nNow let's turn to Slide 15 and discuss the results of the Refining segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA included a LIFO inventory valuation benefit of approximately $40 million. Results increased on higher margins and slightly higher volumes following the third of the planned maintenances, offset by the disruptions of the December freeze.\nIn the fourth quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread modestly increased to $48 per barrel, remaining well above historical averages. Despite unplanned downtime, we operated the refinery at 85% of capacity with an average crude rate of 229,000 barrels per day.\nIn January, the Maya 2-1-1 spreads have also been unseasonally strong at more than $50 per barrel, driven by strong discounts for heavy crudes. We expect to operate the refinery at approximately 85% of capacity in the first quarter.\nFinally, I would like to recognize our team at the refinery for finishing the year with 0 recordable injuries in 2022. This is the first time such a record has been achieved in the 104-year history of this facility. Our team is dedicated to safely and reliably operating these assets until we exit the business. With that, I will turn it over to Torkel.\n\nTorkel Rhenman\n\nEVP of Advanced Polymer Solutions, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you, Kim. Now let's review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 16. Fourth quarter EBITDA declined to $3 million. Margins remain pressured by feedstock and energy costs as well as the $25 million noncash LIFO inventory valuation charge.\nVolumes fell on lower seasonal demand, exacerbated by high power prices that impacted our European customers' businesses. In the fourth quarter, we embarked on a journey to transform the APS segment. Our goal is to sharpen our focus on customer service and product development to maximize value for our customers and for LyondellBasell.\nWith increased autonomy and accountability, we are developing a more agile operating model with meaningful regional and segment growth strategies. As part of this transformation, the Catalloy and polybutene businesses will be moved from APS and reintegrated into the O&P segment beginning January 1, 2023.\nThis move will allow the APS team to sharpen their focus on the compounding business, distinct from the polymer business of Catalloy and polybutene, which serves our O&P value chain. From a portfolio point of view, we estimate APS will shift approximately $200 million of annual EBITDA between O&P Americas and O&P EAI segments fairly equally.\nWe plan to provide additional information regarding the impact of this change in March. I strongly believe that our APS platform has a lot of potential and I look forward to reporting on our team's progress in delivering on this transformation during our Capital Markets Day in March. With that, I will return the call back to Peter.\n\nPeter Z. E. Vanacker\n\nCEO & Executive Director, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you, Torkel. And to the entire LyondellBasell team, thank you again for all the hard work in delivering strong results during a challenging year. To close out on the segments, let's turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results for our technology business on behalf of Jim Seward.\nDuring the fourth quarter, reduced global polyolefin industry operating rates resulted in lower catalyst volumes. Licensing revenue moderated due to the timing of milestones for revenue recognition. We estimate that the first quarter results for the Technology segment will be similar to fourth quarter 2022 as catalyst volumes improve, offset by moderating licensing revenue.\nOur Technology team is hard at work advancing engineering on LyondellBasell's first commercial advanced recycling plant. This plant will leverage on proprietary MoReTec technology to extract value from post-consumer mixed plastic waste by closing the loop and producing feedstocks for our ethylene crackers.\nOur technology provides distinct advantages by reducing energy consumption and improving yields through innovative process designs and catalysis. Let me now summarize our results and first quarter outlook with Slide 18.\nDespite highly challenging markets, our team is capturing value and moving forward on our strategic priorities. Most importantly, we are sharpening our focus on leveraging the scale of our global portfolio to deliver resilient results. We remain focused on LyondellBasell's core values.\nLast year's outstanding safety performance speaks to the depth with which safety is ingrained in our corporate culture. Our goal is to expand our core foundations to encompass a more comprehensive passion for value creation. This week, we welcomed Trisha Conley to our Executive Committee as Executive Vice President, People and Culture.\nTrisha will play a pivotal role in leading LyondellBasell's vision and strategy to enhance the employee experience, elevate our organizational performance and create the best and most inspiring culture in our industry.\nIn 2022, our businesses were pressured by the effects of the war, volatile energy costs emergence from the pandemic and monetary policy. We responded by matching our production with changing demand, leveraging our global business portfolio and maximizing cash generation.\nOver the past year, our businesses generated over $6 billion of cash from operations and returned $3.7 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. LyondellBasell's focus and commitment to shareholder returns remains strong. With our newly formed Circular and Low Carbon Solutions business, we are laser-focused on meeting the needs of our customers, brand owners and society.\nOur decarbonization goals are now aligned with science-based guidance, and we have made substantial progress towards our 2030 goal to procure 75% of our electricity from renewable and low-carbon sources. The Circular and Low Carbon Solutions business is well positioned to address the challenges of sustainability and plastic waste.\nBy building an end-to-end business with robust supply chains, proprietary technology for transforming materials and our global manufacturing and marketing network, we're confident that we can build a large-scale and valuable leadership position in this exciting and expanding market.\nAnd our focus on sustainability is gaining recognition. In December, we were honored to be awarded the EcoVadis Gold Medal for sustainability performance with a 91st percentile ranking. The EcoVadis platform is valued by procurement professionals for assisting in the identification and evaluation of sustainable supply solutions. We expect modest improvements in the first quarter from moderating energy and feedstock costs, stable demand and the absence of fourth quarter life LIFO charges.\nNormalizing supply chains are enabling improved trade flows from our advantaged feedstock positions in North America and the Middle East. Nonetheless, we will continue to maintain focus and discipline to ensure that operating rates across our global portfolio are matched to market conditions.\nAs the year progresses, we anticipate seasonal demand improvements during the second and third quarter. We're keeping a close eye on China's emergence from COVID and potential benefits from increased economic activity during the second half of 2023.\nThe most exciting challenge during my first 8 months as the CEO of LyondellBasell has been the process of identifying and building a compelling strategy that generates substantial value for our customers, suppliers, employees, communities and shareholders over the next decade. We've shared some initial decisions with you already, but much more is ahead.\nAs you will have recognized, we have not waited until the Capital Markets Day, but started moving ahead with great focus and speed in the right direction. On Slide 19, we ask that you save the date for March 14, when we will share more details on our forward strategy at our Capital Markets Day in New York, and we hope that you can all join us virtually or in person. We are now pleased to take your questions."

At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nDavid Kinney\n\nHead of IR, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you, Melissa. Before we begin the discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations. Today, we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are also available on our Investor Relations website.\nComments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results using non-GAAP financial measures, such as EBITDA and earnings per share, excluding identified items. Additional documentation on our investor website provides reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release, in our business results discussion.\nA recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1:00 p.m. Eastern time today until November 28 by calling (877) 660-6853 in the United States; and (201) 612-7415 outside the United States. The access code for both numbers is 13732141.\nJoining today's call will be Peter Vanacker, LyondellBasell's Chief Executive Officer; our CFO, Michael McMurray; Ken Lane, our Executive Vice President of Global Olefins and Polyolefins; Kim Foley, our EVP of Intermediates and Derivatives and Refining; and Torkel Rhenman, our EVP of Advanced Polymer Solutions. During today's call, we will focus on third quarter results, current market dynamics and our near-term outlook. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter.\n\nPeter Z. E. Vanacker\n\nCEO & Executive Director, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you, Dave, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our third quarter 2022 results. Let's begin with our Safety results on Slide #3.\nOur team continues to deliver outstanding Safety performance in 2022. LyondellBasell's year-to-date incident rate for employees and contractors is 0.12, roughly half the rate seen in recent years. Safety is a core value at our company and will continue to receive the utmost attention.\nThe focus and commitment our metrics reflect will remain a cornerstone of our company's culture and a key enabler of our future success. Let's now turn to Slide #4 to discuss our financial results. During the third quarter, as you would expect, our team remains very focused on cash generation while navigating the well-known, very challenging environment. LyondellBasell's business portfolio faced headwinds from rising costs and weaker demand at the same time. Earnings were $1.96 per share. EBITDA was $1.2 billion. Nonetheless, we delivered an impressive $1.4 billion of cash from operating activities. By the end of the quarter, we increased our balance of cash and short-term investments to $1.5 billion and had $5.3 billion of total available liquidity.\nThe strength of our balance sheet and our disciplined approach to capital allocation enables us to confidently move forward with our strategy while continuing to provide attractive and strong returns to shareholders through all stages of the business cycle.\nDespite significant headwinds our company generated a 19% return on invested capital over the past 12 months. On Slide #5, we highlight some of LyondellBasell's existing and emerging sources of advantage for generating differential value and high returns over a range of market conditions.\nOur company is widely recognized for our deep commitment to safe operations, cost management and operational excellence. These values are part of our DNA. LyondellBasell's global portfolio of businesses benefit from both geographic and end market diversity, leading positions in the diverse markets, balance the portfolio and reduce risks from market concentration.\nLast quarter, I mentioned the work that is underway to identify a North Star that provides clarity and guiding principles for our strategic decisions. Some of the early decisions from this work adds to our capability and resiliency for generating value and high returns. Market leadership in circular and low-carbon solutions has quickly emerged as an essential part of our path forward.\nWe believe circular and low-carbon solutions will provide advantage under a wide range of economic scenarios. We will talk about this more in a few moments. An intense and consistent focus on people and culture is a key enabler for driving differential value. On October 1, we implemented a new organizational structure that will improve agility and accountability across our company. One example is our decision to align strategy and execution by moving the global responsibility for manufacturing under the strategic business unit leaders.\nThe strategic business unit leaders will have the ability to run their businesses based upon the required value propositions and business models. We also launched customer and commercial excellence initiatives to elevate our levels of service, quality and innovation. With the right organizational structure and improved customer focus, our company will have even more capacity to capture differential value.\nAfter a very comprehensive diagnostic phase, a well-structured value enhancement program targeting $750 million in recurring annual EBITDA improvements have been launched. I will describe this program in more detail shortly. When these portfolio advantages are combined with our track record of efficient cash conversion, our investment-grade balance sheet and our secure steadily growing dividend, I think you will agree that LyondellBasell has the winning formula for generating high returns and differential value for our investors under a wide range of economic scenarios.\nOn Slide #6, I would like to share more detail on one of the decisions that quickly emerged from our strategy work, the creation of our new circular and low-carbon solutions business unit. In my view, circular and renewable solutions businesses require a differentiated business model and a more entrepreneurial mindset to succeed. We're setting up our new circular and low-carbon solutions business unit with this in mind.\nThis business unit is led by Yvonne van der Laan and is accountable for building scalable technologies and profitable businesses to serve rapidly growing customer demand for our circular and low-carbon solutions. Since we launched the Circulen brands in 2019, we've sold products with more than 150,000 tons of recycled and renewable content. Our current goal is to sell at least 2 million tons per year of these products by 2030, with our new business unit leading the way.\nFor perspective, 2 million tons represents about 20% of our 2021 global sales of polyethylene and polypropylene. In just the past few weeks, we have announced our participation in several agreements related to new capacity for our circular and low-carbon solutions business in several regions. We are partnering on plastic waste sorting facilities in Houston and Germany. The sorting plants will convert longer plastic waste into usable feedstocks for mechanical and or advanced recycling.\nIn Germany, we expect the facility will provide a material amount of the feedstock required for our first advanced recycling plants using LyondellBasell's proprietary MoReTec technology. In India, we are forming a joint venture for a fully-automated 50,000 tons per year mechanical recycling facility. And in China, we are developing another joint venture to mechanically recycle post-consumer waste in the Guangdong province.\nI am confident that these and future actions will accelerate our circular and low-carbon solutions offering to position LyondellBasell as the preferred supplier for customers and brand owners seeking to lower the greenhouse gas impact of their business and increasing the circular content of their products.\nOur recently announced collaboration with Air Liquide, Chevron and Uniper on a U.S. Gulf Coast low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia project is but one additional example of our progress. We're quickly and methodically building a robust supply chain to support attractive growth opportunities for our circular and low-carbon solutions business.\nLet's turn to Slide #7 and discuss the launch of our value enhancement program. LyondellBasell has a well-earned reputation as a cost leader in our industry. But after 12 years with a singular focus on managing costs, a significant number of untapped value opportunities have accumulated. We believe this untapped value can be unlocked with modest incremental investments in resources. Our value enhancement program utilizes a proven stage gate methodology to identify, implement and track progress on hundreds of initiatives across the company.\nOver 2,000 IDs have been generated, and we have validated more than 1,500 initiatives to date. But we're just getting started. We organized value opportunities into 3 categories: manufacturing and operational excellence, procurement and supply chain and commercial excellence. We have confidence that our value enhancement program is capable of achieving an estimated $750 million of annual recurring EBITDA improvement by the end of 2025.\nAnd with the continuous evergreen process in place, we look forward to regularly extending our goals. We will keep you apprised of our progress and look forward to sharing more details on this program during our upcoming Capital Markets Day in March.\nBefore I turn the call over to Michael, I would like to describe the new organizational responsibilities for the business leaders on this call. Joining us on the call today is Kim Foley, who assumed responsibility for the Intermediates and Derivatives and refining segments from Torkel Rhenman. Kim began her career with our company more than 30 years ago as a chemical engineer and has served in a broad range of leadership roles, spanning manufacturing, strategic planning, finance and supply chain. She is a proven leader with a deep knowledge of our company and valued voice on our Executive Committee.\nTorkel Rhenman is now in charge of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. In order to be a market leader, our APS business requires a customer service focus that is differential for most of LyondellBasell's other businesses. Torkel will develop the appropriate culture and service model to maximize the full value potential of our APS business. Torkel's prior experience as a CEO at other companies will serve us well in this role. Ken Lane will continue to have responsibility for our 2 Olefins and Polyolefins segments. And Jim Guilfoyle, who formally led APS is relocating to Rotterdam and reporting to Ken as the leader for the O&P business in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and India.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Michael first and then to each of our business leaders who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail.\n\nMichael C. McMurray\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8, and let me begin by describing how we are extending our track record of robust cash generation. In the third quarter, LyondellBasell generated $1.4 billion of cash from operating activities that contributed towards a total of $7.6 billion over the last 12 months. Our cash on hand increased to $1.5 billion at the end of the third quarter.\nDuring the past 4 quarters, our team efficiently converted 100% of EBITDA into cash. This efficient and robust cash generation provided for the return of $4 billion to LyondellBasell shareholders over the last 12 months.\nLet's continue with Slide 9 and review the details of our cash generation and allocation during the third quarter. The LyondellBasell team remains focused on disciplined capital allocation to provide strong returns for our shareholders. During the third quarter, we returned $400 million to our shareholders through our quarterly dividend and an additional $160 million through share repurchases. We continue to invest in maintenance and growth projects with $440 million in capital expenditures, a significant portion of this capital funded the final stages of construction for our world-scale PO/TBA plant that remains on track for start-up in the first quarter 2023.\nMy finance and strategy teams are partnering with our strategic business unit leaders to rigorously track the ongoing progress from our value enhancement program. We look forward to regular reporting on our value capture beginning in 2023. Now I'd like to provide an overview of the results for each of our segments on Slide 10.\nLyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered $1.2 billion of EBITDA during the third quarter. Our results reflect margin compression across all segments due to rising costs and weaker global demand. Our Olefins and Polyolefins businesses faced persistently high and volatile energy cost, coupled with lower demand, particularly in Europe and China. While our oxyfuel business and refining segment continue to earn margins above historical averages and demand for fuels remained strong, results were sequentially lower following peak margins in the second quarter of 2022.\nHigher cost for energy, raw materials, labor and transportation negatively impacted our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. Across our European assets, September year-to-date energy costs are $1.8 billion higher than the same period in 2020. During the quarter, we recognized $84 million in cost related to the exit from our refining business. We expect to incur a similar amount for refining exit costs during each of the next 5 quarters.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Ken.\n\nKenneth Todd Lane\n\nEVP of Olefins & Polyolefins, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 11 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment. Third quarter O&P Americas EBITDA decreased to $559 million. In North America, the combination of customer destocking and expectations of additional supply from new assets resulted in lower product prices. During the fourth quarter, we expect lower seasonal demand and further capacity additions will keep markets well supplied. Margin pressures could be offset by moderating feedstocks and energy costs. Also, with lower demand, we expect continued easing of logistical constraints.\nLyondellBasell will continue to reduce operating rates to match lower demand and manage our inventories. We expect to operate our O&P-Americas assets at a rate of approximately 75% in the fourth quarter. While market conditions remain challenging, we continue to proactively advance our long-term strategy. We recently announced a new partnership with Cyclyx and ExxonMobil to build a 150,000-ton plastic waste sorting facility in Houston. Beyond recycling, we announced our participation in an industry consortium to evaluate a low-carbon hydrogen production facility along the U.S. Gulf Coast. We are moving quickly and decisively to increase circularity and reduce our carbon footprint.\nNow please turn to Slide 12 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. European markets were severely pressured by tight gas supplies and higher energy costs that reduced demand from both plastic converters and downstream consumers. LyondellBasell's European volumes declined due to extended downtime at our ethylene cracker in France, and planned maintenance at our cracker in Germany.\nAll of this combined to result in a third quarter EBITDA loss of $83 million. During the fourth quarter, we expect high and volatile energy costs will persist. In addition, slower seasonal demand is likely to add further pressure on European markets. Our O&P Europe businesses have responded to escalating energy prices by reflecting these costs and product pricing with energy surcharges. This year, we introduced variable formulas for these surcharges to account for energy volatility and ensure fairness in our pricing. Also, in response to lower demand and margins, we plan to operate our European assets at approximately 60% of capacity during the fourth quarter. As previously announced, we have postponed the restart of our integrated O&P site in France until early 2023.\nAs in the Americas, we continue to focus on long-term strategies in support of our circular and low-carbon business. In October, we announced new partnerships for plastic waste sorting facilities in Germany and China and a fully-automated mechanical recycling facility in India. These partnerships allow us to swiftly develop fit-for-purpose facilities in each region, while addressing rapidly rising global demand for circular and renewable solutions.\nFinally, I want to express how excited I am about the opportunities with the value enhancement program that Peter mentioned. Across the board, we see ideas being generated to improve value capture in manufacturing, procurement and serving our customers more efficiently.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Kim.\n\nKimberly A. Foley\n\nEVP of Intermediates, Derivatives & Refining, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you, Ken, and thank you, Peter, for your kind remarks at the beginning of the call. Please turn to Slide 13 as we look at the Intermediates and Derivatives segment.\nFollowing a record second quarter, EBITDA for the segment declined to the third quarter of $360 million. Styrene margins deteriorated to a loss as market supply improved following second quarter industry outages.\nOxyfuel margins declined relative to the second quarter, but remained above historical averages. Propylene oxide margins continued to moderate on softer demand for durable goods. In the fourth quarter, lower benzene and ethylene raw material costs are expected to improve styrene margins and bring the styrene business closer to breakeven. As we expect, lower seasonal demand will lead to further margin compression across most of the remaining I&D product lines.\nDespite the improving outlook for styrene, we have decided to idle production at our Dutch propylene oxide and styrene monomer joint venture during the months of November and December due to the high energy costs and weaker European demand. Overall, we expect to run our global I&D assets at approximately [75%] capacity during the fourth quarter.\nWe remain on track to start up our new PO/TBA plant in Houston during the first quarter of 2023. Lastly, as we have completed the validation steps for the I&D portion of the value enhancement program, and we look forward to the implementation plans to be done by year-end.\nNow let's turn to Slide 14 and discuss the results of the Refining segment. The third quarter EBITDA decreased to $190 million on moderating margins following an extraordinarily strong second quarter demand for refined products. In the third quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread declined to about $47 per barrel, but remained well above historical averages. Due to planned maintenance, we operated the refinery at 80% of capacity with an average crude rate of 215,000 barrels per day.\nIn the near term, we expect continued strength in the Maya 2-1-1 spread driven by a tight market and strong demand. We plan to run the refinery above 90% capacity during the fourth quarter. The successful completion of the planned maintenance during the third quarter demonstrates our commitment to safely operate these assets with high reliability until we exit the refining business at the end of 2023. With that, I will turn the call over to Torkel.\n\nTorkel Rhenman\n\nEVP of Advanced Polymer Solutions, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you, Kim. I'm extremely excited to be joining the Advanced Polymer Solutions team. With integration now complete, I look forward to increasing our agility, speed and customer focus to maximize the value of this business.\nNow let's review the third quarter results on Slide 15. Third quarter EBITDA was $66 million. Margins in the Compounding & Solutions business and the Advanced Polymers business were both pressured by higher feedstock and energy costs. Volumes for our catalloy roofing polymers decreased due to unplanned downtime at one of our major customers.\nWe expect similar results from this segment during the fourth quarter with a small volume improvement from increased automotive production. In my initial meetings with our APS customers have witnessed the considerable and growing demand for circular and low-carbon solutions. The APS business provides a natural extension of the value chain for LyondellBasell's sustainable solutions, and our team is actively addressing these opportunities.\nAs Peter mentioned, we believe that our APS platform has a lot of potential. While our team will have some autonomy to instill a more customer-centric business model, we will also be highly accountable for delivering value from our initiatives. With that, I will turn the call back to Peter.\n\nPeter Z. E. Vanacker\n\nCEO & Executive Director, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you again to the entire LyondellBasell team for successfully navigating this challenging quarter. To close out our segments, let's turn to Slide 16 and discuss the results for our technology business on behalf of Jim Seward. Third quarter EBITDA declined by $20 million to $92 million due to lower catalyst demand. In the fourth quarter, we expect our licensing revenue will moderate and catalyst volumes will decrease due to lower demand on a weaker macroeconomic outlook. We estimate that fourth quarter results for the Technology segment will be roughly half of quarterly results seen thus far in 2022. After a slow beginning to 2022, our licensing business signed 6 new agreements during the third quarter to provide Polyolefin process technologies for 5 projects in Asia and 1 in Europe.\nOver the history of our company, LyondellBasell has sold more than 300 Polyolefin licenses around the world, and we continue to be a leader in this space. As indicated by our activity to secure plastic waste feedstock in Germany, we are making good progress on developing our MoReTec advanced recycling technology. And during my recent visit to our technology center in Italy, I was impressed by the rich legacy of innovation at LyondellBasell and the creative work underway to launch this exciting technology.\nWe hope to provide you with further updates and reach an initial investment decision for a commercial scale plant in the fourth quarter. Now let me summarize our third quarter and the outlook for our company with Slide 17. Despite very challenging markets, our team is delivering results. Our goal is to capture value and move forward on strategic priorities under a variety of economic conditions.\nWe remain focused on LyondellBasell's core values. The outstanding safety performance from our team is just 1 indicator of the passion and commitment that I see across our workforce. Our O&P businesses are under pressure from weaker demand, new supply and higher energy costs. With our diverse business portfolio often provides balance. In the third quarter, our oxyfuels and refining businesses provided offsets with margins that remained well above historical averages.\nWith over $550 million in dividends and share repurchases during the third quarter, our commitment to shareholder returns remains strong. LyondellBasell is focused on serving growing customer demand for our Circulen products. We recognize the differential needs of these businesses and are rapidly moving to enter multiple partnerships to secure the plastic waste feedstocks required to advance the leading position of our circular and low-carbon solutions business.\nLooking ahead to the fourth quarter, we anticipate seasonally weaker demand and volatile energy costs will further pressure fourth quarter margins. In response, we are proactively lowering operating rates to match reduced demand. Our business leaders are optimizing working capital and further strengthening our balance sheet flexibility.\nWe'll remain watchful for market improvements in China as stronger economic activity could help drive recovery in global markets during 2023. I hope that you can sense our excitement around the initial progress towards developing a North Star to guide LyondellBasell's strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we launched the new organizational structure and established a circular and low-carbon solutions business unit. We are building the structures and leadership that will enable LyondellBasell to quickly advance and our initial strategies with new business models that address our customers' needs.\nWe're also highly energized around the prospects of unlocking the opportunities identified by our value enhancement program. We have put into place the required infrastructure and management expertise to organize, support and track our progress. We aim to leverage LyondellBasell's core competencies and target value opportunities totaling $750 million in annual recurring EBITDA by the end of 2025. In closing, we look forward to sharing more details over the coming months and at our Capital Markets Day in New York next March that should clarify your understanding of LyondellBasell's forward strategy.\nWe're now pleased to take your questions."

At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nDavid Kinney\n\nHead of IR, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you, operator. Before we begin the discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations.\nToday, we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are also available on our Investor Relations website.\nAdditional documents on our Investor website provide reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release and our business results discussion. A recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1:00 p.m. Eastern time today until August 29 by calling (877) 660-6853 in the United States and (201) 612-7415 outside the United States. The access code for both numbers is 13729909.\nJoining today's call will be Peter Vanacker, LyondellBasell's Chief Executive Officer; our CFO, Michael McMurray; Ken Lane, our Executive Vice President of Global Olefins and Polyolefins; Torkel Rhenman, EVP of Intermediates and Derivatives and Refining; and Jim Guilfoyle, EVP of Advanced Polymer Solutions and Supply Chain. During today's call, we will focus on second quarter results, current market dynamics and our near-term outlook.\nBefore turning the call over to Peter, I would like to call your attention to the noncash lower of cost or market inventory adjustments, or LCM, and impairments that we have discussed on past calls. LCM adjustments are related to our use of last in first out or LIFO accounting and the volatility in prices for our raw materials and finished goods inventories. Impairment charges were recognized to write down assets to their estimated fair value. Impairments include the noncash impairment of $69 million in the second quarter of 2022 that reflects the exit of our polypropylene business in Australia and the noncash impairment of $624 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 and that reflects our evaluation of strategic options for the Houston refinery.\nComments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of impairments and LCM inventory adjustments. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter.\n\nPeter Z. E. Vanacker\n\nCEO & Executive Director, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you, Dave, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our second quarter 2022 results. Let's begin with a short introduction of myself on Slide #3.\nI'm very grateful to be here on my first earnings call since becoming CEO of LyondellBasell on May 23. I grew up in Belgium and undertook an education as a chemical engineer with a specialization in polymer engineering. During my more than 32 years in the chemical industry, I have had the pleasure of working with LyondellBasell as a customer, a supplier and a partner. During my time with Bayer, we invested in Lyondell's technology and assets while forming joint ventures for the production of propylene oxide. At Treofan, LyondellBasell was our largest polypropylene supplier. And at Neste, we partnered with LyondellBasell to achieve the world's first commercial production of polyethylene and polypropylene from Neste's sustainable bio-based feedstocks. Since joining the Board of Directors in February and then starting as CEO in May, I have been meeting extensively with stakeholders around the world to learn more about how LyondellBasell has been so successful in creating value.\nMore importantly, we have been asking ourselves how to best position the company to sustainably capture further value for years to come. I've always admired LyondellBasell's rich legacy of innovation and technology development. And I am pleased to confirm that our commitment and passion for safety and operational excellence or deeply embedded in our culture. These qualities will serve as well as work gets underway to advance our capabilities to capture latent value embedded within the company and establish LyondellBasell as a leader in serving the world's growing needs for circular and sustainable materials, while reducing our carbon footprint.\nAs Dave mentioned, additional members of our executive committee will join our earnings calls starting today. I believe that it is important for our investors to get to know our excellent leaders at LyondellBasell better. And I'm really impressed by this team, their market knowledge and leadership and their passion for safety and value creation.\nLet's now turn to Slide #4 to discuss our excellent results during the second quarter. I am very happy with the outstanding work that LyondellBasell's leadership and employees have accomplished. This is a great way to start and gives me a lot of confidence for the future. Our businesses delivered strong earnings and cash generation during the second quarter and driven by record results from our Intermediates and Derivatives segment and strong refining margins.\nLyondellBasell's broad portfolio provided clear benefits as revenue grew sequentially by 13% while margins expanded to support a more than 20% improvement in EBITDA. Earnings were $5.19 per share and EBITDA was $2.5 billion, which resulted in $1.6 billion of cash from operating activities. Altogether, our company generated an impressive 24% return on invested capital over the last 12 months.\nLet's turn to Slide #5 and review our safety performance. LyondellBasell's commitment to safety leadership is outstanding and well known. As the CEO, I will make sure that safety remains a consistent and unwavering cornerstone of our company's culture. During my career, I have witnessed that companies that are leaders in safety are also best-in-class in reliability and productivity, and as a result, in value creation.\nIn 2022, the year-to-date total recordable incident rate for our global workforce improved by more than 40% to 0.12. This represents substantial progress towards our ultimate goal of zero injuries. I want to commend all of our employees and contractors for their clear commitments to goal zero.\nOn Slide #6, we highlight some of our recent progress towards our sustainability goals. LyondellBasell's products, technologies and solutions provides very important contributions to a more sustainable world. In addition, we have committed to industry-leading sustainability targets that improve this value. Over the past few weeks, we signed 4 renewable power purchase agreements for 380 megawatts of electrical generation capacity in Texas. These wind and solar projects will be able to supply more than 10% of LyondellBasell's global electricity needs and represents meaningful progress towards the company's climate goal to procure a minimum of 50% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2030.\nThese projects are expected to reduce the company's annual carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 370,000 tonnes and represents the average annual electricity needs from about 100,000 U.S. homes.\nIn addition to our renewable energy goals, LyondellBasell is growing our production of plastics utilizing renewable feedstocks under our CirculenRenew brands. Last year, we processed 12,000 tons of renewable feedstock in Europe, and we are forecasting to increase this number to 40,000 tonnes across both Europe and the United States during 2022. This material is being run through our existing ethylene cracker assets in Wesseling, Germany and Channelview, Texas with the goal to increase scale over the coming years since we see that the demand for these products is growing.\nThe growth of renewable feedstocks is one part of our broader mission to expand the reach of our sustainable products, including those sold under the Circulen brands. Since launching our Circulen brands in 2019, we have sold over 140,000 tonnes of products based on recycled and renewable feedstock. This represents more than the amount of polyethylene and polypropylene consumed by the population of Houston in 1 year. LyondellBasell is doing more than simply talking about the circular economy. We are building real businesses that can help provide a more sustainable future for our customers and society.\nPlease turn to Slide #7 to review our quarterly profitability. During the second quarter, our business portfolio delivered $2.5 billion of EBITDA, an improvement of $430 million compared to the prior quarter. LyondellBasell results reflect how our global business portfolio can serve changing consumer needs. As in-person activities resume and global travel recovers, our oxyfuels and refining businesses are benefiting from increased demand. Strong North American demand and favorable naphtha costs supported margins for our products in the Americas and Europe, respectively, while higher ethane and energy costs as well as inflation created headwinds in these regions.\nWe started to see moderating European demand due to high inflation at the end of the second quarter and continue to pass through elevated energy and feedstock costs in the prices of our products where possible. During the quarter, China's zero COVID measures and logistics constraints continued to impact both regional and global markets. We expect progress in China will continue to be challenging over the next few months, but anticipate that demand will recover towards the end of 2022.\nLet us turn to Slide #8 and review LyondellBasell's earnings power over the course of the first complete business cycle for our company. From 2011 to 2019, our portfolio of businesses delivered an average of $6.7 billion of EBITDA. Favorable markets and our growing asset base delivered $9.2 billion of EBITDA over the last 12 months, an increase of nearly 40% over the prior cycle average. With the commissioning of our new propylene oxide capacity underway, we expect that LyondellBasell's stepped up earnings performance will provide resilience through the next business cycle. And with that, I will turn the call over to Michael first, then to each of our business leaders who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail.\n\nMichael C. McMurray\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 9, and let me begin with describing how the step-up in our earnings is leading to increased cash generation from our business. In the second quarter, LyondellBasell generated $1.6 billion of cash from operating activities that contributed towards $8.3 billion in cash from operations over the last 12 months.\nDuring the past 4 quarters, our team efficiently converted over 90% of our EBITDA into cash. After accounting for sustaining capital reinvested in the business, we achieved a free operating cash flow yield of 26% relative to our market capitalization over the last 12 months. Let's continue with Slide 10 and review the details of our cash generation and allocation during the second quarter. The LyondellBasell team remains focused on extending our disciplined track record of capital allocation to provide for reinvestment in the company and generous returns for our shareholders.\nAfter generating $1.6 billion in cash from operations during the second quarter, we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders through a $5.20 per share special dividend, a 5% increase to our quarterly dividend that paid another $1.19 per share, all while repurchasing 45 million of our shares during the quarter.\nWe continue to invest in maintenance and growth projects with approximately $530 million in capital expenditures with a large portion funding our nearly completed world-scale PO/TBA plant. Now I'd like to provide an overview of the results for each of our segments on Slide 11.\nDuring the second quarter, LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered nearly $2.5 billion of EBITDA. Our results reflect record profitability in our Intermediates and Derivatives segment, driven by strong oxyfuels margins while our refining margins benefited from increased demand for transportation fuels. Conversely, margins in our O&P businesses encountered headwinds from rising costs for ethane feedstocks and moderating European demand.\nOne modeling item of note. Our original full year pension expense guidance of approximately $55 million did not include a second quarter $94 million noncash pension settlement charge that impacted earnings by $0.22 per share. As a result, our 2022 pension expense is expected to increase to approximately $180 million.\nDuring the third quarter, we anticipate that we will begin recording costs related to our planned exit from our refining business at the end of 2023. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken.\n\nKenneth Todd Lane\n\nEVP of Global Olefins & Polyolefins, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you, Michael. Let's begin the individual segment discussions on Slide 12 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment. Second quarter EBITDA was relatively flat at $905 million. North American demand for polyolefins continue to be very strong. Higher costs for ethane and energy pressured olefin margins and offset the benefits of improved polymer prices. During the third quarter, we expect continued strength in demand for polymers utilized in flexible packaging. But elevated costs for feedstocks and energy as well as continuing export supply chain constraints and market headwinds are likely to pressure margins.\nNow please turn to Slide 13 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. Higher ethylene prices and relatively flat feedstock costs resulted in slightly higher second quarter EBITDA of $228 million. LyondellBasell's volumes declined due to downtime at our French cracker and moderating European demand for polymers in June. The extended maintenance in France resulted in an impact of $65 million to the segment during the second quarter.\nDuring the third quarter, we expect seasonally slower summer demand and continued higher energy costs associated with tight gas supply, which will pressure European markets. Also, with China demand remaining sluggish due to zero COVID measures, the European market is also facing pricing pressure from dislocated Middle Eastern and Asian imports. Toward the end of this year, potential benefits from China's reopening could provide tailwinds for our businesses. With that, I'll turn the call over to Torkel.\n\nTorkel Rhenman\n\nEVP of Global Intermediates, Derivatives & Refining, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you, Ken. Please turn to Slide 14 as we take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Exceptional oxyfuel margins resulted in record second quarter segment EBITDA of $675 million. During the quarter, styrene results benefited from tight market supply. We are beginning to see that softer demand for durable goods is leading to moderation in propylene oxide margins.\nIn the third quarter, we expect margin compression across most product lines. Oxyfuel margins are also moderating but expected to remain elevated at levels well above historical averages. The steady success of our Intermediates and Derivatives segments is rooted in the Advantage Technologies, underpinning our propylene oxide business.\nOn Slide 15, let me highlight the cost advantages of LyondellBasell's propylene oxide production. The chart on the right depicts the global cost curve for producing propylene oxide by asset. The lower an asset is positioned on the curve, the greater the cost advantage. As you can see, LyondellBasell's assets that produce propylene oxide with a tertiary butyl alcohol co-product are on the lowest or most favorable part of the cost curve. PO/TBA assets represent roughly 15% of global capacity and derive their advantage from favorable costs for butane raw materials and strong pricing for the clean burning high-octane oxyfuel products produced from tertiary butyl alcohol. LyondellBasell's plants that produce propylene oxide with the styrene monomer co-products are the next lowest cost technology and represent 35% share of global capacity.\nMuch of the industry produces propylene oxide using older, higher-cost technologies such as the chlorohydrin process. With the recent escalation in chlorine prices, the cost curve for chlorohydrin-based propylene oxide has only steepened, creating hardships for producers using this technology. LyondellBasell's advantage PO/TBA technology provides an excellent platform to address increasing global demand for propylene oxide and oxyfuels. Propylene oxide is used in the production of polyurethanes, first-time materials that saves energy by producing insulation and reducing weight in a wide range of applications.\nOxyfuels are clean-burning, high-oxygen gasoline blending components that increase fuel efficiencies and improves air quality by reducing harmful emissions.\nLet's continue with Slide 16 with an update on our PO/TBA project that we are completing here in Houston. This is the largest greenfield investment in LyondellBasell's history and will deliver much needed capacity to serve growing demand for these products that provide sustainable solutions for our planet.\nWe are thrilled to have nearly completed construction and we have already begun commissioning the oxyfuel assets, depicted in the photo on the right. The PO/TBA plant commissioning will begin during the fourth quarter, and we expect the integrated facility to start up in first quarter of 2023.\nOur ramp-up during 2023 will not provide for full year of production but continued market strength is likely to support stronger margins than the mid-cycle economics depicted on this line. With LyondellBasell's sells advantaged technology and affordable shale advantage butane feedstocks are new capacity starting up with the support of favorable markets.\nNow let's turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results for our Refining segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $418 million, with improved margins driven by increased demand for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. In the second quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread expanded significantly to about $56 per barrel. We operated the refinery at 94% of capacity with an average crude throughput of 252,000 barrels per day. In the near term, the Maya 2-1-1 spread is moderating from second quarter levels. We plan to run the refinery about 87% of capacity during the third quarter to perform a limited scope of planned maintenance. With that, I will turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJames D. Guilfoyle\n\nEVP of Advanced Polymer Solutions & Global Supply Chain, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you, Torkel.\nNow let's review the results from our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 18. Our Compounding and solutions business continued to be pressured by the slow recovery in automotive markets. In the first half of 2022, automotive production was 3% below the same period last year. Supply chain disruptions and raw material shortages continue to impact the recovery and therefore, our compounding and solutions business. Industrial construction markets have demonstrated strength as catalloy demand and margins supported higher advanced polymer results and a second quarter EBITDA for the segment of $118 million.\nWe expect similar results for the segment in the third quarter as the gradual recovery in automotive production improves volumes while rising costs impact margins. A more significant step-up in earnings will be dependent upon stronger automotive production and the resolution of raw material constraints. And with that, I will return the call back to Peter.\n\nPeter Z. E. Vanacker\n\nCEO & Executive Director, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you again, team, for this impressive quarter. The closeouts on our segments, let's turn to Slide #19, and discuss the results for our technology business on behalf of Jim Seward, our Senior Vice President for R&D, Technology and Sustainability. I have always been highly impressed by the strength of LyondellBasell's international innovation and technology capabilities, the broad technology portfolio and our leading market position. Very clearly, innovation is a core part of LyondellBasell's DNA.\nSecond quarter EBITDA was $112 million, supported by strong licensing revenue and record year-to-date catalyst demand. While new licensing activities slowed we have noted a recent shift in our licensing demand away from commodity polymers. 4 of our 5 new licenses this year were sold in Asia to produce low-density polyethylene vinyl acetate copolymers used in solar panel laminations and encapsulants that support the world's rising demand for renewable energy.\nIn the third quarter, we expect our licensing revenue and catalyst volumes to moderate. This segment is likely to produce results similar to that seen in the first or second quarter of 2021. Now let me summarize the second quarter and the outlook for our company with Slide #20.\nLyondellBasell's second quarter results benefited from a balanced portfolio that captured considerable value with very efficient cash conversion. Margin expansion in our oxyfuels and refining businesses and solid demand for our products more than offset higher feedstock and energy costs. Our management team and Board understands and respects the power of this portfolio. We are unwavering and our disciplined approach to capital allocation and demonstrated our commitment to shareholder returns during the second quarter.\nLyondellBasell is making measurable progress towards our ambitious interim and long-term goals for the reduction of our greenhouse gas emissions while developing sustainable businesses based on recycled and renewable materials. Our aim is to build upon our initial work, scale or reach and establish LyondellBasell as a leader in serving the world's growing needs for circular and sustainable materials while reducing our carbon footprint.\nI began my journey as CEO with a commitment to leverage LyondellBasell's strengths and capture value from both near-term and long-term opportunities. Over the past several months, we have undertaken an in-depth examination of our company to identify a north star that will provide clarity and guiding principles for our strategic decisions. including our progress on circularity and sustainability.\nWe are consulting with all stakeholders to ensure we have aligned on a durable and resilient strategy that will serve LyondellBasell well across a range of scenarios for many years. Last week, we had a very productive interim review with our board on this topic. We're planning further alignment during our Board meetings in the second half of the year with our work aimed towards communicating or our north star externally during an Investor Day in early 2023.\nIn addition, the second work stream is underway to identify, prioritize and execute on value opportunities that exist in LyondellBasell's current business structure. Thus far, our work has identified a considerable number of opportunities such as creep capacity, debottlenecks, automation and energy saving opportunities that can be delivered through modest investments by leveraging LyondellBasell's existing strengths.\nWe believe the value of these projects is considerable and actionable. I am committed to communicating our initial assessment of this value opportunity and our time line for realization during our third quarter earnings call. We look forward to sharing our vision for LyondellBasell and the additional value we plan to unlock from our company. We are now pleased to take your questions. Thank you."

We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our first quarter 2022 results. Today's teleconference marks my second earnings call as the interim CEO of LyondellBasell. And I would like to thank our Board of Directors for the opportunity to lead the company over the past few months. Our incoming CEO, Peter Vanacker, joined our Board on February 25, and we're looking forward to him assuming his role as Chief Executive Officer on May 23. Peter and I have been talking over the past several months to ensure a smooth transition and a successful start to his leadership of our company. I know that Peter is very eager to engage with our employees, customers, investors and suppliers to help us build upon the momentum we have underway in LyondellBasell.\nBefore we get into the results, I would like to take a moment to address the tragic and unprovoked attacks unfolding in Ukraine. My heart breaks seeing so many people devastated and the resulting humanitarian crisis. At LyondellBasell, we are working to address the impacts of this crisis through our global corporate citizenship program, Advancing Good. The company and our employees have collectively donated more than $600,000 to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Medical Corps.\nLyondellBasell's presence in Russia and Ukraine is fairly limited. Less than 0.3% of our 2021 revenue came from Russia and a negligible amount from Ukraine. In March, we announced that LyondellBasell will not enter into any new business transactions or relationships with Russian state-owned entities. We also intend to discontinue business relationships with those companies to the extent legally possible. Of course, we are also complying with all U.S. and international sanctions.\nWhile we have no manufacturing sites in Russia or Ukraine, we do have about 30 employees working in offices in Russia. Last week, we made the difficult decision to cease operations at our Moscow and Togliatti offices. We have a local team in place to support our employees during this transition period. At LyondellBasell, we believe in the power of many, and we hope many of you find ways to support the Ukrainian people and influence peace and stability across Europe.\nNow let's review our first quarter results, starting with Slide 3. LyondellBasell's businesses are continuing to benefit from solid global demand and improving markets for products from our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. During the first quarter, LyondellBasell generated $4 per share of earnings, $2 billion of EBITDA and $1.5 billion of cash from operating activities. The start of the year is typically a seasonally slow period for the petrochemical industry. 2022 marks the first time since 2015 where LyondellBasell earned $2 billion of EBITDA during the first quarter, and our income of $4 per share establishes a new first quarter earnings per share record for the company. Despite a turbulent backdrop of geopolitical uncertainties, ongoing supply chain challenges, and volatile prices for energy and feedstocks, LyondellBasell is off to a great start in 2022.\nLet's turn to Slide 4 and review our safety performance. LyondellBasell's commitment to safety, leadership remains a consistent and unwavering component of our company's culture. In 2022, our year-to-date total recordable incident rate for employees and contractors has improved by more than 40% to 0.12. This year, we are emphasizing the importance of instilling safety-related touch points during interactions that occur naturally throughout the workday at our facilities. Whether it's planned or spontaneous, these daily touch points provide powerful opportunities to convey authentic and impactful leadership related to safety performance. This personalized approach to safety improvement is yielding results.\nDuring March, we had only 1 recordable injury across our global workforce of more than 19,000 employees. This represents substantial progress toward our ultimate goal of 0 injuries, and I want to thank all of our employees for their commitment to our GoalZERO journey.\nOn Slide 5, we highlight the recent publication of the fifth edition of our annual sustainability report. This year's report updates our progress to our goals that help in addressing climate change, ending plastic waste and supporting a thriving society.\nThe cover graphic from the report highlights our focus on 2030 interim targets that track our progress toward longer-term goals. Last September, we accelerated these targets and set a goal to achieve net zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions from our global operations by 2050. Our interim 2030 target is to reduce absolute emissions from our global operations by 30% relative to a 2020 baseline. In the area of circular plastics, our 2030 goal is to produce a meaningful share of our polymer production, 2 million tons per year from recycled and renewable-based feedstocks.\nAnd this year, we announced new targets supporting our diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Our goals are to achieve gender parity across our global senior leadership and increase the number of underrepresented groups in our U.S. senior leadership to reflect the general population within 10 years.\nPlease turn to Slide 6, where we highlight some of our recent collaborations to develop more sustainable products. First, we've collaborated with Nippon Paint to produce packaging for the Chinese market using LyondellBasell's mechanically recycled CirculenRecover polypropylene. The paint containers reuse post-consumer plastic waste and reduce reliance on fossil-based feedstocks.\nNext, we show an example of the polyethylene tubes that we developed with our customer, Albea for L'OCCITANE shower scrub. The caps and tubes are designed to be fully recyclable and made with LyondellBasell's CirculenRevive polymers that are produced from an advanced molecular recycling process using plastic waste. The redesigned tubes retain the iconic brand's look and feel while providing a new life for plastic waste and reducing consumption of fossil-based feedstocks.\nFinally, we collaborated with several customers to develop clear polypropylene drink cups for McDonald's from our CirculenRenew polymers using renewable feedstocks produced by Neste from bio-based sources such as McDonald's used cooking oil. We also have a similar collaboration underway with CirculenRevive to make cups for Wendy's restaurants. Wendy's estimates that their cups will divert 10 million pounds of plastic waste from landfills over the first 2 years.\nLyondellBasell's collaborations on sustainability extend both up and down the supply chain. In Houston, we helped form the Houston Recycling Collaboration to increase recycling rates and improve the availability of feedstock from plastic waste. And through our investment with Closed Loop Partners, we have invested in material recovery facilities that support post-consumer plastic waste recycling in New York, New Jersey and Florida.\nAlso, we are making good progress in decarbonizing our electrical power consumption by eliminating coal at our Wesseling, Germany facility and establishing renewable power purchase agreements with partners. In addition, we are collaborating with several peers on the development of large-scale carbon capture and storage facilities for the Houston region that would help decarbonize our industry.\nNotably, we want to acknowledge our decision to exit the refining business by the end of 2023. This was a difficult decision, but we determined that an exit is likely to provide the best outcome for the company. We will talk more about this decision later in this call. Nonetheless, on the sustainability front, the shutdown of the refinery is expected to reduce LyondellBasell's Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 15%.\nOur strategy is to both leverage LyondellBasell's proprietary technology and collaborate with capable partners to advance our progress on circular plastics and decarbonization initiatives.\nPlease turn to Slide 7 to review our quarterly profitability. During the first quarter, our business portfolio delivered over $2 billion of EBITDA, similar to fourth quarter results. Despite volatile prices for energy and feedstocks, solid product demand supported margins for our products across most markets in Europe and the Americas. Supply disruptions triggered by the war in Ukraine and the COVID pandemic created headwinds during the quarter.\nWhile we remain watchful for signs of demand destruction from inflation, we have been largely successful in passing through higher energy and feedstock costs in the prices of our products. We expect the strict 0 COVID policies in China will continue to hinder growth and profitability in Asia during the second quarter.\nAt LyondellBasell, our oxyfuels and refining businesses are benefiting from increased demand for transportation fuels as in-person activities resume and global travel recovers. We expect that favorable markets for transportation fuels will continue through next year.\nSlide 8 depicts LyondellBasell's historical profitability. Over the course of the first complete business cycle for our company, we delivered an average of $6.7 billion of EBITDA. In today's strong market and with LyondellBasell's larger asset base, we delivered $9.7 billion of EBITDA over the last 12 months, nearly 45% above the prior cycle average.\nLyondellBasell's earnings performance is clearly stepping up from prior business cycles. We are well positioned with a diversified portfolio and larger asset base with propylene oxide and oxyfuels growth underway to extend this performance into the next cycle.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Michael, who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail.\n\nMichael C. McMurray\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 9, and let me begin by extending the stepping-up theme to the substantial cash generation from our businesses.\nIn the first quarter, LyondellBasell generated $1.5 billion of cash from operating activities that contributed toward a new record of $8.6 billion in cash from operations over the last 12 months. During the past 4 quarters, our team efficiently converted 88% of our EBITDA into cash. After accounting for sustaining capital reinvested in the business, we achieved a free operating cash flow yield of 23% relative to our market capitalization over the last 12 months.\nThe LyondellBasell team is highly focused on extending our proven track record of efficient cash generation to provide prudent reinvestment in our company and generous returns for our shareholders.\nLet's continue with Slide 10 and review the details of our cash generation and allocation during the first quarter. With $1.5 billion of cash from operating activities, we funded our dividends and capital investments for the first quarter while continuing to repurchase shares and building some cash on the balance sheet. During the first quarter, we returned nearly $600 million to shareholders through our dividend and the repurchase of approximately 2.1 million shares. We continue to invest in maintenance and growth projects with more than $400 million in capital expenditures. This includes our new world-scale PO/TBA plant starting up later this year.\nWe ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of cash and short-term investments and $5.9 billion of cash and available liquidity. With our total debt at 1.2x trailing EBITDA, our leverage ratios are below our targeted range of 1.5 to 2.5, and we see no need for further deleveraging at this time.\nNow I'd like to provide an overview of the results for each of our segments on Slide 11. As Ken mentioned, LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered over $2 billion of EBITDA during the first quarter. Our results reflect solid demand for our products and improving market conditions, benefiting our I&D and APS segments, offset by higher feedstock costs that compressed margins in our O&P-Americas segment.\nLet's begin the individual segment discussions on Slide 12 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins – Americas segment. First quarter 2022 EBITDA was $911 million, $351 million lower than the fourth quarter 2021. Olefin results decreased approximately $170 million compared to the fourth quarter with lower margins due to higher feedstock costs and lower pricing for propylene and butadiene coproducts. We completed planned cracker maintenance at our La Porte, Texas site that contributed to lower volumes and resulted in our North America crackers operating at a rate of 82% during the quarter. Polyolefins results decreased approximately $185 million during the first quarter due to compressed margins driven by lower product prices and higher monomer costs. Stable demand led to relatively comparable volumes despite ongoing logistics and raw material challenges.\nIn March, we achieved an increase in polyethylene contract prices to reverse fourth quarter trends of declining prices. We continue to see strong demand for our polymers as we head into the second quarter. We expect margin recovery as product prices rise reflect higher energy and feedstock costs and stronger summer demand tightens markets.\nNow please turn to Slide 13 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins – Europe, Asia and International segment. Higher product prices and volumes offset rising cost in EAI markets, resulting in first quarter EBITDA of $188 million, $33 million higher than the fourth quarter. Prior quarter results were impacted by LIFO inventory valuation charges of approximately $30 million. Olefins results increased about $25 million as margins improved driven by increased monomer prices that offset higher feedstock and energy cost. We operated our European crackers at a rate of 74% of capacity due to planned maintenance and feedstock supply disruptions resulting from the war in Ukraine. Combined polyolefin results increased approximately $35 million compared to the prior quarter. Stable demand drove increased polyolefin price spreads and volumes despite higher energy and monomer cost.\nHistorically low Asian polyolefin spreads and weaker volumes, driven by COVID-related lockdowns in China, caused our joint venture equity income to decline by about $50 million. During the second quarter, we expect that volumes and integrated margins for the segment will be comparable to the first quarter as steady demand should support price increases and keep pace with increasing costs.\nOn April 13, we reached an agreement to sell our Australian polypropylene business to Viva Energy. We expect a second quarter noncash asset impairment charge of approximately $70 million in the O&P-EAI segment related to the sale of this business.\nLast quarter, we provided guidance related to planned maintenance at our cracker in Berre, France. Due to additional work, we now think this turnaround will impact second quarter EBITDA by about $50 million. As high inflation begins to trigger concerns about the potential for recession, it is instructive to review the resilience of polyethylene demand growth over the past 30 years.\nIn Slide 14, the chart depicts the strength of polyethylene demand relative to other markets through the last 4 U.S. recessions. As indicated by the turquoise line, PE demand is remarkably resilient and compounds at a fairly consistent rate of about 4%, meaningfully higher than typical GDP. Unlike U.S. housing and vehicle markets, PE demand is relatively inelastic and embedded in essential products for our modern lives. Polyethylene is a foundational building block for consumer staples with wide-ranging applications such as food packaging, daily hygiene supplies and health care products. And with a cost advantage from shale feedstocks, U.S. polyethylene production increasingly serves a global market. We expect these resilient growth trends will continue as more people in emerging markets gain purchasing power and increased consumption of these essential products for modern life.\nPlease turn to Slide 15 as we take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Robust margin expansion in most businesses resulted in record first quarter EBITDA of $546 million, $294 million above the prior quarter. Prior quarter results were impacted by LIFO inventory valuation charges of approximately $95 million. First quarter propylene oxide and derivative results increased $50 million as butanediol and other derivative margins expanded. Durable goods demand remained solid, resulting in comparable volumes for the quarter.\nIntermediate chemicals results increased more than $30 million. Margins increased in most businesses, primarily styrene and acetyls driven by tight market supply. Volumes increased as a result of improved first quarter operations. Oxyfuels and related products results increased more than $125 million as margins improved on higher gasoline prices and moderation in the ratio of butane feedstock prices relative to crude oil. Prior to the pandemic, our oxyfuels business was a fairly reliable contributor to the profitability of our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. With gasoline demand approaching pre-pandemic levels, we expect a return to typical performance for the oxyfuels business in 2022.\nIn the second quarter, we expect volumes to increase with seasonal strength in demand for durable goods from building and construction markets. Margins for oxyfuels and related products are expected to expand with typical seasonal reductions in butane feedstock costs and increased gasoline demand associated with summer travel. Planned maintenance at our butanediol facility in 1 of our 2 propylene oxide units located at our Channelview, Texas site is expected to impact second quarter EBITDA for Intermediates and Derivatives segment by approximately $80 million.\nOver the past 2 weeks, we declared force majeure for several acetyl products due to equipment failure at our La Porte, Texas site. If we are successful in restarting acetyls production during May, we are currently estimating a second quarter EBITDA impact for the downtime of approximately $50 million.\nNow let's move forward and review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 16. Improving volumes from automotive production and higher margins resulted in first quarter EBITDA of $125 million, $101 million higher than the fourth quarter. Prior quarter results were impacted by LIFO inventory valuation charges of approximately $55 million.\nCompounding & Solutions results increased $40 million. Volumes increased due to improved demand from automotive parts manufacturers relative to the fourth quarter. Margins increased through stronger product pricing and improving asset utilization, partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs. Advanced polymer results increased $10 million, driven by increased seasonal roofing demand for Catalloy and higher product prices. We expect results will be similar in the second quarter as automotive recovery continues to drive volumes while rising cost impact margins. The latest IHS production forecast predicts a 4% rise in 2022 global automotive builds and a 9% increase in 2023. Unfortunately, these reduced forecast delay a return to prior peak production levels until 2025.\nNow please turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results of our Refining segment. Our first quarter EBITDA was $148 million, a decrease of $2 million. Prior quarter results benefited from LIFO inventory valuation changes of approximately $50 million. In the first quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 benchmark expanded significantly to $30.82 per barrel, a $7.24 increase due to higher demand for gasoline and diesel partially offset by lower by-product value. We operated the refinery at 95% of nameplate capacity with an average crude throughput of 255,000 barrels per day. In April, Refining margins continue to expand with increasing demand for transportation fuels. We expect refining markets will remain favorable during the summer months.\nPlease turn to Slide 18 as we review the results for our Technology segment. First quarter EBITDA was $103 million, $70 million lower than the prior quarter's record level. The results were driven by lower licensing revenue and higher catalyst volumes and margins. We expect that second quarter profitability for our technology business will be slightly higher than the first quarter based on the anticipated timing of licensing revenue milestones.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Ken?\n\nKenneth Todd Lane\n\nInterim CEO and Executive VP of Global Olefins & Polyolefins, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you, Michael. As I mentioned earlier, last week, we announced our decision to exit the crude oil refining business no later than the end of 2023. While these decisions are never easy, operation of the refinery beyond next year would require significant capital investment. After thoroughly analyzing our options, we determined that exiting the business was the best path forward.\nOur intention is to safely operate the refinery at full range through the end of next year to meet strong market demand for transportation fuels. During that time, we will continue to consider potential transactions and alternatives for the site. As mentioned earlier, by exiting refining, LyondellBasell will make substantial progress in reducing the company's greenhouse gas emissions.\nIn addition, the refinery is located on 700 acres in the center of one of the world's leading integrated petrochemical hubs. The site's unique location provides LyondellBasell with valuable options for future growth, including further development of our circular businesses. We recognize that this decision affects our employees, their families and the community. Our employees and contractors at the refinery have delivered outstanding performance in safety, reliability, cost improvement and profitability over the past several years. We sincerely thank them for their contributions, and we are committed to supporting our people through this transition.\nNow let me summarize the first quarter and our outlook with Slide 19. With all of the turbulence in the global economy, LyondellBasell's first quarter results illustrate the benefits of our global business portfolio and how demand for our products is highly resilient. While Asia is suffering from weak markets and historically low margins, demand in Europe and the Americas remains remarkably strong and consistent. Improving margins in our Intermediates and Derivatives segment offset first quarter margin compression in our O&P-Americas business. We expect PE chain margins to improve with higher seasonal demand supporting polymer price increases. Also, increased demand for transportation fuels is driving a recovery from pandemic-related weakness in our Oxyfuels & Refining businesses. As a result, we expect cash generation will remain strong at LyondellBasell.\nJust like our earnings, we are stepping up in our progress on sustainability. Today, we talked about a few of our collaborations with customers to develop circular and renewable products for meaningful applications. We are exiting refining and entering into agreements for the supply of renewable power that will drive significant progress on our path toward decarbonization. And we are raising our targets and expanding on our disclosures in our latest sustainability report.\nWe remain committed to prudent capital allocation. With robust cash generation, we plan to continue rewarding shareholders through a growing dividend and share repurchases. We are consistent in our commitment to an investment-grade balance sheet and remain highly disciplined in our consideration of organic and inorganic growth investments.\nThe coming months are exciting times for LyondellBasell. Our businesses are generating resilient results despite volatile economic conditions. We are laying the groundwork for new, more sustainable business models that are likely to reshape value chains across our industry. And later this year, we will be starting up our new propylene oxide and oxyfuel assets during a period of robust margins and strong market demand.\nFinally, on May 23, I look forward to welcoming our next CEO, Peter Vanacker, to lead LyondellBasell. I hope you share my enthusiasm about the future of our company under his leadership.\nWe're now pleased to take your questions."

At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nDavid Kinney\n\nHead of IR, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you, operator. Hello and welcome to LyondellBasell's Fourth Quarter 2021 Teleconference. I'm joined today by Ken Lane, our Interim Chief Executive Officer; and Michael McMurray, our Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin the discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations. Today, we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are also available on our Investor Relations website.\nAdditional documents on our Investor website provide reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release and our business results discussion.\nA recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1 p.m. Eastern Time today until February 28 by calling (877) 660-6853 in the United States and (201) 612-7415 outside the United States. The access code for both numbers is 13725132.\nDuring today's call, we will focus on fourth quarter and full year 2021 results, the current environment and our near-term outlook.\nBefore turning the call over to Ken, I would like to call your attention to the noncash lower of cost or market inventory adjustments, or LCM, that we have discussed on past calls. These adjustments are related to our use of last in, first out, or LIFO, accounting and the volatility in prices for our raw material and finished goods inventories.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, we recognized a noncash impairment of $624 million that reflected our ongoing evaluation of strategic options for the Houston refinery. Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of the refinery impairment and the LCM inventory adjustments.\nWith that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Ken.\n\nKenneth Todd Lane\n\nInterim CEO & EVP of Global Olefins & Polyolefins, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you, Dave, and good day to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today and as we discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results.\nBefore we begin the business discussion, I would like to take a moment and thank our Board of Directors for the opportunity to lead LyondellBasell as interim CEO until Peter Vanacker can join the company at the end of the second quarter. For the past 30 years, I've worked in the chemical industry and roles spanning manufacturing, major projects, strategy and business leadership with assignments in Asia, Europe and the Americas. Since 2019, I've had the pleasure of leading LyondellBasell's global Olefins and Polyolefins businesses.\nOur company is in great shape, and we have good momentum. I want to emphasize that our strategy remains unchanged, and I'll keep our company moving forward, continuing to execute our strategy and ensuring Peter has a successful start. I'll work closely with our Board, the LyondellBasell leadership team and our 19,000 talented employees to advance our growth projects, actively manage our business portfolio and ensure we remain consistent with our goals of being the best operated and most valued company in our industry.\nNow moving on to the business discussion. As Dave mentioned, a set of slides accompanies today's call and is available on our website. Let's turn to Slide 3 and review some highlights for the past year.\n2021 earnings were $18.19 per share with $9.3 billion of EBITDA. Earnings per share were more than 3x higher than 2020, and EBITDA improved by 140%. Our company's growing portfolio of assets delivered EBITDA that exceeded our previous best year by 15% and resulted in $7.6 billion of cash from operating activities. Altogether, we generated a 25% return on invested capital during 2021.\nOur results provide an indicator of how LyondellBasell's earnings power is stepping up relative to the performance we delivered over the prior decade. Our 2021 performance was supported by strong demand for our products, supply constraints across our industry and our growth investments. Favorable markets drove 7 consecutive months of contract price increases for polyethylene in the United States.\nIn our Intermediates and Derivatives segment, strong demand for polyurethanes drove record earnings from our leading propylene oxide and derivatives business. A robust market for building and construction materials served to increase margins across our acetyls value chain. Also, rebounding demand for transportation fuels, self-help cost reductions and higher operating rates enabled our Refining segment to return to profitability in both the third and the fourth quarters.\nI want to emphasize that we're maintaining our commitment to a disciplined approach to capital allocation. Our team worked diligently to convert our EBITDA into $7.6 billion of cash from operating activities. After investing $1.9 billion to maintain our assets and fund additional profit-generating investments, $5.7 billion of free cash flow remained. We rewarded investors by deploying $4.44 per share in dividends and repurchasing over 5 million shares. Last but not least, we delivered on our commitments and strengthened our balance sheet with $4 billion of long-term debt reduction.\nOur strategy is to identify, develop and capture opportunities through all phases of business cycles. During 2021, we capitalized on those opportunities.\nLet's turn to Slide 4. Our core commitments to health and safety remains steadfast. The tragic incident that resulted in 2 fatalities and several injuries at our acetic acid plant last July reminds us of why we work so diligently toward our goal of flawless safety performance. We learn from experience and seek to further bolster our GoalZERO work environment to prevent these incidents from recurring.\nOn Slide 4, you can see that during 2021, our team continued to deliver recordable incident rates that are among the lowest for industry. I'm particularly proud of our team's performance over the final months of 2021 as we engaged the entire organization and leadership teams of our largest contractors to reduce recordable incident rates across our employee and contractor workforce each month during the second half of the year.\nNow please turn to Slide 5 to review our quarterly profitability. While increased costs for feedstocks and energy continue to compress margins from second quarter highs, demand for our products remain strong. Our business portfolio delivered $2 billion of EBITDA during the fourth quarter, exceeding the results of the prior year quarter by 60%. Increased energy costs were particularly impactful for our European O&P and I&D operations, where on some days in December, Dutch natural gas prices exceeded $50 per million Btu. Higher natural gas prices directly impact our fuel costs, but also show up as higher costs for our purchased electricity and steam.\nNonetheless, seasonal patterns for our businesses typically trend downward at the end of the year, and the $2 billion of EBITDA we earned during the fourth quarter of 2021 is reflective of healthy markets for our products. The downward trends we saw in the fourth quarter seem to be abating with margins stabilizing in January. During the remainder of the first quarter, we could see inflection on stronger seasonal demand and supply constraints.\nWith most economists expecting 2022 global GDP growth rates to exceed historical averages at roughly 4%, we remain constructive on the outlook for our businesses. New capacity will come online in 2022 but will largely be needed to meet growing demand from well-funded consumers, address order backlogs as supply chains normalize and support further global reopening from the pandemic.\nSlide 6 provides a historical view of LyondellBasell's profitability over the past decade. During the period from 2011 to 2019, we delivered an average of $6.7 billion of EBITDA. Our performance in 2021 exceeded the 2015 peak by 15%. While 2021 was a particularly strong year for our core markets, we have confidence that the growth investments we brought online since 2018 will drive a sustainable step-change improvement in our profitability over the next decade.\nThe formation of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment in 2018 provided visibility into LyondellBasell's sizable legacy compounding business. The businesses we acquired that year from A. Schulman added approximately $200 million in annual EBITDA. Since 2018, the APS segment has been challenged by production constraints in their largest market: plastic compounds used in vehicle production.\nDespite high consumer demand, automotive production has been held back by COVID-related manufacturing shutdowns and shortages of semiconductors. With global vehicle production expected to rebound by 9% in 2022 and an additional 10% in 2023, we expect to reach higher utilization across our APS segment. Increased capacity utilization will enable the realization of volume-driven synergies.\nIn 2020, we commissioned the first world-scale plant utilizing LyondellBasell's proprietary Hyperzone technology for high-density polyethylene. We have a long and successful track record of introducing new polyolefin technologies. Each new generation of technology encounters initial challenges, and we are making good progress working through those with our first Hyperzone asset. Our manufacturing and R&D teams have been working diligently to improve reliability.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, we decided to bring down the Hyperzone plant and make some modifications. While it's still early days, we are highly encouraged by the performance of the plant since restarting in December. It's my expectation that we will realize a greater share of the volume and margin benefits from this investment during 2022.\nIn 2020, we invested and integrated cracker joint ventures in China and Louisiana, where new assets were fully built and generated immediate returns. In 2022, we are starting up 2 new propylene oxide plants, a joint venture in China and a wholly owned asset in Houston that will expand LyondellBasell's ownership capacity for propylene oxide by nearly 50%. I'm pleased to report that the China plant is already producing on-spec products and rapidly ramping up rates.\nOur larger PO/TBA facility in Houston is progressing on schedule for start-up during the end of this year. Both propylene oxide facilities are starting up with tight markets and all-time high margins for this intermediate chemical that is essential for the production of polyurethanes and other downstream products. Taken together, our growth investments give us the confidence that we will step up earnings in the current decade.\nOn Slide 7, I would like to highlight how we are also stepping up our progress on sustainability. In April, we introduced our Circulen family of polymers produced using recycled and renewable-based feedstocks that reduce our reliance on fossil-based raw materials. These products are targeted at the rapidly growing market for sustainable plastics. In October, we extended the Circulen brand to the compounds and solutions provided by our APS segment. All of this is part of LyondellBasell's commitment to annually produce and market 2 million tons of recycled and renewable based polymers by 2030.\n2022 will be an exciting year for our proprietary MoReTec advanced recycling technology. In December, our team commissioned upgrades to our pilot facility, enabling us to determine the extent of our technology advantage and guide an investment decision for our first commercial-scale facility. This technology provides LyondellBasell with an opportunity to be a leader in the rapidly growing markets for circular plastics.\nIn late September, we announced accelerated targets and the goal to achieve net zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions from our global operations by 2050. We also increased our 2030 ambition and now aim to reduce absolute emissions by 30% relative to a 2020 baseline.\nIn the near term, we don't expect significant increases in our overall capital budget as reduced spending associated with the completion of our PO/TBA project in 2022 should offset an increasing share for circular and climate-related investments going forward.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Michael for him to describe our financial and segment results in more detail.\n\nMichael C. McMurray\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, LyondellBasell Industries N.V.\n\nThank you, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8, and let me begin by highlighting our substantial cash generation during 2021.\nLyondellBasell delivered record cash from operations and free cash flow in 2021. Our team worked diligently to efficiently convert 82% of our EBITDA into cash for the year despite increased working capital needs to support higher prices. After accounting for sustaining capital investments, we achieved a 23% free operating cash flow yield relative to our market capitalization.\nLet's continue with Slide 9 and review the details of how we deployed all of this cash last year. During 2021, we paid dividends and repurchased shares to provide a total of $2 billion in returns for shareholders. In May, we increased our quarterly dividend by 8%. 2021 represents our 11th consecutive year of annual dividend growth. At the same time, we reduced our long-term debt by $4 billion and further bolstered our balance sheet by paying down $300 million of short-term commercial paper.\nNet interest expense increased to $510 million, higher than our guidance at the beginning of 2021, largely due to debt extinguishment costs. Our current portfolio supports our solid investment-grade balance sheet, and we do not see the need for additional debt reduction. We ended the year with $1.5 billion of cash and short-term investments and $5.4 billion of cash and available liquidity.\nNow I'd like to provide an overview of the results for each of our segments on Slide 10. As Ken mentioned, our business portfolio delivered $2 billion of EBITDA during the fourth quarter. Our results reflected strong demand for our products, offset by higher costs for feedstocks and energy, primarily in our O&P Europe, Asia, International, I&D and APS segments.\nLet's begin the individual segment discussions on Slide 11 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins - Americas segment. Fourth quarter 2021 EBITDA was $1.3 billion, $306 million lower than the third quarter. Margins declined on lower pricing for both Olefins and Polyolefins. Olefin results decreased approximately $190 million compared to third quarter 2021 due to margin declines driven by lower ethylene and propylene prices. Although we operated our North American ethylene crackers at 97%, sales volumes remained relatively unchanged as we built inventory to support maintenance downtime planned for the first quarter.\nCombined polyolefin results were approximately $120 million lower than the third quarter, primarily due to a decrease in polyethylene and polypropylene spreads over monomer. Polyethylene, however, posted record volumes driven by strong demand and increased production from our Hyperzone facility in December.\nO&P Americas posted record EBITDA of $5.3 billion for the full year, $3.5 billion higher than 2020. Margins increased for both Olefins and Polyolefins as higher product prices outpaced higher cost. Demand for nondurable packaging and consumer goods remained strong and led to increased volumes for both ethylene and polyethylene. Based on increasing seasonal demand and tight industry supply due to higher industry cracker maintenance, we expect robust margins to continue into the first quarter.\nLet's turn to Slide 12 and review typical seasonal trends in the U.S. polyethylene market. After tight markets escalated prices over the first 3 quarters of 2021, declines in polyethylene contract prices during the fourth quarter of last year captured market attention.\nAs illustrated by the green line on the chart, demand typically rises during the first quarter, stabilizes in the second quarter and grows again during the second season of the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, orders for polymers slow due to holiday downtime and as market participants strive to minimize their year-end inventories. The blue line indicates that polyethylene pricing logically follows these seasonal demand trends. Simply put, Lower fourth quarter prices are a common occurrence.\nIn contrast, the industry usually sees a rebound in demand and pricing during the first quarter. Orders increase as customers resume full production. During February and March, export demand often improves following the Lunar New Year holiday.\nIn 2022, industry consultants are forecasting planned maintenance for U.S. ethylene crackers will be 3x higher than normal, with about 15% of U.S. capacity taking maintenance downtime. Similarly, about 10% of European ethylene capacity will be down for maintenance during the first half of 2022. Ethylene cracker outages often constrain downstream polyethylene production.\nIn summary, the confluence of seasonal trends, industry downtime and robust consumer demand should provide support for polyethylene pricing during the first quarter of 2022.\nNow please turn to Slide 13 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins - Europe, Asia and International segment. Higher cost and lower spreads reduced margins and volumes in our EAI markets, resulting in a fourth quarter EBITDA of $155 million, $319 million lower than the third quarter. Olefins results declined approximately $180 million as margins decreased driven by higher feedstock and energy cost despite higher ethylene and propylene prices. We operate our crackers at a rate of 70% due to planned maintenance.\nCombined polyolefin results decreased approximately $100 million compared to the prior quarter. Lower seasonal demand drove declines in polyolefin price spreads relative to monomer cost and reduced volumes. Declining polyolefin spreads and higher energy costs also affected our joint venture equity income by about $15 million.\nFull year EBITDA increased $923 million compared to 2020. Olefins margins declined due to higher feedstock costs, outpacing increased ethylene and propylene prices. Combined polyolefin results and our joint venture equity income increased by more than $815 million and $125 million, respectively, driven by higher margins with increases in polyolefin prices. In Europe, we expect typical seasonal improvements as we progress through the first half of the year.\nPlease turn to Slide 14 as we take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $252 million, a decline of $96 million from the third quarter of 2021. Compressed margins for Oxyfuels & Related Products and last in, first out inventory valuation charges of about $95 million muted margin improvements in our propylene oxide and derivatives and intermediate chemical businesses.\nFourth quarter propylene oxide and derivatives results remained relatively unchanged, with higher margins offset by lower volumes due to planned maintenance. Intermediate chemicals results increased about $65 million with the resumption of our acetyls production. Oxyfuels & Related Products results decreased approximately $85 million as margins declined due to higher butane feedstock costs.\nFor the full year, strong demand and a tight market drove margin increases in most businesses, resulting in EBITDA of $1.4 billion, $535 million higher than 2020. Volumes declined due to reduced exports of our propylene oxide and derivative products.\nIn the first quarter of 2022, we expect margins to improve for our Oxyfuels & Related Products business with lower butane feedstock costs. Our volumes are expected to increase during the first quarter, supported by continued strong demand for our propylene oxide and derivatives and acetyls products.\nNow let's move forward and review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 15. Customer supply chain constraints and high raw material costs hindered results with fourth quarter EBITDA of $24 million, $97 million lower than the third quarter. The segment incurred last in, first out inventory valuation charges of about $55 million during the quarter.\nResults for the Compounding & Solutions businesses decreased due to margin declines driven by higher raw material costs. Volumes decreased with continued supply chain constraints in the automotive manufacturing market. Results for our advanced polymer businesses were relatively unchanged, with margin improvement offset by volume declines.\nFull year EBITDA for the segment was $409 million, a $28 million increase over 2020. Compared to the prior period, results benefited from a $35 million reduction in integration costs. Margins increased with higher spreads and volumes, increased with higher building and construction demand for our advanced polymer businesses. We expect volumes to improve as automotive manufacturers begin to ramp up production, particularly for products from our Compounding & Solutions business.\nNow let's turn to Slide 16 and discuss the results of our Refining segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $150 million, a $109 million improvement compared to the third quarter of 2021. Results excluded a noncash impairment charge of $624 million, reflecting our ongoing evaluation of strategic options. Results for the quarter benefited from approximately $50 million due to LIFO effects from reduced inventory volumes.\nResults for the fourth quarter were driven by an improvement in margins due to a better product mix and an increase in the Maya 2-1-1 benchmark crack spread to about $23.58 per barrel. We operated the refinery at near-full rates of nameplate capacity with an average crude throughput at 266,000 barrels per day.\nFull year EBITDA increased $289 million compared to 2020 or breakeven for the year. Comparisons exclude impairments taken in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the third quarter of 2020. Approximately $45 million of LIFO changes benefited the segment for 2021.\nRefining margins improved with higher demand for gasoline and jet fuel, which drove the Maya 2-1-1 spread from a historically low point in 2020 at an average of $12.63 to $20.87 per barrel in 2021. Crude throughput improved to 231,000 barrels per day in response to higher market demand. Refining margins are expected to improve slightly, with crack spreads estimated to be about $25 per barrel. We plan to operate the refinery at more than 90% of nameplate crude capacity during the first quarter.\nPlease turn to Slide 17 as we review the results of our Technology segment. All-time high levels of licensing revenue and catalyst volumes drove EBITDA to new records of $173 million for the fourth quarter and $514 million for the full year. Based on the timing of anticipated licensing milestones, we expect the first quarter Technology business profitability will be lower, similar to levels in the first quarter of 2021.\nBefore I turn the call over to Ken, let me address some of your annual modeling questions for 2022 on Slide 18. We are planning to invest approximately $2.1 billion in capital expenditures during 2022. Approximately $0.9 billion is targeted toward profit-generating growth projects, with the balance supporting sustaining maintenance. The majority of our 2022 growth investment is associated with the construction of the PO/TBA plant in Houston.\nWe have a fairly typical schedule of planned maintenance for 2022 with a total of 3 major cracker turnarounds. We will also have a couple of turnarounds in our I&D segment during the second quarter. Based on expected volumes and margins, we estimate that lost production associated with all of this maintenance downtime will impact 2022 EBITDA by approximately $265 million. While routine maintenance costs are expensed, maintenance costs arising from turnarounds of major production units are capitalized and included in our capital expenditure forecast.\nThe U.S. cracker turnaround is scheduled for the La Porte, Texas site in the first quarter and expect it to impact O&P America's quarterly EBITDA by approximately $125 million. The European cracker turnarounds will occur at our French cracker during the first and second quarters and are smaller cracker in Wesseling, Germany during the third and fourth quarters of 2022. The maintenance is expected to impact O&P EAI quarterly EBITDA by approximately $25 million, $15 million, $10 million, and $10 million in the first through fourth quarters, respectively.\nPlant maintenance at our butanediol facility in 1 of our 2 propylene oxide units located in Channelview, Texas is expected to impact second quarter EBITDA for our Intermediates and Derivatives segment by approximately $80 million. We expect 2022 net interest expense will be approximately $340 million after netting capitalized interest of about $95 million. 2022 book depreciation and amortization is forecasted to be approximately $1.3 billion. We plan to make regular pension contributions in 2022 totaling approximately $70 million with approximately $55 million of pension expense for the year. We currently expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 20% and our cash tax rate to be lower than our ETR.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken. Ken?\n\nJaideep Mukesh Pandya\n\nAnalyst, On Field Investment Research LLP\n\nThank you, Michael. So let me summarize the year's highlights and our outlook with Slide 19.\nIn 2021, LyondellBasell maintained our disciplined focus on safety, operational excellence and reliability to maximize returns during a year of exceptional markets. Our 2021 results were 15% above prior benchmarks and are indicative of how LyondellBasell's profitability is stepping up from prior levels. Many of our growth investments are providing returns today with further contributions expected over the next several years.\nIn 2022, we will expand our propylene oxide capacity by 50% with the start of 2 new plants in China and Texas. We are improving the performance of our Hyperzone polyethylene technology to deliver enhanced product performance for our customers. As supply chains normalize and automotive production begins to catch up with high consumer demand, we anticipate higher volumes and earnings from our APS segment. Also, improving markets for fuels bodes well for our oxyfuels and Refining businesses.\nOur disciplined approach carries through to our capital allocation strategy. We're providing shareholders with increasing returns from higher dividends and the resumption of share repurchases. In 2021, we deleveraged our balance sheet and demonstrated our commitment to a strong investment-grade credit rating. With our strong credit metrics, we have no near-term need for further deleveraging. In 2022, about 40% of our capital expenditures will be allocated toward profit-generating projects, including our new propylene oxide facility in Texas.\nThe rapidly growing market for more sustainable plastics represents one of the greatest opportunities that lies ahead for LyondellBasell. We have launched our Circulen brand, and we're committed to producing and marketing at least 2 million tons of circular and renewable-based polymers by 2030. At the same time, we'll reduce our greenhouse gas emissions in line with our commitment to achieve net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2050. At LyondellBasell, we believe our work in sustainability is both good for our planet and good for our business.\nIn summary, we'll continue to execute on our disciplined approach and build on the strong momentum to deliver sustainable value for all of our stakeholders.\nWe're now pleased to take your questions."

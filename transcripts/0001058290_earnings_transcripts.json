Thank you for joining us. We are pleased to report another industry-leading performance in the third quarter of 2025 as revenue growth and adjusted operating margin again outpaced our expectations. Our results reflect the momentum we have built over the past 2.5 years, helping clients embrace AI. Our investments in platforms, intellectual property, partnerships and in upskilling our people are evolving Cognizant into an AI builder capable of scaling agentic AI across the enterprise. As AI infrastructure expands, our clients increasingly need support from partners who can help them move from experimentation to enterprise-wide adoption with speed, precision and trust.\nTurning to third quarter highlights. Revenue grew 6.5% year-over-year in constant currency to $5.4 billion. All 4 of our operating segments grew revenue organically year-over-year. This breadth of performance across industries and geographies reflects the strength and resilience of our portfolio capabilities and delivery model. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year organic revenue growth. Our strongest sequential organic growth since 2022 and another podium finish to our peer group's Winner Circle.\nWe signed 6 large deals, each with TCV of $100 million or more, bringing our year-to-date total to 16. Trailing 12 months bookings is up 5% year-over-year and year-to-date the TCV of our large deals is up from the prior year period. We are focused on converting value from AI across our 3,500 early AI engagements and embracing AI in the delivery of our services and to drive internal transformation. As we do this, we are also increasing our fixed bid transaction and outcome-based services mix. And we are beginning to see trends of nonlinearity emerge.\nFor example, on a trailing 12-month basis, revenue per employee rose 8% year-over-year, while adjusting operating margin income per employee grew 10%. As we continue to scale our IP and platforms, we expect more examples of nonlinear AI-led growth to emerge.\nImportantly, we are expanding margins while continuing to fund our organic inorganic growth initiatives and increasing returns to shareholders. Q3 adjusted operating margin improved 70 basis points year-over-year, driven by our disciplined expense management, along with our increasingly AI-enabled delivery model. Our year-to-date performance has put us on track to outperform the revenue guidance we established at the beginning of the year, and we expect to meet the high end of the adjusted operating margin range we set then.\nFor much of the last 30 years, IT services grew through a linear model. More people and more projects drove incremental growth. AI is reshaping that equation by compressing time, cost and complexity and redefining how value is created. The opportunity to partner with the clients and drive outcomes is now more expansive, immersive and elastic. The progress we are sharing today reflects 2.5 years of focused execution and amplifying talent, scaling innovation and accelerating growth to return Cognizant to a leadership position in the AI era.\nBecoming an AI builder means building the platforms and engineering capabilities that enable agentic AI to scale across the enterprise. Our progress begins with our workforce as we enable AI fluency across the 350,000 associates. We continue to fuel strength and future readiness for our associates through a learning engine and access to AI tools, which is why we are hiring more new graduates across the world this year and investing in their AI upskilling. In July, our Vibe Coding initiative earned Cognizant the Guinness World Records title for the world's largest online Generative AI Hackathon. More than 53,000 associates across 40 countries built over 30,000 working prototypes, improving their AI code assist skills and productivity. And we are continuing to expand into the AI ecosystem.\nRecently, we entered a new collaboration with Anthropic. Under our agreement, we plan to deploy Anthropic's cloud models and agentic tooling with our platforms to help clients scale AI, while also deploying them internally to advance our own operations. Our AI Builder strategy is anchored in 3 distinct vectors. AI-led productivity, industrializing AI, and identifying the enterprise. When each vector is advancing at a different velocity, together they're performing a flywheel of new value creation. Let me provide an update on vector 1. AI-led productivity is the funding engine for enterprise transformation as we help clients accelerate software development, lower deployment costs and reduce technical debt that we estimate is costing enterprises hundreds of billions of dollars in annual servicing.\nIn the third quarter, approximately 30% of our internal code was AI generated, significantly improving productivity of our developers. We believe it could reach 50% in the years ahead. A great example to illustrate our client impact with Code Assist platform partners is a recent award as the AI GitHub Services and Channel Partner of the Year in recognition of our achievements in helping clients with our AI transformation initiatives. Many clients have asked us for support in bringing wipe coding and code assist best practices to their organizations.\nWe recently launched a Cognizant enterprise wipe coding blueprint, bringing our playbooks and insights to clients seeking to build AI fluency across their own teams. This transformation extends beyond the developer community. Internally, we have embedded AI across more than 150 use cases from finance and operations to sales enablement and contract pricing. These applications are streamlining decision-making, improving accuracy and accelerating cycle times.\nA primary tool for executing Vector 1 is our Flowsource platform, which integrates generative and agentic AI across the full software development life cycle. Flowsource is now being used at over 70 clients with an additional 120 in the pipeline. One of those clients is Pearson, where we are using AI and digital technologies to modernize their learning platforms, products and applications by leveraging Flowsource.\nOur proactive shift to AI native and platform-driven engineering accelerates the software development cycle by enabling engineers to deliver enterprise-grade AI-infused digital applications with greater speed and scale. This is showing up in our results with our approximately $2 billion annual run rate digital engineering business growing about 8% organically year-to-date. Vector 1 is also fueling our large deal momentum as clients consolidate their software estates and shift to outcome-based models, they're capturing savings and unlocking higher value. Often reinvesting those gains into Vector 2 and Vector 3 initiatives. It is creating a self-reinforcing cycle of transformation.\nA great example of this in action is our cloud and infrastructure modernization business, which grew 10% year-over-year in the quarter. Our AI tooling and services in the space has helped over 25 clients so far to build, respond and resolve to reliant and resilient IT infrastructure. Now more on vector 2 or industrializing AI as the scalability layer. It's about moving AI beyond experimentation into enterprise-grade systems, building AI-ready infrastructure, integrating contextual data and operationalizing AI responsibly.\nIt also involves developing new business operating models, leading to an interplay of software and agentic layers, human and agentic capital and structured and unstructured data to reimagine an enterprise. We are leading this effort with our consulting basis framework and methodology to help clients reimagine business processes as they develop and deploy agents. And we are deepening our expertise with the next level capability set, including Agent Foundry, a framework and library of the industry and workflow-specific agents, helping power agentic AI at scale. Together with our clients, we have developed more than 1,500 agents across the company.\nSecond, AI data training services, where we have over 10,000 specialists fine-tuning models with domain-specific context. We have supported leading tech companies with training their machine learning systems long before generative AI entered the mainstream, and we are now bringing the same expertise to Global 2000 clients. Third, small language models development. Fourth, context engineering, which we believe is one of the most critical emerging disciplines in enterprise AI to capture enterprise workflows, domain and tribal knowledge, personas, rules and execution patterns. It is the connectivity tissue between models and outcomes.\nIn partnership with Work Fabric AI, we are deploying context engineers who are helping clients build tailored foundations for AI adoption. And finally, IP on the edge, which I began describing last quarter is a horizontal foundation layer where we are bundling platforms like Neuro AI with services and IP to deliver outcomes. With 400 platform deployments already in motion, we are helping clients modernize core systems to reduce risk, accelerate time to market and improve experiences. As we build layers of contextual value on foundation models through a combination of context engineering, SLMs and multi-agent systems, we are delivering numerous production-grade AI use cases.\nTo bring this to life, we helped the national grocery chain optimize it in-store pickup process for online orders, reducing fulfillment time by 20% to 45% through smarter inventory selection, product substitutions and routing. This is driving a measurable increase in online orders. Lastly, vector 3 or identifying the enterprise is about unlocking exponential agentic capital. Historically, we built software for humans.\nWith Agentic AI, we now reimagine processes end-to-end by deploying agents with humans in the loop to deliver outcomes. This expands the enterprise's surface area, enabling a blended human plus agent workforce across new domains. The agentic development life cycle or ADLC differs fundamentally from the traditional software development cycle or SDLC. SDLC is structured and deterministic, input in, output out. ADLC is adaptive and outcome-driven, to design for behavior, supervise performance and evolves capabilities over time.\nWe believe ADLC significantly expands our addressable market, demanding deep ownership to manage human digital collaboration. As an AI builder, we are creating an agentic ecosystem where agents reason, adopt and collaborate, unlocking service capabilities that weren't possible before.\nCognizant is an early launch partner for Google Gemini Enterprise, an AI-powered platform designed for enterprises to drive unified secure AI capabilities. It seamlessly connects enterprise data, tools and workflows and leverages Gemini models to enable agentic journeys. And some client examples include reducing order response times from 5 days to 90 seconds with digital sales agents for a leading food distributor, helping a leading provider of cell-free DNA diagnostics reinvent patient education, access and onboarding processes, modernizing order management for a crop sciences company using Agent force, delivering intelligent lead generation for a top labeling and a packaging provider.\nWith TriZetto's core adjudication platform supporting health plans, we have deployed multi-agent workflows that connect TriZetto agents to front-end experience platforms such as Salesforce, Genesys and ServiceNow to address common interactions such as requesting ID cards from a member or giving provider the status of a claim. We believe much of the Vector 3 will flow into Intuitive Operations and automation practice, which is our BPO business, including BPaaS services.\nOur BPO revenue grew 10% in the last 2 quarters and is on track to reach $3 billion in annualized revenue over the next several quarters. We believe identification will unlock new labor pools, including roles that don't yet exist. As digital labor diffuses into enterprise operations, the nature of human endeavor will evolve. Together, our work across vector 1, 2 and 3 reflects our evolution into an AI builder company, one that blends deep domain expertise with platform innovation and interdisciplinary talent.\n30 years ago, IT services companies were builders, crafting the foundational systems that powered industries. Over time, the role shifted towards integration, development and maintenance and growth became more linear. Today, Cognizant has a unique opportunity to reclaim the builder mindset and capture a greater share of the fragmented AI market.\nThe scale of this opportunity is extraordinary. While global software market is in hundreds of billions of dollars, the surrounding labor spend represents many trillions more. Classical software has barely penetrated that space. We believe AI's winners will be those who diffuse into this labor spend, reshape how work gets done. Software and agent development cycles will coexist, and Cognizant is poised to generate layers of value in this expansive new role for enterprise reimagination.\nIn closing, we are proud of our Q3 results and the momentum we are building financially, commercially and strategically. We are evolving from software implementer to AI builder powered by an engineering heritage and AI-ready workforce and proprietary innovation. We know long-term success will be determined by the outcomes we deliver for our clients, our people and our shareholders.\nThank you again for joining us. I'll now turn the call over to Jatin.\n\nJatin Pravinchandra Dalal\n\nCFO, Wipro Limited\n\nThank you, Ravi, and thank you all for joining us. We are pleased to report third quarter results that include revenue growth above the high end of our guidance range, strong margin expansion year-over-year and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our performance once again places us in the winner circle, and we are delivering these results despite a complex demand environment and geopolitical backdrop.\nWe continue to execute with discipline, driving improved revenue growth while investing in our people, technology and partnership to support our AI builder strategy and long-term growth. At the same time, we are delivering consistent margin expansion. These results are underpinned by balanced capital allocation framework, which we believe are key enablers to driving long-term and sustained shareholder value creation.\nNow moving to the details of the quarter. In Q3, we delivered revenue of $5.4 billion, up 6.5% year-over-year in constant currency, again led by strong growth in North America. Belcan contributed slightly less than 250 basis points of inorganic growth. Year-to-date, our revenue grew 7.3% in constant currency, including 350 basis points of inorganic growth. Adjusted operating margin expanded 50 basis points and adjusted EPS grew approximately 11%. And we returned about $1.5 billion of capital to shareholders.\nWith respect to demand environment, trends in Q3 were consistent with last quarter. Clients across industries are navigating elevated levels of uncertainty around trade policy and resulting impacts to their businesses. We are also seeing clients carefully evaluate technology investments, which is resulting in a lower pace of discretionary spending in certain areas like products and resources. At the same time, cost pressures continue to spur demand for productivity-led and vendor consolidation opportunity across segments. And we see a growing pipeline of modernization projects that lay the foundation of AI-led transformation for our clients.\nNow turning to segments. We delivered year-over-year organic growth in all segments in the third quarter. Financial Services led growth, driven by healthy discretionary spending trends in areas like digital engineering, legacy modernization and generative AI initiatives and improved spending among insurance customers, particularly in North America. Health Sciences was in line with our expectation and has remained resilient despite the uncertainty around government funding and trade policies. While we have seen pockets of discretionary spending pressure, it is being more than offset by the ramp of recent wins in payer and life sciences.\nProducts and Resources revenue growth has improved, and we are confident we can build off these levels in the quarters ahead as we expect new deal wins to ramp up more meaningfully in 2026. And Communication, Media and Technology grew organically and benefited from recent large deal wins that more than offset pockets of discretionary spending weakness in the quarter.\nGeographically, North America once again led growth and was up nearly 8% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by our large deal success and Belcan. Outside of North America, demand trends in Europe and Rest of World remained stable, but not immune to impacts from recent tariff and geopolitical uncertainty.\nTurning to bookings. On the trailing 12-month basis, bookings grew 5% and represented a book-to-bill of 1.3. After a strong performance of 18% year-over-year growth in Q2, we experienced some lumpiness in the third quarter and bookings declined by about 5% year-over-year. Our trailing 12-month annual contract value, or ACV, growth was consistent with TCV growth. Overall, our backlog remains healthy and our sustained large deal momentum provides us good visibility as we exit 2025.\nMoving on to margins. Third quarter operating margin of 16% increased by 70 basis points year-over-year, benefiting from NextGen program savings and the Indian rupee depreciation. Utilization held steady at 85% for third consecutive quarter, up from 84% a year ago. These improvements were partially offset by the ramp of large deals and the dilutive impact from Belcan. Voluntary attrition remained low at 14.5%, down 70 basis points sequentially, the third consecutive quarter of sequential decline and down 10 basis points year-over-year.\nA brief comment on H1B visas. Over the last several years, Cognizant has significantly reduced the dependency on visas while increasing local hiring and our nearshore capacity. We also stepped up our investments in automation and AI productivity tooling. We, therefore, do not expect a material impact to our operations or financial performance in near term as a result of the recent policy changes in the U.S.\nNow 2 additional details. During the quarter, we recorded a onetime noncash income tax expense of $390 million or $0.80 per share. As we discussed last quarter, this charge is related to a deferred income tax asset on the balance sheet that is not expected to be realized due to the enactment of the July U.S. budget bill. Adjusted EPS, which excludes this impact, was $1.39, up 11% year-over-year. DSO of 82 days declined 1 day sequentially and increased 1 day year-over-year.\nThird quarter free cash flow was $1.2 billion and represented 170% of adjusted net income. This compares to free cash flow of $791 million a year ago. As a reminder, cash income taxes in the third quarter were approximately $150 million, lower compared to our projections prior to the passing of the July U.S. budget bill. For the full year, we expect that reduction to be $200 million. Through the first 9 months of 2025, free cash flow is $1.9 billion and represented approximately 100% of adjusted net income.\nDuring the third quarter, we returned $600 million of capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, bringing the year-to-date total to approximately $1.5 billion. We are on track with our plan to return $2 billion to shareholders in 2025. This will bring total capital returned to shareholders since 2022 to nearly $5 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.4 billion or net cash of $1.8 billion.\nFinally, our M&A pipeline remains active, and we have ample flexibility to invest strategically in the quarters ahead while continuing to return substantial capital to shareholders. Now turning to our forward guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to grow 2.5% to 3.5% year-over-year in constant currency, which is all organic. We, therefore, now expect full year revenue to grow 6% to 6.3% in constant currency, above our prior guidance range of 4% to 6%.\nWe continue to expect full year inorganic contribution of approximately 250 basis points. We are increasing our adjusted operating margin guidance to approximately 15.7%, which is the upper end of our prior guidance and represents 40 basis points of expansion. We continue to expect margin performance will be driven by cost discipline and SG&A leverage. This year, the fourth quarter will include the impact from a merit cycle compared to its Q3 timing last year. This will be partially offset by year-end seasonal margin strength.\nWe continue to expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 100% of adjusted net income. This includes the benefit from lower cash taxes as a result of the U.S. budget bill discussed earlier. We expect our adjusted tax rate, which excludes the onetime tax charge, to be in 24% to 25% range. Based on our current visibility, we now expect full year tax rate to be closer to the midpoint versus the lower end that we indicated last quarter.\nWe are increasing our EPS guidance to $5.22 to $5.26 compared to our prior range of $5.08 to $5.22. This represents 10% to 11% year-over-year growth. Our expected weighted average diluted share count is unchanged at approximately 489 million. In closing, we are very proud that our guidance puts us on track to meet or exceed the high end of the initial guidance range we provided back in February despite a dynamically changing market compared to the beginning of the year.\nWhile we are not commenting on financial expectations for 2026, we feel well positioned to carry this momentum as we look ahead and remain committed to the long-term financial framework we provided at the Investor Day earlier this year. With that, we will open the call for your questions."

Thank you for joining us. Our momentum continued in the second quarter of 2025 as we again delivered revenue growth and adjusted operating margin ahead of our expectations, while also accelerating our bookings growth. Our performance reflects the depth and strength of our portfolio, supported by our continued strategic focus on AI-led opportunities and disciplined execution.\nAs you can see from today's results, we continue to make progress towards building a resilient and durable company that thrives in both slow and high-velocity markets. In the past, I've described the AI opportunity as a double engine transformation for our clients, both on productivity and innovation. In the second quarter, we delivered a healthy combination of wins in AI efficiency-led large deals and innovation-led projects with agentic AI unlocking new revenue pools and spend cycles.\nThe 3-vector AI opportunity we have laid out on our strategy is resonating very well with our clients. AI projects in experimentation over the past few quarters have started to build momentum in downstream opportunities. I will expand on this further when I review our strategic progress shortly.\nFirst, I will walk through the highlights and our key drivers from the quarter. Second quarter revenue grew 7.2% year-over-year in constant currency to $5.2 billion. Our results marked the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year organic growth and another solid placement in our industry's Winner Circle. Organic revenue growth was led by Financial Services and Health Sciences and benefited from the ramp of recently won large deals.\nQ2 bookings grew 18% year-over-year, translating to trailing 12 months growth of 6%. During the quarter, we landed 6 large deals with TCV of $100 million or greater, including 2 mega deals, each valued around $1 billion. As a result of these wins, the TCV of our large deals more than doubled year-over-year. Adjusted operating margin of 15.6% improved by 40 basis points year-over-year.\nWe are on track to achieve our 20 to 40 basis points margin expansion goal for 2025. Headcount grew about 2% sequentially, led by hiring of recent college graduates, while trailing 12 months voluntary attrition for tech services declined by 60 basis points sequentially to 15.2%. The progress reported today is the strategic -- is the result of the strategic actions we have taken over the past 2.5 years to sharpen our innovation engine and develop our capabilities through investments in AI, engineering and our platform strategy.\nWhile we are still in the early innings of capturing the AI opportunity, I believe these strategic steps are helping drive our performance. A few data points of our progress include: first, we currently have more than 2,500 early GenAI client engagements compared to 1,400 in quarter 1. Nearly 30% of our code was AI generated in quarter 2, significantly improving the productivity of our developers. This compares to only approximately 20% when we first disclosed this estimate 2 quarters ago.\nAnd thirdly, our AI research labs is accelerating the industrialization of agent-based systems backed by a robust portfolio of 59 U.S. patents. Our areas of research are focused on building AI platforms and tooling to help clients accelerate the embrace of AI and agenetic systems in enterprise landscapes.\nIn the current economic environment, clients are prioritizing productivity and value what we have characterized as Vector 1. Our ability to proactively craft AI-driven technology deployments that deliver faster execution, improved productivity and cost savings is driving several of our large deal wins, including the 2 mega deals we won in quarter 2.\nWe expect Vector 1 to further accelerate as clients underwrite their innovation and growth projects with AI productivity-led savings we are enabling. In the second quarter out of a subset of a client base of nearly 360 key accounts, 97% of clients have adopted AI, of which 56% are scaling Gen AI and out of which 78% have demonstrated impact from the adoption and scaling.\nWe're also actively pursuing Vector 2 and Vector 3 opportunities, which we have labeled as industrializing AI and agentifying the enterprise, respectively. This includes proactively helping clients with their AI-led innovation and agentic strategy as we quickly evolve our capabilities from experimentation to scale production-grade programs. In a scaled and structured manner, we have created cross service line cohorts anchored by our client partner teams to deliver agentic workshops across our client base.\nFor example, we are combining our strengths in logistics, customer service and agentic AI to extend our relationship with Lineage, the world's largest owner and operator of temperature-controlled warehouses. Under our new agreement announced earlier this week, we will use powerful tools like agentic AI, automation and predictive insights to empower Lineage customer care professionals and help deliver a differentiated experience for their customers. I will touch on a few more examples shortly.\nNow I want to update you on our progress against our strategic priorities to amplify our talent, scale innovation and accelerate growth. First, with amplifying talent, we continue to prepare our workforce for an AI-led future. We are deepening our talent investments in emerging technology hubs with plans to expand operations in visakhapatnam. This follows a new site in GIFT City Ahmedabad and plans for a new 21-acre learning center in Chennai that is expected to train freshers and experienced hires in advanced AI skills.\nOur talent efforts are reflected in our employee engagement survey completed during the quarter, where scores remained well above industry and best-in-class benchmarks for the third year in a row. Next, with scaling innovation, our engine continues to gain momentum. Earlier this month, we launched Cognizant Agent Foundry, which accelerates enterprise scale adoption of agentic AI. Agent Foundry powered by our neuro AI suite and a strong AI partner ecosystem with hundreds of distinctive agents already available for use. It spans industries and platforms with domain-specific small language models, agent templates and the library of prebuilt agents supporting the full agent life cycle.\nAs enterprises reimagine their process and workflows, we are building a repository of reusable agents for a rapid deployment into enterprise landscapes. Earlier today, we launched our first-ever VIBE coding week for all 344,000 of our associates to evangelize an AI-enabled software development cycle as the new and only way to deliver software with the help of our Code Assist platform partners.\nWe believe this is the world's largest initiative of its kind, but what excites me most is the opportunity for every associate to build real AI fluency and deliver continued higher productivity to all our client project work. Also today, we launched Cognizant AI training data services for Global 2000 clients who are embracing AI models in their businesses. For many years, Cognizant has helped digital-native leaders train some of the world's most advanced AI models.\nWorking with trade leaders in tech, health care, automotive, media and retail, our more than 10,000 specialists have curated, annotated and quality check billions of data points and millions of data labels across every major modality. This includes speech, 2D, 3D imagery, video and LiDAR often enriched with geospatial meta data for added accuracy. Our domain know-how has enabled us to produce high-precision specialized data sets across industries. This new strategic offering will help empower enterprises to quickly build, fine-tune, validate and deploy production-grade AI models at scale.\nCurrently, with accelerated growth, let me share a few examples of our innovation in action. Last month, we introduced Cognizant Autonomous customer engagement, a platform built with Google Cloud that uses agentic AI to deliver faster, smarter and more intuitive customer service. It is a significant advancement, and we have already secured clients in both health sciences and global food sectors. We have formed a strategic partnership with a major global biopharmaceutical company to outsource the management of its global IT systems and applications and transform them using generative AI and agentic AI.\nOur global collaboration is twofold, driving productivity and efficiency by modernizing IT operations, while upskilling and cross-skilling technology specialists who will transfer to Cognizant. This partnership highlights our growing leadership in AI-led transformation as well as our long-term vision to empower clients through talent development and innovation. Earlier today, we announced a new partnership with WRITER, a leader in agentic AI for the enterprise. This collaboration will bring together a deep industry knowledge with the global scale of Writer's end-to-end enterprise-grade platform to enable organizations to build and deploy AI agents with a focus on highly regulated industries.\nWe recently won new business to deliver third-party administration services for a leading insurance closed book of annuities business. What makes me particularly excited about the strategic agreement is the next-generation AI platform will build to not only modernize the portfolio, but also the opportunity for us to scale this AI platform to other clients in the future. And finally, we delivered key TriZetto milestones in quarter 2.\nIn May, we completed what we believe is the largest TriZetto Facet's cloud migration with a leading North American health care payer. We moved over 10 million member records to a containerized cloud environment, improving scalability and stability and achieving new performance benchmarks. In parallel, TriZetto has advanced its agentic AI strategy with nearly 30 agents now live or in pilot and another 10 IN development. These agents are streamlining workflows across care management, claims, benefits and customer service, cutting onboarding time and improving case handling efficiency.\nThe underlying foundation of the TriZetto agentic AI strategy is the TriZetto AI gateway, which we are pleased to announce will launch next week. Looking ahead, as I have described today and at our Investor Day earlier this year, we are positioning Cognizant for the generative and agentic AI future. in the process, I believe we are building a new opportunity, one defined by agentification at scale with new client spend cycles. We see this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity enabled by a revolutionary technology to reimagine enterprises workplaces and the workforce.\nWe believe we have a bigger total addressable spend than ever before to partner with our clients on their AI journeys. Our 3 core strategic imperatives are unchanged, but I want to shift the aperture on our lens to help you see more holistically the steps we have taken to differentiate ourselves in a rapidly changing market. I believe the AI wave is different from the prior waves. So too is the way Cognizant is responding.\nHistorically, the most successful companies in our industry thrived by sensing technological shifts and incubating economically viable solutions and new capabilities at scale. To capture the AI opportunity, we recognized and have started building a new layer, one that's in addition to the traditional interdisciplinary capabilities. This new layer includes translating our award-winning AI labs work to differentiated AI platforms, small language models and tooling to address accuracy of the models, reasoning layers to help make the technology responsible investments into the evolving agent development life cycles.\nOur pioneering work in context engineering, which is building layers of context, [ tribal ] knowledge, data flows and workflows to create efficient and productive agentic systems is already making waves with our clients on their agentic journeys. From now, I call this new lower IP on the edge, a working description on the evolving transitionary phase of agentic AI. Our IP on the edge progress is very important differentiator in a fragmented and a heterogeneous market of AI builders.\nWe believe our early investments in AI, led by IP on the edges are scaled interdisciplinary capability. Our partnerships are continued focus to diffuse AI efficiently into our product and client services teams have really helped us stay strategic to our clients' AI journeys, which is reflected in our financial, people and client metrics. In closing, we are proud of our Q2 results.\nWe appreciate that long-term success will be determined by our ability to deliver sustainable performance. That said, while the demand environment remains dynamic, we are encouraged by our continued ability to drive large deal momentum and win a growing number of new spend cycles in Vector 2 and Vector 3 agentic opportunities. Now I'm going to turn the call over to Jatin.\n\nJatin Pravinchandra Dalal\n\nCFO, Wipro Limited\n\nThank you, Ravi, and thank you all for joining us. Our second quarter revenue exceeded the high end of our guidance range, once again earning us a place in the winner circle based on peer results reported so far. Our Q2 performance was characterized by sharp operational rigor, disciplined cost management and a productivity-first mindset that helped drive year-over-year margin expansion and EPS growth that outpaced revenue growth.\nThrough the first half of 2025 on a year-over-year basis, we achieved top-tier revenue growth, 40 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and 11% adjusted EPS growth. Now let's turn to the details of the quarter. Second quarter revenue of $5.2 billion grew 7.2% year-over-year in constant currency. Growth was led by strong organic performance in Financial Services and Health Sciences.\nBelcan contributed approximately 400 basis points of inorganic growth. The demand environment was largely unchanged in the quarter. While visibility is still limited, the ramp of large deals more than offset discretionary spending pressure.\nNow let me provide some color by segment and region. All segment and region growth commentary represents year-over-year constant currency growth, unless otherwise stated. Financial Services grew 6% year-over-year and led our organic growth with broad-based demand across sub-industries driven by digital engineering, legacy modernization and vendor consolidation initiatives. These have supported a healthy pace of GenAI productivity-led deals and GCC opportunities across BFSI.\nFor example, earlier this year, we were chosen as a transformation partner by a large North American bank. This multiyear, multi-hundred million dollar deal as the client partnering with Cognizant in driving talent and technology transformation across the bank's banking and insurance units to support its go-to-market and talent strategies at the right cost. While our BFS business continues to build on its strong performance, our insurance business is showing signs of improved growth, supported by strategic engagements with several key insurance clients in North America.\nHealth Sciences grew 5% year-over-year driven by organic growth across payers, providers and life sciences customers. As we noted last quarter, our clients are navigating a rapidly changing environment. We expect the recent passage of the U.S. budget bill and its changes to Medicaid will weigh on near-term discretionary demand from payers and providers. Meanwhile, Life Sciences customers face heightened uncertainty related to the tariffs.\nDespite this uncertainty, we believe our deep domain expertise and strong client relationships position us well as a strategic partner to help health care organizations adapt quickly, unlocking new opportunities for innovations, efficiency and growth. As a great example, one of the mega deals we signed in Q2 was with a large health care client. our proactive approach and compelling value proposition helped us extend our long-standing relationship. We are helping this customer drive productivity and fund innovation by leveraging our deep industry expertise, AI skills and platform investments.\nIn Products and Resources, growth was primarily attributable to Belcan. Although trade policy uncertainty has tempered discretionary spending, we are seeing demand for cost takeout and productivity led engagements, areas where our value proposition remains strong. In retail, consumer goods and travel and hospitality clients are actively investing in GenAI pilots aimed at elevating the customer experience.\nCommunication, Media and Technology returned to organic growth this quarter, led by the technology sector. We are witnessing robust demand from clients aiming to reduce costs and reallocate capital towards R&D and other CapEx investments. Our expanding expertise in GenAI is strengthening our position as a strategic partner in the CMT industry, enabling us to secure significant wins. An example of this is the mega deal we won in the communications sector in Q2.\nThe partnership encompasses both GenAI-driven productivity transformation and a good mix of new business through the contract duration. For our clients, this deal leverages all 3 pillars of our AI strategy, accelerating growth through AI native offerings, enhancing enterprise productivity through AI-driven automation and transforming customer experience with intelligent personalization. By geography, revenue grew across all major regions. North America led with 8% growth, driven by Financial Services and Health Sciences. Continued strength in large deals and disciplined execution enabled us to deliver industry-leading growth again in Q2.\nWe believe we are gaining market share in this region. Europe grew 4%, again driven by growth among life sciences and financial services clients, including public sector. We are pleased with our momentum in the region, supported by new logos and a revamped sales strategy that have led to an improved large deal pipeline.\nRest of the world increased by about 6%, driven by financial services and health sciences from a segment standpoint and by Australia geographically. Now to bookings.\nAs Ravi mentioned, mega deals drove strong bookings this quarter. Second quarter bookings included a balanced mix of new wins and renewals. And trailing 12-month annual contract value, or ACV, increased high single digits year-over-year. This improved backlog, along with our last 12-month book-to-bill of 1.4x support our full year revenue outlook.\nTurning to margins. Second quarter operating margin of 15.6% increased by 40 basis points on an adjusted basis, benefiting from next-gen program savings and operational rigor and the Indian rupee depreciation despite the dilutive impact of Belcan. These improvements were partially offset by increased compensation costs and initial ramp-up costs of large deals.\nNow moving to cash flow and capital allocation. DSO of 83 days increased by 2 days sequentially and by 3 days year-over-year. Second quarter free cash flow was $331 million compared to $183 million a year ago. During the second quarter, we returned $521 million of capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, bringing the first half total to $885 million.\nWe ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $1.8 billion or net cash of $1.2 billion. Before turning to guidance, I will provide a brief overview of the expected impact from recent changes in U.S. tax laws. In July, the U.S. passed a budget bill which, among other provisions, repeal certain requirements to capitalize research and experimental costs. As a result of this change, we expect to incur a onetime noncash tax expenses of approximately $400 million in the third quarter related to a deferred tax asset on our Q2 balance sheet.\nThis amount would have otherwise been available to offset future taxes related to our non-U.S. earnings. On a cash basis, this legislation is expected to reduce our near-term cash taxes and increase our operating cash flow. In 2025, we expect this improvement to be $200 million, therefore, increasing our capital available to return to shareholders.\nNow the details of our forward outlook. For the third quarter of 2025, we expect revenue to grow 3.5% to 5% year-over-year in constant currency. As a reminder, Q3 includes only a partial year-over-year benefit from Belcan acquisition, which closed in August 2024. We expect a little more than 200 basis points of inorganic contribution in the third quarter.\nThe remaining guidance items I will discuss are for full year 2025. We are modestly increasing the midpoint of our revenue range based on our year-to-date performance and improved confidence in the second half. In 2025, we now expect revenue to grow 4% to 6% in constant currency, reflecting a 50 basis point increase at the low end of the range.\nRevenue details in dollars are available in our press release and supplement. We continue to expect full year inorganic contribution of approximately 250 basis points. Our revenue guidance is based on current visibility and considers a range of scenarios that could unfold in the second half of the year. The low end of the range continues to assume further deterioration in the demand environment.\nThe midpoint incorporates an unchanged environment with ongoing discretionary weakness, partially offset by pipeline conversion and the high end assumes an improved demand environment, further supported by our large deal pipeline. Our adjusted operating margin guidance range remains 15.5% to 15.7% or 20 to 40 basis points of expansion. We expect margin expansion will be driven by cost discipline and SG&A leverage.\nIn parallel, we are driving continued operational rigor through AI led automation and pyramid optimization to support gross margin over the medium term. As a reminder, the second half of the year will include margin investments in large deals and [ a merit ] cycle. Due to cash flow benefit from the U.S. budget bill, I discussed earlier, we now expect free cash flow to represent approximately 100% of net income, excluding the onetime noncash charge that will be recorded in the third quarter.\nThis has also allowed us to increase our expected return of capital. For the full year, we plan to return $2 billion to shareholders, an increase of $300 million from last quarter, driven by higher expected share repurchases. In total, we expect to deploy approximately $1.4 billion in repurchases this year. Even with this increase, we maintain flexibility to pursue opportunistic M&A this year. Other than the onetime noncash tax charge I discussed, we don't expect the budget bill to impact our effective tax rate.\nTherefore, our adjusted tax rate guidance which will exclude the onetime charge, is unchanged at 24% to 25%, but is trending towards the lower end of the range based on first half performance. We are increasing our EPS guidance range to $5.08 to $5.22 compared to our prior range of $4.98 to $5.14, reflecting our revised revenue guidance and favorable foreign currency rates.\nThis represents 7% to 10% year-over-year growth. We expect a weighted average dilutive share count of about 489 million versus 491 million previously. With that, we'll open the call for your questions."

[Operator Instructions] Now I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tyler Scott, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nTyler J. Scott\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC\n\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release and investor supplement for the company's fourth quarter and full year 2024 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com.\nThe speakers we have on today's call are Ravi Kumar, Chief Executive Officer; and Jatin Dalal, Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.\nAdditionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.\nWith that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Ravi. Please go ahead.\n\nRavi Kumar Singisetti\n\nPresident, Infosys Limited\n\nThank you, Tyler, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings call.\nI joined Cognizant 2 years ago, drawn by its heritage and unique DNA, along with its extraordinary ability to sense, incubate and scale new technologies for global enterprises, often ahead of peers and clients. We set out to harness the strengths and reclaim our place in the winner's circle. I'm pleased to report solid progress in 2024. We successfully pivoted from stabilization to growth, building momentum throughout the year.\nQ4 marked a high point for year-over-year revenue growth, large deal signings and bookings. Operationally, we completed our NextGen program, delivering savings reflected in our adjusted operating margin and strengthening our ability to make strategic investments and drive profitable growth.\nOur 2024 results reflect the strong execution of our strategic priorities, accelerating growth becoming an employer of choice and modernizing operations. Our North Star remains returning to the winner's circle with top quartile revenue growth while steadily expanding our margins over time.\nLet's take a moment to reflect on 2024, starting with our growth initiatives, which gained momentum through large deals, platform enhancements, new and strengthened partnerships and strategic acquisitions. With respect to platforms, our AI labs made significant advancements with our AI capabilities and offerings in 2024. We introduced Flowsource for full stack engineering. Neuro [ Age ] for real-time AI, Neuro Cybersecurity for AI-enabled proactive defense and Neuro AI Multi-Agent Accelerator for AI agent development. We also added multi-agent orchestration capabilities to our Neuro AI platform, and we debuted our AI-powered Cognizant Moment to help clients reimagine client experiences.\nIn 2024, we expanded our breadth and depth of our global alliances ecosystem, and we added 2 strategic acquisitions to our portfolio, Thirdera and Belcan. Thirdera made us one of ServiceNow's largest partners. And in the first quarter of 2025, ServiceNow elevated us to global elite status, the highest level of partnership recognition within their ecosystem. Belcan significantly strengthens our opportunity in the $190 billion ER&D market. We believe our integration is on track. We recently completed Phase 1 of the integration focused on commercial integration for clients outside of aerospace and defense.\nAnd in the fourth quarter, we signed a multiyear deal valued at several hundred million dollars within aerospace client. Finally, one last note about our efforts to accelerate revenue. Our NPS client satisfaction scores improved to a historic high in 2024.\nTurning to our second strategic priority of becoming an employer of choice. Developing and strengthening our associates is key to our future. We drove AI reskilling at scale, sustained high employee engagement scores and maintained low voluntary attrition. I'm also pleased to share we have 13,000 current employees who have returned to Cognizant.\nThese metrics, combined with our rising NPS scores are evidence of the high correlation between happy employees and happy clients. Our grassroots innovation initiative Bluebolt continues to generate tangible ideas for clients. Our associates doubled the number of ideas in 2024, submitting nearly 240,000, of which 47,000 were implemented by clients. Our Synapse program equipped more than 400,000 people with skills for future work opportunities well on our way to a goal of 1 million workers. Our work in 2024 earned prestigious recognition, including Forbes World's Best Employers, Newsweek's America's Most Reliable Companies and ranking #7 on Fortune's Change the World list.\nTurning to our third strategic priority. We took several steps during the year to simplify and modernize our operations. For example, completing our NextGen cost program helped drive sequential adjusted operating margin performance throughout the year, while supporting our growth investments. We optimized and diversified our infrastructure in part by directing our India expansion into smaller cities in India.\nYou have heard me call AI a double engine of transformation because it offers Cognizant the opportunity to accelerate our own progress as much as it does for clients. We are rapidly applying AI across the organization to strengthen our operating agility, while at the same time, quickly sharing our learnings with clients. We have identified more than 200 internal AI use cases applying AI across 3 major dimensions: associate experience and productivity, enabling business operations and to improve our technology and security landscape. These will remain important priorities in 2025.\nNow let me turn to some highlights from the quarter. We finished the year on a strong note with accelerating momentum as we delivered another quarter of improved year-over-year organic revenue growth and expanded our adjusted operating margin sequentially ahead of our expectations. Revenue was $5.1 billion, up 6.7% year-over-year in constant currency. Performance included the contribution of Belcan and improved organic growth, driven again by our 2 largest segments: Health Sciences and Financial Services. Organic revenue growth was fueled by recently won deals and improved discretionary spending primarily in financial services.\nWe signed 10 large deals in Q4, up from 7 a year ago reflecting strong momentum across service lines and industries, including digital engineering, financial services and cloud services. This brought our large deal totaled to 29 in 2024 compared to 17 in 2023. Health Sciences led with over 10% revenue growth. This included continued strength in TriZetto, our differentiated software platform that is used to process about 2/3 of U.S. health care claims. As a recent example, we entered an agreement in 2024 to enhance health care operations for Blue Shield of California with our TriZetto Facets platform as a service solution. And our Financial Services segment delivered another quarter of year-over-year growth, supported by increased demand for cloud, data and modernization services.\nAdjusted operating margin improved sequentially to 15.7%, driving full year performance that exceeded our expectations while we continue to make investments in AI and M&A. Taking a step back, we believe our expanding Gen AI capabilities are gaining momentum in the marketplace. For example, we now have over 1,200 early Gen AI engagements compared to 1,000 at the end of third quarter.\nWe see demand for AI services expanding across industries as use cases proliferate. This includes predictive analytics for patient outcomes, drug discovery and virtual health assistance in health care, credit scoring and analysis, customer service automation and fraud detection and financial services, predictive maintenance, quality control and supply chain optimization and manufacturing, content personalization and targeted advertising and media, just to name a few.\nAnother great application of our AI capabilities in Stores 360, recently launched for the retail industry with a strategic partner service now. Stores 360 aims to help retailers streamline store operations, enhance employee productivity and improve their customer experience with integrated automated and predictive Gen AI capabilities. We are already seeing early interest and excitement.\nWe also signed a 5-year agreement with Toyota during the quarter to infuse Gen AI across its software development cycles by leveraging hyper-automation, AI and process reengineering. It is a great example of proactive solutioning, allowing us to deliver significant productivity for the customer that can be redeployed to cover new services under an extended contract tenure.\nAnd we renewed our strategic partnership with McDonald's to streamline operations and support its delivery of exceptional customer experiences. Our multiyear agreement aims to transform McDonald's legacy infrastructure into modern cloud-based systems using our Neuro IT operations and Skygrade platforms to improve system observability, reliability and agility.\nLastly, we expanded our partnership with Gilead Sciences, our collaboration will engage our expertise in machine learning and Gen AI with an agentic framework to improve productivity and generate cost savings. Our new agreement accelerates Gilead's digital transformation, allowing Gilead to focus on its core mission of discovering and delivering critical medicines.\nAnd we are also seeing traction with global capability centers, or GCCs. Earlier this year, we were notified that we won a new strategic partnership with a leading insurance provider to establish the GCC in India. We will work to enhance their operational efficiency, accelerate digital transformation and expand their global talent footprint, leveraging our deep expertise in building and scaling GCCs. This partnership reinforces our position as a trusted transformation partner and marks a significant milestone in our continued growth in the GCC space.\nThese are just a few recent examples illustrating how our innovative solutions and strategic partnerships powered by cutting-edge technologies are delivering significant value to our clients in addition to helping accelerate our commercial momentum.\nAs we think about AI-enabled enterprise landscapes, I'm very excited about the role Cognizant can play in reimagining businesses, reshaping operating models, co-creating new products and services and redefining work, workforces and the workplaces of our clients.\nThe recent advances in democratizing foundation models are efficiently diffusing value to the front end of the AI value chain. We can play a big role for our clients and unlocking newer efficiency and innovation value levers. And we think it will be a force multiplier. We believe our industry domain strength in the intersection of design, deep engineering and operations will allow us to stay differentiated and be a front runner as we see a proliferation of AI-led services.\nWe see the AI-enabled opportunity playing out in 3 distinct vectors with the first already here. First, the most mainstream use case of AI is tech for tech or its application in software development cycles with the help of code assist platforms. We have our own developer work bench on the Flowsource platform. In the fourth quarter, we estimated that 20% of our code accepted by our developers was generated by AI, allowing us to do more for less and unleash a wave of hyper productivity. Our belief is with this level of hyper-productivity, there will be an opportunity for partners like us to help clients unlock the estimated trillions of dollars of technical debt, find viable ways to modernize legacy systems and applications automate infrastructure and operations and eliminate the backlog of workloads.\nThe vector 2 opportunity will be about modernizing the data and cloud foundation for integrating AI into enterprise landscapes. We believe this opportunity will require building last-mile infrastructure related to domain-specific cognitive and reasoning frameworks, explainability and traceability, identification and multi-agent orchestration and platforms. It also involves ensuring that AI is used as [ article ] and responsible and the output is optimized for accuracy and costs. Our belief is that this process of identification will drive significant innovation cycles, leading to new AI-enabled products and services work that is being advanced by our AI labs.\nAnd finally, vector 3 is about untapped and newer service pools that we believe will unlock by identification. Our view is that software may no longer be merely a tool for organizing work but can become the worker itself capable of understanding, executing and improving services traditionally delivered by humans.\nWe expect the most transformative applications of AI will be those that collaborate with human teams with the potential to unlock new and previously unimaginable categories of work. We see a future where a system of agents can inject autonomous intelligence into workflows by grasping context, applying reasoning and building a team of experts that each contribute unique knowledge and abilities.\nThis evolution of services-as-a-software, as we call it, is expected to dramatically expand our addressable spend through new access to our clients' expansive business operations budgets rather than the technology budgets alone. Early use case opportunities for many of our clients are to identify horizontal business functions like sales and marketing, human resources functions and customer service as well as vertical functions like clinical operations, retail operations and connected care to name a few.\nI will close by saying that 2024 accomplishments have strengthened Cognizant operationally and strategically by broadening our portfolio while increasing our agility. We believe we are now transitioning from a phase of stabilization to a phase of growth. Our early investments in AI, practical tooling, thought leadership and unique capabilities at the intersection of design, tech-led engineering and operations gives us confidence that we have the right to win in this dynamically changing IT services market. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities ahead and confident that our strategic focus will help us deliver improved revenue growth to get us back to the winner's circle and gradual margin expansion over time.\nBefore I turn to Jatin to review our financials in greater depth, I would like to thank our clients and partners for their trust and our associates worldwide for their steadfast dedication and daily drive to deliver. We look forward to updating you in more detail at our March 25 Investor Day in New York.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jatin.\n\nJatin Pravinchandra Dalal\n\nCFO, Wipro Limited\n\nThank you, Ravi, and thank you all for joining us.\nOur fourth quarter results underscore the progress we have made against our strategic priorities to improve commercial momentum and enhance operational excellence. Fourth quarter revenue of $5.1 billion grew 6.7% year-over-year in constant currency, at the high end of our guidance range. Organic revenue growth was driven by Health Sciences, which grew more than 10% year-over-year; and Financial Services, which grew approximately 3%. Our acquisitions of Thirdera and Belcan have supported our entry into new end markets with attractive long-term growth profiles.\nFourth quarter revenue included approximately 450 basis points of year-over-year growth from these acquisitions. For the full year, revenue of $19.7 billion increased 1.9% year-over-year in constant currency and included approximately 200 basis points of growth from Thirdera and Belcan.\nWe were very pleased with our fourth quarter adjusted operating margin of 15.7%. This performance driven by completion of our NextGen program and our rigorous actions to strengthen operations drove full year adjusted operating margin of 15.3%. This was 20 basis points ahead of our guidance. This also represents 20 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year net of significant investments we have made to accelerate growth, such as Belcan and our AI platforms.\nNow let's turn to the details of the quarter. By segment, Health Sciences saw broad-based strength across payer, provider and life sciences end markets. Clients continue to prioritize cost optimization, cloud migration, and legacy modernization projects, which are helping to more than offset the muted discretionary spending environment. Within Financial Services, growth was balanced with positive trends across capital markets, cards and payments, fintech and commercial banking clients. We saw a further albeit gradual pickup in discretionary spending.\nIn North America, we are seeing an improved pipeline of opportunities for transformation and modernization projects across both insurance and select ADRs of banking and financial services clients. In addition, we have continued to see healthy growth in Canada, driven by the recent new bookings.\nProducts and Resources, or P&R, growth was driven by Belcan. As we noted last quarter, the segment has been pressured by cautious discretionary environment across end markets. This includes automotive, aerospace, manufacturing and logistics, among others.\nWe signed 3 large deals in this segment in the fourth quarter. Despite the near-term pressure, we are excited about the opportunities we see across P&R where the convergence of information technology and operational technology is rapidly accelerating. Communication, Media and Technology performance was consistent with last quarter as clients remain focused on cost optimization and discretionary spending budgets have been pressured.\nFrom a geographic perspective, growth was led by North America, which increased more than 8% year-over-year. Health Sciences, Belkin and Banking and Financial Services all supported the growth. Europe grew by about 1% year-over-year. By segment, strength in Health Sciences and Financial Services were offset by softness in Products and Resources. And finally, Rest of the World increased about 4% year-over-year, this reflected solid growth across most segments.\nNow turning to bookings. Fourth quarter bookings increased 11% year-over-year, driven by large deals. On a trailing 12-month basis, bookings grew 3% year-over-year and represented a 1.4x book-to-bill. Trends in smaller deals improved, which supported a low to mid-single-digit increase in our trailing 12-month annual contract value, both sequentially and year-over-year.\nTurning to expenses. Quarter 4 marked the end of the NextGen program, and we incurred about $49 million of costs related to the program in the quarter. Excluding the impact of these costs, adjusted operating margin was 15.7%, significantly above our expectations. Year-over-year, margin declined by 40 basis points, primarily reflecting the impact of Belcan and increased compensation costs. This was partially offset by savings from NextGen, high utilization and a favorable currency exchange rates. We are pleased to be exiting the year with an improved cost base and more resilient operating model.\nNow moving to cash flow and capital allocation. Fourth quarter free cash flow was $837 million. This brought full year free cash flow to $1.8 billion or 82% of our net income. This is in line with our guidance. As a reminder, free cash flow was negatively impacted by the previously disclosed impact from a $360 million payment made to Indian tax authorities in relation to our ongoing dispute of our 2016 tax matter.\nWe ended the year with cash and short-term investments of $2.2 billion or net cash of $1.3 billion. DSO of 78 days decreased by 3 days from third quarter and increased by 1 day versus the prior year. For the full year, we returned $1.2 billion of capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, including $300 million in the fourth quarter, and we invested $1.6 [ billion ] in 2 strategic acquisitions.\nTurning to our forward outlook now. Before I start, I would like to reiterate that our strategy is built around driving long-term EPS growth through revenue growth and modest operating margin expansion, which we believe will support enduring shareholder value creation. For the first quarter of 2025, we expect revenue to grow 5.6% to 7.1% year-over-year or 6.5% to 8% in constant currency. Sequentially, this represents a range of negative 0.5% to positive 1% growth in constant currency basis. For the full year 2025, we expect revenue to increase 2.6% to 5.1% or 3.5% to 6% in constant currency. Details of revenue in dollars are available in our press release and supplement.\nWe expect Belcan will contribute a little more than 250 basis points of growth in 2025, with a greater contribution in the first half of the year compared with the second half. As a reminder, we closed the acquisition of Belcan at the end of August 2024 and it contributed approximately $300 million to our 2024 revenue. For the full year, we expect adjusted operating margins will be 15.5% to 15.7%. This represents a 20 to 40 basis points of expansion of our strong performance in 2024.\nOver time, we expect our growing adoption of automation and AI to drive better productivity and higher margins. We remind you that in the first quarter, seasonality typically drives a modest sequential margin decline. We expect our full year adjusted tax rate to be between 24% and 25%. Some of you may have noticed that we are no longer providing net interest income guidance. We made this change to align our guidance metrics more closely with the industry.\nFor the full year, we expect our net interest income will decline modestly given lower cash balances exiting the year. This leads to full year 2025 earnings per share guidance of $4.90 to $5.06. This represents 3% to 7% growth compared to our 2024 adjusted EPS. This growth includes more than 2 percentage points of expected headwind from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates impacting reported revenue and other below that line items, including slightly higher tax rate.\nFor the full year, we expect free cash flow will represent more than 90% of the net income.\nIn 2025, we do not expect material changes to our capital allocation strategy. We plan to balance the return of capital to shareholders with inorganic growth investments that strengthen our capabilities and support our growth ambition. For the full year, we expect to return approximately $1.2 billion to shareholders, including about $600 million in share repurchases and remainder towards our regular quarterly dividend. We expect a weighted average dilutive share count of about 493 million for 2025. And during the year, we plan to repay the $300 million outstanding under our credit facility.\nWith that, we will open the call for your questions."

Please go ahead.\n\nRavi Kumar Singisetti\n\nPresident, Infosys Limited\n\nThank you, Tyler, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm pleased with our strong execution and results in what remains a challenging market. We delivered revenue above the high end of our guidance range, expanded our adjusted operating margin, both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, sustained our large deal momentum by signing 5 deals each with a total contract value of $100 million or more, and announced an agreement to acquire Belcan, which is expected to expand our ER&D capabilities while diversifying into the high-growth aerospace and defense sectors.\nAlthough the demand environment remains challenging and clients' discretionary spending behavior is unchanged from recent quarters, we believe these results demonstrate our rigorous execution against the strategic priorities we set forth last year.\nQ2 revenue was $4.85 billion, which was $30 million above the high end of our guidance range and grew 2.1% sequentially in constant currency. This was the highest quarter-over-quarter growth since 2022. With strong execution of our NextGen program and overall cost discipline, we achieved adjusted operating margin of 15.2%, an increase of 10 basis points sequentially and 100 basis points year-over-year. Our trailing 12-month voluntary attrition for tech services was 13.6% compared to nearly 20% in the prior year period.\nSecond quarter bookings grew 5% year-over-year. And on a trailing 12-month basis, bookings were $26.2 billion, representing a 1.4x book-to-bill. In addition to the 5 deals, each with TCV of over $100 million, we signed 2 deals that were above $90 million each. In the first half of this year, we have now signed 13 deals each with TCV of over $100 million, well ahead of our 2023 pace, which included 17 deals of this size for the entire year.\nFrom a segment perspective, we are especially pleased with Financial Services, which grew 5% sequentially in constant currency, driven by growth in the Americas. Within Financial Services, our banking business posted a second consecutive quarter of sequential growth and returned to modest year-over-year growth in constant currency for the first time since Q2 of 2022. We are seeing demand being driven by client investments in hyper personalization, infrastructure and platform modernization.\nOur insurance subsegment also grew sequentially in Q2. And one of the $500 million-plus TCV deals we signed this quarter was with a large American insurance provider. I believe these results reflect our actions to stabilize the BFSI business since last year.\nOver that period, we put new leadership in place and drove greater industry focus on these customer segments. We also aligned our go-to-market approach and launched industry-led service offerings in areas like real-time payment fraud detection, payments hub modernization and digital banking.\nHealth Sciences grew by 3% sequentially in constant currency, and we see a number of positive secular trends. For example, payers and providers remain focused on reducing the cost of care. We believe this is benefiting our TriZetto platform, where we are helping clients manage more than $500 billion in complex claims and improve patient outcomes. TriZetto's end-to-end capabilities are gaining traction as clients see the value of -- in our ability to provide both revenue cycle management and clearing house services. On the payer side, we are seeing demand being driven by data and cloud monetization as our clients seek to deliver a modern, best-in-class consumer experience for their members.\nAnd in Life Sciences, clients have begun moving beyond cost optimization projects to one that accelerates the GenAI digital transformation in R&D and continue to drive enterprise modernization with SAP S/4HANA. By region, we are very pleased with the performance in Americas, where revenue grew 2.8% sequentially and returned to growth year-over-year. I am extremely proud of the progress the team has made, and I'm confident in our opportunities ahead.\nLooking back over the last 18 months, we believe our strategic investments and focus on improving our operational rigor has further strengthened the foundation on which we can drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth. We invested in our leadership team and attracted new talent to the organization. We drove internal process improvements, particularly around large deals and our talent. And we focus sharply on strengthening our relevance with clients through investments in our innovation strategy and platform offerings.\nWe believe these changes are starting to pay off and are reflected in our recent revenue performance and year-over-year operating margin expansion in the first half of this year. We have maintained our focus on becoming an employer of choice in our industry, and we're recognized by the Newsweek as one of America's Greatest Places to Work and Greatest Places for Job Starters.\nWe also continue to expand our footprint in smaller cities in India with the opening of our newest office in Indore, as we remain committed to bringing offices closest to where our employees are.\nAnd I'm pleased with Bluebolt, our grassroots innovation program, which has generated 210,000 ideas by our associates since its inception last year. We're also hearing positive feedback from our customers through our project level Net Promoter Score, which I'm pleased to say has improved consistently since 2021 through the first half of 2024. This quarter marks our highest NPS to date.\nWe have taken a number of actions to date to accelerate growth and drive operational improvements, and we look forward to continuing to update shareholders on our progress.\nTo that end, we plan to provide an investor update in the first half of 2025 to discuss, among other things, our strategy and differentiation of the market, our efforts to create long-term value for our shareholders and other stakeholders. A prime example of our investments in higher growth industries and expanding capabilities is our agreement to acquire Belcan, a leading global supplier of engineering, research and development or ER&D services.\nWe have seen growing demand in ER&D services and estimated $190 billion market whose high growth has been fueled by the convergence of digital technology and the physical world. Over the last 3 years, we have strengthened our ER&D capabilities, starting with our 2021 acquisition of ESG Mobility, a digital automotive ER&D provider for connected autonomous and electric vehicles. And at the start of my term last year, we acquired Mobica, which focuses on IoT embedded software engineering capabilities from the chip to the cloud.\nWe expect the Belcan acquisition to provide an opportunity for us to expand our service offerings into growth vectors that help move the physical world of manufacturing aerospace and automotive into the age of digital data and AI.\nEarlier this week, we introduced the next evolution of our experience practice area called Cognizant Moment, which is a new integrated business within Cognizant that builds on our over 20 years of expertise in digital experience. Cognizant Moment will focus on next-generation experience services that are dynamic, data-led and AI powered, harnessing the content generation and personalization power that Generative AI brings, combined with human ingenuity to help clients innovate to differentiate and grow.\nThe creative and programmatic services life cycle is expected to go through significant transformation in the years ahead. And we see an opportunity to disrupt the status quo agency model as creative content becomes increasingly generated and orchestrated by GenAI-led models.\nMoving on to rational highlights from the quarter. We extended our relationship with Victory Capital to provide IT infrastructure and data analytics support. Over the next 5 years, we aim to provide this client with new service management capabilities, improved service productivity, opportunities for cost savings and the ability for Victory Capital to cost effectively scale in support of business growth.\nAdditionally, we signed an agreement to provide engineering services to Gentherm, the global market leader of innovative thermal management and pneumatic comfort technologies for the automotive industry. Under this agreement, we'll expand our existing services to help develop a next generation of products aimed at elevating customer vehicle experiences.\nOur expertise in firmware development and verification and validation from the Mobica acquisition played a critical role in differentiating our value proposition. We have also seen increased demand for infrastructure-led transformation to cloud boosted in part by our Thirdera business, which we acquired in the first quarter. And our platform investments have helped drive increased Gen-AI adoption. As of this quarter, we have over 200 clients on our AI-led platforms, including Neuro IT operations, Skygrade and Flowsource.\nNow where are we with GenAI? We see one of the biggest opportunities for GenAI as tech for tech, which applies GenAI to our software development cycles. With higher cost of capital in recent times, we believe that the need to do more with less combined with the leveraging of Generative AI with lead companies into an era of hyper productivity. We believe this will fuel the next wave of digital transformation as clients seek to modernize the tech stack and reimagine business workflows with partners like Cognizant.\nIn fact, in recently released a follow-on analysis to our 2023 study with Oxford Economics, 70% of the respondents globally indicated, they're not moving fast with GenAI. And 82% indicated a delay in execution could put them at a disadvantage. We are seeing a desire from our own clients to move more quickly.\nOver the past few quarters, we have become more deeply involved in our clients' GenAI journeys. As of the end of second quarter, we have over 750 early client engagements, up from 450 in Q1. And we have over 600 opportunities in the pipeline compared to 500 last quarter. These early engagements have been across verticals with healthy activity in products and resources along with financial services and health sciences.\nWe're seeing demand across 4 key areas: first, customer and employee experience; second, content summarization; third, content generation; and finally, tech for tech to accelerate innovation and technology development cycles. As an example of our recent work, Cognizant designed and recommended a business and technology architecture for AI development for a multinational accounting and audit services firm. This work define the relevant technologies, infrastructure, skill sets, processes and data required to support AI development across the organization.\nAnd we are building a strong partnership ecosystem to support our GenAI strategy. This quarter, we have selected as an AWS GenAI competency partner, driven by our capabilities in addressing complex industry problems and our expertise in AWS-specific GenAI solutions. And we have signed a strategic collaboration agreement with AWS to bring smart manufacturing solutions powered by GenAI to market and transform manufacturing operations across various industries.\nAs another example, we helped set up the world's largest pharmaceutical companies AWS infrastructure as a part of the GenAI journey. We also automated that clients channeling of desperate data sources into a single vector data store to build the foundation for the GenAI programs.\nIn Health Sciences, we launched a first set of health care large language model solutions and Google Cloud's GenAI technology, including Google's Vertex AI platform and Gemini models. The suite of solutions addressing 4 workflows: marketing operations, call center operations, provider management and contracted. Our aim is to improve health care administrative process and experiences for our clients and their clients.\nWe believe GenAI &A has become a catalyst for clients who are behind in the data modernization or cloud journey, and we're pursuing these projects to help them lay the foundation for enterprise-grade GenAI implementations.\nIn closing, I want to thank our employees around the world for their dedication to our clients and Cognizant. We have been executing well in a challenging macro environment. In the back half of 2024, we'll remain focused on our strategic priorities to drive revenue growth, become the employer of choice in our industry and to simplify our operations.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Jatin.\n\nJatin Pravinchandra Dalal\n\nCFO, Wipro Limited\n\nThank you, Ravi, and thank you all for joining us. Second quarter revenue and operating margin came in above our expectations. Despite customer behavior and discretionary spending trends remaining largely unchanged, strong execution and the ramp-up of large deals supported sequential revenue growth of 2.1% in constant currency. This provides us with revenue exit velocity to Q3 and has allowed us to increase the midpoint of our organic revenue growth guidance for the full year.\nOur cost optimization efforts, including structural actions under the NextGen program helped us deliver adjusted operating margins of 15.2%. This was a modest increase sequentially and 100 basis point increase from the prior year period. We are pleased with the cost savings we have achieved under the program, which allowed us to expand adjusted operating margin while funding growth investments.\nNow let's turn to the details. Second quarter revenue was approximately $4.9 billion, which Ravi mentioned, exceeded the higher end of our guidance range. This represented a decline of 0.7% year-over-year or a decline of 0.5% in constant currency. In constant currency, growth was approximately 50 basis points better than the high end of our guidance range. Year-over-year performance includes approximately 60 basis points of growth from the recent acquisitions.\nQ2 bookings grew 5% year-over-year and were driven by midsized deals. Our trailing 12-month book-to-bill ticked up slightly to 1.4x from 1.3x in Q1. We continue to see a lengthening of contract durations driven by a shift to larger longer-term contracts. This has extended the revenue conversion timing but also provided improved forward visibility.\nAs Ravi mentioned, we were pleased with the improved performance in Financial Services, which grew 5% sequentially. Our Health Sciences business grew over 3% sequentially with solid growth across payer, provider and life sciences customers. Products and Resources revenue was down quarter-over-quarter, and down approximately 4% year-over-year in constant currency. The decline was due to ongoing discretionary spending [indiscernible] among our customers.\nWe have seen demand in areas like grid modernization, and cloud modernization investments among our utility customers. We have also seen pockets of strength in the travel and hospitality sector, led by improved travel demand as well as interest in GenAI power personalization to deliver differentiated guest experiences.\nOur pipeline in products and resources remains healthy and we are excited to close the Belcan acquisition, which we expect will provide new growth opportunities in this segment. Communications, Media & Technology grew year-over-year, again, supported by recently completed acquisitions. We have also continued to benefit from the ramp of new business within comms and media, which has helped offset lower level of discretionary spending among the technology customers.\nBy geography, we were pleased with the growth in North America, driven in part by large [indiscernible] ramping up over the last few quarters. However, other parts of the world, particularly Europe, remained challenged by soft discretionary spending. Despite this, we were also pleased with our return to sequential growth in our Rest of the World region, where we are seeing early progress from recently won large deals and new logos and a healthy pipeline of new opportunities.\nNow moving to margins. NextGen cost savings continue to progress and helped us offset the margin impact of recent large steel rents. During the quarter, we incurred approximately $29 million in costs related to NextGen, which negatively impacted our GAAP operating margin by approximately 60 basis points. Excluding this impact, adjusted operating margin was 15.2%, an increase of 10 basis points sequentially and 100 basis points year-over-year. As a reminder, the prior year period included a 60 basis points benefit from an insurance recovery.\nOur GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 22.7% and adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 23%, reflecting a benefit from the timing of discrete items. Q2 diluted GAAP EPS was $1.14 and Q2 adjusted EPS was $1.17.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.2 billion or net cash of $1.6 billion. DSO of 80 days was up 2 days sequentially and increased 5 days year-over-year driven by our business mix. Free cash flow in Q2 was $183 million, primarily reflecting the seasonality.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $226 million to the shareholders, including $76 million through share repurchases and $150 million through our regular dividend. At the end of Q2, we had $1.6 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization.\nAs of today, other than the expected closing of Belcan, we do not anticipate any material inorganic activity for the remainder of the year as our immediate focus is on closing the Belcan acquisition and its initial integration work. We expect to return approximately $600 million to shareholders in form of share repurchases and dividends in the second half of this year. This is expected to bring total capital return to the shareholders to approximately $1 billion for the full year. These amounts exclude the expected additional share repurchase activity to offset the new shares we plan to issue as part of Belcan acquisition.\nTurning to our forward outlook now. Our updated guidance does not include contribution from Belcan. We plan to update our outlook after the acquisition has closed, which we still expect to occur in the third quarter. There are no changes to the estimated financial impact that we provided at the time of the announcement.\nFor the third quarter, we expect revenue to be flat to up 1.5% year-over-year in constant currency. Sequentially, this implies a growth of 0.7% to 2.2% in constant currency. For the full year, our organic revenue growth outlook has modestly improved. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $19.3 million to $19.5 billion, which is a decline of 0.5% to growth of 1% year-over-year, both as reported and in constant currency.\nOur updated guidance includes approximately 70 basis points of inorganic contribution versus our prior guidance of up to 100 basis points. This reflects the contribution from only our completed transactions. Therefore, at the midpoint, our organic growth outlook has improved by approximately 55 basis points.\nMoving on to adjusted operating margin. We are pleased with our first half performance, and we continue to expect the full year to be in the range of 15.3% to 15.5%. Our guidance includes the expected impact of our merit cycle, which will take effect on August 1. We expect this will be partially offset by the savings from our NextGen program and operational discipline. For the full year, we anticipate net interest income of approximately $80 million, which compares to $60 million previously.\nOur adjusted tax rate guidance of 24% to 25% remains unchanged. Our full year free cash flow guidance is also unchanged, and we continue to expect it will represent 80% of net income. This includes the negative impact from $360 million payment made to Indian tax authorities in the first quarter in relation to our ongoing appeal of our 2016 tax matter.\nOur guidance for shares outstanding is unchanged at approximately $497 million. This leads to our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.62 to $4.70, which reflects a $0.07 increase in the midpoint versus our prior range of $4.50 and $4.68.\nWith that, we will open the call for your questions."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tyler Scott, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nTyler J. Scott\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC\n\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release and the investor supplement for the company's first quarter 2024 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Ravi Kumar, Chief Executive Officer; and Jatin Dalal, Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Additionally, during the call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ravi. Please go ahead.\n\nRavi Kumar Singisetti\n\nPresident, Infosys Limited\n\nThank you, Tyler, and good afternoon, everyone.\nThank you for joining our first quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm pleased to report that during the quarter, we continued to make progress against the strategic priorities I laid out last year while navigating a challenging demand environment. We delivered revenue growth that exceeded the high end of our guidance range and expanded our adjusted operating margin year-over-year. Voluntary attrition improved again, and we ended Q1 with trailing 12-month voluntary attrition for our Technology Services business at 13.1%, representing a decline of 10 percentage points year-over-year. And our NextGen program remains on track as we continue to focus on simplification and operational excellence. As we have all seen in recent earnings results for our peer companies and economic headlines, the demand environment remains uncertain and geopolitical risks continue. These dynamics are shifting near-term client spending priorities from discretionary projects towards projects that will drive near-term cost savings and fund innovation for the future.\nNow moving on to Q1 highlights. We delivered revenue of $4.8 billion, which was sequentially flat and represented a decline of 1% year-over-year, both as reported and in constant currency. We expanded our adjusted operating margin by 50 basis points to 15.1% as we continue to execute our cost optimization strategy and take out structural costs. First year -- first quarter bookings on a trailing 12-month basis were $25.9 billion, an increase of 1% year-over-year.\nWhile there is good sustained traction with our large deals, we saw softness in smaller deals in the range of 0 to $10 million total contract value, reflecting the tight discretionary environment. Our strong deal momentum in the quarter was evidenced by the fact we signed 8 deals each with TCV of $100 million or more compared to only 4 in the prior year period. We've also seen early green shoots in our efforts to diversify our large deals outside of North America. And in quarter 1, two of the 8 greater than $100 million contracts we signed with in the APJ region.\nOn a trailing 12-month basis, our book-to-bill ratio of 1.3x remains strong, which we believe provides a healthy backlog of opportunities to improve revenue performance over the next several quarters. We continue to grow our pipeline for larger deals and make progress against our goal of increasing the value of large deals in our bookings.\nFrom a segment perspective, demand trends were consistent with what we have seen in recent quarters. We saw sequential growth in Health Sciences and Communications, Media and Technology offset by declines in Financial Services and Products & Resources. While financial services has been impacted more meaningfully than other segments by weaker discretionary spending, we did see sequential growth among our banking and financial services clients, which represents about 60% of our Financial Services segment and are encouraged by the opportunities we are seeing in the overall pipeline particularly within our intuitive operations and automation practice area.\nWe see several themes that we believe are helping drive demand for our services. This includes clients' continued investments in developing a modern technology infrastructure related to AI, cloud and digital technologies, data engineering, prioritization of hyper personalization and customer experience projects and the need to deliver innovation. One example of infrastructure modernization this quarter was an agreement we signed with a new client, [ McCormick ] & Company, a global leader in flavor. Over the next 5 years, we will help transform manager's global technology infrastructure, leveraging AI automated tools to enhance McCormick's employee and customer experience while improving productivity and driving financial savings for our clients.\nAnother example of monetization hyper-personalization is our recently announced new strategic alliance with Shopify and Google Cloud. Under this alliance, we will help drive digital transformation and platform modernization, enabling global retailers and brands to unlock business value from generative AI. We believe today's retailers must drive a modernization agenda while investing in innovation to elevate their end users and customers experiences. Earlier this week, we signed a strategic agreement with Telstra, Australia's leading telecom and technology company to elevate their software engineering capabilities and enhance their customers' experience.\nWe believe this is a key strategic win in our APJ market. And we will leverage our AI tools to drive innovation, enable more efficient software engineering and ID operations and decommission legacy systems to improve operational efficiency and support their employee experience by building them a superior engineering experience. And as a fourth example, we extended our long-standing relationship with C&O Financial Group during the quarter.\nUnder this expanded agreement, we will implement cloud and digital technologies to help C&O, deliver more personalized digital and convenient solutions to the customers. We'll also leverage gen AI technologies to help drive efficiencies across infrastructure, applications, enterprise software and engineering services. Our clients' desire and need to drive innovation is apparent in all our client interactions, but funding for that innovation is being impacted by demand uncertainties in our clients' own end markets.\nThe timing of a return in discretionary spending remains unknown, but our thesis remains simple. We plan to be prepared when it returns. But continuing our organic investments in learning and development people, platforms and innovation while supporting those initiatives with inorganic capability enhancing investments. On the client side, data from our project level client feedback process for the first quarter of this year, shows a 39% improvement in our Net Promoter Score regarding our project delivery quality over the last 2 years. We believe this is a result of a self-reinforcing cycle we created through tighter client collaboration since the beginning of 2023. As a testament to our longtime focus on helping clients innovate during the quarter, Fortune magazine recognized Cognizant as one of the America's Most Innovative Companies in 2024.\nOur focus on innovation is reflected in our Blue Board grassroots innovation initiative, which we launched a year ago in April. Blue Board has already generated more than 130,000 ideas from our associates, 23,000 of which have been implemented with clients. Overall, more than 220,000 Cognizant associates have been trained on Blue Board. In addition, Google named Cognizant at Google Cloud 2024 Breakthrough Partner of the Year. This is one of our industry's most distinguished awards. I will elaborate more on Google Cloud in a moment. And just this month, LinkedIn recognized Cognizant as a #3 on its top company's 2024 employer list in India, which is home to more than 250,000 of our valued associates. This repeat recognition is a reminder that our focus on becoming the employer of choice is paying off in the country that is at the heart of Cognizant's success India. These client wins and industry recognitions demonstrate one of our core differentiators, our collaborative innovation. And nowhere else is the demand for innovation higher than in gen AI. To date, we have more than 450 early client engagements in more than 500 additional opportunities in the pipeline. We have seen increased demand for AI services across 4 key areas. First, customer and employee experience as clients seek to deliver improved interactions through hyper-personalization; second, content summarization and insights to empower decision-making; third, content generation; and finally, leveraging gen AI to accelerate innovation and technology development cycles.\nWe continue to see strong interest from clients as they assess proofs of concept and the return on investment of these opportunities. These efforts are supported by our recently launched advanced artificial intelligence lab in San Francisco, where we are investing in state-of-the-art core AI research aimed to position us at the forefront of innovation in our industry. This builds upon our network of AI innovation studios in London, New York, San Francisco, Dallas and Bangaluru. Incidentally, our advanced artificial intelligence lab has already produced 53 AI patents with applications for many more pending. This quarter alone, we had 7 new AI patents approved and granted to us. In quarter 1, we announced a series of new partnerships and co-innovations behind this strategy we announced last year to invest $1 billion in generative AI over 3 years.\nThis includes our collaboration with Microsoft to infuse Gen AI into health care administration. The TriZetto assistant on our Facets platform will leverage Azure open AI service and [ Symantec ] canal to provide access to gen AI within the TriZetto user interface. We are already progressing from proof of concept to the piloting phase and are seeing strong interest from some of our largest health care customers. And last week, we announced another element of our expanded partnership with Microsoft. We plan to leverage Microsoft CoPilot and Cognizant's advisory and digital transformation services to help our employees and enterprise customers operationalize generative AI and realize strategic business transformation benefits from this technology.\nIn addition, as a part of Cognizant Snaps skilling program, Cognizant will train 25,000 developers of the use of Girath Copilot, doubling the number trained on the technology. We are also collaborating with NVIDIA to leverage our deep life sciences and AI domain expertise with NVIDIA's pre-trend industry-specific general AI models offered as a part of [indiscernible]. There -- through this collaboration, we will provide clients access to a suite of model making services, including pretrained models, cutting-edge frameworks and application programming interfaces. That offer clients an accelerated path to train and customized enterprise models using the proprietary data. By leveraging gen AI infused models, clinical researchers can rapidly sift through extensive data sets, more accurately predict interactions between drug compounds and create a new viable drug development pathways.\nWe also expanded our partnership with Google Cloud will adopt Gemini for Google Cloud in two ways: first, by training Cognizant associates to use Gemini for software development assistance; and second, by integrating Gemini's advanced capabilities within Cognizant's internal operations and platforms. Using Gemini for Google Cloud, Cognizant's developers will be equipped to write, test and deploy code faster and more effectively with the help of AI powered tools, improving the reliability and cost efficiency of building and managing client applications.\nOver the next 12 months, Cognizant expects to upskill more than 70,000 cross-functional associates on Google Cloud's AI offerings. This is another milestone in our [indiscernible] initiative to upscale 1 million individuals globally by 2026. Additionally, Cognizant will work to integrate Gemini into its suite of automated platforms and accelerators beginning with the recently announced Cognizant flow source platform for developers. As a part of our social responsibility platform, we recently announced that since 2018, we have awarded $70 million in philanthropic funds to global skilling programs for underrepresented communities.\nThese 117 grants combined Cognizant's culture of continuous scaling our focus on prioritization of empowering diversity through technology and the philosophy that AI and other advanced technologies can be a great equalizer for the future of work. We intend to continue following and participating in the AI innovation cycles by investing in last mile platform infrastructure productivity studies and capabilities to enable better and faster integration into enterprise landscapes.\nIn the last 12 months, our AI platforms gained significant traction as we onboarded clients on the neuro sky grade and flow source platforms to cover various phases of AI deployment cycles, by investing in productivity studies, which dissect the anatomy of skills and occupations and map the AI exposure goes to different roles, we have assisted our clients in realizing value and driving the scaled embrace of newer AI use cases.\nAs we continue to navigate this ongoing soft demand environment, we remain focused on investing in areas to help our clients reduce total cost of ownership, boost productivity, enhanced technology intensity and enable better adoption of new age technologies like AI to capture the current demand and be prepared for the future. And we remain differentiated by investing in industry remain capabilities and platforms in select industries. We also believe inorganic opportunities remain an important element of our investment strategy.\nWe continue to seek to expand and deepen capabilities, diversify our business, including into industries where we are underexposed and improve our geographic mix. For example, we are pleased with the early traction of our Q1 acquisition of [indiscernible] and industry-leading ServiceNow platform, which has significantly expanded our capabilities and credentials. We already see a healthy pipeline of opportunities as direct result of this acquisition to cross-sell within our existing client base.\nIn closing, I want to thank our 345,000 employees around the world for their dedication to our clients and Cognizant. In 2024, we will keep working to increase our revenue growth, become the employer of choice in our industry and to simplify our operations. Jatin, over to you.\n\nJatin Pravinchandra Dalal\n\nCFO, Wipro Limited\n\nThank you, Ravi, and thank you all for joining us.\nAs I enter my sixth month as Cognizant's CFO, I remain deeply impressed by the culture, passion and client [indiscernible] across the organization. I am pleased with our execution in the first quarter in what remains a tough economic environment. Revenue exited the high end of our guidance range, supported by our Communications, Media and Technology segments. The sequential growth of our Healthcare segment was also hardening. Strong execution on our NextGen program and disciplined cost optimization actions allowed us to deliver a 15.1% adjusted operating margin representing 50 basis points of expansion year-on-year.\nLooking ahead, I am focused on several objectives in support of our broader strategic priorities. First, continue to strengthen our partnerships and collaborations across the organization to improve revenue growth; second, improve our margin profile through our NextGen cost programs and process enhancements, driven in part by leveraging AI tools.\nNext, continue to invest in our people with a focus on supporting our company-wide employee skilling programs designed to train our employees on the latest technology, including gen AI. And finally, drive disciplined execution with a focus on maximizing value creation from our M&A investments and improving our large sales risk management framework.\nFirst quarter revenue was $4.8 billion, representing a decline of 1.1% year-over-year or a decline of 1.2% in constant currency. Year-over-year performance includes approximately 70 basis points of growth from recent acquisitions. On a sequential basis, revenue was flat from the prior quarter. Across global industry segments and geographies, we have seen the uncertain economic outlook and volatile geopolitical environment weigh on our client spending priorities, which has kept their discretionary spend muted. These headwinds are more pronounced in financial services, which is more susceptible to higher interest rates. Health Sciences customers are also being impacted by the inflationary environment and industry-specific headwinds.\nAt the same time, clients continue to prioritize spending that can deliver cost savings quickly and continue to fund investments in transformation and innovation. For example, within our Products and Resources segment, we have seen resiliency among utility customers where grid modernization remains a critical priority. This has been further supported by our 2022 acquisitions of Utegration, which helps drive SAP S/4 cloud opportunities with the utilities customers. In addition, we have seen positive trends amongst automotive customers in area like software-defined vehicles and in our Products and Resources segment where the convergence of IT and operational technology is driving transformation and digitization priorities.\nFinally, we were pleased with the performance of our Communications, Media and Technology segment, which grew year-over-year, driven by contribution of recently completed acquisitions and wins with the communications and media customers.\nThis has helped offset discretionary spending pressure among our technology customers, which we believe have been impacted by clients focused on reducing costs.\nNow moving on to margins. Our next-gen optimization program has progressed well in helping us drive structural cost savings and simplification of our operations. During the quarter, we incurred approximately $23 million of costs related to this program. This negatively impacted our GAAP operating margin by approximately 50 basis points. Excluding this impact, adjusted operating margin was 15.1%, which benefited from savings related to our NextGen program and the depreciation of the Indian rupee.\nBoth our GAAP and adjusted tax rate in the quarter were 24.8%. Q1 diluted GAAP EPS was $1.10 and Q1 adjusted EPS was $1.12. Now turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. DSO of 78 days was up 1 day sequentially and increased 5 days year-over-year, primarily driven by our business mix. Free cash flow in Q1 was $16 million and included the impact of previously disclosed $360 million payments made to Indian tax authorities as well as the payout of bonuses that were accrued last year.\nAs a reminder, the tax payment to the Indian tax authority was required to proceed with the appeals process relating to our 2016 tax matter. The appeal is ongoing and final amounts refunded to Cognizant or due to tax authorities will be determined at the end of the process. We also returned $284 million to shareholders, including $133 million through share repurchases and $151 million through our regular [ dividends ]. In addition, we completed our acquisition of Third Era in January for a total consideration net of cash acquired of approximately $420 million. These factors drove quarter end cash and short-term investments of $2.2 billion or net cash of $1.6 billion.\nIn 2024, we continue to expect to return over $1 billion to our shareholders, including at least $400 million through share repurchases and $600 million through regular dividends. We will also continue to evaluate inorganic strategic investment opportunities to help accelerate our growth profile, expand our capabilities and diversify our portfolio. Now let me speak about the forward outlook. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be flat to growth of 1.5% sequentially, in constant currency.\nYear-over-year, this implies a decline of 2.5% to a decline of 1% in constant currency. On a reported basis, this translates to a revenue of $4.75 billion to $4.82 billion, representing a year-over-year decline of 2.9% to a decline of 1.4%. For the full year, we continue to expect a revenue decline of 2% to a growth of 2% in constant currency. On a reported basis, this translates to revenue in range of $18.9 billion to $19.7 billion and a decline of 2.2% to a growth of 1.8%, reflecting our latest exchange assumptions. The guidance we are providing of today assumes up to 100 basis points inorganic contribution. We see an active pipeline of acquisition opportunities, and we continue to evaluate assets for the right capabilities to support our strategic priorities. Our NextGen program remains on track, and there are no changes to our assumptions regarding the program. We still intend to reinvest the majority of NextGen savings in our growth opportunities in 2024 and beyond.\nMoving on to adjusted operating margin. We are pleased with our Q1 performance and we continue to expect the full year to be in the range of 15.3% to 15.5%. For Q2, we expect adjusted operating margin will be in a narrow range around Q1's number with NextGen cost savings and improved utilization being offset by initial negative impact from the ramp of large deals and the revenue mix. I am pleased with our sequential improvement in utilization during the quarter, and we are sharply focused on driving further improvements to support margins next quarter.\nFor the full year, we anticipate net interest income of approximately $60 million, which compares to $40 million previously, primarily reflecting updated interest rate and cash balances assumptions. Our adjusted tax rate guidance of 24% to 25% remains unchanged. Our full year free cash flow guidance is also unchanged, and we continue to do exist will represent 80% of our net income.\nThis includes the previously discussed negative impact of $360 million payment made with Indian tax authorities in relation to our ongoing appeal of our [ 2006 ] tax method. Our guidance for shares outstanding is unchanged at approximately $497 million. This leads to our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.50 to $4.68, unchanged from our previous guidance. With that, we'll open the call for your questions."

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tyler Scott, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nTyler Scott\n\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release and the investor supplement for the company's fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Ravi Kumar, Chief Executive Officer; and Jatin Dalal, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.\nAdditionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate, to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.\nWith that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Ravi. Please go ahead.\n\nRavi Kumar Singisetti\n\nPresident, Infosys Limited\n\nThank you, Tyler, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to cover three topics. Cognizant's fourth quarter and full year results, an assessment of our progress in 2023 and a look ahead to our focus and outlook for 2024. I've been in the CEO role now for a full year and have used this 12 months to dig into the company's client relationships, operations, services portfolio, market environment, finances and culture. I've met with about 400 clients and established a regular cadence of listening to and speaking with our employees across the world.\nMy full year immersion into everything, Cognizant has confirmed my belief in the high level of initiative and motivation of nearly 350,000 employees as well as my belief in the company's distinctive core strengths. I have confidence in our potential to increase our revenue growth, and I'll have more to say about this in a few minutes.\nLet's start with the fourth quarter where we delivered on our commitments while continuing to implement our cost management program. To call out three highlights. First, we executed well, delivering revenue within our guidance range despite ongoing macroeconomic pressures and meaningfully exceeded our adjusted operating margin expectations. Second, we made further progress on our goal to increase the percentage of large deals, new clients and business in the overall mix. And third, we saw continued improvement in our voluntary attrition. Q4 revenue of $4.8 billion was in line with the guidance range we provided last quarter. Year-over-year, Q4 revenue was down 1.7% as reported or down 2.4% in constant currency. The quarter developed much as we expected as clients remain cautious and limited the discretionary spending.\nOur Q4 adjusted operating margin of 16.1% was meaningfully stronger than we anticipated. Driven by savings from our next-gen cost management program and better execution on our operational efficiencies. We sustained our large deal momentum in the quarter, winning 7 deals exceeding $100 million each. Of these 7 deals, 2 were new business and 5 were a mix of renewals and expansions. I am especially pleased to see our continued decline in employee attrition, trailing 12-month voluntary attrition for our tech services business declined to 13.8%, that is down 2.4 percentage points sequentially and down 12 points year-over-year.\nTurning to the full year. Revenue of $19.4 billion was down slightly from the prior year and in line with the guidance we set on our Q3 call. A strong Q4 margin performance enabled us to achieve a full year adjusted operating margin of 15.1% compared with a guidance of approximately 14.7%. We ended Q4 with a trailing 12 months booking growth of $26.3 billion, up 9% year-over-year, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.4x. For 2023, about 30% of our TCV exceeded 50 billion-plus deals, compared with approximately 20% in the previous year. We signed 17 deals that exceeded $100 million TCV, $100 million TCV. Total TCV for deals above $100 million increased 42% year-over-year. Several factors contributed to this progress. We have reoriented our teams to large deal demand generation and execution across all service lines.\nWe have strengthened our ability to see, shape and sell large deals. And we have made progress in industrializing delivery with automation and productivity tools to create repeatable solutions and enable a consistent and efficient delivery operating model for large deals.\nTurning to our business segments where Jatin will cover our financial performance, I want to comment on our two largest segments. In financial services, while responding to a demand environment that remains challenging. We are increasing our efforts to stimulate growth. We've installed new leaders in a number of key positions across the segment. We have invested in consulting and commercial resources and targets of industries and in partner relationships. We are also focused on expanding our service offerings and on enhancing our industry solutions powered by new technologies like Generative AI. In Health Sciences, as the healthcare industry continues to undergo major transformation, we believe Cognizant is well positioned to become the nucleus of an emerging healthcare ecosystem through our platform's data and solutions.\nWith these dynamics in mind, we are investing in the expansion of our TriZetto platform and our healthcare BPaaS solution capabilities. We are also capitalizing on the opportunity Gen AI presents to the healthcare market. For instance, LLM can be used to streamline payer administrative processes, automate clinical documentation and enhance clinical decision support systems. I remain confident in the value of our health sciences portfolio provides to clients. For example, Fortrea recently chose Cognizant as its technology transformation partner to deploy a modern secure digital ecosystem to help bring treatments to patients faster while strengthening its position in the life sciences industry. And Takeda, a global biopharma company with whom we have had a long relationship has selected us to help modernize their infrastructure and application management in support of the digital transformation.\nNow let's turn to an assessment of how we move the company forward in 2023. To begin, we made considerable progress enhancing three core strengths that taken together, I believe, Cognizant set apart in the market. First, industry expertise. In 2023, we further deepened our expertise at the intersection of technology and industry use cases to deliver industry-specific solutions in service of business outcomes. We also enhanced our collaboration and co-creation with clients and the broader partner ecosystem to stitch together industry-leading capabilities. A good example is our strategic partnership with ServiceNow to advance the adoption of AI-driven automation across industries.\nWe are also collaborating with ServiceNow to enhance Cognizant's worth next modern workplace services solution with Generative AI. WorkNEXT aims to provide more intuitive and personalized experiences for employees while helping to better quantify and improve the return on experience for enterprise customers. Its second core strength, we are collaborative partners to our clients. As mentioned on our Q3 call, our annual client Net Promoter Score survey hit a historic high for Cognizant last year. An empathy for clients as a part of our DNA, and we believe we have become even better at listening carefully to learning from and working with clients to earn their trust, solve their problems and help them succeed.\nThird, we are passionate innovators. Last April, we launched Cognizant's BlueBolt grassroots innovation program, calling on all our employees to help us solve client problems, look for unmet or latent client needs and challenge this status quo. In just 9 months, our employees generated more than 100,000 ideas, 21,000 of which we have already implemented. We expect to augment our BlueBolt program through a new collaboration with Microsoft to launch the innovation assistant a Generative AI-powered tool built on Azure OpenAI service. Shortly after my arrival, we consolidated our performance objectives, the way we measure success suggest three long strategic priorities, long-term strategic priorities become the employer of choice in our industry, accelerate revenue growth and simplify our operations.\nI'll touch on our progress beginning with employer of choice. Our voluntary attrition improved throughout 2023 to multiyear lows, while our employee engagement scores improved. To capitalize cognizance entrepreneur spirit, we have given greater autonomy and accountability to business unit leaders. This is helping increase our responsiveness to client needs and market conditions. We remain committed to providing our teams with continuous learning upskilling and professional development. In 2023, 90% of our global workforce spent time in learning with 270,000 of our employees acquiring at least one new skill of proficiency and 88,000 completing AI and Generative AI courses. We've also established programs to provide more opportunities for employees to advance their careers.\nI'm pleased to say we promoted nearly 30,000 people across the company last year. Later this month, we'll bring together our entire employee population and gatherings physical and virtual to recognize excellence across the business with Cognizant's company-wide awards program, The Impact Awards. Late last year, we introduced an initiative called Shakti that unify our women-centric programs to further advance carriers and boost women leadership and technology. Shakti and compass Cognizant's leadership development programs for a senior level women globally and for a mid-level woman in India, along with our paid up skilling program for women returning to work after a career break.\nOur second performance objective is to accelerate revenue growth. We've invested heavily in platform-centric approaches to further differentiate Cognizant and select industries. I've talked about our core platform such as TriZetto and healthcare shared investigators in Life Sciences and asset performance and smart manufacturing, to name a few. Last year, we also began industrializing solutions for the next wave of technologies with our AI portfolio. We introduced Cognizant Neuro IT operations, our AI-led platform built to reduce the complexity and cost of enterprise infrastructure. We launched Cognizant Skygrade cloud orchestration platform designed to help clients to rapidly transition to modern cloud-native architectures.\nIn addition, we introduced Cognizant Neuro AI developed to speed clients' adoption of Generative AI. With Neuro AI, we are able to quickly build AI enablement use cases for clients that are specific to their businesses. And just last week, we expanded our Gen AI portfolio with the introduction of Cognizant flow source, developed to help engineering teams deliver high-quality core faster with increased control and transparency.\nToday, we have over 250 early engagements that incorporate the use of Generative AI. Some examples are creating a virtual code for a diabetic patient for a pharma company predicting the size of target audiences for a TV network, conducting sentiment analysis and summarization of user comments for a large bank, developing a field services expert adviser for a manufacturer, enabling conversational intelligence for an insurance call center and auto generating a sales pitch for a tech company. We have another 350 plus opportunities in our pipeline that we are planning to scale.\nWe aim to infuse AI not only into our core offerings, but into everything we do, including using Generative AI to create industry and functional services. It's worth mentioning that one of our integrated practices, intuitive operations and automation, which helps clients build and run modern operations crossed $2.5 billion of revenue in 2023. Our tech-driven modern BPO and automation services helps clients achieve higher levels of productivity and read benefits of Generative AI in the core processes.\nWe strive to stay tuned to market shifts which is why last month, we acquired Thirdera and elate ServiceNow partner that specializes in solutions for the ServiceNow platform. Adding Thirdera brings an on and near-shore global presence to own ServiceNow business group. With Thirdera, will continue to advance the efforts of our strategic partnership with ServiceNow to build a $1 billion combined business focused on AI-driven automation. Our third performance objective is to simplify our business. We executed well on our next-gen program, which is aimed at simplifying our operating model, optimizing corporate functions and consolidating and realigning workspace to reflect the post-pandemic work environment.\nOur cost management enabled us to achieve a 2023 adjusted operating margin performance that exceeded our expectations from earlier in the year. Simplifying our business goes beyond structurally reducing costs. It also helps us become more agile and proactive and innovative. Last year, we further streamlined our operating model and what we -- what was a complex metric structure to focus primarily on our markets and integrated service lines. We are moving towards fewer layers in the organization, which we believe will bring us closer to our clients and associates help drive strong coordination across the company and further empower account teams to make decisions.\nIn summary, 2023 was a year of strengthening our company's fundamentals. Now let's look at -- look to our focus in 2024. We have selected 6 strategic imperatives that will help further sharpen our differentiation across clients' primary needs while strengthening our ability to achieve our performance objectives. These imperatives are to grow in select industries, expand internationally, build large deal capabilities, capture the AI opportunity deliver our talent strategy and implement our IT road map. In the interest of time, I'll focus on only one of those initiatives, which is capturing the substantial AI opportunity.\nAlthough consumer use of Generative AI is starting to explore, enterprise use cases have been ramping slowly. That said, we expect the pace of enterprise adoption to pick up soon and believe that after a slow takeoff movement up the S-curve will accelerate sharply. The results we have seen from initial Gen AI proof of concepts are very increasing. We believe system integrators like Cognizant will play a major role in managing, governing and optimizing Generative AI initiatives at scale. This includes building accuracy in output, reducing hallucinations, continued reinforced learning and testing in incorporating transparency and accountability and iteratively driving performance optimization.\nTherefore, as mentioned on our prior calls, we expect to invest approximately $1 billion in our Generative AI capabilities over the next 3 years, spanning people, platforms, partnerships and M&A. We believe generative AI is becoming a driving force for the economy and society in partnership with Oxford Economics. Cognizant developed and published a new economy compacity ahead of last month's World Economic Forum that predicts Generative AI could inject up to $1 trillion into the U.S. economy over 10 years. Our research also predicts that 90% of the jobs will be disrupted in some way by this technology. From 2023 to 2032, the percent of jobs with high exposure scores, meaning the degree to which an occupation will be affected by Generative AI could increase from 8% to 52%, setting the stage for a profound shift in how we approach work productivity and economic growth.\nOne last topic to cover, and that's the demand environment. We see little change from the assessment we have provided in recent quarters about uncertain and weak discretionary spending in the early part of 2024. Given the clients are experiencing a period that has bought both change and uncertainty together, we expect them to continue to focus on reducing costs, consolidating vendors modernizing their data and processes and increasing the productivity so that they can apply savings to AI-led transformation.\nOn a closing note, we celebrated our 30th anniversary just last month. we have stood the test of time, and we are determined to sustain and extend the momentum we have created last year. As optimistic as I was about our company's future when I joined last January, I'm doubly so now. whatever the future may hold, I believe we are in a significantly strong position today than we were one year ago to seize the market opportunity ahead.\nNow it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Jatin, who joined us on December 4 for his initial observations about Cognizant and additional details on the quarter.\n\nJatin Pravinchandra Dalal\n\nCFO, Wipro Limited\n\nThank you, Ravi, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very excited to join Cognizant and would like to thank the entire organization for such a warm welcome. I would also like to thank Jan for helping me in making the onboarding experience seamless. I have always admired Cognizant's growth mindset, client centricity and the entrepreneurial culture. While it has only been 2 months since I joined the energy and passion across the organization are apparent. I have also had the opportunity to participate in our global sales kickoff events in January. This has further strengthened my conviction in Cognizant's capability and our market opportunity.\nI'm excited to partner with Ravi and the entire leadership team to build on the progress we have made in 2023 as we strive to reach our full growth potential. In doing so, I believe there is a tremendous opportunity to create long-term sustainable value for our associates, clients and shareholders.\nWith that, let's turn to our fourth quarter and full year revenue results. Fourth quarter revenue was $4.8 billion, representing a decline of 1.7% year-over-year or a decline of 2.4% in constant currency. Year-over-year performance includes approximately 90 basis points of growth from our acquisitions. This led to full year revenue of $19.4 billion, which declined 0.4% year-over-year or 0.3% in constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 110 basis points of growth from acquisitions. Ravi discussed Financial Services and Health Services, which declined 6.6% and 2.7% year-over-year in constant currency, respectively.\nSo I will quickly comment on our other 2 segments. Products and Resources revenue was roughly flat year-over-year in constant currency, which included contribution from recently completed acquisitions and the ramp of new business. This helped offset the macro-driven discretionary spending pressure. We saw relatively better performance in North America, particularly among auto, utility and travel and hospitality clients. Communication, media and technology revenue increased 2% in constant currency. The growth reflected the benefit from recently completed acquisitions and the ramp of new bookings.\nNow moving on to margins. During the quarter, we incurred approximately $40 million of costs related to our NextGen program. This negatively impacted our GAAP operating margin by approximately 90 basis points. Excluding this impact, adjusted operating margin was 16.1%. Year-over-year, margin included savings from our NextGen program and tailwinds from the depreciation of the Indian rupee. This helped partially offset increased compensation costs. As a reminder, the prior year period also included a negative impact from a noncash impairment charge related to a health sciences customer. Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 26%, adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 25.4%. Q4 diluted GAAP EPS was 1.11, which is $1.11 and Q4 adjusted EPS was $1.18.\nNow we turn to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.6 billion or net cash of $2 billion. DSO of 77 days was flat sequentially and increased 3 days year-over-year, driven by our business mix. Free cash flow in Q4 was $659 million which brings full year 2023 free cash flow to $2 billion or approximately 95% of the net income. This was slightly ahead of our expectations. During the quarter, we repurchased over 4 million shares for $313 million and returned $146 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. For the full year, we returned about $1.7 billion to shareholders, including $1.1 billion through share repurchases and $591 million through our regular dividend. As of December 31, we had $1.8 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization.\nTurning to our forward outlook. For the first quarter, we expect revenue in the range of 4.68 million to $4.76 billion, representing a year-over-year decline of 2.7% to 1.2% or a decline of 3% to 1.5% in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a positive impact of approximately 30 basis points. For the full year, we expect revenue to be in the range of $19 billion to $19.8 billion, which is a decline of 1.8% to growth of 2.2% year-over-year or a decline of 2% to growth of 2% in constant currency. Inorganic contribution is expected to be up to 100 basis points, and we anticipate approximately 20 basis points positive impact for the year from the currency. Our NextGen program remained on track this quarter, and we still expect to incur total cost of approximately $300 million. This includes $229 million incurred in 2023 and our expectation for an additional $70 million in 2024. There are no changes to our savings assumption from NextGen, and we still intend to reinvest the majority of the savings in the growth opportunity in 2024 and beyond.\nMoving on to adjusted margins. We are pleased with the strong finish to 2023, which allowed us to deliver a full year adjusted operating margin of 15.1% versus our guidance of 14.7%. In 2024, we continue to expect 20 to 40 basis points of operating margin expansion. This represents an adjusted operating margin range of 15.3% to 15.5%. We remain focused on driving further efficiency in our business model through improved utilization, increased operational discipline and automation of tools and processes. We are also introducing guidance for net interest income versus our prior practice of providing gross interest income.\nFor the full year, we anticipate net interest income of approximately $40 million. Our expectations for the full year adjusted tax rate is 24% to 25%. For the full year, we expect free cash flow will represent about 80% of net income. This includes an anticipated negative impact of approximately $360 million because of a ruling on January 8 in India relating to a previously disclosed 2016 tax matter in connection with share repurchase transactions undertaken by our Indian subsidiary. The ruling required Cognizant to deposit the funds with India tax authorities to proceed with our appeals process. The funds deposited with tax authority were previously held in bank deposits under Lean. And as of December 31 were presented on our balance sheet under long-term investments.\nThe outflow will negatively impact our operating cash flow, but will not impact the cash and cash equivalent amounts on the balance sheet, and therefore, we do not anticipate any impact to our capital allocation priorities. Final amounts refunded to Cognizant or due to tax authorities will be determined at the end of the appeals process. We continue to believe that we have complied with all tax regulations applicable to this matter in accordance with the law and intend to vigorously defend our position.\nMoving on to capital allocation. We expect to return over $1 billion to shareholders in 2024, including at least $400 million through share repurchases and $600 million through regular dividends. We will also continue to pursue acquisition opportunities aligned with our strategy. For the full year, we, therefore, expect to deploy more than 100% of free cash flow given the negative impact of the free cash flow from aforementioned additional deposit with the India tax authorities. Based on our anticipated share repurchases, our guidance for shares outstanding is approximately $497 million. This leads to our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.5 to $4.68. With that, we'll be open to take the questions."

[Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tyler Scott, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nTyler Scott\n\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release and investor supplement for the company's third quarter 2023 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Ravi Kumar, Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Sigman, Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Ravi. Please go ahead.\n\nRavi Kumar Singisetti\n\nPresident, Infosys Limited\n\nThank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to cover 3 topics: our third quarter results, the demand environment and a brief update on our strategic priorities.\nWe are pleased with the company's continued progress in the third quarter, during which clients remained cautious amid economic uncertainty and discretionary spend was under pressure. Q3 revenue came in at $4.9 billion, within our guidance range. We saw sequential revenue growth of 20 basis points year-over-year revenue grew 0.8% as reported or a modest decline of 20 basis points in constant currency.\nOur adjusted operating margin of 15.5% exceeded our expectations, mostly reflecting savings from our next generation program, which remains on track as well as from our operational discipline and the timing of spend on investment opportunities. We recorded another quarter of bookings growth, up approximately 9% year-over-year. We ended Q3 with a record trailing 12-month bookings growth of $26.9 billion, up 16% year-over-year and a strong book-to-bill of 1.4x. We have sustained our large deal momentum through Q3. Approximately 30% of our in-quarter Q3 bookings were large deals and 3 of these deals exceeded $100 million each. I believe we are getting progressively better at building a creative deal generation engine and solutioning large deals.\nI am especially encouraged to see our continued decline in attrition. Trailing 12-month voluntary attrition for our tech services business declined to 16.2%, down about 4 percentage points sequentially and down 13 points year-over-year. This decline in attrition was a positive factor in our just completed annual client Net Promoter Score survey, which showed significant improvement year-over-year and hit a historic high for Cognizant. Clients let us know that leadership, account management and delivery are especially important to them. And the survey results show that in these areas, we're doing a great job. This assessment of our clients perceive Cognizant underscores the interdependence of the employee and client experience that gives us confidence that the changes we are making will help strengthen the portfolio over the long run.\nWhile Jan will cover our performance at a business segment level, I want to offer a quick word about financial services. We continue to reposition our Financial Services segment while responding to an increasingly challenged demand environment. One of the ways we are striving to reinvigorate growth is through a sharply focused subindustry go-to-market approach in the Americas. Directed by highly experienced leaders, we believe this change will increase our agility and deepen our domain expertise.\nLet's turn to the demand environment and what I'm hearing from clients. Clients remain focused on efficiency initiatives to reduce costs and consolidate providers as they increase their productivity and resilience and we are helping them do so. This should, in turn, enable them to underwrite their continuing investment in digital transformation. For example, during the quarter, we expanded our relationship with Lineage, a global leader in temperature-controlled logistics to help build an industry-leading operating platform and establish a plan to support their operations through automation and infrastructure management. We also established a new multiyear relationship with Swedish firm, Interim. We expect to provide end-to-end digital integration and core modernization services for their credit management technology platform.\nTo dive deeper into clients' long-term objectives and discover new ways to strengthen our partnership with them, Cognizant held a 2-day Discovery Summit last month for about 130 of our North America clients, our first large-scale client gathering in more than 4 years. We discussed the transformative power of generative AI and how we believe it can reshape every industry. We showed clients how to apply generative AI to create more connected, collaborative and responsive relationships with their customers. We also ran live use cases at Cognizant's new AI platform showing generative AI working alongside legacy data and machine learning models to rapidly create end-to-end AI use cases to tackle client KPIs.\nAs mentioned last quarter, we expect to invest approximately $1 billion in our generative AI capabilities over the next 3 years, focusing on areas such as platform modernization infrastructure, recruiting and upskilling. To that end, we opened a dedicated AI innovation studio in London. And later this year, we expect to open AI studios in New York, Dallas and Bangalore. We have trained about 55,000 of our employees in generative AI this year and have an additional 40,000 employees from all levels of a company registered in pursuing training on Gen AI.\nWe have also invested in AI partnerships and experimental infrastructure to support early client engagements. We believe clients will depend on partners like Cognizant to generate significant productivity gains through automated AI-powered platforms for design, engineering and operations. This shift in client behavior further validates a recently refined strategy, which is aimed at strengthening Cognizant's differentiation to help drive growth. Our strategy is focused on 3 imperatives. First, we are resolved to be an industry-led creating value for clients by integrating technology with industry use cases to drive business outcomes.\nWe are embedding industry expertise across our value chain and select industries. We are developing more enterprise scale platforms designed for industry and operational use cases. Partnerships have a major role to play here. We are focused on expanding our partner ecosystem across a range of technology providers. Among them, hyperscalers, cloud providers, enterprise software companies, digital software enterprises and emerging startups. We believe this partner ecosystem will enable us to enhance our integrated offering by combining third-party products with our service solutions, helping to deliver enterprise-wide digital transformation. We believe this strategy as a full stack provider opens new and significant managed services opportunities.\nSecond, given today's more heterogeneous technology landscape and the desire of many clients to build their own technology muscle, we focus on operating a highly flexible business model to meet clients where they are in their digital transformation journeys. We can support them across a range of project types, whether that's structured deals, traditional managed services, build up trade transfer, co-innovation partner solutions or large technology transformations. And to help clients strengthen their technology expertise, we can either lend our human capital along with our human capital value chain which includes learning, development, automation and AI infrastructure and more.\nOur business model flexibility is well suited to the changing nature of large deals where we see increasing demand for bundling services often a combination of software people take over infrastructure and services. These deals have a potential to bring Cognizant into the heart of clients' business landscape, putting us in a strong position to capture future services opportunities. Our third imperative is to enable more intimate levels of client collaboration and co-innovation. This effort grows out of our heritage of client centricity and grassroots innovation.\nGiven the scale and diversity of our global teams, we believe we have a potential to harvest an abundance of ideas big and small that can contribute to our clients' focus. Inspired by our BlueBolt grassroots innovation movement launched in quarter 2, more than 35,000 of our employees have generated 75,000 ideas. We have already implemented about 14,000 of these ideas, nearly 6,000 of which are client-facing. A strengthened ability to co-innovate with clients is especially valuable as they grapple with understanding and applying generative AI.\nDuring the quarter, we launched Telco Assurance 360, a cloud-based AI-powered solution built on ServiceNow and designed to provide telcos with real-time visibility into network issues and fast proactive resolution through AI-powered analytics. We also signed a multiyear agreement with a leading provider of digital and cloud-enabled solutions that are vital to the administration of health and human services programs across the U.S. Cognizant will serve as the client's sole global IT services and operations partner to help drive transformation at scale. We also provide the client with access to our AI, machine learning and generated AI tools, along with our TriZetto platform to advance revenue growth, increase administrative efficiency and improve the member experience.\nWhat's more, we are expanding our strategic collaboration with Qualcomm Technologies to jointly implement the AI-based solutions at the edge as a part of our car to cloud initiative. We encourage our clients who want to transform their businesses by being AI first to begin the journey by modernizing the data architecture, cloud infrastructure and core business applications. Today, we are running more than 150-plus early client engagements that incorporate the use of generative AI.\nSome of the examples of this work include general productivity use cases related to writing code, code analysis and troubleshooting, knowledge management and translating product specs into natural chat or speech. Business specific use cases for call center automation product prototyping, audience prediction, claims management, medical scribing and research and development. And domain specific use cases like onboarding new employees, validating deep documents and financial statement planning analytics.\nWe have 300-plus additional opportunities in our pipeline that we are planning to scale. Let's turn to a quick update on our 3 long-term strategic objectives, starting with becoming an employer of choice in our industry. I see Cognizant as a human capital company, first, and a technology company, second. Everything we do in is on the quality, dedication and scale of our talent base. That's why it is so consequential that our voluntary attrition continues to fall, putting us on par with the industry average. We expect further improvement in our attrition in quarter 4. It's also worth noting that in quarter 3, we had a net sequential headcount increase for the first time in several quarters.\nAs a human capital company, we are determined to help improve the lives of workers around the world. With that in mind, we announced a groundbreaking training initiative yesterday called Cognizant Synapse initiative, our job training endeavor is aimed at empowering more than 1 million individuals with the advanced technology skills, including generative AI, and that they will need to thrive in the digital economy. We intend to build a consortium of partners for training and jobs, which will then employ individuals who have upskilled through our Synaps initiative. Our next performance objective is to accelerate revenue growth.\nWhen I joined Cognizant in January, I said large deals are one of my top priorities. As I mentioned earlier, we are pleased to see our continuing large deal momentum, which is underpinned by the work we are doing to improve the capabilities required to see, shape and sell large deals and our ongoing investment in the client-facing roles needed for driving growth. These efforts have helped to partially offset what remains a softer discretionary spending environment and provides new growth opportunities following last year's muted bookings growth.\nOur third performance objective is to ensure operational excellence across the company. We remain focused on simplifying our operations, including a sales and delivery structure so we can continue to become more agile and get closer to clients in their unique business challenges. In general, we are operating with fewer layers, optimizing our day-to-day operations with enhanced systems and tools and working to streamline our processes and automate information flows using AI.\nDifferentiation in the tech services industry happens at the client side and the project level, making relationships and strong execution key. That's why I've invested so much time in meeting with over 270 clients so far this year, building trust and learning all I can about Cognizant can deliver more value to them. Over the past 3 quarters, I believe Cognizant has made meaningful progress on our long-term priorities. While we have a lot of work ahead, we also have much to be proud of. This includes a continuing large deals momentum, improved employee and client satisfaction scores, declining attrition, the scaling of our industry leadership with a platform-centered approach, heightened operational discipline and the launch of a grassroots innovation movement.\nLooking ahead, we believe the soft demand environment is unlikely to see a rapid rebound. Therefore, we expect clients to continue tempering the discretionary spending as we begin the new year. Given that market reality, we remain focused on winning efficiency-led large deals aimed at cost takeout on vendor consolidation, which can offset current pressure on discretionary spending. Our focus on operating discipline and our year-to-date progress on the next-gen program gives us confidence that we can meet our expectation to deliver our 20 to 40 basis points of margin expansion next year.\nJan will share more detail on NextGen in a moment. Taking a longer view with my read of business history, periods of great uncertainty and periods of change rarely coincide. Today, I believe we are in just such a period of simultaneous great uncertainty and deep-seated change. The uncertainty is being compounded by a number of intertwined domestic and international risks. What can become a transformative change is being driven primarily by new general-purpose technologies with immense power such as generative AI, which I believe could become as ubiquitous and consequential for business as society as the Internet did 3 decades ago.\nI expect this reality will leave most clients. However focused they are on navigating uncertainty with no choice but to make some big bets if they are not to be left behind by the peers. I believe Cognizant is in a position -- in a great position to prepare them for this future, whether by helping them achieve significant savings to underwrite investments in transformation or by helping them build their own technology muscle, which can include becoming fully AI-ready.\nIn closing, you are all aware that we recently appointed Jatin Dalal to be Cognizant's next Chief Financial Officer, and we're excited that he will be joining us in December. Since this is Jan's last earnings call with Cognizant, I want you all to know that what a powerful partner he's been to me across so many dimensions: strategic, financial, operational and cultural. He left a positive and indelible mark on our global organization, and I'm especially grateful that he agreed to stay with us until early next year to ensure smooth transition to [indiscernible] . With that, I'll turn the call over to Jan to provide additional details on this quarter.\n\nJan Siegmund\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Ravi, for the kind words. I want to thank all of our associates around the world for welcoming me into the Cognizant family 3 years ago and for making my time here such a memorable experience. It has been a pleasure working with so many great people at Cognizant and all of you on this call. I'm confident that I'm leaving the company in great hands with -- who many of you know, is an accomplished CFO and an experienced IT services executive. Over the next several months, I look forward to working with Ravi the Jason and the rest of the leadership team to ensure a smooth transition.\nWith that, let's turn to our third quarter results. We delivered revenue within our guidance range despite a soft discretionary spending environment and ongoing economic uncertainty. Adjusted operating margin exceeded our expectations. -- reflecting savings from our NextGen program and the timing of investments, which is driving some modest upside in our guidance range that I will touch on later. We were also pleased to deliver another quarter of solid bookings growth, which continue to be driven by larger longer-duration engagements.\nMoving on to the details of the quarter. Third quarter revenue was $4.9 billion, an increase of 0.2% sequentially. Year-over-year, revenue grew 0.8%, but declined 0.2% in constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 110 basis points of contributions from our acquisitions. Similar to last quarter, our 9% quarterly bookings growth was driven primarily by larger and longer duration deals. On a trailing 12-month basis, duration is up over 50% from the prior year period. At the same time, we are continuing to experience softness in the smaller short duration contracts driven by weak discretionary spending. This dynamic has negatively impacted our near-term revenue but we believe will put us in a better position to accelerate revenue growth in the future when discretionary spending improves.\nMoving on to the segment results for the third quarter where all growth rates discussed will be in year-over-year in constant currency. Within Financial Services, revenue declined 4%, reflecting the softer demand environment across regions and subindustries. This decline was partially offset by the benefit from the resale of third-party products in connection with our integrated offering strategy that Ravi mentioned earlier in his prepared remarks. Looking ahead, we believe the market remains challenging, and we expect the macroeconomic uncertainty will again have a meaningful impact for this segment in the fourth quarter.\nThat said, we are working hard to correct what is in our control, and I believe we can make meaningful progress under the new subindustry go-to-market approach and leadership. Health Sciences revenue declined 1%. Growth was negatively impacted by a large renewal that we signed earlier this year with a payer customer, which resulted in a lower revenue run rate but meaningfully improved profitability. In addition, several of our larger customers have been impacted by their own company-specific and end market challenges, which has in turn led to softer discretionary spending. Products and Resources revenue grew less than 1%, reflecting the benefit from recently completed acquisitions, strong performance from utility clients driven by their grid modernization investments and growth among automotive clients in Europe.\nGrowth in these areas was partially offset by pressure in manufacturing. Communications, Media and Technology revenue increased 7%, reflecting the benefit from recently completed acquisitions and the ramp of new contract awards. This includes the expansion of current engagement with our largest customers in this portfolio who are launching innovative vertical solutions and leveraging our expertise in these areas to rapidly scale globally. Continuing with year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency from a geographic perspective in Q3, North America revenue was down less than 1%, driven by declines within our Financial Services and Health Sciences portfolios. This was partially offset by growth in CMT and Products & Resources.\nOur global growth markets or GGM, which include all revenue outside of North America grew approximately 1%. Growth was led by Europe, which grew 3%, and included strong growth within CMT, Life Sciences customers within our Health Sciences segment and products and resources.\nFinally, the resale of third-party products contributed 120 basis points to our overall revenue growth in Q3, the majority of which was in the Financial Services segment. Now moving on to margins. During the quarter, we incurred approximately $72 million of costs related to our next-gen program. This negatively impacted our GAAP operating margin by approximately 150 basis points. Excluding this impact, adjusted operating margin was 15.5%. Similar to last quarter, our adjusted operating margin included the negative impact from increased compensation costs attributable to our 2 merit cycles over the last 12 months. This was partially offset by savings from our next-gen program and tailwinds from the depreciation of the Indian rupee.\nOur GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 26.8%. Adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 25.7%. Q3 diluted GAAP EPS was $1.04, and Q3 adjusted EPS was $1.16. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.4 billion, or net cash of $1.7 billion.\nDSO of 77 days increased 2 days sequentially and 3 days year-over-year. Free cash flow in Q3 was $755 million, which brings year-to-date free cash flow to approximately $1.4 billion. For the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow to represent approximately 90% of net income. During the quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares for $300 million under our share repurchase program and returned $147 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. Year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately 11 million shares for about $700 million. At quarter end, we had $2.1 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization.\nTurning to our forward outlook. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $4.69 billion to $4.82 billion, representing a year-over-year decline of 3.1% to 0.3% or a decline of 4% to 1.2% in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a benefit of approximately 90 basis points as well as an inorganic contribution of approximately 100 basis points. Our Q4 revenue guidance range is wider than our historical practice, reflecting a heightened level of uncertainty regarding client discretionary spending and recent pace of decision-making heading into the end of the year. For the full year, we expect revenue will be in the range of $19.3 billion to $19.4 billion, which is down approximately 0.7% to flat, both as reported and in constant currency, as we do not expect a material impact from foreign exchange rates.\nThis compares to our prior guidance range of $19.2 billion to $19.6 billion or negative 1% to plus 1% growth in constant currency. We still expect inorganic contribution to be approximately 100 basis points. Our -- next Gen program remains on track, and our assumptions for cost savings are unchanged from last quarter. I'm also pleased to share that we are further reducing our expectations for next-gen costs. We now expect to incur $300 million in total charges versus $350 million previously. With $200 million this year versus $250 million previously, the reduction is a result of lower real estate cost as we are now as we now expect to incur about $100 million related to the net consolidation of office space in 2023 versus $150 million previously. This reflects lower expected third-party costs associated with the real estate exits.\nAs we have spoken about previously, we still intend to reinvest the majority of the NextGen savings and growth opportunities in 2024 and beyond.\nMoving on to adjusted operating margin. We are modestly increasing our guidance to 14.7%, which is the high end of our prior range. As a reminder, our Q4 operating margin is typically seasonally lower than Q3 levels. We still anticipate 2023 interest income of approximately $115 million and an adjusted tax rate of approximately 34% and versus the range of 23% to 24% previously provided. In addition, we now expect to deploy approximately $1 billion on share repurchases in 2023 versus our prior expectations of approximately $800 million, which assumes an additional $300 million of share repurchases in the fourth quarter. In total, we expect to return approximately $1.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2023. Our guidance for shares outstanding is unchanged at approximately 506 million.\nThis leads to our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.39 in to $4.42 versus $4.25 and $4.48 previously, reflecting our updated expectations for revenue and adjusted operating margin.\nWith that, we will open the call for your questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Tyler Scott, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nTyler Scott\n\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release and the investor supplement for the company's second quarter 2023 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Ravi Kumar, Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.\nAdditionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Ravi. Please go ahead.\n\nRavi Kumar Singisetti\n\nPresident, Infosys Limited\n\nThank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everyone. I would like to discuss 4 topics with you today: our second quarter results, the demand environment, our comprehensive commitment to generative AI and an update on our long-term priorities. We've made continued progress during the quarter in what remains an uncertain global macroeconomic environment. Q2 came in at $4.9 billion, at the high end of our guidance range.\nWe were pleased to return to sequential revenue growth of more than 1%. Year-over-year, Q2 revenue showed a modest decline of 40 basis points or essentially flat in constant currency. Our adjusted operating margin was 14.2% and adjusted EPS was $1.10. We recorded another quarter of strong bookings growth, up 17% year-over-year, ending quarter 2 with record trailing 12 months bookings of $26.4 billion, a book-to-bill of 1.4x. Approximately 30% of our in-quarter Q2 bookings were large deals, and 5 of these deals exceeded $100 million each.\nOur bookings continue to be a balanced mix of renewals, extensions and new opportunities. The leadership team and I remain intensely focused on our talent, so I'm glad to see the continued reduction in our attrition with trailing 12 months voluntary attrition for our tech services business declining to 19.9%, down 3 percentage points sequentially and 11 percentage points year-over-year. While Jan will cover our performance in the business segment level, I want to offer a quick word about Financial Services.\nOur quarterly year-over-year revenue decline in this segment reflects the soft market and continuing weakness in discretionary spending. In response, we are transitioning more existing work in this sector towards managed services as many clients remain focused on driving cost takeout, vendor consolidation and productivity initiatives. We're also stepping up our engagement with fintech companies, which we believe offer a great opportunity for digital transformation. And we are strengthening our capabilities with the goal of capturing discretionary spending on transformation work when it returns.\nFor example, we continue to support the modernization of S&P Global's configure price quote system to enable end-to-end digitization in what we believe is the world's largest CPQ implementation on Salesforce. And we are collaborating with Max Life Insurance to launch an innovation and development center in Chennai to help accelerate their digital transformation efforts. With a flexible client-centric operating model, we can assist clients across industry sectors, take out costs, consolidate their vendors and achieve both technology and operational efficiencies, which provide opportunities for large deals.\nWe can also help them develop digital platforms to deliver richer and more personalized experiences to their customers. What's more, we can engineer technology into their products and services. As an example, we recently extended our partnership with Gilead Sciences. This agreement includes the renewal and expansion of Cognizant's services for a total expected value of $800 million over the next 5 years. We'll manage Gilead's global IT infrastructure while leading digital transformation initiatives designed to enhance their overall client experience and enable faster time to market for their products. We will apply the power of Gen AI and intelligent automation to help improve Gilead's customer service experience and assist in driving greater manufacturing efficiencies.\nTo support clients' transformation leads, we have established a distinctive position across industries using a platform-centric approach designed to speed clients' consumption of technology. You've seen the emphasis we have given to this platform approach. For example, Cognizant, TriZetto and Healthcare, our shared investigator platform in life sciences, asset performance excellence and smart manufacturing and cloud and automotive.\nLast quarter, we launched 2 new platforms with applications across industries, Neuro IT Operations, which enables AI-led autonomous operations; and Cognizant Skygrade designed to help clients maximize the full potential of cloud.\nTurning to AI. In quarter 2, we expanded our platform portfolio further with Cognizant Neuro AI. It's designed to speed the adoption of generative AI and harness its value in a flexible, secure, scalable and responsible way. With Neuro AI, we are helping clients advance from identifying company-specific use cases to operationalizing AI. I should point out that generative AI is a natural evolution of our work across cognitive AI, enterprise applications and data and analytics services.\nTo extract value from gen AI, the data must be curated, trained, modernized and made production-ready. You also need a deep understanding of clients' data estates, data architectures, data usage patterns and business applications of the data. Our current approach to leverage third-party foundational models and enhance them with our platforms and IP and then fine-tune the models for our clients. Today, we have more than 100 active client engagements in various stages with a focus on cognitive and generative AI as well as hundreds more projects using AI services within the context of delivery.\nWe are designing our generative AI offerings for industry-specific solutions across industry use cases and productivity enablement under themes like transforming code processes, improving the customer and employee experience, product innovation, software and coding and knowledge management, to name a few. For example, one of the world's largest health care product companies, we are helping to speed up their research process by deploying gen AI to author scientific content. We developed a workbench that uses GPT models to summarize and generate content from unstructured and structured data such as laboratory information management systems with the aim of automating the generation of regulatory content.\nFor a top 20 property and casualty insurer, we have helped frame its gen AI strategy and conduct real-world tests based on company data. For example, we built a gen AI-based digital virtual assistant that analyze loss complex claims submissions. By referencing the insurer's claim data, the virtual assistant was able to guide a human claims handler to gather nearly 100% of missing claims information. This simple application is expected to produce millions of dollars in savings through improved operational efficiency and reduced claim costs.\nIn addition, we signed a new multiyear agreement with Nuance Communications, a Microsoft company, to help scale their resources for Nuance's Dragon Ambient eXperience operations. This solution is at the forefront of conversational and ambient clinical intelligence.\n[indiscernible] essential role partners play in delivering our AI capabilities. We expanded our alliance with Google Cloud to help enterprise clients create, migrate and modernize their AI journeys and offer clients innovative industry solutions founded on the tenet of responsible AI. Our investments in developing generative AI capabilities include launching the Cognizant Google Cloud AI University, a program designed to train 25,000 Cognizant professionals on Google Cloud AI technologies will offer this program to our clients as well.\nAnd earlier today, we announced that as a part of our expanded partnership with Google, we'll be building on Google Cloud's generative AI technology with Cognizant's AI domain expertise to create a health care large language model. This LLM is designed to simplify and improve the accuracy of complex health care administrative tasks and strengthen business outcomes for health care organizations.\nWe've also expanded our relationship with Microsoft to deliver industry solutions and enable AI-led transformation. This includes expanding the focus of our Microsoft Center of Excellence in AI and other next-gen technologies to drive competencies across architecture technology leadership, value delivery tools and enablement.\nCognizant and ServiceNow have announced a strategic partnership to accelerate the adoption of AI-driven automation across industries. Our industry expertise and solutions integrated with ServiceNow's intelligent platform for end-to-end digital transformation will bring to market offerings that are designed to solve complex problems, automate operations and enhance employee as well as end customer experiences through the use of AI.\nNow a quick update on our 3 long-term performance objectives: becoming an employer of choice in our industry, accelerating revenue growth and enhancing operational discipline. Let's start with the employer of choice. During our Q4 call, I talked about how tightly linked the client and the employee experience are, giving Cognizant at the opportunity to create self-reinforcing cycles. Highly engaged talent with a passion for clients and a growth mindset attract the best clients. These clients, in turn, attract more of the best people, keeping the flywheel turning faster.\nNow 2 quarters later, we are seeing the early benefits of this interdependent relationship between employees and clients. Our trailing 12-month voluntary attrition has been trending downwards for the last 4 quarters. And a just-completed annual people engagement survey showed meaningfully improved engagement results. Among the many questions the survey poses to associates, we saw multipoint increases in 3 areas strongly correlated to engagement. Would you recommend Cognizant as a great place to work? Are you excited about Cognizant's future? And do you plan to be working at Cognizant 2 years from now?\nOn the client side, data from our project-level client feedback process through the first half of this year shows solid improvement over the previous period scores as well as our best Net Promoter Score since launching this program in 2021. I see us making real progress on creating a self-reinforcing cycle. From day 1, my commitment to our associates has been to cultivate a diverse organization that reflects the world which we operate. Our top priority has been to increase a diverse talent, including at leadership levels.\nI'm delighted to say that in the past couple of months, we have appointed 7 women to fill strategic roles at the senior vice president level. We are resolved to help all our associates bring their best selves to work, and that means focusing on all aspects of the Cognizant experience. For example, we develop talent early through educational partnerships and apprenticeships. We invest heavily in upskilling and reskilling current employees through our award-winning leadership and development ecosystem. We also employ innovative train-to-hire initiatives such as the Cognizant Skills Accelerator aimed at people seeking to kickstart a technology career in the U.S. and the Cognizant Returnship Program for technology professionals looking to restart their careers.\nOur next priority is to accelerate revenue growth, which is the absolute focus of the entire management team. We are differentiating Cognizant and large deal opportunities by scaling our capabilities for cost takeout and optimization and focusing more on managed services. And we continue to see a strong pipeline of opportunities on the cost and efficiency side. Given the groundswell of interest in generative AI, the number of projects we have underway focused on cognitive and generative AI, we see this technology generating a new wave of opportunities for us. Accordingly, we expect to invest approximately $1 billion in our generative AI capabilities over the next 3 years.\nOur third long-term priority is to enhance our operational discipline. We are working to fortify our day-to-day business execution and optimize cost of delivery by driving higher productivity powered by advances in tooling platforms and automation technologies and by improving our operational leader in areas like billable utilization. Our NextGen program which we announced last quarter is on track. We are making progress on removing structural costs as we continue to simplify our operating model and realign our office space for the future of hybrid work.\nOn our last call, I talked about a plan to redistribute some of our development centers from India's largest cities to smaller cities. I'm pleased to announce the first phase of this shift with the planned opening of 2 new centers, 1 in Boneshwa and the other in Indore, India, which offer great talent pools. Keep in mind, the next generation, NextGen program's overriding aim is to generate savings to invest in our people and Jan will provide additional details in his remarks on the NextGen program.\nIn closing, I'm now 7 months into my tenure as a CEO. I have met with more than 200 clients, dozens of our partners and through in-person and virtual town halls with most of our workforce. I've also made a point to continuously soliciting ideas and perspectives from our top [ 1,000 ] leaders on strategic topics of importance to our future. Further, our company-wide grassroots innovation movement launched earlier this year, BlueBolt has led to such a surge of fresh ideas with more than 32,000 generated so far that it's now serving as our company's innovation engine.\nI'm convinced Cognizant's path to winning in the marketplace runs through fully embracing our heritage and DNA. We are leaning into a heritage at the intersection of industry and technology, a flexible client-centric operating model and a distributed delivery network that bring together global and local capabilities. All in all, we've been making good progress but recognize how much more work lies ahead. Continuing to build on our growth imperatives is the goal on which everyone in the company is focused.\nI especially want to express my heartfelt gratitude to all our associates for the extraordinary work they do each day. Before I turn the call to Jan, I want to comment on his plans for the future. Jan let me and the Board know of his intention to retire from Cognizant early next year. Jan has been a wonderful business partner to me and over the past 3 years, he's played an instrumental role in designing and executing our strategic financial and operating plan while developing superb talent with our finance organization. As we begin the search for the company's next CFO, I'm grateful for Jan's willingness to work closely with his eventual successor to ensure a smooth transition.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to him to provide additional details on the quarter. Thank you.\n\nJan Siegmund\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Ravi, for the kind words. I'm proud of what we have accomplished over the last 3 years, including our work together over the last 7 months. I'm looking forward to continuing our partnership in the months ahead while the search for my successor is underway. Until then, it's business as usual, so with that, let's turn now to our second quarter results.\nWe delivered second quarter revenue at the high end of our guidance range and adjusted operating margins above expectations. We were pleased to deliver another strong quarter of bookings growth driven by larger and longer duration deals. Our pipeline for larger bookings also remains strong and is up meaningfully year-over-year. Additionally, our NextGen program is on track and yielding early savings through our efforts to structurally reduce our cost base and fund investments for growth.\nMoving on to the details of the quarter. Second quarter revenue was $4.9 billion, representing an increase of over 1% sequentially and a decline of 40 basis points year-over-year or roughly flat in constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 130 basis points of contribution from our recent acquisitions. Bookings growth in the quarter was again driven by a mix shift towards larger deals, which had, in turn, led to longer average duration of our bookings. We are pleased with our bookings performance in the quarter and are focused on building momentum in the quarters ahead.\nConsistent with the first quarter, we have continued to experience softness in smaller, shorter duration contracts, which we attribute to weaker discretionary spending. The translation of bookings to revenue growth is impacted by this change in deal mix. As duration has increased, the conversion to revenue will be longer but helps to improve our forward visibility.\nMoving on to segments result for the second quarter, where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Within Financial Services, revenues declined 5%, which reflects a softer overall demand environment and weak discretionary spending. As we navigate this environment, we have continued to strengthen our leadership team and sharpened our client engagement. While our pipeline for work related to cost takeout and productivity led initiatives remains healthy and meaningfully higher than prior year period, we expect the uncertainties of the macro environment to continue to impact the pace of client spending over the next several quarters.\nHealth Sciences revenue grew 2%. Growth was again driven by strong demand from health care clients for our integrated software solutions, which increased mid-teens year-over-year. While the Life Sciences was down year-over-year and impacted by softer discretionary spending, we experienced strong sequential growth driven by increased volumes with existing customers. Products and Resources revenue grew 4%, reflecting the benefit from recently completed acquisitions, ramp of recent wins and demand from automotive and travel and hospitality clients. This was partially offset by softer discretionary spending across industries.\nCommunications, Media and Technology revenue declined 40 basis points, reflecting softness among both technology and our communications and media clients. We expect growth to improve in Q3 as recent new bookings have already begun to ramp. Continuing with year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency, from a geographic perspective in Q2, North America revenue declined 2%, reflecting softness within our Financial Services and CMT portfolio. This was partially offset by growth in Health Sciences and Products and Resources. Our growth -- our global growth markets, or GGM, which includes all revenue outside North America grew approximately 5%. Growth was led by Europe, which grew 6% and included strong growth within CMT and Products and Resources, particularly within automotive.\nNow moving on to margins. During the quarter, we incurred approximately $117 million cost related to our previously announced NextGen program. This negatively impacted our GAAP operating margin by approximately 240 basis points. Excluding this impact, adjusted operating margin was 14.2%. Operating margin included the negative impact from an increase in compensation cost, primarily the result of our 2 merit cycles since October 2022. This has impacted both gross margin and SG&A.\nThis was partially offset by tailwinds from the depreciation of the Indian rupee and higher utilization. It also included an approximate 60 basis points benefit from an insurance recovery related to our previously disclosed 2020 cyber incident. Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 21.1%. Adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 21.7%. Our effective tax rate included a discrete benefit from a settlement related to U.S. state income taxes. Q2 diluted GAAP EPS was $0.91 and adjusted EPS was $1.10.\nNow turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.1 billion or net cash of $1.4 billion. DSO of 75 days increased 2 days sequentially and 1 day year-over-year. Free cash flow in Q2 was a negative $32 million, which reflects the previously disclosed impact from the change in the U.S. law that we discussed earlier this year. This change negatively impacted Q2 free cash flow by approximately $420 million, which included tax payments of approximately $300 million related to 2022. This impact was largely in line with our expectations, and we continue to expect free cash flow to represent approximately 90% of net income this year.\nDuring the quarter, we've repurchased about 3 million shares for $200 million under our share repurchase program and returned $148 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. Year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately 6 million shares for about $400 million. At quarter end, we had $2.4 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization.\nTurning to our forward outlook. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $4.89 billion to $4.94 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 0.6% to 1.6% or a decline of 50 basis points to an increase of 50 basis points in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a positive impact of 110 basis points as well as an inorganic contribution of approximately 100 basis points. For the full year, we are reiterating our constant currency revenue growth guidance range is slightly wider than our historical practice, reflecting a heightened level of uncertainty and the recent pace of client decision-making.\nFor 2023, we expect revenue of $19.2 billion to $19.6 billion, representing a decline of 0.9% to a growth of 1.1% or a decline of 1% to growth of 1% in constant currency. Inorganic contribution is still expected to be approximately 100 basis points. The midpoint of our guidance suggests a softer fourth quarter relative to historic norms as we anticipate softer demand and more volatile discretionary spending patterns driven by macroeconomic uncertainty to continue throughout the end of the year.\nAs I mentioned earlier, the NextGen program is on track and our assumptions for cost savings are unchanged. However, we now expect to incur $350 million in total charges versus $400 million previously. This reflects our assumption for lower employee separation costs as a result of voluntary attrition trend. We now expect to incur approximately $250 million of NextGen costs in 2023, including approximately $100 million relating to employee severance and an unchanged $150 million related to net consolidation of office space.\nMoving on to adjusted operating margin. Our guidance is unchanged at 14.2% to 14.7%. Our margin outlook is impacted by several factors but primarily the negative impact from recent merit cycles. It also reflects our assumption for NextGen savings and growth investments, including the dilutive early impact associates with large deals. We anticipate 2023 interest income of approximately $115 million versus $85 million previously, reflecting the higher interest rate environment. Adjusted tax rate is expected to be in the range of 23% to 24% versus 24% to 26% previously due to several discrete items in the first half of the year.\nIn 2023, we continue to expect to return approximately $1.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and our regular quarterly dividend. We continue to expect full year average shares outstanding of approximately 506 million. This leads to our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.25 to $4.48 versus $4.11 to $4.34 previously. With that, we will open the call for your questions."

[Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would like now to turn the conference over to Mr. Tyler Scott, Vice President and Investor of Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nTyler Scott\n\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release and the investor supplement for the company's first quarter 2023 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Ravi Kumar, Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.\nAdditionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ravi. Please go ahead.\n\nRavi Kumar Singisetti\n\nPresident, Infosys Limited\n\nThank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everyone. When I spoke to you early February, I was just 3 weeks into my role. I explained my plan to move rapidly up the learning curve by embarking on a global listening and learning tour with associates, clients and partners. I also mentioned that I would meet with more than 100 clients and as many of our associates as possible. In addition, I outlined 3 interrelated priorities: making Cognizant an employer of choice in its industry; accelerate revenue growth, especially by winning large deals; and enhancing our operational discipline. I'll comment on progress of each of these areas, but first, I want to cover a few of the quarter's financial and operational highlights.\nIn quarter 1, we delivered revenue of $4.8 billion, a decline of 0.3% year-over-year as reported, but a growth of 1.5% in constant currency, above the high end of our guidance range. Our adjusted operating margin was 14.6%. We recorded strong quarterly bookings growth of 28% year-over-year and ended quarter 1 with record trailing 12 months bookings of $25.6 billion in the trailing 12 months book-to-bill of 1.3x. Approximately 30% of our [ in-quarter ] or quarter 1 bookings were large deals, which we define as total contract value of about $50 million compared to approximately 20% for all of 2022.\nWe were very pleased with our first quarter bookings performance as well as the build in our pipeline, which includes a strong mix of large new opportunities. I'm especially pleased to see the continuing reduction in our attrition with trailing 12-month voluntary attrition for our technology services business declining to 23%, down [ 3% points ] sequentially and 7 points Y-on-Y year-on-year. While Jan will cover our financial performance at the business segment level, given the importance of financial services on our momentum, I want to comment on the state of this business and the emerging opportunities we see in this segment.\nFor starters, we believe our company-specific operational challenges in financial services have largely subsided, and we are beginning to stabilize the business. Our client portfolio has shown resilience, both in U.S. and internationally, but we're also seeing the impact from softer discretionary spending and decision delays by existing and potential clients. In the U.S., our banking clients are generally large institutions, and we have seen an uptick in our deal pipeline. Overall, we have seen early green shoots that we are moving this portfolio in the right direction while navigating the macro dynamics. We are encouraged by leading indicators such as strong Q1 global bookings growth for financial services at a rate above the company average as well as an uptick in our large deal pipeline.\nI'm particularly encouraged by my conversations with about 2 dozen of our financial services clients. I came away from these meetings with many new opportunities to pursue related to cost takeout, vendor consolidation, post-merger integration and a new wave of outsourcing in fintechs. Having said that, we still have a lot of work ahead, and we will be closely monitoring the environment to anticipate shifts in our clients' needs. To date, I have met either in person or virtually with C-suite executors from more than 100 of our clients representing nearly all of our industry segments and all of our major geographies.\nSeveral teams have surfaced from these candid conversations. We have a strong goodwill with our clients and continue to recognize a culture of client centricity. This way, we are easy to work with, [ adventive ] to nurturing our client relationships and deeply understand their businesses. They like our entrepreneurial approach to developing solutions to their challenges. They also appreciate our humility, our willingness to learn, listen and adapt. I believe the longevity and depth of our relationships have created a lot of accumulated trust.\nBy the way, none of our clients I spoke to mentioned about Cognizant's digital mix. I believe that's because digital and nondigital capabilities have converged to the point where the distinction between the two is less significant. Instead, the differentiator many clients have spoken about is how well positioned Cognizant is that the confluence of technology and industry domains. Given that our digital mix is no longer a true measure of the value we are providing to clients, we have decided to stop disclosing this metric.\nWith that said, clients want more from us. They trust us with their agenda, strategies and competitive challenges. They tell me Cognizant has earned the right to challenge their thinking and be a strategic partner who co-create solutions with them and offers insights on improving their operations. Overall, I came away with the sense that many clients are fans of our company.\nWhat also surfaced is that most clients are grappling with largely similar challenges, although with variations by industry. The cost basis reflect the higher growth levels seen during the pandemic era, prompting an intensified focus on optimizing cost and efficiency and building greater resilience. They need to digitize workflows, enhance their customer and employee experiences and boost the efficiency of their commercial and operational teams.\nIn that context, I thought it would be useful to mention a few recent client wins that underscore the strategic cloud-focused work we do for clients and a skill-as-a-systems integrator. We are partnering with Microsoft to build an integration road map between our TriZetto health products and the cloud for Healthcare. Our shared aim is to give payers and providers easy access to cutting-edge technology solutions, streamlined claims management and improved interoperability to deliver better patient and member experiences.\nIn a new win, we are working with Boehringer Ingelheim to speed the development and improve the accuracy of their life-saving therapies. We help our clients unify medicinal development processes and data into unified cloud platform and enhance the collaboration across clinical, regulatory and quality functions. We've been engaged by works within Group Ireland to reengineer its siloed contact center platform into omnichannel customer service landscape that will deliver more personalized agent and customer experiences using Salesforce Cloud and Amazon Connect. And last week, we announced a new 5-year agreement to transform and support the global technology operations of a long-term client, Nike. We will help drive customer, employee and partner experiences from Nike by leveraging hyper-automation, AI and processing reengineering. These are just a few examples. In short, our capabilities are in demand as clients navigate an uncertain macroeconomic environment.\nLet's turn to the company's 3 focus areas of growth enablers and the progress we are beginning to make. The first of these is to become an employer of choice. We recognize this as a multiyear undertaking. To take the pulse of employee sentiment, I've been using every communication channel available to get unfiltered feedback from tens of thousands of associates to learn what's working well and what needs to improve. As a part of my immersion, I spent 2 weeks in India visiting a half a dozen cities where we have major facilities, along with traveling to see associates in the U.K., Switzerland, Canada and across the U.S. I've been moved by our associates warmth, enthusiasm and energy, and what I'm hearing from them is very encouraging. In this post-pandemic era, we are back to walking the corridors for clients, mining relationships and building new ones, and we're revitalizing our ability to land and expand within existing clients as we steadily bring on new accounts.\nAcross the organization, I see a rising pride in the company. Associates at all levels of our company want to partner with me to begin writing the next chapter in Cognizant's nearly 30-year history and are moving forward with renewed confidence about the future. To be an employer of choice, we need to meet the demands of a diverse workforce that spans geographies, generation and the range of work and life priorities. Here are a few of our approaches.\nWe have made career progression easier by expanding our internal job board process and redesigning the promotion process to increase more movement across our organization. We have intensified our focus on continuous upscaling and learning by expanding a learning library, running internal learning and development campaigns and launching a new leadership training initiative for people at all levels. We have had 3 merit increases in 18 months for the majority of our associates who are in the levels up to associate director. And over the past couple of years, we've invested significantly more in compensation. In addition, we are stepping up the efforts to get our associates to return to office because doing so, we believe, helps build and sustain our culture and helps associates build their social capital with colleagues.\nTo tap into the creativity of our more than 350,000 associates, we are launching a grassroots innovation movement because I believe innovative ideas can come from everyone. This program called Blue Bold encourages and celebrates the thousands of flashes of inspiration that our associates have every day as they innovate for our clients. Over the coming months, we plan to train more than 20,000 additional project leads in our innovation methods and generate over 100,000 ideas for client to use rapid prototyping and the identification of new opportunities.\nA second focus area I've spoken about is accelerating revenue growth and building commercial momentum, especially by strengthening our ability to win large deals. Our Q1 bookings were a balance of renewals, expansions and new engagements, which we believe will provide revenue opportunities for us later in the year and valid to 2024. Our strong bookings growth in the quarter, including 4 deals with a total contract value of about $100 million.\nTo cite one large deal, one recent large deal, Horizon Healthcare Services selected us to manage their claims processing and counter submissions to the state and enrollment services for their 1.2 million members. In the 7-year renewal agreement, we will bring to bear advanced automation solutions for our TriZetto product suite to help Horizon expedite the claims payment process and ensure accuracy in support of their member services. Our large deal pipeline remains healthy for the next couple of quarters. Large deal bookings that aligned with our risk appetite are essential to building commercial momentum, but they can take time to ramp up and realize revenue. We are working on strengthening and industrializing delivery to support our execution of large deals.\nMoving to our third priority, operational excellence. As you may recall from my last call, I said that internal simplification would be a team will carry forward to help achieve the company's full potential. Our drive for simplification will include operating with fewer layers to deliver greater agility along with realigning the business to be closer to our clients and employees, and of course, to increase a growth mindset. This endeavor named NextGen is aimed at building the enterprise of the future by simplifying our business operations, optimizing our corporate functions and realigning our workforce to a post-pandemic era of hybrid and redistributed work. This shift will provide an opportunity to rationalize the workspaces across the world and especially in India's largest cities where we're distributing some real estate to smaller cities where we can expand and by modernizing some existing space. We expect the structural shift in our real estate costs to help eliminate 80,000 seats and 11 million square feet in large cities in India. This shift will also enable us to invest in collaboration spaces in smaller cities while creating structural savings for the future that we can invest in our people and growth opportunities.\nWe expect this program to help enable us to deliver margin expansion in the range of 20 to 40 basis points in 2024 while supporting a large deal pipeline. Combined with our efforts to increase utilization, improve delivery efficiency, maintain disciplined pricing and a lower attrition, we believe we have the levers to drive modest margin expansion over the next several years while we continue to fund growth investments in 2024 and beyond. Recognizing how much work we have ahead of us, I plan to provide periodic updates about our progress in achieving these 3 priorities.\nLet's spend a moment on the demand environment and tech trends. We are carefully monitoring what remains an uncertain macroeconomic environment and with its potential for shifts in client priorities. That said, we are optimistic about our long-term opportunity within the IT services market. The demand for solutions and business outcomes remain solid as technology becomes core to nearly every business. The tech trend on everyone's mind is generative AI with recent breakthroughs offering the potential to fundamentally transform our clients' businesses and increase our own productivity. To that end, we are accelerating our investment in generative AI. Our AI accelerator process uses studio environments to collaborate with clients to identify priority AI use cases and rapidly implement prototype solutions for field testing. We have conducted ideation sessions with over 30 clients and are now working to industrialize solutions to their common challenges. We believe generative AI will revolutionize the technology services industry, creating higher rates of productivity and driving greater prominence for software and data engineering expertise. We are using AI to enhance our own creativity and productivity. We are operating pilots that use generative AI to accelerate consulting, design, engineering and operations with the long-term goal of doubling the productivity of our associates.\nWith that in mind, last month, we launched a neuro IT operations, a next-generation platform that brings new levels of automation and intelligence to applications and infrastructure operations. By applying an AI-led automation-first approach, we are enabling enterprises to innovate faster and drive down cost and risk. We believe that enacting new IT operations can actually reduce operational costs by 25% to 45%, reduce mean time to delivery and mean time to detect by 30% to 50% and reduce FTEs by 15% to 30% compared with the use of traditional approaches.\nAcross every industry, the cloud is today the biggest transformational opportunity, and therefore, our clients need a partner that can orchestrate cloud in a heterogeneous environment. In response, we just introduced a new cloud platform called Cognizant Skygrade. This multi-hybrid cloud and edge management platform applies an industry-focused approach designed to help clients transition to a modern cloud-native architecture, develop modern applications that evolve with the pace of business and streamline the cloud management operations. With Skygrade, we believe we can accelerate migration and modernization programs by shortening transformation time by 20% to 40%, resulting in faster value realization while reducing ongoing run and governance costs by 15% to 25%.\nTo wrap up, I stand behind my initial assessment that Cognizant has the strong foundation in place on which we could accelerate growth. I am especially optimistic about the strength of our portfolio and partner ecosystem, combined with our ability to create value for our clients at the intersection of technology and industry use cases. We recognize that our renewed strength in bookings momentum is helping us replenish a softer backlog from the past 9 months, and we believe we can demonstrate improved growth towards the end of this year and in 2024.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jan to provide additional details on the quarter and our outlook for 2023. Jan, over to you.\n\nJan Siegmund\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Ravi, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I touch on the details of the first quarter, I would like to spend a moment on the NexGen program we announced today. During the second quarter, we initiated NexGen to simplify our operating model, optimize our corporate functions and realign our office space to reflect our hybrid work environment. We expect to record total estimated NexGen costs of $400 million, approximately $350 million in 2023 and $50 million in 2024. This consists of $200 million of employee severance and other costs primarily related to nonbillable and corporate personnel which we expect to mostly incur in 2023. The personnel-related actions under this program are expected to impact approximately 3,500 associates or approximately 1% of our total workforce. We expect to realize savings from our NexGen initiative in the back half of this year.\nThe NexGen program also includes $200 million of costs related to the consolidation of office space and approximately $150 million in 2023 and $50 million in 2024. We do not anticipate these real estate actions will begin to generate savings until 2024. By 2025, we expect to reduce our annual real estate costs by approximately $100 million versus 2022. This reduction is net of investments to expand our real estate footprint in smaller cities, primarily in India, in support of our hybrid work strategy.\nOur full year operating margin outlook includes the anticipated impact of these actions. As Ravi mentioned, we expect this program to help enable us to deliver 20 to 40 basis points of margin expansion in 2024, in addition to funding revenue growth opportunities. This 2024 expectation assumes no further deterioration of the economic environment. Beyond 2024, we are focused on driving structural cost improvements to fund investments to support revenue growth, our people and modernization of facilities while driving consistent, modest margin expansion.\nNow moving on to the details for the quarter. We were pleased to deliver revenue above the high end of our guidance range, strong free cash flow and healthy large deal bookings, which has helped us to begin to replenish our backlog following muted bookings growth throughout 2022. First quarter revenue was $4.8 billion, representing a decline of 30 basis points year-over-year or growth of plus 1.5% in constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 100 basis points of growth from our recent acquisitions. As Ravi mentioned, we were pleased with our bookings performance in the first quarter, including the mix shift towards larger deals. We also exited the quarter with a strong pipeline of larger opportunities across industries. At the same time, we also saw pressure in smaller contracts, which we believe is a result of a softer discretionary spending being driven by the macro environment. This environment has a near-term impact on our revenue in the second quarter, which I will touch on in my guidance commentary.\nMoving on to segment results for the first quarter where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Within Financial Services, revenue declined 1%. Revenue pressure within our North American portfolio was partially offset by growth in our global growth markets, which was driven by public sector and insurance clients. In the first quarter, bookings growth within financial services outpaced the total company, and we are seeing an improving pipeline of opportunities over the next 12 months. While we have begun to see signs of stabilization, we are still rebuilding our backlog as we continue to navigate an uncertain macro environment. We believe this uncertainty has impacted the pace of client decision-making and put pressure on discretionary budgets. It has also resulted in new pipeline opportunities around cost savings, efficiency and vendor consolidation which we are actively pursuing.\nHealth Sciences revenue grew 4%, consistent with last quarter. Growth was driven by increased demand from health care payer clients for our integrated software solutions. Products and Resources revenue grew 1%, reflecting inorganic contribution from recently completed acquisitions and continued strength among logistics, utility and travel and hospitality customers. This was partially offset by pressure from retail, consumer goods and manufacturing customers, which we believe reflects the economic environment. Communications, Media and Technology revenue grew 4%, reflecting slower growth among our largest technology clients and muted growth among communications and media clients. Similar to our other segments, we believe the macroeconomic environment pace of decision-making and discretionary spending among our CMT clients.\nContinuing with our year-over-year growth in constant currency from a geographic perspective in Q1. North America revenue declined 1%. This performance reflected declines within Financial Services and Products and Resources, partially offset by growth in Health Sciences. Our global growth markets, or GGM, which includes all revenue outside of North America, grew approximately 7%. Growth was again led by the U.K., which grew 14% and included strong double-digit growth within Financial Services, including public sector clients and CMT.\nNow moving on to margins. In Q1, both our GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 14.6% as there were no non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, both GAAP and adjusted operating margin declined by 40 basis points. This primarily reflects gross margin pressure from increased compensation costs, partially offset by tailwinds from the depreciation of the Indian rupee, lower SG&A expenses and the benefit of 2022 pricing actions. Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 21.4%. The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 22.5%. Our effective tax rate included a discrete benefit from a settlement of prior year tax audits. Year 1, diluted GAAP EPS was $1.14 and adjusted EPS was $1.11, up 7% and 3% year-over-year, respectively.\nNow turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.5 billion or net cash of $1.8 billion. DSO of 73 days was down 1 day sequentially and increased 1 day year-over-year. Free cash flow in Q1 was $631 million, representing approximately 110% of net income. This compares to free cash flow of $186 million in the prior year period, which represented approximately 35% of net income. The increase in free cash flow was driven by strong collections. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.2 million shares for $200 million under our share repurchase program and returned $150 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. We also closed 2 acquisitions in the quarter, Mobica, which helps bolster our IoT software engineering capabilities; and the professional and application management services business of OneSource Virtual, a Workday partner. Over the last 6 months, we have deployed approximately $800 million of capital across 4 acquisitions.\nBefore we move to our outlook, I would like to spend a moment to discuss the change in our attrition disclosure. As you heard Ravi mentioned, we are now disclosing voluntary attrition tech services on a trailing 12-month basis, which we believe is most relevant to our business. This new metric includes all employees, except those in our intuitive operations automation practice, and replaces our prior disclosure.\nNow turning to our forward outlook. For the second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $4.83 billion to $4.88 billion, representing a year-over-year decline of 1.6% to minus 0.6%, or a decline of minus 1% to flat in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a negative 60 basis points impact as well as an inorganic contribution of approximately 100 basis points. We are also providing initial full year 2023 revenue and operating margin guidance. Our focus for the remainder of the year is to continue to replenish our backlog to successive quarters of strong bookings performance, which we believe would improve revenue momentum towards the end of this year and as we enter 2024. For the full year, we are guiding revenue in the range of $19.2 billion to $19.6 billion, representing a decline of minus 1.2% to growth of plus 0.8%, or a decline of minus 1% to growth of plus 1% in constant currency. Inorganic contribution is expected to be approximately 100 basis points. This assumes no major deterioration in the demand environment, and our assumption that large deals we have signed and expect to sign in Q2 begin to ramp more meaningfully in the second half of the year.\nMoving on to the adjusted operating margin. We are guiding operating margin to be in the range of 14.2% to 14.7%. Our margin outlook is impacted by several factors. First, we expect the macroeconomic environment will impact pricing, which was a key lever for us in 2022 to help offset the elevated wage inflation. Second, we are achieving a faster pace of large deals than we initially anticipated. These larger deals generally have a dilutive impact in the first year. Finally, as mentioned, the NexGen program is not expected to drive meaningful savings until the back half of this year. For real estate, we anticipate initial savings in 2024 and a full run rate in 2025. Our operating margin guidance also assumes a sequential decline in Q2 as a result of the merit cycle that took effect from April 1. As a reminder, this is our second merit cycle for the majority of our employees in the last 6 months. We anticipate 2023 interest income of approximately $85 million, reflecting the higher interest rate environment, and an adjusted tax rate in the range of 24% to 26%. In 2023, we expect to deploy approximately $800 million on share repurchases, including the activity in Q1. This assumes repurchase activity above our long-term capital allocation framework and will reduce our weighted average share count by approximately 2.5% in 2023. Based on the share repurchase activity, we anticipate full year average shares outstanding of approximately 506 million. This leads to our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.11 to $4.34, which reflects our wider-than-typical operating margin guidance.\nFinally, we are targeting free cash flow conversion of approximately 90% of net income, which assumes the negative impact from the changes in the U.S. tax law that we discussed in February. We now estimate the negative year-over-year impact of $540 million from this change, which is slightly down from our prior estimate. This includes approximately $300 million in deferred payments relating to 2022.\nWith that, we will open the call for your questions."

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tyler Scott, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nTyler Scott\n\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release and investor supplement for the company's fourth quarter and full year 2022 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, Cognizant.com.\nThe speakers we have on today's call are Steve Rohleder, Chair of Cognizant's Board of Directors; Ravi Kumar, Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.\nAdditionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures, can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.\nWith that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Steve. Please go ahead.\n\nStephen J. Rohleder\n\nIndependent Chairman, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation\n\nThank you, Tyler, and thank you all for joining us today. Given the recent news, I wanted to join the call for this quarter to introduce myself and explain the changes we've recently announced. For those of you that don't know me, I'm Steve Rohleder, and I joined the Board as an independent director in March of 2022. Last month, I became Chair of Cognizant's Board of Directors. I previously spent 35 years at Accenture where I served as Group Chief Executive of Health and Public Services, Chief Executive of North America and Chief Operating Officer.\nToday, I'd like to briefly discuss our recent CEO transition and the Board changes announced this afternoon supporting our ongoing Board refreshment process. I also want to explain why we're excited for Cognizant's next chapter. Ravi will then introduce himself and share his thoughts before Jan discusses our fourth quarter results in detail. We'll then proceed to Q&A.\nRegarding our CEO transition, as we announced a few weeks ago, the Board appointed Ravi Kumar to succeed Brian Humphries as CEO. Brian was a resilient leader providing a steady hand as he steered the company through various challenges, including the global pandemic. On behalf of the Board, management and all of our associates, I want to thank Brian for his contributions, which have helped to position Cognizant to capture a large growing market and fuel profitable revenue growth beyond our short-term challenges. We also appreciate that Brian will remain with the company as a special adviser until March to ensure a seamless transition.\nAs part of the Board's strategy to help Cognizant achieve long-term sustainable growth, we also announced today a new Board appointment. Eric Branderiz, a proven financial executive and public company director with demonstrated experience supporting growth in technology in the energy industries, has been appointed to serve as an independent director on the Board. Eric brings significant experience in finance, accounting, M&A execution, risk management and ESG and corporate governance to Cognizant, and we welcome him to the Board.\nThe appointment comes as our Board continues to strive towards optimizing its balance of director skills and tenures as part of its ongoing refreshment program. With Eric's appointment, the Board has appointed 5 new independent directors over the last 4 years.\nMaureen Breakiron-Evans, a member of the Board since 2009, has also advised the Board that she will not stand for reelection at Cognizant's 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. On behalf of the entire Board, we thank her for her more than a decade of astute guidance, exceptional leadership and dedicated service to Cognizant.\nGiven these changes to the Board, our Governance Committee, our committee chairs and myself will perform a comprehensive evaluation of committee composition with an aim toward balancing representation of Board tenure and appropriate key skills and qualifications on our committees. These were topics that I, along with other members of the Board, had the pleasure of discussing with several of our largest investors during our annual governance road show in the fourth quarter.\nNow before I turn the call over to Ravi, let me share a little bit about our enthusiasm for his leadership. Over the past few years, Cognizant has navigated a dynamic uncertain market while strengthening its operational and financial fundamentals. Heading into 2023, the Board believes that Cognizant has established a solid operational foundation and now needs to move toward accelerating growth. This agenda requires a focused growth mindset driven from the C-Suite.\nRavi has this mindset. He brings a passion for building teams and driving growth in our industry, and we're confident that he's the right leader to take Cognizant into our next phase with a goal of ultimately delivering significant returns to our shareholders. Ravi also brings to Cognizant best-in-class operations, transformation and leadership expertise at a global scale from a stellar 20-year track record of emphasis. During his tenure, he oversaw the company's global services organization and drove growth across its global industry segments.\nRavi is a proven strategist who secured significant IT services deals. He led international business operations in India, Latin America, Japan and China, and he pioneered the creation of digital talent pools in the U.S., Europe and Australia. Importantly, during his time at Infosys, Ravi earned a reputation as a people-focused leader with a deep rooted commitment to teams and associates.\nSince he joined us a few weeks ago, Ravi has proven out this reputation as Cognizant associates have warmly welcomed into the team and are deeply enthusiastic about his leadership. We're confident that Ravi will help us further our efforts to support engagement and trust internally and drive retention amongst our high-performing leaders and associates.\nAs we look forward under Ravi's leadership, Cognizant will have a sharp focus on 2 key priorities: first, we'll be focused on meaningful acceleration of revenue growth; our second key priority will be ensuring that Cognizant is the employer of choice in our industry. Ravi is the right leader to achieve this vision, and the Board looks forward to partnering with him.\nI'll now turn the call over to Ravi to introduce himself and to share some additional perspective.\n\nRavi Kumar S\n\nCEO & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation\n\nThank you, Steve, for that very warm introduction. Good afternoon, everyone. My appointment as CEO is one of the proudest moments of my life. I'm excited as well as humbled by this opportunity to lead Cognizant, a company I've long admired, closely watched and competed against.\nAs I've experienced, Cognizant has a diverse, highly skilled and a fully engaged Board. I'm grateful for the Board's trust and support and for their efforts to lay the groundwork for me and the company to flourish. I'm also very grateful to my predecessor, Brian Humphries, who led the evolution of Cognizant's business. He refreshed and broadened the strategy, extended the company's portfolio and drove the implementation of more rigorous systems and processes.\nWith a very strong foundation in place, I'm not going back to the drawing board. Instead, I plan to move forward by building on and refining what already exists, which will include calibrating a thinking to a growth mindset. I want to see us offer the full breadth of our industry-specific solutions, whether developed organically or acquired through targeted acquisitions to a large installed base of clients and invest for growth.\nA few days after my appointment, I participated in Cognizant's annual sales kickoff, which was held in Abu Dhabi. At the summit, 1,000 of our client-facing associates came together from around the world to take stock of all of what we have and what we need to accelerate growth. I was so deeply moved by the warmth and the enthusiasm I was greeted with. We set ourselves a goal to be an employer of choice, which we believe will be a pivot for growth.\nI plan to spend the next several months meeting with so many associates, clients, partners and shareholders as much as I can. I will listen carefully with an open mind, build trust and learn all I can about how best to unlock more value for clients. Make progress in accelerating top-line growth and drive long-term shareholder value.\nBecause I like to be highly visible with clients and associates, my plan is to meet with 100 clients over 100 days, whether in person or virtually, and to visit with as many of our global teams as I can. Later this quarter, I'm spending several weeks in India and visiting associates at many of our locations across the country.\nHaving joined Cognizant just 3 weeks ago, I'm early in my learning curve and need time to get my hands on the pulse of the business. That said, I've already identified several areas that are tied to operating with a growth mindset to focus on immediately. Today, I will look to talk about 3 of those important areas: first, making Cognizant an employer of choice in its industry; second, strengthening our ability to win large deals; and third, enhancing our operating discipline.\nA quick word on each, starting with employee of choice. Spend time in the IT services industry, and you quickly realize that sustained success hinges on the quality, dedication and scale of our talent. The value we create for clients comes from the knowledge of the skills of our associates. Because the client experience and the employee experience are so tightly linked, we have the opportunity to create a self-reinforcing cycle.\nHighly engaged talent with a passion for clients and a growth mindset attract the best clients. These clients in turn, attract more of the best people, keeping the flywheel turning faster. That's why one of our goals and one of my specific important roles as a CEO is creating conditions for all our associates to excel.\nI'm committed to investing heavily in providing associates with continuous learning, upscaling and leadership development, all aimed at increasing the professional relevance. I believe the #1 factor that will define success for Cognizant is to become the employer of choice in our industry. Everything else must be based on that foundation, especially the ability to consistently deliver industry-leading growth, which is the absolute focus of the entire management team.\nLet's turn to large deals, which are another top priority given how essential they are to building commercial momentum and enhancing our station as a provider of business outcomes aligned by industry. Accelerating large deal bookings that will align with our risk appetite requires the client centricity and competitive self-confidence to work the corridors of our clients, cultivating and mining existing relationships while hunting for new ones and always showing up with an informed point of view.\nOver the last year or so, Cognizant has advanced its solutioning capabilities along with its project and program management processes. We have become better equipped to solution and manage large deals and plan to build on this foundation to reenergize our efforts. In particular, I want to instill a greater sense of pride and empowerment among our client partners and delivery teams to encourage a faster, more agile response to client needs.\nI have a weekly standing meeting during which I reviewed 10 large deals and do everything I can to help our teams to drive these deals over the finish line. Last week, we were pleased to announce the signing of a 10-year $1 billion renewal contract with a long-standing client, CoreLogic, demonstrating our capabilities and the confidence that clients placed in us.\nThe third area of focus is ensuring operational excellence across the company, including our approach to large deals and fulfillment in general. We are building out an organizational structure designed to bring together a continuum of activities such as industrialized delivery with high productivity rates, market competitive cost takeout initiatives, contract life cycle and risk management, consortium led deals and more.\nAs One Cognizant team, we are also working on internal simplification as a team. We will carry forward to help achieve the company's full potential. With the market for tech talent showing some early signs of improvement, we are working to optimize our fulfillment of existing engagements, unleash our entrepreneurial spirit and rejuvenate the growth mindset.\nSwitching gears for a moment. I would like to offer a few perspectives on the long-term demand environment for technology services. I believe we are in a golden era of technology and that software is the new alchemy for every business and industry. As the world prepares for a post-pandemic reset of the way we work and live our lives, we see more organizations accelerating their embrace of digital technologies.\nIndustries at lower levels of digital maturity like health care, life sciences and manufacturing are stepping up their tech intensity. While those that are more digitally mature like financial services, retail and communications are staying invested in digitizing the landscapes. We also interestingly see workplaces rapidly adapt digital technologies as employees get comfortable with continuously toggling between hybrid and physical workplaces.\nIn an era of globalization that has spanned several decades, enterprises have turned to tech services companies to enable the businesses to scale and globalize. Today, every industry is a tech industry. Technology will be deeply embedded in the core of every business, every product delivery service. Therefore, the use of deep software engineering capabilities to transform the core of businesses will be a big player for tech services firms like Cognizant. So too will be the market opportunity that comes from bond digital companies that outsource the technology core and operations.\nThe cloud, needless to say, will continue to remain the biggest gen-purpose technology we have seen in decades, and be deeply embedded as a digital pillar in every business. Cloud migration, modernization, application services will continue to create significant market momentum. Growth will also be driven by new cloud services like data on the cloud, data exchanges, new SaaS services and cloud security services.\nClients are aware of our deep alliances with the hyperscalers and new best-in-class SaaS companies as well as our ability to co-innovate with these partners. We truly believe clients will continue to turn to us to help orchestrate those cloud capabilities. The shift to the cloud and 5G have also accelerated IoT adoption as use cases grow with better connectivity and proliferating devices and that's core.\nLast week, we further bolstered our IoT embedded software engineering capabilities with our agreement to acquire Mobica, an IoT software engineering provider. Mobica also strengthens our near-shoring capabilities in Eastern Europe, which is home to nearly 8,000 of our associates. We see a strong push now to bring AI into business landscapes with the expectation that AI will reengineer enterprises as completely as enterprise software did 3 decades ago.\nOf course, as clients navigate a challenging macro environment now, they need to fund their investments in digital transformation by executing cost and efficiency agendas. These same clients are now asking how we can help them achieve their cost reduction ambitions and underwrite savings for their digital initiatives. Given our broad capabilities, we can help clients, whether they need to drive efficiency gains, innovation or an end-to-end transformation of the business.\nI quickly want to turn for a moment to India, home to about 3/4 of Cognizant's workforce. India is likely to be the world's technology talent hub for the next decade. India's population has a demographic profile and digital talent pool unmatched by any other country. And NASSCOM forecasts some 2 million IT professionals will be added to India's talent pool over the next 3 years.\nWe'll continue to capitalize on this surge in the IT talent in India as we intensify efforts to recruit from India's Tier 2 cities as well. Our large associate base in India is an ongoing source of strength and differentiation for Cognizant and one in which we will continue to invest.\nAs confident as I am in Cognizant's prospects, I'm fully aware, as we have signaled with our guidance for Q1, for quarter 1, that we have a great deal of work ahead of us. It will take time to rebuild the pipeline and go after larger opportunities. Please know we put a lot of thought into our decision to hold off on providing full year guidance.\nBut before making commitments I can stand behind, I really need to spend more time digging into the business and talking to associates and clients. Keep in mind that we are building on a strong foundation. We have a long-standing client relationships, a broad portfolio of industry-specific solutions, a robust and resilient global delivery network, a significant opportunity for international expansion and most important, a reenergized and highly motivated team.\nI intend to capitalize Cognizant's heritage culture of bold ambitions, our entrepreneur spirit that emphasizes being fast, agile and adaptable and of course, our camaraderie and teamwork. I'm super energized to lead Cognizant into the next era of growth, and I'll put everything I have into making this happen. As I've shared with all our associates, our mantra right now is to bring back growth and be the employer of choice.\nNow it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Jan, who will take you through the financial details of the quarter before we take over questions. Jan, over to you.\n\nJan Siegmund\n\nCFO, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation\n\nThank you, Ravi, and good evening, everyone. Fourth quarter and full year 2022 revenue were above the high end of the guidance range we provided on our third quarter earnings call in November and in line with the revised expectations we provided on January 12. Operating margin was negatively impacted by the previously disclosed noncash charge in the quarter, which I will cover in more detail later.\nOutside of this charge, we were pleased with the continued progress towards our operating margin goals driven by commercial discipline, the depreciation of the Indian rupee and SG&A leverage. During the quarter, we made progress improving fulfillment, driven in part by a meaningful reduction in voluntary attrition, which declined to 19% on a quarterly annualized basis from 29% last quarter.\nThis has allowed us to further decrease subcontracted usage and will enable us to put greater focus on driving improved commercial momentum in the quarters ahead. That said, the macro environment remains uncertain, and we continue to see pockets of weakness across several key verticals.\nNow moving on to the details for the quarter. Fourth quarter revenue was $4.8 billion, representing an increase of 1.3% year-over-year or 4.1% in constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 40 basis points of growth from our acquisitions and a negative 60 basis points impact from the sale of Samlink completed at the beginning of 2022. Full year 2022 revenue was $19.4 billion, representing an increase of 5% year-over-year or 7.5% in constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 100 basis points of growth from acquisitions and a negative 60 basis points impact from the sale of Samlink.\nIn Q4, digital revenue grew 4% year-over-year or 7% in constant currency. This resulted in full year 2022 digital revenue growth of 11% or 13% in constant currency. Digital mix was unchanged from last quarter at 51%, up 2 points from the prior year period. Q4 bookings increased 12% year-over-year, including the large agreement with CoreLogic that we announced last week.\nThis opportunity is primarily a renewal of existing work with some modest increase in scope during the latter years of the contract. For the full year, we recorded bookings of $24.1 billion and a book-to-bill of approximately 1.2x, unchanged from the trailing 12-month book-to-bill we reported last quarter. Outside the large renewal, bookings momentum remains muted exiting this year. This has put pressure on our Q1 outlook, which I will cover shortly.\nMoving on now to segment results in the fourth quarter, where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Within Financial Services, revenue declined 1%, reflecting a negative impact of 180 basis points related to the previously disclosed sale of our Samlink subsidiary. This was partially offset by growth among public sector clients in the U.K. and insurance clients.\nThe revenue weakness is being driven by our Banking and Financial Services practice, which we expect will remain under pressure for the next several quarters. Ravi, the entire team and I are laser-focused on reevaluating our go-to-market strategy, enhancing the strength of this portfolio and have initiated a series of actions, including certain leadership changes that we believe will give us the best opportunity to improve our performance.\nWe are seeing early signs of success with select global banking relationships where we have successfully shifted our portfolio mix towards higher growth in strategic areas. This gives us confidence that we are moving in the right direction. However, more meaningful improvements will take time to implement. Health Services revenue grew 5%, consistent with last quarter. We experienced similar growth among both Healthcare and Life Sciences clients, which partially reflects some normalization of demand that had been driven by COVID.\nAs we discussed last quarter, we have seen some pockets of softness within the segment, driven by the macro environment and regulatory complexity. Despite these challenges, we continue to review our Health Sciences capability as industry-leading and remain excited about the growth opportunities over the medium term.\nProducts and Resources revenue grew 7%, a modest deceleration from last quarter. Revenue was negatively impacted by slower growth among manufacturing, retail and consumer goods customers, which we believe primarily reflected the softening of the macro environment. This was offset by continued strength among consumer goods, automotive, logistics and utility customers.\nCommunications, Media and Technology revenue grew 9%. Growth again was led by our technology business, where our work with digital native clients has driven growth in our core portfolio. Our growth has moderated somewhat as growth among some of our largest clients have slowed but remains positive. We are closely monitoring trends and developments affecting the tech industry.\nContinuing with year-over-year growth in constant currency from a geographic perspective in Q4. North American revenue grew 3%. Growth was led by CMT and Health Sciences. Our global growth markets, or GGM, which includes all revenue outside of North America, grew approximately 8%. It also included a negative 220 basis points impact from the sale of Samlink. Growth was again led by the U.K., which grew 16% and included double-digit growth in Financial Services, including public sector clients.\nNow moving on to margins. In Q4, our GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 14.2% as there were no non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, both GAAP and adjusted operating margins declined by 110 basis points. This includes the previously disclosed negative 120 basis point impact from a noncash impairment of capitalized costs related to a large volume-based contract with a Health Sciences customer.\nOur operating margin benefited from SG&A leverage, while gross margin pressure from increased compensation costs was partially offset by delivery efficiencies and disciplined pricing. We also experienced a meaningful tailwind from the depreciation of the Indian rupee, which represented an approximate 110 basis point benefit net of hedges year-over-year.\nOur GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 27%. Adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 26.8%. Q4 diluted GAAP EPS was $1.02 and Q4 adjusted EPS was $1.01, down 7% and 8%, respectively. GAAP and adjusted earnings per share were each negatively impacted by $0.08 in connection with the impairment of capitalized costs related to a large volume-based contract with the Health Sciences customer.\nNow turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.5 billion or net cash of $1.9 billion. DSO of 74 days was flat sequentially and increased by 5 days year-over-year. Free cash flow in Q4 was $612 million, representing approximately 115% of net income. This brings full year free cash flow to $2.2 billion, representing approximately 100% of net income, in line with our expectations.\nWe are pleased with our performance in '22. However, a change in U.S. tax law that became effective last year now requires companies to capitalize rather than currently deduct R&D expenses. As a result, like many other companies, this will impact our free cash flow in 2023. We expect capitalization of R&D costs for tax purposes to negatively impact free cash flow by $600 million, which includes deferred payments for the 2022 tax year as well as increased payments for 2023. With this change, we expect our cash conversion ratio to be below our target of 100% of net income in 2023.\nMoving on to capital deployment. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 5 million shares for $300 million under our share repurchase program and returned $139 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. This brings total capital return to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends to $2 billion for the full year.\nIn the quarter, we also completed 2 acquisitions: Austin CSI and Integration for a total purchase price of approximately $370 million. In addition, we announced the acquisitions of Mobica and the professional services and management practices of OneSource Virtual. These acquisitions are expected to improve our digital revenue mix, enhance our consulting capabilities.\nOur capital allocation framework remains unchanged. Over the longer term, we continue to expect to deploy a balanced capital allocation policy, returning to an aggregate of approximately 50% of free cash flow to shareholders in form of dividends and share repurchases and allocating the remaining 50% to inorganic investments.\nTurning to our forward outlook. As Ravi mentioned, and you will see in our earnings materials, we are only providing revenue guidance for the first quarter of 2023. Given our bookings momentum in 2022 and the uncertain macroeconomic environment, we expect our full year 2023 performance to be below the multiyear goals we provided in late 2021. We intend to provide an update on the full year 2023 expectations for revenue and adjusted operating margin next quarter.\nFor the first quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $4.71 billion to $4.76 billion, representing a year-over-year decline of minus 2.5% to minus 1.5% or a decline of minus 1% to flat in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a negative 150 basis points impact as well as an inorganic contribution of approximately 100 basis points.\nWe look forward to sharing more as Ravi continues to get up to speed. As he discussed, we remain very excited about the medium-term market opportunity. We also believe that while the current macroeconomic uncertainty has led to some pockets of slowdown, it also presents an opportunity for Cognizant to help our clients operate more efficiently while continuing to invest in new digital capabilities.\nWith that, we will open the call for your questions."

(Operator Instructions) Thank you.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tyler Scott, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nTyler J. Scott\n\nSenior Director of IR, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation\n\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release and investor supplement for the company's third quarter 2022 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com.\nThe speakers we have on today's call are Brian Humphries, Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.\nAdditionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.\nWith that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Brian Humphries. Please go ahead, Brian.\n\nBrian Humphries\n\nCEO & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation\n\nThank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everyone. Third quarter revenue was $4.9 billion, up 5.6% year-over-year in constant currency, short of our expectations. Adjusted operating margin grew 90 basis points sequentially and 60 basis points year-over-year to 16.4% of revenue. While a non-certain macroeconomic backdrop impacted bookings and revenue, the primary driver of the revenue shortfall relates to a reduction in U.S. onshore billable resources in recent quarters, following a period of elevated attrition, a reduction in visa travel and a COVID-induced shift in the near and offshore delivery centers. Financial impact of this headcount reduction is magnified given this is our highest revenue and margin dollar per head population.\nTo reverse this trend, we have already initiated a series of actions that are intended to increase U.S. onshore billable resources, including enhanced focus on lateral hires and subcontractors, accelerated visa travel and targeted compensation programs. While these actions are gaining traction, it is somewhat slower than previously anticipated. We, therefore, expect these headwinds to continue in the fourth quarter ahead of clearer progress in Q1.\nLet me now turn your attention to global third quarter voluntary attrition, which was a little higher than expected in the quarter. Voluntary attrition fell 2 points sequentially to 29% on an annualized basis and fell 3 points sequentially on a trailing 12-month basis.\nWe've taken extensive actions to increase employee engagement and reduce attrition over the past year. These initiatives, coupled with an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, have led to reduced daily resignations, a leading indicator of voluntary attrition across the globe in the last 4 months. We expect sequential reductions in voluntary attritions to be more meaningful in the fourth quarter.\nTo maintain positive momentum on resignations, we are continuing our comprehensive effort to attract, retain and rally employees. We remain focused on our people strategy, which includes our refined promotion initiative, learning and development, and enhanced compensation and benefits programs. For instance, we recently communicated to our associates that we will accelerate next year's merit cycle to the second quarter of 2023, meaning we will have 2 merit cycles in the space of 6 months for most of our associates.\nI would like to now discuss the macroeconomic environment, which Jan will also address in our fourth quarter guidance. We see clients closely scrutinizing and slowing their investment decisions faced with a backdrop of uncertain economic conditions. Then it's been reduced on lower-priority projects or those with a longer return on investment. We're seeing some early signs of slowing in discretionary digital projects.\nIndustry-wise, we've seen weakness in banking, especially in the mortgage segment, health sciences and retail. In our international business, the U.K. remains solid, but deal cycles are slowing, while Continental Europe is showing signs of weakness.\nFrom a commercial point of view, despite a strategy to sell solution and deliver client outcomes, we remain exposed to time and material engagements across all industries. We've seen clients curtailing their spending, and we expect furloughs to impact the fourth quarter. These factors contributed to a decline in bookings of 2% year-over-year in the third quarter, representing an in-period book-to-bill ratio of 1.0x and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2x on a trailing 12-month basis.\nTurning now to our industry segment performance. Financial Services grew 1.6% year-over-year in constant currency, led by growth in our insurance business. This includes a negative impact of 180 basis points from the exit of Samlink. In insurance, carriers of all lines of business are enhancing their digital capabilities, driven by demand for new insurance products and improved user experience. For example, Resolution Life U.S. turned to us to execute several digital transformation initiatives that include large-scale data and application core modernization and cloud migrations. We're also helping them develop and scale advanced capabilities in data and analytics to drive significant operational efficiencies in our closed book portfolio.\nWe were selected by AXA UK & Ireland as a technology partner to help consolidate, modernize and manage a part of their IT operations. AXA is transforming its technology ecosystem to create a more digitally enabled modern and agile environment that's data-rich, secure and sustainable.\nHealth Sciences revenue grew 5.5% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by digital services among pharmaceutical and health care payer clients. I'm pleased to note that our shared investigator platform, a SaaS solution for pharmaceutical companies that streamlines clinical trials to improve the speed of drug discovery, has surpassed 250,000 users across 100 countries worldwide. Kyowa Kirin, a Japanese pharmaceutical and biotechnology company, has signed a multiyear agreement with Cognizant to provide global pharmacovigilance services and help improve patient health through the analysis of adverse reactions across its products.\nIn Products and Resources, revenue grew 8.2% year-over-year in constant currency. Growth was driven by demand for our digital services among logistics, automotive, consumer goods and travel and hospitality clients. During the quarter, we extended our long-standing relationship with Centrica, the U.K.'s largest supplier of energy and energy services, deliver business-critical services encompassing application testing, client infrastructure support and IT infrastructure management.\nCommunications, Media and Technology revenue grew 10.4% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by strength among digital-native clients. We're expanding our collaboration with Qualcomm to accelerate digital transformation through a new 5G experience center in Atlanta. The collaboration combines our deep expertise in 5G, IoT, cloud and data analytics with Qualcomm's intelligent edge devices, AI and 5G connectivity solutions.\nWe've also had our first substantial win in the legal sector, which has traditionally been a latecomer to outsourcing and digital services. Freshfields selected us to manage their global IT operations and support their ambitious global expansion plans. We'll be providing 24/7 managed service of the firmed IT infrastructure applications as well as managing its service desk. Cognizant will also help define Freshfields' technology transformation road map.\nAs I mentioned in our last earnings call, targeted M&A remains an important tool for enhancing our competitiveness. We have several M&A targets in the pipeline in line with our strategy and capital allocation framework. As always, we continue to focus on opportunities which are value-accretive to Cognizant shareholders and align with our strategy.\nYesterday, we announced an agreement to acquire the professional services and application management practices of OneSource Virtual, a Workday partner based in Dallas. These practices will complement our existing finance and HR advisory services on the Workday Cloud Platform. The acquisition is anticipated to close by year-end 2022, subject to satisfaction of closing conditions. At which stage, we expect to welcome nearly 400 new employees to our strategic Workday practice.\nImportantly, we continue to strengthen our leadership team. Last month, we named Ravi Kumar President of Cognizant Americas. He will join us in mid-January from Infosys, where he served as President for the past 6 years. Ravi brings client centricity and a growth mindset that we believe will help improve our U.S. revenue trajectory.\nWe also announced Prasad Sankaran as the new Head of our Software & Platform Engineering Practice. Prasad joined us yesterday from Bain, where he was a Senior Vice President in the firm's Enterprise Technology Global Practice. Prior to that, he spent 25 years in senior leadership roles with Accenture. Both announcements speak highly of our ability to attract world-class talent and support 2 key strategic areas for Cognizant, the Americas region and leading enterprise technology transformation.\nBefore passing the call to Jan, I would like to stress that while we're in a period of economic uncertainty, the entire leadership team knows we must execute better on things that we can control, including optimizing resources globally and getting the right mix on- and offshore in a dynamic demand environment.\nWe will continue to focus on and hone our operational discipline, which is intended to enable us to adapt quickly to demand changes. While we're in an uncertain macroeconomic environment, we remain highly optimistic on the key services market and our opportunity within it.\nFinally, following sustained progress in reducing voluntary resignation rates, we expect sequential reductions in voluntary attrition to be more meaningful in the fourth quarter, allowing us to repivot client conversations from fulfillment to innovation, strategic transformation and growth.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jan, who will cover the details of our quarter and our fourth quarter financial outlook before we take your questions.\n\nJan Siegmund\n\nCFO, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation\n\nThank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Q3 revenue was below our guidance range, driven primarily by lower billable headcount in North America. Higher-than-expected attrition, coupled with strong competition for talent in North America, made it challenging for us to maintain required staffing levels to meet our revenue forecast. An uncertain macroeconomic backdrop led to pockets of bookings and revenue weaknesses in certain industries.\nThe weaker-than-expected revenue performance was offset by commercial discipline, the benefit from the depreciation of the Indian rupee and SG&A leverage, which resulted in sequential and year-over-year operating margin expansion.\nNow moving on to the details for the quarter. Q3 revenue was $4.9 billion, representing an increase of 2.4% year-over-year or 5.6% in constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 40 basis points of growth from our acquisitions and a negative 60 basis points impact from the sale of Samlink completed at the beginning of this year.\nIn Q3, digital revenue, as reported, grew 7% year-over-year or 11% at constant currency. Digital represented approximately 51% of total revenue for the quarter, up 2 points from the prior year period. Our slower digital revenue growth reflected the expected lower inorganic contribution we discussed last quarter and the lower billable headcount in North America mentioned earlier.\nThese factors and softening demand environment also contributed to a bookings performance below our expectations. Q3 bookings declined 2% year-over-year and represented an in-period book-to-bill of approximately 1x. This resulted in a trailing 12-month bookings of $23.1 million and a book-to-bill of approximately 1.2x, unchanged from Q2.\nBrian has already taken us through the segment performance, but I will spend a minute discussing several trends we are seeing emerge across our 2 largest segments. Within Financial Services, banking revenue growth slowed this quarter. This portfolio has a higher mix of time and material business, which we believe is more vulnerable to changes in the economic outlook of our clients.\nAdditionally, mortgage clients have been impacted by rising interest rates, which has a negative impact on our results. These headwinds were offset by continued growth within insurance, particularly within property and casualty, where we are seeing good traction in both middle market and large global carriers. We're continuing to invest and strengthen our banking and financial services portfolio to improve the revenue trajectory over the medium term.\nWithin Health Sciences, our growth was again driven by demand for digital services among pharmaceutical companies. Health care payer growth was consistent with last quarter, and we have seen the ramp-up of integration-related services following the softer product growth earlier this year. However, the health care industry has not been immune to pressures driven by the macro uncertainty as we have seen softer demand both across health care payer and life sciences.\nClients are slowing discretionary spending as they await greater clarity on the economy and navigate an increasingly complex regulatory environment.\nContinuing with the year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency, from a geographic perspective in Q3, North America revenue grew 4%. Growth was led by CMT and Health Sciences. Our global growth markets, or GGM, which consists of all revenue outside of North America, grew approximately 10%, including a negative 220 basis point impact from the sale of Samlink. Growth was again led by the U.K., up 19%, which had a strong double-digit growth within Financial Services, including public sector clients.\nNow moving on to margins. In Q3, our GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 16.4% as there were no non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, GAAP operating margin increased by 100 basis points, and adjusted operating margin increased by 60 basis points.\nYear-over-year, margin expansion was primarily driven by SG&A leverage, while gross margin pressure from increased compensation costs was partially offset by delivering efficiencies and disciplined pricing. We also experienced a meaningful tailwind from the depreciation of the Indian rupee, delivering an approximate 80 basis points of benefit, net of hedges year-over-year.\nOur GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 22.5%, which included the benefit from a discrete tax item in the quarter. Adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 25.2%. Q3 diluted GAAP EPS was $1.22 and Q3 adjusted EPS was $1.17, up 18% and 10% year-over-year, respectively.\nNow turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.7 billion or net cash of $2.1 billion. Free cash flow in Q3 was $953 million, representing approximately 150% of net income, in line with our expectation. This brings year-to-date free cash flow to $1.6 billion or 92% of net income. DSO of 74 days was flat sequentially and increased by 2 days year-over-year.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased 5 million shares for $300 million under our share repurchase program and returned $141 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. This brings total capital return to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends to approximately $1.5 billion through the first 9 months of 2022.\nTurning to our forward outlook. We are revising our full year guidance downward, which reflects headwinds from currency, lower North America billable headcount, which we expect to take several quarters to improve, and softer-than-expected bookings growth. Offsetting these factors are several tailwinds, including sustained reductions in resignations globally and our expectation for lower attrition in the fourth quarter.\nFor Q4, we expect revenue in the range of $4.72 billion to $4.77 billion, representing year-over-year decline of 0.2% to 1.2% or growth of 2% to 3% in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a negative 320 basis points impact as well as an inorganic contribution of approximately 30 basis points.\nTogether, these factors contribute to our revised full year revenue guidance of approximately $19.3 billion, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 4.5% or 7% in constant currency. This assumes approximately 100 basis points of inorganic contribution. Our reported revenue outlook now assumes a negative 260 basis points of impact from currency versus 220 basis points previously. This compares to our prior full year revenue guidance of $19.7 billion to $19.9 billion, which represented growth of 6.3% to 7.3% or 8.5% to 9.5% in constant currency.\nWe expect our full year operating margin to be approximately 15.6% at the low end of our prior range. This implies Q4 adjusted operating margin of around 15.3% at the midpoint of our EPS range, reflecting the reduced revenue outlook and the annual merit cycle for most employees that is effective October 1.\nOur full year outlook assumes interest income of approximately $50 million versus $35 million previously, reflecting higher interest rates. We still expect average shares outstanding of approximately 519 million, unchanged. Our tax guidance of 24% to 25% is unchanged.\nFinally, our revised full year adjusted EPS guidance of $4.43 to $4.46 represents growth of approximately 7% to 8%. This compares to prior guidance of $4.51 to $4.57. Our longer-term capital allocation framework remains unchanged.\nWe are pleased to announce our agreement to acquire the professional services and application management practices of OneSource Virtual yesterday, and we expect our acquisition pipelines to remain active. Our share repurchase assumption for the full year is unchanged at $1.2 billion. As always, this remains subject to market conditions and other factors.\nIn support of our balanced capital deployment strategy, the Board has also approved a $2 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization, which brings our total remaining authorization to over $3 billion as of today. We are also still targeting full year free cash flow conversion of approximately 100% of net income.\nBefore opening the call for questions, I want to reinforce that the leadership team is focused on addressing the operational challenges impacting our recent results. We are also closely monitoring macroeconomic factors to help enable us to quickly respond to changes in the demand environment. Longer term, we remain confident in our market opportunity.\nWith that, we will open the call for your questions."

(Operator Instructions) After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)\nThank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tyler Scott, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. You may begin your presentation.\n\nTyler J. Scott\n\nSenior Director of IR, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation\n\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. By now you should have received a copy of the earnings release and the investor supplement for the company's second quarter 2022 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Brian Humphries, Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.\nAdditionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures or appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Brian Humphries. Please go ahead, Brian.\n\nBrian Humphries\n\nCEO & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation\n\nThank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to comment on several topics today, notably our second quarter performance, the demand and pricing environment and labor market dynamics. Let's start with our second quarter performance which was balanced.\nSecond quarter revenue was $4.9 billion, up 9.5% year-over-year in constant currency. Growth was led by digital. Second quarter operating margin was 15.5%, up 50 basis points sequentially, in line with our expectations. Financial leverage driven by sequential revenue growth, disciplined expense management, currency benefits and the optimization of pyramid, shoring and fulfillment helped offset the impact of attrition and labor cost inflationary pressure.\nOur industry segment performance remained largely consistent. Financial Services grew 5.1% year-over-year in constant currency, led by insurance growth. This includes a negative impact of 190 basis points from the exit of Samlink.\nWe continue to make progress strengthening client relationships in financial services. Earlier in the second quarter, I visited clients in Germany and celebrated a new logo win with Zurich Insurance Germany. Cognizant will help them simplify, modernize and manage their enterprise application landscape by establishing joint DevOps teams and working to extend the insurer's AI, data, software engineering and cloud capabilities.\nIn insurance, [CCT Intelligence Solutions], whose SaaS platform powers the property and casualty insurance industry, asked for our help in enabling their cloud transformation program. We led with our enterprise DevOps and cloud transformation consultancy and partnered with Microsoft to present a comprehensive solution. This prompted the client to also select us to build next-generation analytics and telematics solutions that are expected to be key to their long-term leadership.\nIn the second quarter, we combined our Healthcare and Life Sciences operating segments into a single operating segment called Health Sciences and naturally dilution given the market conversions across these industries. Health Sciences grew 7.6% year-over-year in constant currency, with growth driven by pharmaceutical clients and sustained momentum in our TriZetto product portfolio.\nCommonwealth Care Alliance, an integrated care system serving over 60,000 members across numerous U.S. states, illustrates our momentum in TriZetto. Our end-to-end business process innovation powered by TriZetto solutions and a BPaaS engagement is fully integrated from enrollment and billing through claims. Through our partnership, Commonwealth Care now has the tools needed to compete in the digital health ecosystem and support value-based personalized care for its members.\nWe've also signed a new multiyear agreement with Organon, a global women's health company to help improve the delivery of health care products and crucial medicinal supply chain management. We'll help Organon scale its health care business by delivering full stack industrial technology support for its global pharmaceutical manufacturing sites in the U.K., Netherlands, Belgium and Indonesia.\nWe continue to see excellent growth in Products and Resources, where revenue grew 11.6% year-over-year in constant currency, driven in part by strength among automotive, logistics, retail and consumer goods clients. As a strategic partner for digital, we're helping Albertsons Companies, a $70 billion grocery retailer, make their move to a cloud-based infrastructure model, enabling innovation and improved customer experiences, both in-store and across last-mile delivery.\nIn Communications, Media and Technology, we had another quarter of excellent growth. Revenue grew 19.5% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by technology clients and new client acquisition. DocuSign is an example of a new logo win. They selected Cognizant as the preferred partner for global customer support operations across all products and services from their flagship e-signature product to newer contract life cycle management products. DocuSign turned to us because of the distinctive solution proposed by our intuitive operations and automation practice, including cutting-edge omnichannel customer support and outcome-based commercial models.\nA quick word on our recently announced organizational evolution. In July, we announced the combination of our practice areas with delivery practices, which simplifies our model by bringing Cognizant in line with industry norms. This enables us to have end-to-end accountability across 4 integrated practices from vision, road map, offerings and capabilities, including M&A and post-merger integration through to presale solutioning and delivery. I believe this will assist our industry teams to be more successful with our clients as we sell solution and deliver client outcomes. I also believe that our industry capabilities provide differentiation that we can unlock value for clients at the intersection of industry use cases and technology.\nMoving now to the demand and pricing environment. While we are carefully monitoring the potential impact of a worsening economy on our pipeline, to date, we've not seen any significant slowdown for IT services demand. That said, as we serve some of the largest clients in the world, we are aware that should they see slowing earnings growth, nonessential projects or those with longer ROI may be paused. I am confident that the breadth of our portfolio enables us to serve our clients' needs for higher levels of agility, innovation, resilience and indeed, efficiency. So regardless of what the coming quarters bring, our value proposition to clients remains.\nMore generally, digital transformation has become so essential and foundational to most companies, regardless of their industry, that despite some macro demand uncertainty in the short term, I remain optimistic on IT services' growth prospects in the medium to long term. In fact, the bigger challenges we are faced with as an industry are the demand and supply imbalance on key digital skills, elevated attrition and labor cost inflationary pressure.\nI would like to thank our associates around the world who've been working hard to navigate these challenges, all whilst trying to optimize fulfillment and pricing. Achieving the perfect balance is not always easy. And in the second quarter, while I'm pleased that we drove both year-over-year and sequential margin expansion, I suspect that our focus on fulfillment optimization and pricing marginally impacted top line performance and hurt bookings momentum. Second quarter bookings declined 3% year-over-year, below our assumptions entering the quarter. While we continue to have a robust book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.2x revenue on a trailing 12-month basis, by better balancing the factors just mentioned, we aim to accelerate bookings growth in [every] quarters, whilst nonetheless achieving our committed margin expansion.\nJust a word now on pricing. Market pricing dynamics remain consistent. Clients, through their vendor exposure and their internal teams, are privy to demand/supply imbalances across key digital skills and labor cost inflationary pressure. This, coupled with the pent-up demand for digital transformation, means clients are more predisposed to engage in price increase discussions. Clients are willing to pay for skills and innovation, with efficiencies, including automation and optimized delivery mix, are expected to mitigate cost increases.\nWe continue to execute against a pricing initiative to offset labor cost inflationary pressure, with benefits starting to be felt but greater impact expected in the coming quarters, recognizing that pricing power stemming from talent shortages will lag behind talent-related cost increases.\nLet's move now to labor market dynamics, including attrition and inflationary pressure. Second quarter voluntary attrition rose 5 points to 31% on an annualized basis or 32% on a trailing 12-month basis. This increase was slightly above the seasonal uptick we anticipated entering the quarter, impacting second quarter revenue performance. While we have seen some signs of improvement in July resignation rates, we continue to expect elevated attrition for the remainder of the year.\nAs I've mentioned on prior calls, attracting, retaining and rallying our talented employees is one of our top priorities. In the past year, we've invested record levels in compensation, overhauled our promotion process, invested heavily in our learning and development initiatives and introduced a series of other measures, including educational programs and returnships.\nOur internal Job Moves program, which facilitates ongoing upward mobility in the company, is one factor that enables us to mitigate the need for and indeed the cost pressure of lateral hires, all whilst improving morale. We've also recognized how important flexibility is to our associates and have, therefore, communicated a hybrid model will define our approach to work. Our priority is to be a welcoming, inclusive, equitable company for everyone no matter their work location. Our clients and associate-centric company aims to strike a balance between how clients want to interact with us and the flexibility we seek, all while maintaining a focus on employee engagement, collaboration, our values and a culture of continuous learning.\nI'm pleased to see that our efforts on employee engagement are working. In recent weeks, we completed our annual engagement survey that showed significant increases in our engagement scores, positioning us above industry benchmarks.\nIn closing, as we execute our strategy, we were operating with 3 clear priorities: first, execute our vision to become the preeminent technology services partner to the Global 2000 C-suite; second, rally and engage our associates around the world; and third, drive profitable growth. Despite some near-term macro demand uncertainty and the challenges of navigating today's labor markets, let's not forget that we are in at the early stages, of what we expect to be a massive digital build-out. Thanks to our portfolio and our talented employees around the world, we believe that we will be a strategic beneficiary as companies embrace digital operating models.\nFinally, as we reposition Cognizant towards selling, solutioning and delivering industry-aligned solutions, enabled by targeted advisory capabilities, our margin potential will be strengthened in line with our brand repositioning to higher-value services.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jan, who will cover the details of the quarter and our financial outlook before we take your questions. Jan, over to you.\n\nJan Siegmund\n\nCFO, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation\n\nThank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone.\nWhile our Q2 revenue growth was slightly below the midpoint of our guidance range, we delivered sequential margin expansion in line with our expectation, while continuing to invest into our talented people. We remain focused on profitable revenue growth.\nMoving on to results. Q2 revenue was $4.9 billion, representing an increase of 7% year-over-year or 9.5% at constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 110 basis points of growth from our recent acquisitions and a negative 60 basis points impact from the sale of Samlink completed February 1.\nIn Q2, digital revenue, as reported, grew 13% year-over-year and included FX headwinds of approximately 250 basis points, consistent with the total company. At quarter end, digital represented approximately 50% of total revenue, up 3 points from the prior year period.\nIn addition to the FX headwinds, slowing of digital growth reflected lower inorganic contribution and elevated attrition, in particular, in North America. Despite these headwinds, we were pleased with the growth across our digital battlegrounds, which outpaced the total digital growth.\nAs Brian mentioned, Q2 bookings declined 3% year-over-year. This resulted in trailing 12 months bookings of $23.2 billion, which represented a book-to-bill of approximately 1.2, unchanged from Q1. Despite the softer-than-expected growth, we continue to believe this book-to-bill provides us a healthy opportunity to support our revenue growth outlook for 2022. We expect to improve bookings growth in the quarters ahead.\nMoving on to segment results for the second quarter, where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial services revenue increased approximately 5%. Q2 growth included a negative 190 basis points impact from the sale of our Samlink subsidiary. Our recovery within financial services remains largely in line with our expectation, driven by continued strength in our North America regional banking portfolio, growth in the U.K. and steady performance within insurance globally.\nHealth Sciences revenue increased approximately 8%, driven by demand for digital services among pharmaceutical companies. Demand among health care clients was consistent with last quarter. Momentum continued in our integrated software solutions.\nProducts and Resources revenue increased approximately 12%, driven by growth across all segments and included approximately 260 basis points contribution from recently completed acquisitions. This compares to the approximately 500 basis points contribution we reported in Q1 of this year. Based on the current portfolio of closed acquisitions, we expect the inorganic contribution to be immaterial to segment performance beginning in Q3.\nCommunications, Media & Technology or CMT revenue grew approximately 20%, primarily organically, including growth from new clients. This reflects growing demand for data services and our work with leading digital-native clients. We also continue to experience strong demand for our intuitive operations and automation services, which includes our BPO business.\nFrom a geographic perspective in Q2, North America revenue grew 9% year-over-year. Growth was led by CMT and Life Sciences clients. Our global growth markets, which includes all revenue outside of North America, grew approximately 12% year-over-year in constant currency, which included a negative 240 basis points impact from the sale of Samlink.\nGrowth was led again by the U.K., which grew 25% and included strong double-digit growth within financial services, including public sector clients, Products and Resources and CMT. We continue to see significant opportunities for growth in our GGM business and do not believe that we are hitting our full potential yet.\nNow moving on to margins. In Q2, our GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 15.5%, as there were no non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, operating margin increased by approximately 30 basis points, in line with our expectations. This included improvement in gross margin, driven in part by a balanced execution and our focus on profitable revenue growth. We also experienced a benefit from the depreciation of the rupee against the dollar and a modest benefit from our recent pricing initiatives.\nAdditionally, we were pleased with the SG&A leverage we drove in the quarter. Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 24.2%, and adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 22.2%, which benefited from a discrete tax benefit related to our unrepatriated accumulated foreign earnings, driven by the depreciation of the rupee. Q2 diluted GAAP EPS was $1.11, and Q2 adjusted EPS was $1.14, up 14% and 18% year-over-year, respectively.\nNow turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.3 billion or net cash of $1.7 billion. Free cash flow in Q2 was $485 million, representing approximately 84% of net income, in line with our expectation. This brings year-to-date free cash flow to $671 million. DSO of 74 days increased by 2 days sequentially, driven in part by seasonality and by 3 days year-over-year. We expect to improve DSO in the second half of the year.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares for $300 million under our share repurchase program and returned $141 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. This brings total capital return to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends to over $1 billion through the first half of 2022.\nTurning to guidance. Our outlook for the remainder of the year assumes that we will continue to balance margin performance and revenue growth. For Q3, we expect revenue in the range of $4.98 billion to $5.03 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 5% to 6% or 7.5% to 8.5% in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a negative 250 basis points impact as well as an inorganic contribution of approximately 50 basis points, which reflects the lower-than-anticipated M&A activity compared with our assumptions in prior full year guidance.\nFor the full year, we are lowering the midpoint of our constant currency revenue growth guidance by about 1 point, which reflects, in part, the impact we have had while navigating the current industry supply/demand imbalances, elevated attrition and softer-than-expected hiring, particularly in North America. However, we are maintaining our margin expansion guidance, which reflects prioritization of profitable growth, pricing initiatives and the rigor that we have put around SG&A.\nOur full year revenue, we still expect inorganic growth to contribute approximately 100 basis points to growth, unchanged from prior guidance. This assumes an immaterial contribution from future unannounced acquisitions in Q4. Our reported revenue outlook now assumes a negative 220 basis points impact from currency versus 180 basis points previously. This leads to a revised reported revenue guidance in the range of $19.7 billion to $19.9 billion, representing 6.3% to 7.3% growth or 8.5% to 9.5% growth in constant currency. This compares to our prior guidance of $19.8 billion to $20.2 billion, which represented growth of 7.2% to 9.2% or 9% to 11% in constant currency.\nOur longer-term capital allocation framework is unchanged. Today's uncertain macroeconomic backdrop has the potential to create a mismatch of valuation expectations between buyers and sellers as well as challenging synergy assumptions. Despite these dynamics, our pipeline remains active, and we expect to announce deals towards the end of this year. However, these factors have led us to deploy less capital than anticipated on M&A. Therefore, we are revising our capital allocation plans for the remainder of 2022. We now expect to return at least $1.2 billion through share repurchases for the full year, up from our commitment of at least $600 million last quarter. As always, this remains subject to market conditions and other factors. Given the strength of our balance sheet and expected free cash flow generation, we do not expect liquidity will restrict our ability to execute against our M&A pipeline for the remainder of the year.\nAs I mentioned earlier, our adjusted operating margin outlook is unchanged, and we continue to expect approximately 20 to 30 basis points of expansion versus 2021. Our outlook for operating margin continues to assume industry supply side constraints, elevated attrition for the remainder of the year. Headwinds to operating margins include increased compensation costs, T&E and a return-to-office costs, which we expect to offset through delivery efficiencies, digital revenue mix, pricing and SG&A leverage and discipline.\nOur guidance assumes continued sequential margin expansion in Q3 before the impact of our annual merit cycle in Q4. Our full year outlook assumes interest income of approximately $35 million versus $25 million previously, reflecting higher interest rates. Based on our increased share repurchase activity, we now expect average shares outstanding of approximately 519 million versus 522 million shares previously. We also now expect a tax rate of 24% to 25% versus 25% to 26%, reflecting lower year-to-date performance. This leads to our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $4.51 to $4.57, up approximately 9% to 11% year-over-year. This compares to $4.45 to $4.55 previously. Finally, we are still targeting full year free cash flow conversion of approximately 100% of net income.\nWith that, we will open the call for your questions?"

Please go ahead, Brian.\n\nBrian Humphries\n\nCEO & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation\n\nThank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks to our talented employees, we delivered on our first quarter commitments in what continues to be an intensely competitive global labor market. First quarter revenue was $4.8 billion, up 10.9% year-over-year in constant currency, above the midpoint of our first quarter guidance of 10.2% to 11.2% growth. Growth was led by digital, which grew 20% year-over-year and now represents 50% of our revenue. We had another exceptional quarter in digital business operations, which continues to meaningfully outgrow the BPO market reflecting momentum in intelligent process automation and digital-native clients.\nFirst quarter operating margin was 15%, down slightly sequentially as expected, reflecting seasonality. First quarter bookings growth of 4% was in line with our expectations following exceptional bookings growth in the fourth quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, we have a robust book-to-bill ratio of greater than 1.2x revenue reflecting bookings of over $23 billion. Given a healthy pipeline, we anticipate bookings growth acceleration in the second quarter and for the full year.\nOver the last 3 months, I've met employees, partners and clients across 4 continents. While the global economic environment is uncertain, based on these interactions, I remain optimistic about IT services industry demand for the foreseeable future. Clients are making the shift to digital operating models to become more agile, automated and innovative. They know that it is the only way to deliver customer-centric user experience and hyper personalization, to simplify complex workflows and to build a modern operating infrastructure that's scalable and resilient.\nOur strategic repositioning enables us to engage more deeply with clients, helping them to succeed and supports our growth trajectory. Our capabilities are in strong demand as digital becomes mainstream. Ultimately, I believe that our scale in India, complemented by our growing global delivery network will differentiate us as clients seek talent and business stability.\nMeanwhile, the labor market continues to be challenging with industry-wide elevated attrition, demand supply imbalances and inflationary pressure. I'd like to thank our teams across the globe for their leadership, patience and engagement as we navigate these challenges and execute against our client commitments.\nToday, more than ever, employees demand that we invest not just in total rewards, including compensation, but also in the end-to-end employee experience, their skilling and career advancement. Cognizant has always been known for our investment in our people. And in the last year, we built in this legacy with accelerated skilling and enhancements to our promotion framework.\nFirst quarter voluntary attrition fell 5 points to 26% on an annualized basis or 29% on a trailing 12-month basis. While we made sequential progress reducing voluntary attrition for the second consecutive quarter, we anticipate attrition will remain elevated for the full year and will increase in the second quarter, reflecting seasonality. To mitigate labor cost increases and the investments we are making in our people, we continue to execute against a series of measures including our automation agenda, pyramid and shoring optimization and a deep pricing.\nTurning to the industry segments. In Financial Services, our ongoing recovery continued with growth of 6% year-over-year in constant currency reflecting the sale of our Samlink subsidiary in February, continue to make progress repositioning the business towards higher growth and higher value services and solutions with a more focused client set. We expect to pace recovery in banking and insurance to continue with strong demand for digital transformation.\nOne client whose digital transformation journey we've been supporting is ABN AMRO Clearing Bank. We are transforming the bank's IT landscape into a hybrid cloud platform with a focus on security and regulatory compliance. We'll be implementing an end-to-end secure, scalable and compliant infrastructure as a service model in support of the bank's IT modernization agenda.\nIn Healthcare, revenue grew 9% year-over-year in constant currency, with particularly strong growth in life sciences. Our investments to modernize the TriZetto product portfolio, which includes the integration of AI and machine learning capabilities continued to pay off. Our clients are responding to our commitment to deliver next-generation platform solutions that help them offer patients real-time insights and personalized care.\nWe're keeping our products cutting edge, building new solutions across the value chain and capitalizing on the opportunity at the intersection of health and digital in areas such as virtual care and telehealth. During the first quarter, we announced our collaboration with Microsoft to deliver a new digital health solution designed to improve medical care. Leveraging Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare, our new solution is the first of several planned offerings that combine remote patient monitoring and virtual health using products like smart watches, blood pressure monitors and glucose meters to collect and communicate patient health data to providers.\nWellmark, Blue Cross and Blue Shield, a leading health insurer with more than 2 million members is a great example of how we're partnering with AWS to drive digital transformation. Wellmark aims to improve the experience of their stakeholders by accelerating cloud migration and data modernization, all while strengthening their information security.\nIn Products and Resources, we continue to see excellent growth in client success across travel and hospitality and in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities. Automation is top of mind for clients like Pacific Gas and Electric, which sought our help to realize their vision for a new digital productivity center of excellence that aims to reduce manual efforts, simplify their automation tools and provide agile and scalable solutions for their business and IT users. To that end, our IPA team helped deploy Microsoft Power Platform and simplified our tool sets with Cognizant Neuro, our recently announced intelligent automation fabric. PG&E is now well on its way to saving 1 million hours of work through low code, no code automation.\nFinally, in Communications, Media and Technology, we saw continued strength in technology, where we've sustained double-digit growth over the last 4 quarters. I'd like to briefly switch gears now to the future of work, a universal topic amongst the C-Suite with enduring societal implications. Organizations around the world are deliberating how to best attract, engage and retain employees. The events of the past few years have prompted people worldwide to question their life and work choices, including how and where they work. In the meantime, executive teams are determining how to best nurture company culture and values in the face of today's labor market realities and a hybrid work environment. These socioeconomic questions also intersect with business practicalities such as real estate strategy, one of the many things we are currently reviewing.\nOne of the prominent business themes of our time is the relationship between purpose and work. Purpose encompasses all the values that drive people's choices, actions and attitudes from wider social and environmental goals to professional and personal objectives such as a healthy work-life balance. That's one reason we put so much time, thought and energy into developing and activating a compelling purpose, vision and set of values for our company, which express our commitment to making a positive impact on the environment and the wider society.\nWe continue to advance our ESG agenda, applying our knowledge, portfolio and partnerships to engineer new levels of environmental and social benefits for our company, clients and communities. In April, we announced that we will source 100% renewable energy for all our global offices and facilities by the end of 2026. Sourcing 100% renewable energy supports our goal, and as last year, to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and responds to client expectations that business transition to a low-carbon economy.\nWe also want our employees, clients, partners and other stakeholders to better understand today's Cognizant, which is why during the first quarter, we modernized and reintroduced our brand to mirror the company we've become, the services leader with world-class digital solutions and talent. Our brand now carries the tagline, Intuition engineered. This is our promise to engineer clients' businesses so they can anticipate and meet their customers' needs with the insight and speed of intuition.\nAs a global company, we will always stand with the right of people to choose a path of self-determination and democracy. Wave humanitarian relief efforts for Ukraine, Cognizant contributed $1 million in grants to several organizations that are delivering food, water, shelter, health care and economic assistance. We joined the international community in hoping that a path to lasting peace can be found soon.\nIn closing, I believe we were strategically well positioned to capture a large growing addressable market and drive profitable revenue growth. A month ago, I marked my third year anniversary leading Cognizant. While we are a company in transition, our evolution has been significant across multiple dimensions. We're putting the company on a strong growth trajectory, and I'm optimistic about Cognizant's prospects as we bolster our portfolio judiciously, to not only build and run clients' technology foundations but also transform their enterprises into modern businesses.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Jan, who will cover the details of the quarter and our financial outlook before we take your questions. Jan, over to you.\n\nJan Siegmund\n\nCFO, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation\n\nThank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter results reflect continued momentum within our digital portfolio. While overall uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased, we continue to see a healthy demand environment across our portfolio of services and offerings.\nQ1 revenue was $4.8 billion, representing an increase of 9.7% year-over-year or 10.9% in constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 220 basis points of growth from our recent acquisitions partially offset by a negative 40 basis point impact from the sale of Samlink completed February 1. In Q1, Digital revenue grew 20% year-over-year and represented approximately 50% of total revenue. During the quarter, we reviewed the scope of our digital revenue definition to ensure alignment across digital skills, growth priorities and our pricing initiatives. This is the first time we have reviewed our definition since we updated it in 2020.\nUnder the new definition, Q4 '21 digital revenue would have been about 49% of total revenue, approximately 4 points higher than the 45% we previously reported. For this quarter only, we are also providing some additional information to highlight the change in our digital definition. Under our previous definition, digital would have grown 18% in Q1, and represented approximately 47% of revenue.\nAs Brian mentioned, Q1 bookings grew 4% year-over-year, which resulted in trailing 12 months bookings of $23.4 billion, representing a book-to-bill of approximately 1.2 unchanged from Q4. We believe this book-to-bill provides us a healthy opportunity to support our full year growth ambitions.\nMoving on to segment results for the first quarter where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial Services revenue increased approximately 6%. Trends within this segment were consistent with last quarter as positive momentum within our North American banking business and improved performance in insurance were offset by softness in our global banking portfolio. Q1 growth also included a negative 130 basis point impact from the sale of our Samlink subsidiary. We remain focused on investing in our talent and digital capabilities while targeting growth opportunities with new and existing clients aligned to our strategy.\nHealthcare revenue increased approximately 9%, primarily organic, driven by demand for digital services among pharmaceutical companies within our life sciences business, around digitization of clinical trial processes and modernization of manufacturing operations. Products and Resources revenue increased approximately 15%, driven by double-digit growth across all subsectors within the segment. Segment growth also benefited from recently completed acquisitions, which contributed approximately 500 basis points to growth. Communications, Media and Technology revenue grew 20%, primarily organic reflecting growing demand for data services and our work with leading digital-native clients, which has continued to support growth in our core portfolio.\nFrom a geographic perspective, in Q1, North America revenue grew 9% year-over-year. Growth continued to be led by life sciences, manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities and communications and technology clients. Our global growth markets, which include all revenue outside of North America grew approximately 17% year-over-year in constant currency. Growth was led by 20-plus percent growth in the U.K., where we saw strong double-digit growth within Financial Services, including public sector clients, Products and Resources and Communications, Media and Technology segments. We also continued to experience strong growth in Australia and Germany, driven and powered by our recent acquisitions.\nNow moving on to margins. In Q1, our GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 15% as there were no non-GAAP charges in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, operating margin declined by approximately 20 basis points. The largest headwind remains increased compensation costs, including the cost of subcontractors. Partially offsetting these headwinds were delivery efficiencies, slowing growth of SG&A and depreciation of the rupee against the dollar. Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 23.3%, and the adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 22.5%, which benefited from discrete items, which we do not expect to repeat. Q1 diluted GAAP EPS was $1.07, and Q1 adjusted EPS was $1.08.\nNow turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.3 billion and net cash of $1.7 billion. Free cash flow in Q1 was $186 million, representing approximately 33% of net income. As a reminder, Q1 is seasonally our softest quarter for free cash flow, primarily due to the timing of bonus payments.\nDSO of 72 days increased by 3 days sequentially and by 2 days year-over-year. During the quarter, we repurchased 5 million shares for $444 million on our share repurchase program and returned $143 million to shareholders through our regular dividend.\nTurning to guidance. For Q2, we expect revenue in the range of $4.9 billion to $4.94 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 6.8% to 7.8% or 9.3% to 10.3% in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a negative 250 basis points impact as well as an inorganic contribution of approximately 100 basis points.\nFor the full year, we are increasing the organic growth outlook assumption in our guidance reflecting strong performance in our digital portfolio and a healthy demand backdrop. However, we are tightening our constant currency outlook at both ends of the range, which reflects our improved organic revenue growth. This is partially offset by a lower expectation of inorganic growth, which we now expect to contribute approximately 100 basis points to full year growth versus 200 basis points previously.\nOur reported revenue outlook now assumes a negative 180 basis points impact from currency versus 70 points previously, which equates to roughly $200 million headwind in reported revenues. This leads to a revised reported revenue guidance range of $19.8 billion to $20.2 billion representing 4.2% to 9.2% growth or 10% to 11% in constant currency. This compares to our previous guidance of $20 billion to $20.5 billion, which represented growth of 7.8% to 10.8% or 8.5% to 11.5% in constant currency.\nOur capital allocation framework is unchanged. While we did not complete any acquisitions in Q1, we remain active in pursuit of acquisitions aligned with our strategy. We will stay disciplined as we analyze the acquisition pipeline and thoughtful as we assess the best use of capital. For the full year, we expect to return at least $600 million through share repurchases subject to market conditions and other factors.\nMoving on to adjusted operating margin. Our adjusted operating margin outlook is unchanged, and we continue to expect approximately 20 to 30 basis points of expansion versus 2021. Our outlook for operating margin continues to assume industry supply side constraints and elevated attrition for the remainder of the year. Headwinds to operating margin include increased compensation costs, T&E and return-to-office costs, which we expect to offset to -- through delivery efficiencies, digital revenue mix, pricing and SG&A leverage and discipline.\nWe currently expect to see some gradual improvement in our operating margin in Q2. This leads to our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $4.45 to $4.55 compared to $4.46 to $4.60 previously, which primarily reflects the FX impact on our reported revenue outlook. Our full year outlook assumes interest income of $25 million and average share outstanding of approximately 522 million, both unchanged from our prior outlook. We also continue to expect a tax rate of 25% to 26%.\nFinally, we are still targeting full year cash flow conversion of approximately 100% of net income. However, there are several moving pieces that could cause us to fall below our goal. Key factors impacting our conversion rates includes the timing of certain payments, cash taxes and higher CapEx. We remain focused on our working capital initiatives to offset these headwinds for the remainder of the year.\nWith that, we will open the call for your questions."

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn this conference over to Mr. Tyler Scott, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. You may begin.\n\nTyler J. Scott\n\nSenior Director of IR, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation\n\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release and investor supplement for the company's fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Brian Humphries, Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.\nAdditionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures, can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Brian Humphries. Please go ahead, Brian.\n\nBrian Humphries\n\nCEO & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation\n\nThank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everybody. Throughout 2021, clients have meaningfully accelerated spend on digital transformation initiatives, accelerating the demand for IT services. Elevated attrition in key digital skills is, however, a direct consequence of this, creating revenue fulfillment challenges and cost pressure that need to be carefully navigated. I'm therefore pleased that we had another quarter of solid execution, delivering against our commitments to clients and to you, our shareholders.\nFourth quarter revenue was $4.8 billion, up 14.5% year-over-year in constant currency, above the high end of our guidance. Growth was led by digital, which grew 20% year-over-year. Fourth quarter adjusted operating margin was 15.3%, and full year adjusted operating margin was 15.4%, in line with our guidance. During the quarter, we also progressed against our key strategic initiatives, including scaling our digital capabilities, globalizing the company, helping our clients be successful by leading with greater industry insights and solutions and repositioning the Cognizant brand.\nTurning now to industry segments. Our recovery in Financial Services continued with fourth quarter growth of 19% year-over-year in constant currency. This includes an approximate 9 percentage point benefit from the impact of the prior year charge related to Samlink. As you know, we've been rebuilding our strength in Financial Services by refreshing our leadership in client-facing teams, strengthening our partner engagement, shifting our portfolio of services to more attractive market segments and sharpening our focus on priority industry solutions and clients. We expect to build further on this progress in 2022.\nAs we reposition Cognizant as a digital transformation provider in larger banking clients, we've complemented this with sustained momentum in regional banks. KeyBank, where we've just renewed our engagement as their primary digital partner, is a great example of this. We will further enable their digital transformation by digitizing their products to increase their digitally active customers to approximately 85%, by driving remote self-service growth by more than 40%, by automating front-to-back processes and by migrating more than half of their application portfolio to the cloud.\nIn insurance, we see continued demand for core modernization and digital transformation, including cloud and analytics. Unum, a global leader in disability insurance and group benefits, is partnering with us to pursue their digital transformation focus on agent and customer experiences and associated analytics. These digital solutions enhance our existing application development and maintenance services relationship with Unum. And for a long-time client, Royal London, the U.K.'s largest mutual life pensions and investment firm, we're now extending our partnership to reimagine their customer engagement through personalized seamless connected customer journeys enabled by cloud, data and customer-centric principles.\nIn Healthcare, revenue grew 8.2% year-over-year in constant currency. We've substantially increased our competitiveness in Healthcare by investing in digital solutions, domain expertise and partnerships and by modernizing our core platforms. We've seen continuing momentum in our TriZetto product business, which grew 13% in 2021. We continue to add new footprints and, in 2021, increased the number of overall members supported by our platforms to approximately 210 million.\nWe see solid commercial momentum across our Healthcare payer and provider business. For instance, Humana, a large national payer is modernizing and moving their legacy ecosystem to the cloud and has chosen Cognizant as a partner for agency, marketing and clinical transformation. These initiatives will help improve Humana's customer and employee satisfaction, reduce costs and enhance the delivery of integrated personalized experiences to their members.\nWe also have momentum with next-generation health care companies like Relic Health Technologies, a rapidly growing global telemedicine firm, which turned to us to expand their care management capabilities. Relic will leverage Cognizant care management services to support the deployment of their care platform across managed care organizations, hospital networks and health insurance providers.\nIn life sciences, we partnered with AbbVie, a leading global biopharma company, to help advance their digital transformation in safety and risk management, which will improve patient care and outcomes. Through our digital health consulting services augmented by capabilities in human-centered design and digital product engineering, AbbVie can understand the needs of patients and care providers, design fit-for-purpose solutions that support the patient journey and incorporate feedback for ongoing innovation. These improvements will help AbbVie better support patients and care providers across a broad range of therapeutic areas and products.\nWithin Products and Resources, we continue to deliver excellent growth in client success across travel and hospitality and in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities. Drawing on our extensive experience helping automakers streamlined their operational tasks, Volvo Cars chose us to help harmonize their finance and accounting and procurement processes and implement intelligent process automation to support their digital transformation. This is a great example of our growing momentum in digital business operations, which significantly outpaced the BPO industry in 2021 and is set to continue to gain share. Top line growth has been fueled by momentum in intelligent process automation and strength in our digital-native client portfolio.\nOur work at Grundfos, a global leader in water technology and the world's largest pump manufacturer, perfectly illustrates our growing digital credentials. Grundfos initially selected Cognizant to establish an IoT-based intelligent platform to gather real-time pump data from the sensors and perform analytics to prevent, predict and respond to issues caused by leakages. Based on this success, we've since been selected to build a modern enterprise system based on SAP S/4HANA.\nFinally, in Communications, Media and Technology, we saw continued strength in technology, in particular, where we've sustained strong double-digit growth over the past 3 quarters.\nTurning now to bookings, which grew 22% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, our second consecutive quarter of 20%-plus growth. Full year 2021 bookings growth was in the mid-teens. We entered 2022 with a healthy book-to-bill ratio of 1.2. Throughout the year, our bookings strength, which has been fueled by digital, has been broad-based across industries and geographies.\nMoving to the macro demand environment. Industry demand remains robust and I expect it to continue throughout 2022. Clients are embracing digital operating models to become more efficient, agile, automated, scalable, innovative and, indeed, secure whilst also responding to the expectations of their customers and employees for hyper-personalized experiences.\nContinuing to scale our digital capabilities is at the heart of our company strategy. Digital represented 45% of our revenue mix in Q4. As we noted during our recent investor briefing, we believe digital can become 55% to 60% of revenue in the coming years. Reflecting our strength in digital credentials, during the fourth quarter, we were named an industry leader in [70] new industry analyst reports. They highlighted the company's client partnerships, scalability, digital capabilities and expertise as factors in recognizing our leadership.\nAccelerating digital is not only a driver of double-digit revenue growth and improved margins, it also fosters greater client intimacy and higher levels of employee engagement as we partner on strategic transformation projects that leverage skills.\nMoving on now to an industry phenomenon you're accustomed to hearing about, the unprecedented competition for talent, reflective of the industry-wide demand/supply imbalance in key digital skills. Fourth quarter voluntary attrition moderated a little to 31% on an annualized basis or 28% on a trailing 12-month basis. As a reminder, when we measure attrition, we count the entire company, including trainees and corporate across IT services and BPO. We've been working aggressively to mitigate attrition levels whilst intensifying our efforts and focus on employee training, promotion cycles, professional development and total rewards.\nDuring 2021, we also facilitated more than 14,000 job moves across 40 countries, continue to revitalize our campus recruitment program in India, establish new compensation measures and a revised promotion cycle to retain employees and invested heavily in upskilling. In fact, our associates completed 23 million hours of learning and consumed 130,000 courses in 2021. Given that we compete on our knowledge and skills, we're proud to have won 42 awards for excellence in learning and development from the Brandon Hall Group, often considered the leading independent HCM research analyst firm.\nWe more than offset elevated attrition levels in 2021 by accelerating our hiring, allowing us to increase company headcount by 14%. I'm pleased to say that in recent years, we've made meaningful progress in correcting our delivery pyramid by significantly increasing the number of college graduate hires onboarded in India. In 2021, we added a record 33,000 college graduate hires in India, up from 17,000 in 2020. In 2022, we plan to add approximately 50,000 in India.\nDigital acquisitions have also brought incredible talent to Cognizant. During 2021, we completed 7 acquisitions that extend our digital leadership, the most recent being our fourth quarter acquisition of Devbridge. This software consultancy and product development firm expands our software product engineering capabilities and global delivery footprint by adding more than 600 engineers, designers and product managers in Lithuania, Poland, the U.K. and North America. This extension of our global delivery network complements recent announcements in the United Kingdom, Australia and, indeed, Canada.\nIn closing, I'm proud of our execution against our strategy in 2021. We've reestablished commercial momentum and have a healthy book-to-bill ratio. Our delivery teams executed against our commitments despite challenging labor market conditions. Our performance in our 2 largest industries, Financial Services and Healthcare, has strengthened. Growth in key international markets such as the U.K. has meaningfully accelerated. Our digital portfolio has been extended and has never been stronger, and we've made significant progress in our people strategy, our internal digitization agenda and indeed, our brand repositioning.\nFor several quarters now, I've been holding our long open-ended vertical sessions with small groups of employees. What I've learned from these intimate sessions as well as from our large virtual townhall meetings, is that employee pride in the company is building. Employees see not only how far we've come but also a clear path to an exciting future. Our employees also recognize the consistent execution of our strategy, our commercial momentum and a commitment to our purpose, vision and values. This purpose has kept us focused on executing our ESG agenda despite distress for prolonged COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur ESG-focused commitment is evident in our Cognizant Combat COVID-19 initiative in India, in our intensified efforts to drive a culture of belonging throughout Cognizant, in our $250 million philanthropic initiative to advance diversity, equity and inclusion, along with health and well-being in communities around the world and in many other areas covered in our 2021 ESG report.\nIn summary, our broad-based progress allows us to approach the new fiscal year with confidence in our ability to execute against the multiyear financial outlook we presented at our November investor briefing. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Jan, who will cover the details of the quarter and our financial outlook before we take your questions.\n\nJan Siegmund\n\nCFO, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation\n\nThank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. We finished the year with solid momentum, driven by digital projects and enter 2022 with bookings momentum and strong customer demand. For the full year, revenue was $18.5 billion, representing an increase of 11% or 10% at constant currency. This includes 320 basis points contribution from our acquisitions. The charge in Q4 2020 related to the proposed exit from the customer engagement of our Samlink subsidiary contributed 70 basis points of growth. I will refer to this as the Samlink impact for the remainder of my remarks.\nFor the full year, digital revenue grew over 19% and represented approximately 44% of total revenue. Q4 revenue was $4.8 billion, representing an increase of 14% year-over-year or 14.5% in constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes 280 basis points of the Samlink impact and also 280 basis points of growth from our recent acquisitions.\nIn Q4, digital revenue grew over 20% year-over-year and represented approximately 45% of total revenue. As Brian mentioned, we were pleased with our bookings performance in the quarter and for the full year. In Q4, we have begun providing trailing 12-month bookings, which can be found in the supplemental presentation posted on our Investor Relations website. We took the opportunity to enhance our bookings definition, modifying it to exclude overlap from early renewals and to include bookings from unintegrated acquired entities. As of Q4 2021, trailing 12-month bookings based on our revised definition were $23.1 billion, representing a book-to-bill of approximately 1.2.\nMoving on to segment results for the fourth quarter, where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial Services revenue increased approximately 19%, which includes a positive 900 basis points of Samlink impact. During the quarter, we saw positive trends in our North American banking business, where revenue grew high single digits and internationally within insurance. Across banking and insurance, we are continuing to invest into our talent and digital capabilities while focusing on broadening our client base and driving improved profitable growth. In 2022, we expect our recovery to continue.\nHealthcare revenue increased approximately 8%, driven by double-digit organic growth in life sciences. Our Healthcare payer and provider business grew in the mid-single digits, driven by our integrated software solutions. As we discussed during our investor briefing in November, we see a large and growing market opportunity in the health care space, and our capabilities across health care payer, provider and life sciences provide us a unique industry perspective and client intimacy that we believe provides ample opportunity to support sustainable growth in the years ahead.\nProducts and Resources revenue momentum continued with revenue increasing 18%, the third consecutive quarter of strong double-digit growth. Revenue was again driven by strong performance in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities, which grew double digits for the seventh consecutive quarter and surpassed $2 billion in annual revenue in 2021. Retail and consumer goods and travel and hospitality also grew double digits year-over-year with quarterly revenue now back above pre-pandemic levels. Revenue growth also included 550 basis points from our recent acquisitions.\nCommunications, Media and Technology revenue grew 13%, of which approximately 300 basis points of growth was attributable to recent acquisitions. Organic growth was again led by our technology business, where our work with digital native clients has continued to drive growth in our core portfolio.\nFrom a geographic perspective, in Q4, North American revenue grew 9% year-over-year, driven by banking, life sciences, manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities and technology. Growth in North America also included the benefit of recently completed acquisitions across segments. Revenue outside of North America grew approximately 33% year-over-year in constant currency, including [13] points of Samlink impact. Growth was led by the U.K. where we saw strong double-digit growth within Financial Services, Products and Resources and Communications, Media and Technology segments. We also continued to experience strong growth in Australia and Germany, driven in part by our acquisitions of Servian and ESG mobility, respectively.\nNow moving on to margins. In Q4, our GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 15.3% as there were no non-GAAP charges in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted operating margin improved by approximately 300 basis points, driven primarily by the Samlink charge in the prior year period. As we discussed last quarter, merit increases for the majority of employees were effected October 1, which negatively impacted margin in the quarter. Supply chain constraints and our elevated attrition has kept subcontractor, recruiting and other delivery costs elevated, while our recently completed acquisitions have also negatively impacted our margin.\nWhile we continue to invest in SG&A to drive and support organic revenue growth, we have also moderated nonstrategic spend, which has helped partially offset the labor cost pressure. Our GAAP and adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 22%, below the low end of full year guidance range, benefiting from discrete items which we do not expect to repeat in the future. Q4 diluted GAAP and adjusted EPS were both $1.10.\nNow turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.7 billion or net cash of $2.1 billion. Free cash flow in Q4 was $760 million, representing approximately 130% of net income. This resulted in a full year free cash flow of $2.2 billion and represented a cash flow conversion of over 100% of net income, which was in line with our prior guidance. DSO of 69 days declined by 3 days sequentially and by 1 day year-over-year. DSO will remain a key lever to support strong free cash flow conversion over the medium term.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased 800,000 shares for $66 million under our share repurchase program and returned $127 million to shareholders through our regular dividend and spent cash of $255 million on acquisitions. In 2021, we've returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and spent approximately $1 billion on acquisitions. This was consistent with our capital deployment framework introduced in Q4 2020 and reiterated at our November investor briefing.\nIn support of our capital deployment framework, today, we have also announced a 12% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, our third consecutive annual increase and fourth since we initiated the dividend in 2017. We also expect to return at least $500 million through share repurchases in 2022, subject to market conditions and other factors.\nTurning to guidance. For Q1, we expect revenue in the range of $4.8 billion to $4.84 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 9% to 10% or 10.2% to 11.2% in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a negative 120 basis point impact and an inorganic contribution of approximately 200 basis points. For the full year, we expect revenue growth to be towards the high end of our medium-term financial framework, which is consistent with our expectations at the November 2021 investor briefing.\nWe expect full year revenue of $20 billion to $20.5 billion, representing 7.8% to 8 point -- I apologize, representing 7.8% to 10.8% growth or 8.5% to 11.5% in constant currency. Our outlook assumes currency will have a negative 70 basis points impact and includes 200 basis points contribution from inorganic revenue. This inorganic assumption includes approximately 100 basis points from future acquisitions. Full year guidance also includes the negative impact from the sale of our Samlink subsidiary, which was completed on February 1.\nMoving on to adjusted operating margin. Consistent with our outlook at the November 2021 investor briefing, we expect 2022 to be towards the lower end of our medium-term financial framework. For 2022, our full year adjusted operating margin guidance of 15.6% to 15.7% assumes approximately 25 basis points of expansion at the midpoint from 2021. While we are not providing quarterly margin guidance, we expect typical seasonality in 2022, which includes stronger margin performance in Q2 and Q3 while Q1 and Q4 are expected to be below our full year guidance. In Q1, we expect some modest sequential pressure driven by compensation costs and seasonal factors.\nOur outlook for margin assumes the industry supply side constraints continue and that attrition remains elevated in 2022. In response, we will continue to invest into our talent, including through merit increases, promotions, career development opportunities and training. This will include hiring of approximately 50,000 recent college graduates, targeted lateral hires and the continued use of subcontractors. Similar to 2021, we will continue to moderate nonstrategic SG&A spend to help offset some of this pressure in the near term.\nThis leads to our full year adjusted EPS guidance, which is $4.46 to $4.60. Our full year outlook assumes interest income of $25 million. Our outlook also assumes average share outstanding of approximately 522 million and a tax rate of 25% to 26%. Finally, we expect free cash flow will represent approximately 100% of net income for the full year. With that, we will open the call for your questions."

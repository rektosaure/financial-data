[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Amanda Ho. Ma'am, the floor is yours.\n\nAmanda Ho\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Matthew. I would like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and webcast to review our third quarter earnings, recent developments and operating performance. Our speakers today will be our Chairman, President and CEO, Ted Geisler; and our CFO, Andrew Cooper. Jacob Tetlow, COO; and Jose Esparza, SVP of Public Policy, are also here with us.\nFirst, I need to cover a few details on the slides. The slides that we will be using are available on our Investor Relations website, along with our earnings release and related information. Today's comments and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and actual results may differ materially from expectations. Our third quarter 2025 Form 10-Q was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language as well as the risk factors and MD&A sections which identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures. A replay of this call will be available shortly on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through November 10, 2025.\nI will now turn the call over to Ted.\n\nTheodore N. Geisler\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Pinnacle West Capital Corporation\n\nThank you, Amanda, and thank you all for joining us today. In the third quarter, we delivered strong operational and financial performance, underscoring the discipline and focus to define our strategy. Today, I'll share how we plan to continue to meet rising customer demand and how we successfully navigated a dynamic summer season. I'll also highlight our long-term planning efforts and strategic investments that position us for sustainable growth. Then Andrew will walk through how increased sales and transmission revenue have led us to revise our 2025 earnings guidance, along with our forward-looking financial expectations.\nImportantly, our long-term planning and resource procurement paid off as we reliably serve customers over multiple record peak days this quarter. I'm proud of our entire team for stepping up during the summer season to support our customers and communities with industry-leading reliability, a hallmark of our company. Our crews battled storms, flooding and extreme heat, yet we're prepared to ensure customers were taking care of with rapid response and operational excellence. Additionally, [ Palo Verde ] generating station operated at 100% capacity factor the entire summer, delivering a solid performance for our customers and the entire Desert Southwest region.\nOur peak demand record reflects the strong underlying economic growth in our service territory with weather-normalized sales growth of 5.4% and residential sales growth of 4.3% in the third quarter alone. Arizona's population growth remains robust, fueled by major employers, expanding their operations and driving demand for skilled labor. The state's ability to attract and retain high-quality talent is truly a key differentiator and a powerful signal of the long-term economic fatality we're helping support. [ SEMICON West ] recognized as North America's largest microelectronic Exhibition and Conference was held outside California for the first time in more than 50 years with Phoenix being selected as the host city. Our region's economic momentum continues to accelerate.\nSite Selection Magazine recently named [ Maricopa ] County, the top county in the nation for economic development in 2025, citing its success in attracting high-growth industries like semiconductors, data centers and logistics. Taiwan Semiconductor reaffirmed its commitment to Arizona, accelerating production of 2-nanometer wafers and advanced technologies. They also announced plans to acquire a second location in Phoenix to support their vision for a stand-alone giga-fab cluster.\nMeanwhile, [ Amkor ] Technology broke ground on a $7 billion advanced semiconductor packaging and testing facility, which is an increased investment of $5 billion over their original plans. The first phase is expected to be completed by mid-2027 with production beginning in early 2028. To support this growth, we're executing our plan for long-term investments in both transmission and baseload generation, which are essential to secure a reliable grid for the long term.\nIn Q2, we announced our role as the anchor shipper on the Desert Southwest expansion project. And just days ago, we announced our plans to develop a new generation site near [ Hila Bend ] just southwest of Phoenix, which could add up to 2,000 megawatts of reliable and affordable natural gas generation to our customers. The [ Desert Sun Power Plant ] is a 2-phase project designed to serve both existing customers and the rising demand from extra large energy users like data centers and manufacturers. Phase 1 is expected to begin serving committed customers by late 2030. Phase 2 is expected to support new demand from our queue of high load factor customers.\nImportantly, we're working with customers now to contract for the Phase 2 capacity using our subscription model, a commercial construct designed to ensure growth pays for growth while protecting affordability for all customers. Investment in generation alone will not be enough to support the growth in customer demand. We're making significant investments in transmission as well with multiple projects underway and more in development. These projects are expected to enhance reliability, resiliency and integration of new resources. They also expand our access to out-of-state generation and regional markets. Transmission investment benefit from constructive and timely recovery through our [indiscernible] formula rate and creates opportunities for additional wheeling revenues that support affordability for our retail customers.\nTurning to our pending rate case. We remain actively engaged with intervenors in responding to data requests, and remain on track for a hearing in Q2 of next year. As we approach the end of 2025, our priorities remain clear: executing our mission to deliver reliable and affordable service to our customers investing in baseload generation and transmission to serve growth and achieving a constructive regulatory outcome that protects customer affordability while reducing regulatory lag.\nThank you for your time today. I'll now turn it over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew D. Cooper\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Pinnacle West Capital Corporation\n\nThank you, Ted, and thanks again to everyone for joining us today. This morning, we released our third quarter 2025 financial results. I'll walk through the key drivers behind our performance, provide context on our updated 2025 guidance and share our outlook for 2026 and beyond.\nWe reported earnings of $3.39 per share for the quarter, a modest increase of $0.02 year-over-year. This result was primarily attributable to higher transmission revenues and higher sales driven by robust sales growth across customer classes. These gains were partially offset by lower weather-driven sales compared to last year's Q3, higher interest expense, reduced pension and [ OPEB ] benefits and an increase in our outstanding share count. Based on strong sales growth along with above normal weather, an increase in transmission revenues and contributions from El Dorado, we are raising our 2025 EPS guidance from a range of $4.40 to $4.60 per share, up to $4.90 to $5.10 per share. With the ability to derisk future operating expenses, our updated guidance reflects an increase to our forecasted O&M for the year to a range of $1.025 billion to $1.045 billion.\nSales growth across all customer classes continues to be strong. We experienced 5.4% weather-normalized sales growth for the quarter, including 6.6% C&I growth, supported by the continued ramp-up of our large load customers and 4.3% residential growth. Year-to-date residential sales growth stands at 2%, exceeding our expectations and fueled by continued customer growth to the top end of our range. We are, therefore, narrowing our customer growth guidance range to the high end of 2% to 2.5% for the year.\nAs we look ahead to 2026, we anticipate earnings per share of $4.55 to $4.75 per share. The expected year-over-year decrease compared to our revised 2025 earnings guidance is due to the projection of normal weather and higher financing and D&A costs as we work through the rate case process. We continue to expect robust customer and sales growth increased transmission revenues, focused O&M management and some positive contributions from our El Dorado subsidiary. Customer growth next year is expected at 1.5% to 2.5%, supported by Arizona's ongoing population and business expansion. Last year, we set a post-recession record with nearly 35,000 new meter sets. We're on track to match that figure again in 2025 and our forecast for 2026 customer additions remained strong.\nFor overall sales growth, we expect weather normalized sales to continue to grow at 4% to 6% in 2026. And with the strong residential sales growth trends and continued ramping and acceleration plans by our extra high load factor customers, including in the advanced manufacturing space, we are increasingly confident in our forecasted long-term sales growth range and are raising it up from 4% to 6% to 5% to 7% and extending it through 2030.\nOur capital and financing strategy remain focused on enabling growth while maintaining affordability and financial discipline. We've updated our capital plan through 2028 to include critical strategic investments in transmission and generation that support reliability and the demands of our rapidly growing service territory. As highlighted by Ted, we look forward to developing these new resources for the benefit of our customers. These investments are expected to drive rate base growth of 7% to 9% through 2028, an increase from our prior guidance of 6% to 8% through 2027. To support this plan, we've updated our financing strategy for '26 through '28, maintaining a balanced mix of debt and equity aligned with our balance sheet targets. For 2026, approximately 85% of our equity need has already been priced with an additional $1 billion to $1.2 billion of Pinnacle West equity forecasted through 2028.\nOn the O&M front, our 2026 outlook reflects our commitment to cost efficiency. We expect a slight year-over-year decrease despite continued customer growth, and we remain focused on reducing O&M per mega hour over the long term.\nFinally, we are affirming our long-term EPS growth guidance range of 5% to 7% based on the midpoint of our original 2024 guidance range. We recognize that regulatory lag will continue to be a factor in 2026. However, we remain confident in our long-term financial strategy. Our service territory offers unique advantages, including strong growth across all customer classes and a diversified economic base that includes advanced manufacturing, data centers and continued population growth. Working closely with the Arizona Corporation Commission and stakeholders, we're committed to addressing regulatory lag, improving recovery timing and ensuring affordability as we continue serving new and existing customers.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

Geisler\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Pinnacle West Capital Corporation\n\nThank you, Amanda, and thank you all for joining us today. Our second quarter financial results are in line with our annual guidance. Before Andrew discusses the details of these results, I'll provide a few updates on recent operational and regulatory developments. As we progress through the summer season, I'm very proud to share our team continues to excel in delivering reliable service to our customers. For the third consecutive year, we set a new peak energy demand record. Our customers reached a new peak on July 9 at more than 8,500 megawatts when Phoenix reached 118 degrees, more than a 300-megawatt increase from last year's peak. And we may surpass this again tomorrow as temperatures are expected to reach at least 118 again. We take our responsibility to reliably and affordably to serve our customers seriously through robust planning, resource procurement efforts and a dedicated team.\nI want to recognize our planners, engineers, operators, field teams, everyone that makes up the APS workforce for doing an exceptional job making sure our customers continue to experience reliable service through our summer season. Setting a new peak does not come as a surprise since our state continues experiencing growing customer demand, steady population growth and economic diversity. There on the Commerce Authority just reported a record-breaking year in fiscal 2025 with a projected 24,000 jobs created in the state and businesses committed to investing over $31 billion in Arizona communities. For the second year in a row, Arizona earned the top spot by Site Selection magazine for attracting business investment in the Mountain region.\nAdditionally, CNBC recently ranked Arizona in the top 3 states for infrastructure which takes into account how states are delivering on customer power and data demands. We're working diligently with our customers and community leaders to develop the new infrastructure needed to power our state's growth. In fact, TSMC announced earlier this month that it plans to accelerate production time lines for some planned facilities by several quarters, and we're developing accelerated construction schedules now to meet their needs.\nOur all of the above approach to resource planning is ensuring that we deliver reliable service to our customers every day and in the moments when it matters most, like this week. The cornerstone of our balanced energy portfolio is the Palo Verde Generating Station which celebrated its 40th anniversary this year. We continue to invest in Palo Verde for the long term. Although we have already secured 20-year license extensions to continue operating into the 2040s we're taking steps now to prepare for subsequent license renewals into the 2060s. In addition, we recently contracted to exercise a buyout option of 94 megawatts previously contracted under sale leaseback. This will allow us to continue providing reliable and low-cost baseload energy to our customers for decades to come.\nIn addition to nuclear, natural gas continues to be an important part of our diverse resource portfolio. We are already developing 675 megawatts of additional natural gas generation to support reliability. Earlier today, we announced a project with Transwestern Pipeline Company to support the Desert Southwest pipeline expansion. The new pipeline will help maintain year-round regional energy reliability by expanding transport capacity of natural gas from the Permian Basin to Arizona, enabling new gas generation infrastructure to be built in support of our customers into the next decade and beyond. This new pipeline was a critical milestone for our team to secure before proceeding further with procuring new gas generation needed to support Arizona's reliability and growth. We expect the pipeline project to be in service by 2030, and we will be coordinating the development of new gas-fired generation to be in service coincident with this timing.\nIn addition to generation, we continue to make progress on our transmission investments and are on track to complete multiple transmission and substation projects for our growing customer base with the tremendous growth and critical need to build out the grid, we have increased our investment in transmission infrastructure and expect this to continue being a strong component of our capital plan well into the future. We are evaluating additional opportunities to build FERC jurisdictional transmission for the benefit of our customers and look forward to providing additional information on this in the future.\nAs Arizona continues to grow at unprecedented levels, reliable service for our customers is our top priority. Which has led us to update our clean energy goal from 0 carbon to carbon neutral by 2050. We're also transitioning away from interim targets to better reflect our near-term focus of reliability and affordability for our customers. And instead, we'll report interim progress in our resource plans going forward. We will rely on the integrated resource planning process to forecast the right energy mix and our all-source RFP process to support reliability through best-fit lease cost resources, including dispatchable resources such as natural gas, plus solar and storage.\nTurning to our regulatory updates. We filed a rate case on June 13. Key components of the filing include a 10.7% return on equity, 1% return on the fair value increment 52.4% equity layer in 12 months of post-test-year plan. We requested an increase of annual revenue of $580 million, with rates to be in effect in the back half of 2026. Since our filing, a procedural schedule has been issued, which shows a hearing in May and a final open meeting vote in October of 2026. The rate case supports investments in our energy infrastructure to ensure that all customers continue to receive the reliability they count on and increased resiliency under all weather conditions. We're focused on investments to protect the grid from extreme weather and have invested in programs such as vegetation management, predictive maintenance and wildfire early detection and mitigation tools.\nOn a related note, HB 2201, the state's wildfire mitigation bill received bipartisan support from Arizona legislature and was recently signed into law by Governor Hubs. The bill requires Arizona utilities to submit comprehensive wildfire mitigation plans to the Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management for approval and mitigates wildfire liability risk by defining standards for the wildfire mitigation in Arizona, with reference to those plans.\nLastly, we're laser-focused on reducing regulatory lag, controlling costs and keeping rates as low as possible for our customers. We've proposed a formula rate adjustment mechanism to improve timely recovery of prudent and necessary costs while smoothing out customer bill impacts. In addition, we're proposing adjustments to our existing rate design to ensure new large customers will pay their full cost of service without shifting costs to other customers. We're focused on building out the grid to serve growth, ensuring reliability for our customers at the lowest cost possible and executing on our regulatory priorities. We look forward to delivering on our commitment to customers for safe, reliable and affordable service, especially through the summer season, while also delivering on our commitments to shareholders as well.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew D. Cooper\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Pinnacle West Capital Corporation\n\nThank you, Ted, and thanks again to everyone for joining us today. This morning, we released our second quarter 2025 financial results. I will review those results and provide some additional details on key drivers for the quarter.\nWe earned $1.58 per share in the second quarter, a decrease of $0.18 compared to the second quarter of 2024. Weather, O&M, share issuance and pension and OPEB nonservice credits were the primary negative drivers for the quarter-over-quarter comparison, along with income taxes and D&A. These were partially offset by sales growth and transmission revenue and a gain from an El Dorado equity investment. While weather was beneficial for the quarter as compared to normal weather, it was less than half the weather benefit we experienced in the second quarter last year. As a reminder, June 2024 was the hottest June on record contributing much of the quarter-over-quarter drag. Our sales growth was strong for the quarter, contributing $0.08 of benefit year-over-year as our weather-normalized sales increased 5.2% compared to the second quarter last year. Solidly within our guidance range of 4% to 6% and with significant contributions from both residential and C&I customer classes.\nC&I once again has shown robust sales growth at 8% for the quarter. With the continued ramping of diverse data center and large manufacturing customers in our service territory. We experienced 2.4% customer growth in the second quarter, and Arizona's economic backdrop remains strong. We continue to see strong in-migration and population growth with [indiscernible] ranking in the top 3 among the 50 hottest new home markets for 2025 according to Zonda National Housing Market Data firm. In addition, according to recent U.S. Census population estimates, multiple cities within our service territory have seen tremendous growth over the past 5 years with Buckeye, Grader Surprise and [ Collage ] all exceeding 15% population growth. This customer growth included a surge in new home builds and new meter sets.\nIn fact, meter sets through the first half of the year are on a similar pace to last year, which was the highest number of new meters in over a decade. Also of note, in Phoenix, inflation unemployment both remained below national averages. This provides us confidence in our current long-term sales growth guidance of 4% to 6% through 2027. We continue to monitor overall economic trends, both locally and nationally, and we'll take them into consideration for future updates.\nO&M was higher this quarter. And year-to-date, while our O&M costs were higher compared to last year. This is largely due to the timing of the planned major outage at our Fort Quantix plant. Our cost-saving measures and lean culture remains a central tenet of our operations and we continue to anticipate balanced spend aligned with our O&M guidance in the second half of the year. We are also maintaining our goal of declining O&M per megawatt hour while our customer footprint continues to grow. We are focused on executing our capital investment program and financing strategy. Our long-term plans remain intact with the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. We have already begun construction on our Gavan Harwood projects where we anticipate tax credit benefits and these key reliability resources are on track to be in service by 2026.\nTurning to our financing plan. We issued $800 million in bonds in the second quarter to pay off our 2025 maturities and support our funding strategy. We continue to be deliberate in our financing plan to support a balanced capital structure and balance sheet strength and find advantageous financial opportunities. We are reiterating all other aspects of guidance. And given the strong execution of our plan through the first half of this year, we expect that we will end the year in the top half of our full year EPS range of $4.40 to $4.60 per share. As always, we are closely monitoring sales growth and weather as we move through this summer. We look forward to continuing to execute our strategy throughout the rest of 2025.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

Geisler\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Pinnacle West Capital Corporation\n\nThanks, Amanda, and thank you all for joining us today. 2025 has started off in line with financial guidance we provided on the fourth quarter call in February. Before Andrew discusses the details of our first quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on recent operational and regulatory developments. Our diverse Arizona economy continues to thrive and grow at solid pace. Arizona has become a national leader in semiconductor and advanced manufacturing, which has attracted investments spanning the entire supply chain including robotic manufacturing, advanced packaging, research and development, material suppliers and workforce development. This quarter had several notable expansion announcements, including the additional $100 billion investment by Taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company beyond their original $65 billion investment. TSMC now intends to build 3 additional fabrication centers for a total of as well as 2 advanced packaging facilities and a research and development part.\nIn fact, TSMC held the groundbreaking for Fab 3 this week as construction progress continues to advance. Also, NVIDIA announced their manufacturing black well chips at TSMC's facilities, and we'll be partnering with advanced packaging and testing operations right here in Arizona. In addition to TSMC Arizona's total international exports rose almost 12% in 2024, the highest year-over-year growth rate in the country led by mining, semiconductors, computer equipment and aerospace products. Health care is another rapidly expanding sector, highlighted by Mayo Clinic's announcement of a nearly $2 billion investment in their Phoenix Healthcare Hospital campus, the clinic's largest investment to date. These announcements highlight the diversity of investments and robust growth that will fuel the Arizona economy for years to come.\nTurning to operations. We're focused on continuing to provide top-tier reliability for our customers. making year-round investments to secure a resilient grid and delivering excellence in customer experience. As we build out the grid to serve growth, we continue to increase our transmission investments to construct multiple high-voltage lines and substations. Through our comprehensive summer preparedness program, we've procured all necessary generation capacity and reserves, completed our grid inspections, procured critical materials needed frustration efforts and executed robust fire mitigation investments. This includes the deployment of fire sensing cameras that use artificial intelligence to proactively search for early signs of wildfires, enabling critical operation decisions to help keep communities safe. We're in the final stages of planned maintenance activities for our generation units. We have successfully completed our major outages for the Four Corners Power Plan.\nIn addition, we've invested in Tiller upgrades at Red Hawk and Sundance units reducing ambient de rates during hot summer evenings when customers use the most energy. Finally, Palo Verde Unit 1 is currently in planned refueling outage and expected to return to service in early May. Upon the successful completion of the latest refueling outage, all 3 Palo Verde units are poised to provide reliable around-the-clock power to help meet the summer energy demand. We stand ready to safely, reliably and affordably serve our customers as we head into summer, the season our customers depend on us the most. Turning to long-term resource procurement. We continue to make progress on our annual all-source request for proposals. As a reminder, we're seeking at least 2,000 megawatts of new resources to be in service between 2028 and 2030. We're in the process of evaluating project proposals and plan to have final projects selected later this year. which is expected to include a blend of ownership and PPA projects.\nWe continue to build and enhance our customer-centric culture, and our employees are focused on delivering excellent customer experience. Investing in advanced digital platforms is an important part of our strategy to deliver customer experience excellence while lowering costs over time. These efforts are paying off. Since APS now ranks in the top 10 nationally, in the J.D. Power Utility digital experience survey. I'm also proud to share that APS was recently recognized by Newsweek as one of the most trustworthy companies in America for 2024. On the regulatory front, we've been preparing for upcoming rate case filing and remain on track to file midyear. The primary objectives of this next rate case will be to recover costs and investments to secure a reliable and resilient grid develop a modernized rate structure to support the unprecedented growth of high load factor customers in our service territory and reduce regulatory lag while maintaining the lowest cost possible for customers.\nOur current rates are based on test year expenses that go back to 2021, and we look forward to working with the commission and stakeholders to update these costs while keeping rates affordable. The filing will include a formula rate proposal consistent with the commission's recently approved policy statement. In conclusion, we're executing our strategy while remaining focused on creating customer value and shareholder value throughout the year. Before I hand it over to Andrew, I want to give a special birthday shout out to both Andrew and Jacob are celebrating today. It's truly a pleasure working alongside you both wishing you both a very happy birthday.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew D. Cooper\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Pinnacle West Capital Corporation\n\nThank you, Ted, and thanks again to everyone for joining us today. This morning, we reported our first quarter 2025 financial results. I will review those results and provide additional details on sales and financial guidance. For the first quarter of 2025, we lost $0.04 per share compared to earnings of $0.15 per share for the first quarter of 2024. The primary driver for this decrease was the sale of Bright Canyon Energy in 2024 and which was a onetime benefit of $0.15 in the first quarter last year. Other negative drivers were higher O&M interest expense and depreciation and amortization, along with the positive amortization of an OPEB service credit rolling off in January. Partially offsetting these items were new rates that went into effect on March 8 of last year, providing a $0.29 year-over-year benefit this quarter. Other positive drivers were a gain from our El Dorado equity investment and higher transmission sales.\nBriefly touching upon weather. We averaged to normal weather for the quarter with little impact on margin. We continue to see a consistent ongoing influx of customers into our region as customer growth for the quarter was again strong at 2.3%, near the high end of our annual customer growth guidance. In fact, according to the latest report by the U.S. Census Bureau, last year, Maricopa County was the third fastest-growing county in the U.S. by a numeric number and adjacent Panel County was the fifth fastest-growing county by percentage growth. This trend of customer growth continues our need for investments in our system to ensure reliable service for all customers. Our current capital plan is designed to meet these needs, and our guidance remains unchanged. Our weather-normalized sales growth was 2.1% for the quarter, driven by strong C&I growth of 5.3% and caused by the continued ramp-up of both manufacturing and data center customers.\nAs extra high load factor customers have continued to grow as a proportion of our business, we have updated our procedures with respect to estimates of unbilled revenues for our customer classes. As a result, we had an adjustment in January to recalibrate accrued unbilled revenues, offsetting year-to-date sales growth by 1.9%. Even with the change, we expect our overall weather normalized sales growth to meet our guidance expectations of 4% to 6% for the year. Arizona remains a diverse growth in investment time. As Ted mentioned, TSMC announced that they will nearly triple their original expected investments in Arizona for a total of $165 billion. TSMC's first fabrication facility is already in full production. They recently stated that they've completed construction on their second facility and are working on accelerating the production start date and Fab 3 has broken ground.\nTSMC's expanded investment is expected to support 40,000 construction jobs over the next 4 years and create tens of thousands of high-paying high-tech jobs. As a reminder, these announcements are beyond our current long-term sales growth guidance of 4% to 6%, which is through 2027, but highlights the ongoing investments and opportunities in our service area. O&M was an anticipated drag on the first quarter. The major outage of the Four Corners Power Plant drove larger planned outage costs when compared to Q1 of last year. Additionally, expenses associated with IT projects increased O&M for this quarter versus the prior year. Guidance for 2025 O&M remains unchanged as these items were already considered in our guidance and are anticipated to be offset over the balance of the year.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We recently had positive conversations with all 3 credit rating agencies, resulting in no changes to our current ratings and stable outlooks. We are focused on maintaining solid ratings and metrics to the benefit of our customers as we continue to work with the commission and stakeholders on reducing regulatory lag through our upcoming rate case. Our guidance for financing remains unchanged, and featuring a mix of debt and equity sources, intended to maintain a balanced capital structure. And as a reminder, we do not currently utilize or rely on the transferability of tax credits for any of the financing needs in our plan. Finally, we are reaffirming all other guidance provided on our fourth quarter call and look forward to continuing to execute our strategy and reliably serving our customers as we head into the upcoming summer season. This concludes our prepared remarks.\nI will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Amanda Ho. Ma'am, the floor is yours.\n\nAmanda Ho\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Matthew. I would like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and webcast to review our fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings, recent developments and operating performance. Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Guldner; APS President, Ted Geisler; and our CFO, Andrew Cooper. Jacob Tetlow, COO, is also here with us.\nFirst, I need to cover a few details with you. The slides that we will be using are available on our Investor Relations website, along with our earnings release and related information. Today's comments and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations that actual results may differ materially from expectations. Our annual 2024 Form 10-K was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language as well as the risk factors and MD&A sections, which identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures. A replay of this call will be available shortly on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through March 4, 2025. I will now turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey B. Guldner\n\nPresident-Arizona Public Service Company & Executive Vice President, Public Policy, Pinnacle West Ca, Pinnacle West Capital Corp.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Amanda. Thank you all for joining us today. I want to look back on 2024 and just say I'm extremely proud of our company and all of our accomplishments. I'm going to provide several updates today and share the successes we were able to achieve despite the challenges that we faced. And we met or exceeded nearly every target we set for ourselves, including delivering strong service reliability to our customers. We made significant progress in the last year, but we're not done, and we look forward to continuing to execute on our plan.\nOn the regulatory front, we were able to achieve a constructive outcome in our last rate case. And even more importantly, the commission has been committed to finding ways to reduce regulatory lag. In December, the commission approved a policy statement on formula rates, recognizing the need for better regulatory recovery to support our customers and the tremendous growth that we're seeing in Arizona. We started the year with 2 new commissioners, Commissioner Walden and Commissioner Lopez, who joined the bench in January with Commissioner Marquez Peterson. In addition, Commissioner Thompson and Commissioner Myers were elected to Chairman and Vice Chairman, respectively, and we look forward to continuing to work collaboratively with the new bench of commissioners.\nTurning to the operations side. I want to start by recognizing our field team's exceptional execution in 2024. I'm especially proud of our employees for prioritizing safety and ending the year with 0 serious injuries or fatalities or SIFs. We were able to accomplish this through 113 consecutive days of 100 degrees and above in Phoenix. That's the longest stretch in Arizona history. And APS customers set a peak energy demand record of 8,210 megawatts on Sunday, August 4, breaking a prior record of 8,162 megawatts from 2023.\nOur generating fleet operated extremely well and was available when our customers critically needed the power. For the 16th consecutive year and the 20th overall, Palo Verde Generating Station's 3 nuclear units exceeded 30 million-megawatt hours of net generation and achieved a capacity factor of 93.7%.\nFinally, in December, I announced my retirement date at March 31. When I became CEO over 5 years ago, we began executing on a vision to improve our customer experience to position the company for long-term financial health and to enable the workforce of the future. And that future provides both reliable and carbon-free electricity. Ted and I have had a close and trusted partnership throughout our tenures, enabling a seamless succession and continued focus on advancing our company's strategy. The strength of our team and the dedication of our people is truly what makes this company special, and I can't fully express how proud I am to have been a part of this journey. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Ted to talk about our future and what we can look forward to.\n\nTheodore N. Geisler\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Pinnacle West Capital Corporation\n\nThank you, Jeff. And first, I'd like to take this opportunity to recognize everything you have done to create a strong foundation for our company's success with your collaborative leadership approach over the past 5 years. Under your leadership, our team has achieved a performance improvement across all aspects of our business, including improving our customers' experience and the company's long-term financial health. We're truly grateful for your years of service to Pinnacle West and APS, and I'm personally grateful for the trust and confidence you've placed in me during these years.\n\nJeffrey B. Guldner\n\nPresident-Arizona Public Service Company & Executive Vice President, Public Policy, Pinnacle West Ca, Pinnacle West Capital Corp.\n\nThanks, Ted.\n\nTheodore N. Geisler\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Pinnacle West Capital Corporation\n\nLooking ahead, I'm honored and humbled to continue serving our customers and shareholders through an era of unprecedented growth. Our team is focused on robust grid expansion, improving the timely recovery of our investments, delivering an exceptional customer experience and a relentless focus on talent development. I firmly believe we have the right strategy, the right team and the right culture to deliver consistently for our customers while creating sustained competitive value for our shareholders.\nArizona is well positioned for long-term growth, and our company is committed to enabling this growth through strong execution of our generation, transmission and distribution investments. We recognize the importance of creating customer value and remain focused on delivering an excellent customer experience. Our employees are putting customers first and working towards our goal of achieving an industry-leading customer experience.\nBecause of this commitment, we made solid progress on that front in 2024, finishing the year as a top performer among utilities for power quality and reliability, the top performer in helping customers choose rate options, a top performer in helping customers lower their bills and the top performer for overall digital experience. Our customer base, which for decades leaned heavily residential, is now more diverse than ever, mirroring the diversification in our growing Arizona economy. A robust increase in commercial and industrial customers in our service territory, including new chip manufacturing and expanded data center operations, is leading to strong economic growth across our entire state.\nAs an example, construction continues in Northwest Phoenix on the Taiwan Semiconductor manufacturing company facility. By the end of the decade, TSMC is expected to have invested $65 billion in 3 dedicated semiconductor fabs. The first fab began high-volume chip production in the fourth quarter of 2024. Amkor Technology also announced plans to invest $2 billion in the semiconductor advanced packaging and testing facility to be built nearby Peoria, Arizona, creating more than 2,000 jobs. Both companies, along with an already strong Arizona presence by Intel, is expected to stimulate many suppliers and related manufacturing and service entities to establish operations here, further increasing growth for our state and APS. TSMC and the nearby science and manufacturing park alone is anticipated to create approximately 62,000 jobs.\nMeanwhile, our residential customer base also continues to grow. In 2024, we installed more than 32,000 new residential meters, the most since before the Great Recession. Importantly, we see residential growth across our entire service territory. For example, the Yuma area saw a 34% year-over-year growth in meter sets, and [ Casa Grande ] saw a 36% year-over-year growth. Finally, Metro Phoenix experienced 49% year-over-year growth in new meter sets. We are well positioned to capitalize on this demand and have embarked on the largest transmission and generation expansion in our company's history. In fact, we recently procured nearly 7,300 megawatts of new resources to be in service between 2026 and 2028.\nWe're committed to serving Arizona's economic and population growth responsibly while maintaining a top-tier reliability for our customers as we connect new large customer facilities, like chip manufacturers and data centers. We continue to make progress on responsibly decarbonizing the electric grid, while focusing on reliability and affordability for our customers. Last year, we delivered top quartile reliability for our customers through another record year of summer heat and peak demand, while at the same time generating 54% of our total energy mix from carbon-free resources.\nWe're also working to improve timely investment recovery through innovative rate design and regulatory outcomes that benefit our customers and our company. This began last year when we secured the new system reliability benefit mechanism for improving cost recovery on new generation investments, and we look forward to continuing to collaborate with the commission and stakeholders on implementing a formula rate plan in the future. We're focused on executing our plan and expect to file a new rate case midyear 2025 to support Arizona's economic expansion.\nThank you for your time today. I'll now turn it over to Andrew, who will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings and our forward-looking financial expectations.\n\nAndrew D. Cooper\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Pinnacle West Capital Corporation\n\nThanks, Ted and Jeff, and thanks again to everyone for joining us today. Earlier this morning, we released our fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. I'll share those results and highlight key drivers, and we'll review our full year 2025 financial guidance, which was provided in Q3 2024.\nWe lost $0.06 per share during the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to a flat result in Q4 of 2023. Our largest positive drivers year-over-year were new rates, as well as benefits from weather and continued sales growth. These were offset by negative drivers in O&M, D&A, financing costs and other net. For the full year 2024, we ended at $5.24 per share, an increase of $0.83 per share from 2023, slightly above our updated annual guidance range. The constructive rate case outcome, as well as strong sales and usage growth throughout the year, were the largest positive drivers of this increase. We also had benefits from our approved surcharges and positive contributions from weather. Offsetting these benefits were increases in O&M, D&A and debt financing costs, as well as share dilution from our equity issuance.\nWe saw strong and consistent customer and sales growth continue throughout 2024, with customer growth coming in at 2.1% for the full year. This was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range of 1.5% to 2.5%, and continues the trend of steady customer growth each year. Last quarter, we had raised our full year 2024 sales growth guidance from 2% to 4% up to 4% to 6% to match our long-term growth guidance after seeing multiple quarters of strong growth, particularly in the C&I segment. This strong growth continued in the fourth quarter, with weather-normalized sales growth coming in at 5.5%. We ended the full year near the high end of our sales guidance -- sales growth guidance range at 5.7%. This growth was driven by both consistent residential sales growth of 1.1% for the full year and strong growth in our C&I segment of 9.7% for the year.\nAs Ted mentioned, this growth trend reflects the diversity of our Arizona economy as we saw growth across the breadth of C&I sectors from small business, to manufacturing. The robust weather benefit in 2024 allowed us the opportunity to derisk future spend. We are focused on cost efficiencies, and we continue to work towards our goal of declining O&M per megawatt hour. Cost management is a priority, and we will continue to strive for operational excellence and efficiency through our lean culture and initiatives.\nLooking ahead, we are reiterating all aspects of 2025 guidance provided on our third quarter 2024 call. Our weather-normalized sales growth guidance for 2025 remains unchanged at 4% to 6%, matching our long-term expectations, with extra high load factors, C&I customers contributing 3% to 5%. As Ted talked about earlier, we continue to see both residents and businesses viewing Arizona as a highly attractive destination to call home. We are also reaffirming our capital and financing plans and are already making progress on both.\nOur capital plan continues to focus on strengthening infrastructure, improving reliability and meeting the accelerating demands of our growing service territory. These investments include strategic transmission and new generation resources, with over 40% of our future capital investments being tracked via our system reliability benefit surcharge or through our FERC formula rates, allowing for more timely recovery. Our financing plan supports a balanced utility capital structure matched to our spending profile and includes a mix of both debt and equity. We are focused on maintaining a solid balance sheet and stable credit ratings.\nWe completed our block equity in early 2024 and closed out the year by opening an at-the-market program, consistent with the cadence of our investment. Our laser focus on cost management, balanced capital investment and financing plans, along with the strong growth trajectory of our service territory, allows us to reaffirm our long-term 5% to 7% EPS growth guidance based on the midpoint of our original 2024 guide of $4.60 to $4.80 per share.\nWe ended 2024 strong and are confident in our plan for 2025 and the long term while continuing to recognize and address the challenges of regulatory lag with our regulators. We are focused on executing our plans to deliver reliable, affordable service to our increasingly diversified and growing service territory while maintaining financial health and creating value into the future. This concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Amanda Ho. Ma'am, the floor is yours.\n\nAmanda Ho\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Matthew. I would like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and webcast to review our second quarter 2024 earnings, recent developments and operating performance. Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Guldner; and our CFO, Andrew Cooper. Ted Geisler, APS President; Jacob Tetlow, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Jose Esparza Senior Vice President, Public Policy, are also here with us.\nFirst, I need to cover a few details with you. The slides that we will be using are available on our Investor Relations website, along with our earnings release and related information. Today's comments and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and actual results may differ materially from expectations. Our second quarter 2024 Form 10-Q filed this morning.

Guldner\n\nPresident-Arizona Public Service Company & Executive Vice President, Public Policy, Pinnacle West Ca, Pinnacle West Capital Corp.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Amanda, and thank you all for joining us today. Second quarter financials were positively impacted by a number of things to the implementation of new customers weather and increased sales growth. Before Andrew discusses the details of our second quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on recent operational and regulatory developments.\nStarting with our operations. As we progress through the summer season, really proud to say our team continues to excel in delivering reliable service to our customers. In fact, we just experienced the hottest June on record in Phoenix with an average high temperature of over 109 degrees and an average overnight temperature of 85 degrees. According to the National Weather Service, the average high temperature in Phoenix during the second quarter was 98 degrees Fahrenheit, which is an increase of 2% over the same period last year and 1.4% above the 10-year historical average.\nThe number of residential degree cooling days -- sorry, the residential cooling degree days, that's a utility measure of the effects of weather in this year's second quarter increased 53% compared to the same period a year ago and was 24% higher than historical 10-year averages. Our robust planning, resource procurement efforts and our dedicated team have allowed us to provide exceptional service to our customers during this unrelenting summer season. And I really do want to recognize our operators and our field teams for doing an exceptional job making sure our customers continue to have reliable service through this persistent heat.\nWith the extreme weather we experienced each summer, it remains as important as ever that we continue to assist our communities through heat relief support programs. We partnered with local community organizations to aid the state's most vulnerable populations, and this support includes a collaboration with the foundation for Senior Living, where we offer emergency repair, replacement of AC systems during the hot summer months the Salvation Army's network of cooling and hydration stations across Arizona and an emergency shelter and addiction protection program in partnership with St. [ Dosedel ].\nWe also offer a variety of assistance programs for those who are struggling with their bill. These resources include the Energy Sport program, which provides limited income customers with up to a 60% discount on their monthly bill crisis bill assistance that provides up to $1,000 annually to qualified limited income customers who experienced unexpected financial hardships and Project Share, which is a Salvation Army administer service, providing up to $500 annually in emergency bill assistance.\nWe plan years in advance to serve customers with reliable and affordable energy. Our resource planners secure a diverse energy mix to meet demand like things like solar and wind and rely on the energy provided by our share of the [ Talavera ] Nuclear Generating Station when temperatures caused demand to increase, APS's strength and resilience comes from using flexible resources like natural gas and energy storage to keep homes and businesses cool over long stretches of extreme heat.\nWe've taken all of the above approach to provide the most affordable and reliable service when our customers need us suppose. And as part of our vigorous planning, we've recently executed agreements on multiple projects resulting from our 2023 all-source RFP to be online between 2026 and 2028, and that includes over 400 megawatts of APS-owned resources, and those are already reflected in our capital plan. We're still in negotiations on additional projects, and we look forward to announcing those in the future, and we are always seeking the best combination of resources, serve our customers reliably while not sacrificing affordability and continuing to build towards our clean energy future.\nAdditionally, we remain focused on providing exceptional customer service. I'm proud to share that through the first 2 quarters of the year, the 2024 J.D. Power residential and business survey results have placed us in the first quartile compared to peers. We've made remarkable progress over the past few years moving from fourth quartile to first, and I can absolutely say that progress would not have happened without the dedication and commitment of our hard-working employees across the company.\nTurning to regulatory update. The Commission has continued to progress in the regulatory lag docket at the July open meeting, the Commission unanimously voted to hold additional workshops and the next workshop is scheduled for October 3. And Commission staff stated that the workshops will be focused on formula rates and future test years with experts sharing their experience with each of these regulatory structures and we'll continue to work with the commission and stakeholders on this important issue of reducing regulatory lag in Arizona.\nWe've made solid progress through the first half of this year, improving our customer experience, enhancing our stakeholder relationships and executing on regulatory priorities. And we look forward to continuing to provide exceptional service for our customers through the balance of the year.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew D. Cooper\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Pinnacle West Capital Corporation\n\nThank you, Jeff, and thanks again to everyone for joining us today. This morning, we released our second quarter 2024 financial results. I will review those results and provide some additional details on key drivers for the quarter. We earned $1.76 per share this quarter, an increase of $0.82 per share compared to second quarter last year. New customer rates, weather and continued robust sales growth were the main drivers for the quarter-over-quarter increase.\nThe 2019 rate case appeal outcome, income tax timing and O&M savings were other positive drivers for the quarter. Higher interest expense and depreciation and amortization expense were the primary negative drivers compared to last year. As Jeff mentioned, we experienced the hottest June on record, which contributed to a $0.29 benefit from weather versus this time last year. As a reminder, last year, we saw the mildest June since 2009.\nOur sales growth continued to be strong during the second quarter, providing a $0.24 benefit with total weather-normalized sales increasing 5.5% compared to second quarter last year. C&I continued its robust growth at 10% for the quarter. This is primarily due to the ramping of large manufacturing and data center customers in our service territory. Although we are not changing 2024 sales growth guidance at this time, our weather-normalized sales growth year-to-date has aligned more closely with our long-term sales growth guidance of 4% to 6% and of which 3% to 5% is expected to be attributable to our extra high load factor customers.\nTurning to economic conditions in Arizona. We experienced 2.1% customer growth in the second quarter and the fundamental economic factors supporting customer growth remains strong. National inflation is declining with the Phoenix Metro area in particular, experiencing a year-over-year inflation rate of 2.7% and as of June data, below the national average of 3%. Additionally, Arizona's unemployment rate hit an all-time record low of 3.3% in June, which is below the national unemployment rate of 4.1%. These positive economic indicators underscore the strong support for continued growth in our service territory.\nOur O&M initiatives have delivered benefits this quarter. We have been successful in our efforts to lower core O&M expense across multiple areas of our operations, including both nuclear and nonnuclear generation costs. We are making progress in our planned outages to keep our generation resilient and reliable and our goal continues to be declining O&M per [indiscernible] an hour, while ensuring we meet the critical reliability demands of the summer season.\nWhile interest expenses rose in this quarter compared to last year due to higher debt balances and increased interest rates, we are managing our financing costs proactively. Additionally, our depreciation and amortization expense has increased, reflecting our investment in planned IT projects and other grid investments. These strategic projects are expected to yield long-term benefits even as they create additional drag throughout the year. We have continued the successful execution of our capital investment program and related financing strategies this quarter as well as managing our debt maturities.\nThis quarter, APS issued a $450 million bond in early May. And in early June, we successfully closed on both $525 million in convertible notes and $350 million in floating rate notes at Pinnacle Labs. We are committed to seeking the most advantageous opportunities to strategically finance our capital plan.\nFinally, all other aspects of guidance remain unchanged and including 2024 EPS. However, if the sales growth and weather trends we experienced during the second quarter continue, we expect to be towards the higher end of our EPS range. We are closely monitoring sales growth and weather for the remainder of the year. We have had a strong first half of the year and are excited to continue executing our strategy throughout the rest of 2024. We are focused on ensuring our customers have safe and reliable power to navigate the summer heat.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

Guldner\n\nPresident-Arizona Public Service Company & Executive Vice President, Public Policy, Pinnacle West Ca, Pinnacle West Capital Corp.\n\nThanks, Amanda, and thank you all for joining us today. 2024 started off in line with the financial guidance that we provided on the fourth quarter call in February. And before Andrew discusses the details of our first quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on our recent operational and on regulatory developments.\nWith the temperatures in Arizona quickly heating up, we're focused on executing our robust summer preparedness program with the resource adequacy continuing to be extremely important as energy demands increase and energy supplies in the Southwest [ Titan ]. To serve our customers with top-tier reliability, we work year round on operational preparedness, resource planning, procuring sufficient reserve margins, creating customer partnerships to manage peak demand and maintaining a comprehensive fire mitigation program.\nIn fact, as we head into the wildfire season, the company is taking further action to our customers and our communities from the risk of wildfires. Our comprehensive fire mitigation strategy includes 3 key categories to ensure defense and depth. First, we have a robust vegetation management program, including creating defensible space around poles and infrastructure, and strong coordination with forest management officials around the state.\nSecond, we deploy technology that's targeted at managing wildfire risk, and that includes weather stations, cameras, remote control, [ search lining ] devices and advanced risk modeling software. And third, we apply several risk-informed operating protocols, such as specific requirements for how our crews work safely in fire-prone areas, in addition to new protocols such as power safety and public safety power shutoffs or PSPS.\nWhile PSPS is a new protocol for our program, we've been working on this implementation following last summer, and we've partnered with local communities first responders and state officials to ensure that our customers are informed and know what to expect. We've had community workshops and have invested a lot in customer communications to ensure that this is a transparent process. We're committed to actively taking steps to prevent wildfires and to safeguard the communities that we serve while continuing to learn from operating experience developed throughout our industry.\nTurning to our operational preparedness. It's extremely important that our generation units are ready for the summer. We're in the final stages of our planned maintenance activities for our thermal units ahead of the summer period to ensure our system is ready to serve. In addition, Palo Verde's Unit 3 is currently in a planned refueling outage that began on April 6, and it's on schedule to return to service in early May. Upon the successful completion of the latest refueling outage, all 3 units are poised to provide around the clock clean energy to help meet the demand for the summer for the entire Desert Southwest.\nI'm also proud to say that we're starting this year with J.D. Power residential customer satisfaction survey scores that place APS within the first quartile for overall satisfaction compared to its large investor-owned peers. APS made gains in every category, including power quality and reliability, p power ] corporate citizenship, billing and payment communications and customer care, both digital and phone in the first quarter. Results like this take the dedication and the commitment of all employees across the company, and we look forward to continuing to make improvements for our customers and providing a more frictionless experience.\nTurning to regulatory. We've successfully implemented the rate case outcome on March 8 for our customers. The commission recently voted to hold a narrow rehearing on our rate case that's limited to the grid access charge. That charge is a rate design issue where the commission had increased the revenue allocation to distributed generation solar customers to better align their rates with cost of service. The commission intends, I think, to further examine whether the excess charge is just unreasonable and we'll be participating in those proceedings.\nAdditionally, the commission has turned its focus to the regulatory lag docket. The first workshop was held on March 19 with multiple stakeholders presenting a variety of options on how to holistically address regulatory lag and interested parties have been invited to file written comments into the docket and the commission has voiced their intent of having further workshops that will be noticed in the future. We look forward to continuing to work with the commission and with other stakeholders on addressing regulatory lag in Arizona. Although 2024 is off to a solid start, we know we have much to do still, and we look forward to continuing to execute on our priorities throughout the year.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew D. Cooper\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Pinnacle West Capital Corporation\n\nThank you, Jeff, and thanks again to everyone for joining us today. This morning, we reported our first quarter 2024 financial results. I will review those results and provide additional details on weather, sales and guidance.\nIn the first quarter of 2024, we achieved earnings of $0.15 per share compared to a loss of $0.03 per share in the first quarter of 2023. This improvement was driven by several key factors: the sale of Bright Canyon Energy, the implementation of new rates on March 8, along with increases in adjusted revenue. And finally, robust customer and sales growth. These positive impacts were partially offset by milder year-over-year weather and increases in interest expense depreciation and amortization and L&M.\nThe Bright Canyon Energy transaction provided a onetime benefit of $0.15 per share this quarter. This follows the initial phase of the sale completed in the third quarter of last year. In addition, as Jeff mentioned, we successfully implemented new rates for our customers in March and are seeing a benefit from these new revenues.\nTurning to weather. Although conditions in the first 3 months of this year were normal, we experienced a drag of $0.07 per share year-over-year. This drag can be attributed to the exceptionally cold start in 2023, which was one of the coldest in the Phoenix Metro area since 1979, and to March 2023 being the coldest March in over 3 decades. Customer growth for the quarter came in as expected at 1.8% and consistent with our guidance range of 1.5% [ 0.5% ] and our weather-normalized sales growth came in at 5.9% for the quarter, driven by robust C&I growth. Because first quarter is historically a smaller quarter for the company, we're still expecting our weather-normalized sales growth to come in within our existing guidance range of 2% to 3% for the year.\nArizona's economy remains a diverse release growth in Investment hub. A prominent example of this vibrant economic activity is Taiwan Semiconductor which recently announced a $25 billion increase to the previously announced $40 billion investment in Arizona, a total of $65 billion. TSMC announced plans to build a third facility by the end of the decade, and the facilities are now expected to employ more than 6,000 workers, of which TSMC has already hired over 2,000. In addition, there continues to be sustained interest for additional data center and manufacturing development within our service territory. Although these developments are outside of our current 3-year sales growth guidance, they represent significant long-term opportunities for earnings growth and the potential for enhanced cost efficiency for all our customers.\nResidential growth in our region has been consistently strong. Maricopa County was recognized by the U.S. Census Bureau as the fourth largest growing county in the nation in 2023, welcoming over 30,000 new residents. This ongoing influx of residents underscores the need for continuous investment in our infrastructure to ensure reliable service for all our customers. Our current capital expenditure and financing plans are designed to meet these expanding demands effectively.\nO&M was a slight drag compared to Q1 2023. [ We have 1 ] less than expected, primarily due to delays in procuring essential materials needed for planned maintenance work at our power plants. These delays are expected to shift the timing of certain costs from first to second quarter. Despite ongoing inflationary pressures and the costs associated with supporting our expanding customer base, we remain committed to our 2024 O&M guidance, which is a year-over-year reduction in core expense.\nInterest expense was higher this quarter compared to the first quarter of last year driven by increased interest rates and higher debt balances, and we continue to monitor the actions of the Federal Reserve. In addition, our depreciation and amortization expense is higher as 1 of 2 large planned information technology products went into service this quarter. These projects are extremely important to make sure we have updated systems and the tools necessary to reliably serve our customers. Due to the shorter depreciation schedule for IT projects, we expect these expenses to create meaningful drag throughout the year and have already accounted for them in our annual guidance.\nAfter the [ wreck case ] outcome, we successfully completed our planned equity offering of about $750 million of common stock and a forward sale. We will determine the most opportune time to settle the forward sale agreements and invest the funds into the utility to maintain a healthy and sustainable capital structure. In addition, the rating agencies have completed their reviews of our ratings and importantly, all 3 rating agencies have resolved our outlook from negative to stable. Moody's and Fitch downgraded Pinnacle West ratings by 1 notch with Moody's downgrading APS ratings 1 notch as well, and we are now similarly rated by all 3 agencies. We continue to focus on reducing regulatory lag and sustaining our targeted cash flow metrics with adequate to maintain solid investment-grade credit ratings for the benefit of our customers. Finally, we are reaffirming all other guidance provided on the fourth quarter call and look forward to continuing to execute our strategy and reliably serving our customers as we head into the upcoming summer season.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Amanda Ho. Ma'am, the floor is yours.\n\nAmanda Ho\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Matthew. I would like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and webcast to review our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings, recent developments and operating performance. Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Guldner; and our CFO, Andrew Cooper. [ Ted Geisler ], APS' President; and [ Jacob Telleo ], Executive Vice President of Operations are also here with us.\nFirst, I need to cover a few details with you. The slides that we will be using are available on our Investor Relations website, along with our earnings release and related information.\nToday's comments and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and actual results may differ materially from expectations. Our annual 2023 Form 10-K was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language as well as the risk factors and MD&A [indiscernible], which identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures.\nA replay of this call will be available shortly on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through March 5, 2024. I will now turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew D. Cooper\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Pinnacle West Capital Corporation\n\nThank you, Amanda, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. I will first cover our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results before handing it to Jeff, who will discuss our recent rate case outcome, growth outlook and strategy. Afterwards, I will finish up with our 2024 guidance and long-term financial outlook.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we achieved a $0.21 increase in earnings per share compared to the same quarter in 2022. This year-over-year improvement was largely driven by a $0.41 uplift in gross margin attributable to increased sales and usage as well as higher transmission revenue and contributions from the LFCR and 2019 rate case appeal.\nThe lack of certain prior period items from Q4 2022 contributed to a $0.21 benefit to other income and expense on a year-over-year basis. These increases versus the prior year were partially offset by higher O&M expense, depreciation and amortization, interest expense and benefit costs.\nFor the full year 2023 we earned $4.41 per share, a $0.15 increase over 2022, surpassing our guidance range of $4.10 to $4.30 per share. A significant factor in this result was a $0.22 year-over-year weather benefit driven by an unprecedented summer heat wave during the third quarter. Overall, weather contributed $0.48 in 2023 compared to normal weather.\nRevenues from adjustor mechanisms, transmission and increased sales and usage were also positive drivers for the year. In addition, other income and expense was $0.33 higher year-over-year, driven by the lack of certain prior expense items from 2022 and the sale of Frank Canyon assets in the third quarter of 2023. These increases versus 2022 were partially offset by higher O&M expense, depreciation and amortization, interest expense and benefit costs.\nOverall, we ended 2023 with 2% customer growth maintaining the year's long upward trajectory of consistent growth in our service territory. Weather-normalized sales growth was within the expected guidance range at 1.5% in 2023 and driven by 3.3% growth in our C&I customer segment. I'll now pass the discussion to Jeff to talk about our rate case outcome, growth outlook and strategy before I continue with our 2024 guidance and long-term financial outlook.\n\nJeffrey B. Guldner\n\nPresident-Arizona Public Service Company & Executive Vice President, Public Policy, Pinnacle West Ca, Pinnacle West Capital Corp.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Andrew, and thank you all for joining us today. As you all know, just a few days ago, the commission voted to approve our 2022 rate case. I'm pleased to say that this rate case decision was ultimately reasonable and constructive. I'll highlight a few of the main outcomes, including an improved authorized return on equity, the approval of a new generation rider, and a balanced revenue requirement increase among other items. I'll also discuss our growth outlook and future strategy coming out of this case. Lastly, as Andrew mentioned, he'll provide our 2024 guidance and our long-term financial outlook.\nAfter the unconstructive outcome of our 2019 rate case, we designed a comprehensive strategy and plan, and I'm pleased to share that we have accomplished the goals that we set out 2 years ago. We executed on a strategy centered on creating shareholder value by creating customer value, and we've seen significant improvements in our J.D. Power survey results.\nNot only have we been successful in moving from fourth quartile in 2021 to second quartile at the end of 2023 for both our residential and our business customers. We finished the year second amongst all large investor-owned utilities in phone customer care and in perfect power. Reliability has continued to be a top priority, and we're once again top quartile meeting this milestone 10 years out of the last 11. This reliability was put on full display during the summer of 2023 when Arizona broke numerous heat records yet our team delivered outstanding performance for our customers.\nAnother important goal that we set was to build more collaborative relationships with stakeholders in the regulatory process, and we succeeded in adding supportive regulatory decisions, and that includes both the efficient implementation of our successful 2019 rate case appeal as well as the most recent rate case.\nAnd finally, we focused on shareholder value by deferring any equity issuances and continuing to grow our dividend during this challenging period.\nNow I'll walk through some of the major highlights of the rate case. The commission adopted a net revenue increase of $253.4 million. From the very beginning, we focused this rate case on improving the authorized ROE to recognize the risk and the investment needed to serve our rapidly growing service territory and the commission did that.\nThe commission voted to adopt an authorized return on equity of 9.55% with a 0.25% fair value increment and a combination of those two is equivalent to a 9.85% return on equity. With this decision, the commission has adopted an authorized return that's more in line with national averages and it recognizes that we're one of the fastest-growing states in the nation and we need to attract capital in order to fund the investments necessary to reliably serve our customers. In addition, the commission voted to approve our request for a system reliability benefit surcharge. This is an important surcharge that will allow us to invest in much needed generation resources to continue to serve our customers reliably and affordably while reducing regulatory lag.\nImportantly, the SRB will allow for the most cost-effective generation resources to be built for the benefit of our customers and to promote a healthier balance of PPAs and utility owned assets. Later on, Andrew will discuss how the SRB provides future opportunities for CapEx growth.\nIt's also noteworthy that the commissioners made positive amendments to the revised recommended opinion and order at the open meeting that increased the net revenue requirement and addressed some items that would have created additional regulatory lag. This highlights the improved regulatory environment and our ability to achieve constructive outcomes. However, even at the final net revenue requirement, the outcome underscores the continued challenge from lagging historical costs. We look forward to working with the commission on addressing these lagging costs in the near future through both the regulatory lag docket, which will have a workshop on March 19 as well as through future rate case filings.\nNow I'll share our next step and strategies as we look to the future. We're focused on solid execution and continue to remain optimistic about our future for many reasons, and I'll discuss each of these reasons in more detail. First, I'm optimistic about our attractive service territory and consistent customer growth. Arizona remains among the fastest-growing states in the nation where other states have been experiencing little or negative customer growth, we've been benefiting from steady and consistent retail customer growth of 2% for the last few years and project that growth to continue in the range of 1.5% to 2.5% in 2024.\nWe believe that the constructive business environment with ample job growth, a competitive cost of living and the desirable climate will continue to grow the Metro Phoenix market and benefit the local economy.\nFocusing on our service territory specifically, we continue to see development from a variety of sectors, which is helping to diversify our local economy more than ever. The availability of a skilled workforce in our state's business-friendly policies and regulations, coupled with our low propensity for natural disasters and our clean energy development potential make us uniquely situated for growth. The tremendous demand that we see from large commercial and industrial customers will help spread fixed costs over increasing sales and has a positive multiplier impact for jobs and surrounding communities.\nWe'll continue to focus our economic development approach on helping to attract and expand businesses and job creators. As you can see from this graphic from the Arizona Commerce Authority the diversity of the commercial and industrial growth in Arizona presents exciting opportunities. Our state is seeing growth in a wide range of sectors, driven by manufacturing, reshoring, the clean economy and digital infrastructure needs, which will help reduce the risk of any potential downturns in a particular industry to keep our economy and grow stable.\nTurning to regulatory environment. We've seen meaningful improvement through the last couple of years. The Arizona Corporation Commission has established a record of balanced and constructive decisions, including our most recent rate case. And importantly, beyond those decisions, the commission has also recognized the need to address regulatory lag in a holistic manner and has opened a docket to review and discuss various solutions going forward. And as I mentioned, will kick off next month. We look forward to working with the commission on addressing this important issue.\nIn addition, the commission reaffirmed its policy on settlements. Historically, outcomes achieved through settlement have delivered new and innovative customer programs and other results that benefit a broad and diverse range of stakeholder interest in our state energy future. We believe the nature of the settlement process itself yields more informed constructive and mutually beneficial results.\nThe third reason that we're confident is the clear path that we are on in our transition to clean energy. We came out with our clean energy commitment in early 2020, and I'm proud that we've made significant progress. We plan on retiring our remaining [ Choa ] units by next year and to completely exit coal by 2031. Since our clean energy commitment, we've procured nearly 5,000 megawatts of additional clean energy and storage and issued another all-source RFP for an additional 1,000 megawatts of reliable capacity, including at least 700 megawatts of renewable energy. With the approval of the SRB mechanism in this rate case, we're even better positioned to establish ownership in these new clean energy assets for our customers' benefit.\nThe fourth reason I'm optimistic about the future is because of the tremendous amount of growth and opportunities we have in our FERC jurisdictional transmission business. We've increased our FERC transmission spend for the next 3 years and expect to have a much greater need for transmission capital spend over the next decade. We recently filed our 10-year transmission system plan with the Corporation Commission showing five critical transmission projects that are needed to strengthen resiliency to support the growing energy needs of our customers and allow for greater access to diversity of resources in markets across the region.\nThe total investment for APS' portion of these projects is estimated to total over $5 billion over the next 10 years. We look forward to developing this critical infrastructure that's necessary to continue to provide safe and reliable service to our customers. And finally, I'm optimistic about the future because my entire management team and I have been committed to executing a customer-centric strategy that will allow us to deliver exceptional customer service.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we've made significant progress in our J.D. Power survey results and have moved from fourth quartile in 2021 to second quartile at the end of 2023. We Additionally, we're focused on delivering on our goal to provide reliable energy to our customers in the most affordable manner. Increase [indiscernible] rates remain well below the rate of inflation, even with the latest rate case decision. We remain focused on customer affordability and keeping it central to our plans to provide long-term sustainable growth. That focus, coupled with continued cost management creates rate headroom for the future. I'll now turn the call back over to Andrew to provide guidance and share our long-term financial outlook.\n\nAndrew D. Cooper\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Pinnacle West Capital Corporation\n\nThanks, Jeff. I'll now discuss our 2024 guidance and future financial outlook. For our 2024 outlook, we are establishing an EPS guidance range of $4.60 to $4.80 per share, reflecting the additional revenues from our recent rate case outcome, with new rates effective March 8. This revenue is partially offset by continued drag from increased expenses not captured in our historical test year.\nAs Jeff mentioned, this rate case was balanced and constructive and this decision will create a solid foundation from which we will grow. However, it is important to highlight that we continue to face significant regulatory lag due to the timing of our historical test year, which ended June 30, 2022. This lag is mainly due to higher interest rates on borrowed capital, higher depreciation due to increased rate base growth, lower contribution from pension nonservice credits and increased O&M expense due to planned generation outages.\nWe are encouraged by the commission's focus on holistically addressing regulatory lag through the newly created regulatory lag docket. We are committed to addressing these current costs in our next rate case and working with the commission to find solutions to reduce these impacts on our current comp stop. Our commitment to mitigating regulatory lag is a priority, aiming to preserve our financial stability and build shareholder value between rate cases.\nDiving a bit deeper into 2024. The largest positive driver of our guidance will be new revenues from the implementation of the rate case decision. Other positive drivers are expected to include increased revenues from sales growth, the LFCR and the full year impact of the 2019 rate case appeal outcome. The most significant year-over-year negative driver is expected to be weather due to the record-breaking heat wave we saw in 2023 as we plan for normal weather. Other negative drivers are expected to be higher depreciation and amortization expense, increased financing costs and higher O&M primarily due to planned outages.\nTurning to customer growth. As Jeff mentioned, we once again expect our customer growth to be within the range of 1.5% to 2.5%, which continues to highlight the attractiveness of our state and service territory for customer in migration. For 2024 sales growth, we expect 2% to 4% growth, of which 2.5% to 3.5% is driven by extra high load factor, C&I cutters. These sales create operating leverage and ultimately rate headroom for all customers. We have seen a steady ramping of these customers and anticipate it will continue to ramp through 2024. Longer term, we expect our weather-normalized sales growth to be within the range of 4% to 6% through 2026 with 3% to 5% of this growth driven by our large C&I customers.\nTurning now to what we strive to provide investors going forward, I will discuss our financial outlook and goals. We are rebasing our long-term EPS growth guidance of 5% to 7% and off the midpoint of our 2024 guidance range of $4.60 to $4.80 per share. While our financial plan supports this growth rate for the long term, our goal is to work towards a more consistent and timely cost recovery profile. We have already made solid progress toward reducing regulatory lag with the commission approving the system reliability benefit surcharge.\nWhile this mechanism will enable more timely cost recovery for utility-owned generation, we must first develop these projects before the mechanism begins recovering costs. Therefore, this mechanism has the potential to create strong value in the future. but we must first work through the natural development cycle and get projects in service. In addition, the commission has reiterated its policy on settlements, which may streamline future rate case filings while creating even more collaboration between parties.\nFinally, we will engage with regulators to holistically address regulatory lag through the newly created docket and commit our cadence of future rate cases to ensure we are recovering our material costs. We are allocating $6 billion for investment through 2026, contributing to a 14% increase in our capital investment profile compared to this time last year. This plan incorporates additional capital investment in generation that will qualify for the new SRB mechanism. In addition, an increasing portion of our capital plan is directed towards bolstering our FERC jurisdictional transmission infrastructure. Average annual spend is now more than double what it was as recently as 5 years ago. We have designed a well-balanced capital allocation strategy that optimizes our ability to receive timely recovery for investments while providing reliable service across our rapidly growing service territory.\nImportantly, the SRB will expand our capacity to self-build generation to meet customer needs while reducing lag. Projects that meet the requirements of the outsource RFP and compete from a cost and reliability perspective would qualify for recovery through the SRB. We expect approved projects to be included in rates with an approximately 180 days of in-service significantly shortening the time between investment and recovery on those assets compared to a traditional rate case. Recovery will be at the prevailing weighted average cost of capital, less 100 basis points until a future rate case. This discount will provide customers an immediate benefit while achieving rate gradualism and reducing lag.\nWe have highlighted five potential near-term opportunities to secure project cost recovery through the SRB with final outcomes dependent on ongoing procurement processes. Additional opportunities are also expected to arise based on future RFP outcomes and projects aligning with this mechanism.\nExpansion of our capital investment plan is poised to drive substantial rate base growth. Consequently, we are revising our rate base growth guidance to an annual CAGR of 6% to 8%. In addition, with the adoption of the SRB, we now expect an increase in tracked capital, which will reduce regulatory lag in the future. By increasing our transmission spend and generation investment that qualifies for the SRB, we expect to double the amount of tracked capital, which will improve our ability to receive timely cost recovery and reduce the amount to be recovered in future rate cases.\nTo fortify our capital structure and support our robust capital expenditure plan, we are planning to issue a mix of debt and equity securities over the 2024 through 2026 period. Our principal goal is to have a healthy capital structure at the utility with no less than 50% equity. We have noted since 2021, the need for up to $500 million of equity to support a balanced utility capital structure. You'll recall this was deferred over the past 2-plus years as we sought to insulate shareholders as we work to improve the regulatory environment in Arizona. The capital structure need has grown by an additional $100 million to $200 million over that time and will be required to true up our equity ratio.\nAt the same time, our CapEx profile has grown by almost 15%, nearly $1 billion over a 4-year window. While we will pursue a blend of financing solutions across APS and Pinnacle West to address our investment objectives, sources of incremental capital may include up to $400 million of additional equity or equity-like securities over the period, size to approximately 40% of this incremental CapEx. The financing options for this incremental CapEx may potentially include at-the-market issuances, though we will continue to evaluate alternatives to common equity.\nAs we advance into 2024, our dedication to cost management continues to guide our operations. Core O&M is declining year-over-year despite continued inflation, which supports our long-term goal of reduced O&M per megawatt hour. Notably, planned major outages are scheduled for Four Corners, Unit 5, Red Hawk and West Phoenix with refueling outages at Palo Verde, marking a critical phase in our maintenance strategy. The Four Corners outage at Unit 5 specifically is the last major planned outage at the unit before its retirement with the last major planned [indiscernible] Unit 4 scheduled for spring of 2025. Despite these necessary planned outages, our commitment to operational efficiency and lean practices remains intact for the long term.\nOur goal of declining O&M per megawatt hour is strongly established and underscores our effective cost management with rapid growth in our service territory. The second chart on this slide highlights our success in maintaining O&M cost increases below the rate of inflation since 2017 and outperforming both national CPI trends and more specifically, local inflation rates in Phoenix. This achievement is a testament to our unwavering focus on optimizing operations and fostering a culture of efficiency, across our organization.\nWe continue to provide an attractive dividend yield as part of our total shareholder return and maintain a goal of managing our payout ratio into a sustained range of 65% to 75% in the future. With a solid track record of annual dividend growth, we understand the importance of returning value to our investors. We are committed to working diligently to ensure our dividend remains competitive.\nTurning to our credit ratings. Following our recent rate case resolution and other developments in the Arizona regulatory climate, we are working with the rating agencies as they evaluate our credit. Healthy investment-grade credit ratings are pivotal to our financial profile as they contribute to reducing borrowing costs, thereby directly benefiting our customers through more favorable financial conditions.\nWe are adjusting our FFO to debt target range to 14% to 16% to properly balance the financing needs of the company and solid credit metrics. Our balance sheet remains strong, reinforcing our financial foundation. This balance sheet strength provides us flexibility to navigate the current interest rate environment and strategically address our near-term maturities and as well as ongoing and future investment needs.\nLooking back at the last few years and the strides we've made, we are enthusiastic about our future and the potential of the company. Overcoming the setbacks of the private case, we achieved the goal set forth during the preceding 2 years, and we've aligned closely with the commission and stakeholders to secure a constructive outcome in this rate case. While challenges such as regulatory lag persist, our commitment to seek collaborative solutions with stakeholders, ACC staff and the commission remains firm.\nOur dedication to keeping customer costs affordable is evident through our efficient O&M practices, seeking to ensure that rates and costs stay below inflation during this period of unprecedented growth in our service territory. With a more constructive regulatory environment and a continued focus on affordability, we look forward to approaching the future with a clear vision and optimism for our customers and investors. This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

[Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Amanda Ho. Ma'am, the floor is yours.\n\nAmanda Ho\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Matthew. I would like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and webcast to review our third quarter 2023 earnings, recent developments and operating performance. Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Guldner; and our CFO, Andrew Cooper. Ted Geisler, APS' President, Jacob Tetlow, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Jose Esparza Senior Vice President of Public Policy, are also here with us. First, I need to cover a few details with you. The slides that we will be using are available on our Investor Relations, along with our earnings release and related information. Today's comments and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and actual results may differ rely from expectations. Our third quarter 2023 Form 10-Q was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language as well as Risk Factors and MD&A sections, which identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures. A replay of this call will be available shortly on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through November 9, 2023, and I will now turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey B. Guldner\n\nPresident-Arizona Public Service Company & Executive Vice President, Public Policy, Pinnacle West Ca, Pinnacle West Capital Corp.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Amanda, and thank you all for joining us today. We continue to execute well on our operations performance and financial management. As part of my operations update, I'll share with you our success in managing through a record-breaking summer in the valley and reliably serving our customers when they needed us the most. I'll also provide an update on our pending rate case and other regulatory filings. As Andrew will explain our earnings expectations for the year on track to meet our guidance range that we recently updated in the second quarter. First, I want to recognize our operation field teams for doing an exceptional job maintaining reliable service for our customers this summer. July was just one day short of an entire month of 110-plus degrees and August did not provide much repreve. We ended the summer with 55 days of 110-plus degrees and 36 days of overnight lows above 90 degrees. During this period, our generation fleet performed extremely well and was available when our customers critically needed the power. Our careful long-term planning for resource adequacy, combined with equipment maintenance programs and innovative customer demand side programs proved beneficial throughout the summer.\nAPS set 5 new peak demand records during the month of July, ultimately reaching 8,162 megawatts on July 15. That figures over 500 megawatts higher than our last peak demand that was set in August of 2020. Our baseload and fast-ramping assets, including Four Corners, [ Akatio ] and Palo Verde all performed well. Our nonnuclear generation fleet's equivalent availability factor, which is the percentage of time that a generation units available and ready to perform when called upon was 93.4% from June through September. In addition, we were extremely pleased to have our Agave solar facilities and our AZ Sun batteries online and available to serve customers. Finally, [ Palo Verde ] degenerating station's capacity factor for the same time frame was 99%. With the successful completion of the summer run, Palo Verde Unit 1 has entered its planned refueling outage on October 7. Not only were our generation plants there when we needed them, our customers were as well. Customers participating in APS' Cool rewards program helped create grid capacity while earning bill credits for voluntarily reducing their energy use.\nA community of more than 50,000 customers and about 80,000 smart thermostats created a virtual power plant to save energy during the peak hours of the summer. This year, participating customers conserved a record 135 megawatts of power, the equivalent of a peaking unit. APS' Cool Rewards is the cornerstone of our virtual power plant, which is rapidly approaching 200 megawatts in participation and will be an important part of our long-term resource planning strategy. We'll continue to expand this resource and these important partnerships with our customers as we continue our journey to 100% clean and carbon-free electricity by 2050. Long-term planning has been key to providing reliable service. In fact, we just filed our Integrated Resource Plan or IRP with the Arizona Corporation Commission yesterday, outlining our resource needs for the next 15 years. We're expecting strong customer and demand growth during this period and have outlined the resources necessary to maintain affordable and reliable service for our customers. We anticipate that a variety of resource types will be important in serving this period of robust customer growth and look forward to partnering with customers, developers and stakeholders on bringing these technologies online.\nWhile the IRP does not specify ownership, we are committed to continuing our competitive all-source RFP process, which will yield a blend of PPA and ownership projects. The IRP includes a variety of scenarios, but our preferred scenario identifies a diverse blend of technologies to secure a reliable grid while maintaining a strong focus on customer affordability. And this scenario also achieves our clean energy goals of 65% carbon free by 2030. With the extreme weather that we experienced each summer remains as important as ever to continue assisting our communities through our heat release support programs, ATS partners with local community organizations to aid the state's most vulnerable populations, this support includes a collaboration with the foundation for senior living, offering emergency repair replacement of AC systems during the hot summer months. The Salvation Army's network of 18 cooling and hydration stations across Arizona, an emergency shelter and homeless prevention program in partnership with St. Vincent de Paul and a new partnership with Salary 211 and Lyft to provide eligible Arizonans with free rides to cooling shelters.\nThese are just a few examples of our efforts to collaborate for the benefit of our customers and communities, and I'm pleased to share that APS was recently recognized with the innovative Corporate Philanthropy Award by the Phoenix Business Journal for these partnerships and programs aimed at providing heat relief to vulnerable individuals and customers. I'm also happy to share that we've completed our labor negotiations with our local IBEW and have a newly ratified agreement in effect. We worked hard to build a collaborative relationship with our labor union employees. And I'm grateful that we've been able to reach an agreement that allows us to continue to serve our customers and retain top talent. Finally, our customer care center was ranked as the top care center amongst our peers so far through the third quarter of this year, as rated by our customers in the J.D. Power electric customer satisfaction study. And overall, our customer satisfaction is rated by customers through J.D. Power remains strong. I'm extremely proud of our employees, our progress so far and look forward to closing out the year strong.\nTurning to our rate case. After 24 days of hearings, we wrapped up on October 3, and the parties are now in the briefing period initial briefs are due November 6 with replied breach due November 21. We expect the administrative law judge to issue her recommended opinion in order later this year, possibly early next year, with it being placed on an open meeting agenda shortly thereafter. We look forward to completing our rate case in a constructive manner while securing the cost recovery that's necessary to enable continued growth of our electric grid and to support Arizona's growing economy. As we look to wrap up 2023, our focus and priorities remain on executing our mission of providing clean, reliable and affordable service to our customers. I want to thank you all for your time today, and I'll turn it over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew D. Cooper\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Pinnacle West Capital Corporation\n\nThank you, Jeff, and thanks again to everyone for joining us. Earlier today, we released our third quarter 2023 financial results. I will review those results, which were positively impacted by weather, and provide additional detail on the various drivers for the quarter. We earned $3.50 per share this quarter, an increase of $0.62 compared to the third quarter last year. As Jeff mentioned, we experienced record-breaking summer heat. So weather was by far the large driver for the higher year-over-year results. In fact, the number of residential cooling degree days, which is a utilities measure of the effects of weather, increased more than 28% over the same period a year ago and were 32% higher than historical 10-year averages. Residential coin degree days for the month of July were the highest of any year since data tracking began in 1974, and August recorded the second highest coin degree days for the month behind only August of 2020. This resulted in a $0.38 benefit from weather versus third quarter last year, which itself was slightly warmer than normal.\nFavorable surcharge income through both our [ LFCR ] and the new surcharge related to the 2019 rate case appeal outcome, income tax items and other net were also positive drivers, partially offset by higher interest, higher depreciation and amortization, and lower pension and OPEB nonservice credits. Our income tax benefit is largely due to the timing of certain tax items being recognized through the effective tax rate. Q3 income taxes were also favorably impacted by the investment tax credit amortization from our Arizona sun battery facilities and production tax credits from our Agave solar facility. Turning to customer growth in the third quarter. It came in at 2%, which is right at the midpoint of our 1.5% to 2.5% guidance range. Arizona remains an attractive destination for population migration and for economic development. APS was honored in the September issue of Site Selection Magazine as one of the top utilities in economic development based on corporate end-user project investments and affiliated job creation. Our weather-normalized sales growth was flat in the third quarter compared to last year.\nFor the quarter, residential sales were down 1.9% on lower weather-normalized customer usage, but our strong C&I sales growth continued coming in at 2.2% for the quarter and is now at 2.8% through 3 quarters year-to-date. Due to the weaker weather normalized residential sales, we are adjusting our sales growth guidance for the year to 1% to 3% while keeping our long-term sales growth guidance at 4.5% to 6.5%. Turning to O&M. This quarter came in slightly lower than last year. However, we continue to see pressures in O&M, both from inflation as well as increases in costs incurred to serve the significant growth in our service territory. We continue to look for opportunities to reduce risk and find efficiencies that keep our costs low and maintain customer rate affordability. We raised our O&M guidance last quarter and are reaffirming it now while continuing to target O&M permit what hour declines over the long term. Interest expense remains a drag on earnings as the Federal Reserve continues to combat inflation through higher rates and they have signaled that higher rates will likely persist. This is expected to impact future debt financings and refinancings. With that said, I will note we only have a single fixed-rate maturity of $250 million in 2024 and we will continue to closely monitor our financing needs.\nRecently, our Board approved a 1.7% increase in our quarterly dividend. We are proud to continue our track record of steady dividend growth and are confident in our intention to grow back into our 65% to 75% dividend payout ratio target over the long term. Turning to CapEx. We have raised our guidance for 2023 from $1.67 billion to $1.8 billion. This increase is due to distribution investments needed to serve our growing service territory and generation investments to support the reliability of our fleet. This higher CapEx level also includes increases in transmission spend as we continue to make key investments in our FERC jurisdictional high-voltage system. We now expect 2023 transmission capital within our regulated footprint at a spend level nearly 50% higher than last year. Finally, I'd like to reiterate the impact weather had on our financial outlook for the year. Taking both the mild spring weather of the second quarter and extremely hot summer weather of the third quarter into consideration, we continue to guide to our $4.10 to $4.30 per share earnings guidance range for the year.\nWith our hearings concluded, we look forward to continuing to execute on our strategy as we await the issuance of the recommended opinion order and the final decision. This concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

[Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Amanda Ho. Ma'am, the floor is yours.\n\nAmanda Ho\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Matthew. I would like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and webcast to review our second quarter 2023 earnings, recent developments and operating performance. Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Guldner; and our CFO, Andrew Cooper. Ted Geisler, APS' President; and Jacob Tetlow, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Jose Asparza, Senior Vice President, Public Policy, are also here with us. First, I need to cover a few details with you. The slides that we will be using are available on our Investor Relations website along with our earnings release and related information. Today's comments and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and actual results may differ materially from expectations. Our second quarter 2023 Form 10-Q was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language as well as the risk factors and MD&A sections identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures. A replay of this call will be available shortly on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through August 10, 2023. We I will now turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey B. Guldner\n\nPresident-Arizona Public Service Company & Executive Vice President, Public Policy, Pinnacle West Ca, Pinnacle West Capital Corp.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Amanda. Thank you all for joining us today. Although our second quarter financials were negatively impacted by significantly mild weather in June, as well as higher operating expenses. We have updated our full year 2023 guidance to take into account the settlement that was reached between APS and the commission on the SCR matter. Before Andrew goes through the details of our second quarter results and updates to our 2023 full year guidance, I'll just provide a few updates on recent operational and regulatory developments. Starting with operations. As we progress through the summer season, I'm very proud to say that our team continues to excel in delivering reliable service to our customers. The [indiscernible] station successfully completed its planned refueling and maintenance outage for Unit 1 on May 13, and Additionally, we commissioned the remaining 60 megawatts of energy storage at our AZ Sun sites. So that totals now 201 megawatts of APS-owned storage installed this year and 150 megawatts of APS-owned solar at the agave solar facility.\nThese are all valuable resources to help serve our customers through the summer season. In fact, while the second quarter was marked by extremely mild weather, as I think all of you probably know, July certainly heated up. Our robust planning, resource procurement efforts and our dedicated team have allowed us to provide exceptional service to our customers throughout this unprecedented heat wave. Phoenix experienced a record number of consecutive days of over 110 degrees, shattering prior records for daytime highs for evening lows for days over 110 degrees, and the APS team served its customers with top-tier reliability throughout it all. In fact, we broke our previous peak demand record multiple times this July, reaching a new all-time record on July 20 at nearly 8,200 megawatts. That's a 500-megawatt increase compared to our prior record that was set in 2020.\nI want to recognize our operators and our field teams for doing such an exceptional job in making sure that customers continue to have reliable service through this unrelenting heat. As you know, APS plans years in advance to continue serving customers with reliable and affordable energy, our resource planners secure a diverse energy mix to meet demand like solar and wind power, battery energy storage and our APS, Operated Powder Generating Station, which is still the largest nuclear plant in the U.S. and the country's largest producer of clean energy. When temperatures caused demand to increase, APS' strength and resilience comes from using flexible resources like natural gas to keep homes and businesses cool over long stretches of extreme heat. Another important tool that I want to highlight and that we utilize is our Cool Rewards demand response program. It's in its fifth year of operation. That program essentially operates as a virtual power plant where our customers provide over 110 megawatts of flexible clean capacity. The program connects nearly 80,000 APS customers with smart thermostat technology. that helps them save money while also playing an integral role in conserving energy when the demand on the electric grid is its highest.\nThis partnership helps us to ensure reliable, uninterrupted service to our customers on the hottest Arizona days, while also assisting us on our journey to 100% clean in carbon-free electricity by 2050. So you can see we've taken all of the above approach to provide the most affordable and reliable service when our customers need us the most. And as part of our vigorous planning, we recently issued an all-source RFP for another 1,000 megawatts to be online between 2026 and 2028. We're seeking the best combination of resources to serve our customers reliably while not sacrificing affordability and continuing to build towards our clean energy future. Additionally, we continue to remain focused on providing exceptional customer service. Our J.D. Power JDP residential rankings for overall customer satisfaction have steadily improved over the past 2 years. And I'm proud to share that the latest JDP residential 2023 2nd quarter results have placed us back in the first quartile compared to our peers. APS is the strongest performing drivers in the latest survey where customer care, both phone and digital power quality and reliability and corporate citizenship.\nWe've made remarkable progress over the past few years moving from fourth quartile to first and that progress would not have happened without the dedication and commitment of our hard-working employees across the company. I look forward to continuing to provide exemplary service to our customers in the future. Turning to our regulatory updates. Last quarter, I spoke about the appeal of our last rate case and the favorable Court of Appeals decision. The commission directed its legal staff to enter into negotiations with the company. And in June, we reached an agreement with the commission legal staff on how to implement that decision. The joint resolution was then approved at the June open meeting, and it created a court resolution surcharge that started on July 1. We're pleased that we were able to reach an agreement with the commission in a reasonable and expeditious manner to resolve this issue. And as I've mentioned previously, the Four Corners Power Plant is a critically important reliability asset for the entire Southwest. And the investment in SCRs was required to keep that plant running under federal law. Andrew will address the financial impacts from this decision here in a few minutes.\nOn our rate case, we are almost done with all rounds of written testimony. Our rejoinder testimony is due tomorrow. The hearing is scheduled to begin on August 10. And we look forward to working through that process and resolving this rate case in a timely and constructive manner. We made solid progress through the first half of this year, improving our customer experience, enhancing our stakeholder relationships and executing on our regulatory matters. There's certainly more work to do, but I think this is a good opportunity to acknowledge the team's dedication and early accomplishments here in 2023. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew D. Cooper\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Pinnacle West Capital Corporation\n\nThank you, Jeff, and thanks again to everyone for joining us today. This morning, we released our second quarter 2023 financial results. I will first review those results, which were negatively impacted by extremely mild weather and provide some additional details on the various drivers for the quarter. I will also provide an update to full year 2023 guidance. We earned $0.94 per share this quarter, down $0.51 compared to the second quarter last year. Specifically during the month of June was the primary driver for the lower year-over-year results. June of 2023 was the mildest since 2009 with an average daily temperature slightly below 90 degrees. This resulted in a $0.25 year-over-year drag from weather compared to Q2 last year, which was -- which notably included an above-average contribution from June 2022's hot weather. Higher O&M interest expense and depreciation and amortization and lower pension and OPEB nonservice credits were other negative drivers, partially offset by higher transmission revenues and LFCR revenues. O&M was $0.21 higher year-over-year or $0.14, excluding res and DSM. We have experienced year-over-year increases to most of our O&M categories due to inflation and high customer growth.\nWe have seen inflationary impacts in areas, including chemicals, materials, insurance and wage rates. Of the $0.14 Q2 headwind, O&M associated with our generation fleet constitutes $0.10. And for the first half of the year, generation fleet O&M has been a 21 centric. Prioritizing the needs of our generation fleet to ensure reliability for customers has been essential to our summer preparedness strategy. The importance of this prioritization was as clear as ever as our team successfully ran our fleet during the month of July. In addition, as Jeff mentioned, July weather was record-breaking. And similar to past years, the weather benefits have allowed us to flex up to derisk future spending. Based on the OEM trends we are seeing, we are increasing our O&M guidance range for 2023 to $915 million to $935 million. Importantly, even with this update, we anticipate our O&M per megawatt hour to be flat to last year, and we maintain our goal of declining O&M per megawatt hour into the future. We continue to look for opportunities to create efficiencies, reduce risk and keep our costs low to maintain affordable rates for our customers. Turning now to customer growth. We continue to be in line with expectations. Customer growth remains at 2% for the second quarter.\nThe fundamentals for customer growth remains strong in our service territory, and Arizona continues to be a popular migration destination. Redfin.com noted in May that Phoenix Lebination in housing markets its users were most interested in moving into. The cost of living in Arizona and the Phoenix Metro area still compare favorably to many Western markets. So we continue to project steady population growth and corresponding APS customer growth largely driven by net migration. However, weather normalized sales growth for the quarter was 0.1% compared to last year. Although we continue to see steady C&I sales growth, which came in at 2.2% for the second quarter this year versus last year. Overall sales growth has been slower than originally anticipated. We continue to monitor our extra high load factor customers as they ramp up. And in fact, Taiwan Semiconductor recently announced a delay in the opening of their first chip factory. With the flat year-over-year sales growth in the quarter and slower ramp-up of these larger customers, we are revising our sales growth guidance range to 2% to 4% for 2023.\nBecause sales from these larger customers contribute a lower margin, the change to our sales growth guidance has a disproportionately smaller impact to earnings expectations. Over the longer term, we continue to forecast a strong contribution to sales growth from advanced manufacturing and other large customers though the variable remains the speed of their ramp-up. Turning to our 2023 guidance for EPS. With the approval by the commission of the joint resolution of the 2019 rate case appeal, on July 1, we began collecting a corresponding surcharge with an annualized impact of approximately $52.5 million.\nThis surcharge includes both a prospective and historical portion and is collected through a per kilowatt hour charge. Taking all financial drivers into account, including this additional revenue, July temperatures but normalized weather thereafter, anticipated lower sales growth and the higher O&M trends mentioned earlier, we now expect our new EPS guidance range to be $4.10 to $4.30 per share for the year. We look forward to continuing to execute on our strategy and on the next phases of our pending rate case process. This concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

Guldner\n\nPresident-Arizona Public Service Company & Executive Vice President, Public Policy, Pinnacle West Ca, Pinnacle West Capital Corp.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Amanda, and thank you all for joining us today. 2023 has started off in line with the financial guidance that we provided on the fourth quarter call in February. And before Andrew discusses the details of our first quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on recent operational and regulatory developments.\nFirst off, as you know, safety is our #1 priority, and I do want to take this opportunity to congratulate our employees for keeping safety in sharp focus in the first quarter, especially through an unseasonably long and challenging winter period. We discussed summer preparedness quite extensively, and that is our longest and highest peak demand season in Arizona. But winter preparedness is also an important part of how we reliably serve our customers throughout the year.\nWe have an extremely diverse and broad service territory, serving 11 out of 15 counties in Arizona. And so in addition to the desert regions that most people associate with the state, APS also serves communities at much higher altitudes. This year, northern Arizona saw one of the wettest winter seasons in recent history. In fact, Flagstaff set a record for the second highest snowfall total through March 1 in over 100 years. Despite slippery roads, hazardous conditions and freezing temperatures, our crews were able to restore power safely and quickly to our customers when they needed it the most.\nWith winter now officially behind us, we've quickly moved to preparing for the summer. While we always have had a robust summer preparedness program, resource adequacy continues to be extremely important as energy supplies in the southwest tighten. To serve our customers with top-tier reliability each year, we perform preventative maintenance, emergency operations center drills, acquire critical spare equipment, conduct fire mitigation line controls and execute a comprehensive plan to support public safety and first responders.\nAlso during the first quarter, our Palo Verde nuclear facility operated a 100% capacity factor. Unit 2 is currently in a planned refueling outage that began on April 8 and is on schedule to return to service in early May. Upon successful completion of the latest refueling outage, all 3 units are poised to provide around-the-clock clean energy to help meet the demands of the summer for the entire Desert Southwest. In addition, our resource planning process helps ensure long-term resource adequacy and progress towards our clean energy commitment. We do plan to file our 2023 integrated resource plan later this year. That will include a 15-year forecast of electricity demand and the resources needed to reliably serve our customers. We're currently engaging with a wide variety of stakeholders to gather input and feedback as we prepare that plan.\nI'm also extremely pleased to announce the completion of 141 megawatts of APS-owned batteries at our Arizona sun sites with an additional 60 megawatts that we expect to be completed by midyear. We also expect our 150-megawatt Agave solar plant to be in service in the next few months. We look forward to having these critical resources serve customers during the peak summer season. And we're also finalizing project selections from our 2022 all-source RFP, and we've recently signed 4 PPAs to be in service by 2024 and 2025.\nFinally, APS is actively working on another all-source RFP that's expected to be released midyear, and that will be for new resources to be in service by 2026 through 2028. Additionally, we reached an exciting milestone in our clean energy journey on March 26 when our highest hours served by clean percent metric peaked at 99%. And during that hour, we also reached 58% renewable energy. Our participation in the energy imbalance market and our continued effort in exploring an expanded Western energy market will be critical to maintaining customer reliability and affordability into the future.\nWe're also starting the year with solid J.D. Power Residential Customer Satisfaction Survey scores that firmly place APS within the second quartile for overall satisfaction when compared to its large investor-owned peers. We made gains in both power quality and reliability and corporate citizenship in the first quarter, and this was especially positive, given the challenging winter season that I spoke about earlier. We look forward to continuing to make improvements for our customers and providing a more frictionless customer experience.\nAnd then turning to regulatory. We continue to work through the rate case process. Expect that staff and intervenor direct testimony will be filed right now scheduled for May 22 for revenue requirement and June 5 for rate design. In addition, in March, we received a favorable decision from the Arizona Court of Appeals on our appeal of the last rate case decision. We are pleased that the Court of Appeals clarified the prudency standard that must be applied by the commission in their evaluation for recovery of investments that we make.\nThe Four Corners Power Plant is a critically important reliability asset for the entire Southwest region, and the investment in SCRs was required to keep that plant running under federal law. Right now, parties have until May 8 to file a petition for review to the Supreme Court. No one has filed that petition yet. And we look forward to working with the commission and other parties to resolve this in a matter -- in the most efficient way that we can.\nSo although 2023 is off to a solid start, we know we still have much work to do, and we look forward to continuing to execute on our priorities throughout the year. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew?\n\nAndrew D. Cooper\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Pinnacle West Capital Corporation\n\nThank you, Jeff, and thanks again to everyone for joining us today. This morning, we reported our first quarter 2023 financial results. I will review those results and provide additional details on weather impacts, sales and guidance. While lower than last year, 2023 has started off in line with our expectations. We lost $0.03 per share this quarter, $0.18 lower than first quarter 2022. Weather, along with sales and customer growth, were the primary benefits this quarter, offset by higher O&M, interest, depreciation as well as a smaller benefit from pension and OPEB.\nWeather provided an earnings benefit this quarter, primarily driven by the lengthy winter season Jeff mentioned earlier. According to the National Weather Service, the first 3 months of the year were the coolest start to a year in the Phoenix Metropolitan area since 1979, with March of 2023 being the coldest March in more than 30 years. The resulting impact was an increase in energy sales in the first quarter as residential heating degree days increased about 51% compared to the same time frame a year ago and were 57% higher than the historical 10-year average.\nTurning to customer and sales growth. We experienced 2% total retail customer growth in the first quarter, which is in line with our guidance range of 1.5% to 2.5%. Additionally, weather-normalized sales growth remained strong at 3.6% for the quarter and is also within our guidance range. The first quarter weather-normalized sales growth is comprised of 2.8% residential growth and 4.3% C&I growth. As previously discussed, our 2023 sales growth is driven by several large customers expanding and ramping up their usage. While our sales growth guidance remains unchanged for the year, we will continue to monitor the timing and usage of these large C&I customers coming online and adjust as necessary.\nMetro Phoenix continues to show strong growth in manufacturing employment [ of ] 4.8% compared to 2.6% for the entire U.S. In fact, the White House recently announced that Arizona has attracted over $58 billion of private investment for manufacturing since 2021. Additionally, we continue to project steady population growth, along with solid APS customer growth. According to recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau, Maricopa County had the largest population increase in the U.S. in 2022 and led the nation in net domestic migration.\nOn the expense side, O&M is a significant driver relative to the first quarter last year. This is primarily due to timing, with the prior year reflecting lower-than-normal first quarter O&M levels. Importantly, our O&M guidance range for the year remains unchanged. While we continue to experience the impacts of inflation, we have a strong company-wide focus on cost management and maintain our goal of declining O&M per megawatt-hour. Interest expense was higher versus first quarter last year due to higher interest rates on higher total debt balances, though we maintain a limited portfolio of floating rate debt and have no debt maturities until mid-2024.\nAdditionally, from a liquidity perspective, we were very pleased to successfully complete the upsizing and extension of our credit facilities out to 2028 in early April. As a quick reminder on pension, it is well funded with no expectation for contributions needed in the near term. We remain committed to the long-term benefits of our liability-driven investment strategy and the reduced volatility of a fixed income weighted portfolio. As we have previously stated, we are expecting a headwind in 2023, and we saw this in the first quarter with lower year-over-year nonservice credits partially offset by lower service cost, which is reflected in O&M expense. We will continue to evaluate options for regulatory recovery of higher benefit expenses.\nOur overall expectations for 2023 remain unchanged. And our guidance of 5% to 7% long-term earnings growth off the midpoint of weather-normalized 2022 guidance remains intact. Our capital plan includes the investments necessary to reliably serve a rapidly growing service territory, independent of any rate case outcome. And we continue to defer any potential equity issuance until resolution of the current rate case. We look forward to continuing to execute our plan though 2023 and to the resolution of the rate case.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

Guldner\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Pinnacle West Capital Corporation\n\nThanks, Amanda, and thank you all for joining us today. Good morning. In looking back on 2022, it was no doubt one of our most challenging years in recent memory as we faced major financial headwinds and a financial reset resulting from the outcome of our last rate case. I'm going to provide several updates today and share the successes we were able to achieve despite the challenges we faced.\nComing out of the last rate case, we laid out a comprehensive plan and strategy and we met or exceeded nearly every target we set for ourselves, including delivering strong service reliability to our customers. We made significant progress in the last year, but we're not done and we look forward to continuing to execute our plan.\nTurning now to regulatory. We came out of the last rate case fully committed to improving our regulatory relationships, and we've seen progress as a result of our focus in that area. We received constructive decisions for all key items heard by the previous bench during 2022, including our financing application last December. We started 2023 with 2 new commissioners and a new Chair, Commissioner Thompson and Commissioner Myers joined the bench in January and Commissioner O'Connor was elected Chairman.\nWe've already seen constructive actions and decisions by the new bench, including the creation of a docket to examine ways to reduce regulatory lag. We believe that these conversations are important, and we look forward to working with the commission on thoughtful solutions. For our pending rate case, the administrative law judge issued a procedural order in December, outlining the schedule. The first round of staff and intervenor testimony is due in May with the hearing set to commence in early August. We look forward to working with the parties and the commission through the rate case process and in gaining additional regulatory clarity.\nOur #1 goal continues to be doing what's right for the people and prosperity of Arizona, which includes working collaboratively with the commission and building a more constructive relationship. Turning to the operations side. I want to start by recognizing our field team's exceptional execution in 2022. I'm especially proud of our employees for prioritizing safety and ending the year with significantly lower employee injuries, 3 low-energy SIPs and our lowest number of OSHA recordable injuries on record.\nWe had one of the most hazardous and damaging summer storm seasons in recent history where we saw a record number of poles damaged. And for context, we replaced over 800 poles, which is about 500 more than an average summer. In addition, while parts of the Southwest region experienced capacity shortages again in 2022, our careful long-term planning and resource adequacy allowed us to serve our customers reliably. Additionally, we remain engaged in the western wholesale market, which allowed us to make off-system sales and to create savings for APS customers.\nImportantly, those off-system sales directly benefit APS customers by lowering our overall costs, while helping maintain regional grid stability. And finally, our generation units performed extremely well with our nonnuclear fleet, recording a summertime equivalent availability factor, EAF of 95%, and we achieved a capacity factor of 100.2% at the Palo Verde Generating Station.\nWe recognize the importance of creating customer value and remain focused on improving our customer experience. Our employees are committed to putting customers first and working towards our goal of achieving an industry-leading best-in-class customer experience. As a result of this commitment, we made extraordinary progress on that front in 2022 with APS earning ratings from its customers, making it among the most improved utilities in the nation for both residential and business customer satisfaction measured by J.D. Power. Compared to 2021, APS achieved quartile gains in every single driver of residential and business customer satisfaction firmly lifting the company into the second quartile nationally for residential customers and the first quartile nationally for business customers. Consequently, overall satisfaction is now well above industry benchmarks when compared to the company's large investor-owned peers.\nWe also continue to make progress on our resource procurement and clean energy commitment since announcing our goal to reach 100% clean carbon-free energy by 2050, 3 years ago. We've procured over 2,100 megawatts of clean and affordable energy resources. Additionally, as previously discussed, we issued an all-source RFP last year for another 1,000 to 1,500 megawatts of new resources to be in service from 2025 to 2027, and we continue to work through finalizing procurement decisions from that RFP. These substantial investments are essential resources designed to help us keep pace with Arizona's tremendous growth. At the same time, electricity capacity markets are tightening across the entire West.\nLooking forward, our goals for 2023 include continuously improving our customer communication and engagement, achieving a constructive outcome in our pending rate case, and reliably serving customers through the tremendous growth in our service territory. And I want to once again recognize the near-term headwinds that are created by the unfavorable outcome of our previous rate case and how it will continue to make 2023 challenging. However, we believe in our ability to provide long-term value to both customers and shareholders and we look forward to executing our plan and continuing our proven cost management efforts, all against the backdrop of Arizona's extraordinary economic expansion.\nSo I want to thank you for your time today. And I'm going to turn the call over to Andrew, who will talk about our fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings and our forward-looking financial expectations. Andrew?\n\nAndrew D. Cooper\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Pinnacle West Capital Corporation\n\nThank you, Jeff, and thanks again to everyone for joining us today. This morning, we reported our fourth quarter and full year financial results for 2022 and introduced guidance for 2023. I will cover our results and provide additional details around the financial outlook for 2023 and beyond. As Jeff discussed, we remain in our period of financial reset during the near term. But right up front, I want to make clear that while we are navigating through challenges brought on by the negative outcome of the last rate case, we have been executing well on our plan and we remain confident in our ability to create renewed growth and deliver strong shareholder returns.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2022, we lost $0.21 per share, down $0.45 compared to fourth quarter 2021. The unfavorable rate case decision and reduction in net income from no longer deferring the costs related to the Four Corners SCR and Ocotillo Modernization Project have been the primary driver of lower results all year, and that remained the case for the fourth quarter. The quarter also included a $17.1 million impairment charge relating to a Bright Canyon Energy equity investment. This was a legacy investment by Bright Canyon for a minority stake in a wind farm.\nIn the fourth quarter, we determined that impairment of the investment was appropriate due to ongoing disputes on transmission cost allocation and a lack of a probable favorable outcome. Other negative impacts included lower LFCR revenues, higher O&M and higher interest expense. Favorable weather and customer and sales growth were partial offsets to the negative drivers in the fourth quarter. For our full year results for 2022, we earned $4.26 per share, down from $5.47 per share in 2021. We ended the year in line with our updated full year guidance. As noted earlier, the negative rate case outcome drove a financial reset and is the primary driver for the lower year-over-year results. The Bright Canyon impairment charge, higher O&M and higher interest expense were other negative drivers for lower year-over-year results.\nFor the year, we saw beneficial weather as well as customer and sales growth that partially offset the negative drivers. Turning to customer growth. The fourth quarter remained in line with our guidance at 2.1%, which was also the customer growth rate for the full year. Arizona continues to be a popular destination for relocation and had the fifth highest population growth in 2022 according to recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau.\nArizona has continued to show strong employment growth, including emerging areas of economic diversification with manufacturing employment, for example, growing at 6.2% in 2022 as compared to a U.S. rate of 3.8%. We also continued to experience strong weather normalized sales growth. Sales increased 1.2% in the fourth quarter relative to the prior year. And for the full year 2022, our weather normalized sales growth was 2.4% in line with our upwardly revised guidance range. This was anchored by strong C&I growth of 4.6% over 2021 as the benefits of Arizona's increasingly diversified economy realized. In fact, Phoenix Metro was recently named a top 3 industrial market to watch in 2023 according to a JLL Tenant Demand Study that evaluated 60 U.S. markets.\nMoving on to our financial outlook. Our 2023 earnings guidance range is $3.95 to $4.15 per share. Although this is a decline from 2022 actual results, the range is comparable to our weather-normalized 2022 guidance range of $3.90 to $4.10 per share. We forecast steady customer growth and robust sales growth ahead in 2023. Headwinds for 2023 include higher benefit expense, interest expense and plant D&A. We continue to target declining O&M per megawatt hour and believe our proven track record of cost management and lean initiatives will help us successfully navigate through this inflationary period. We continue to have a strong focus on O&M and look for opportunities to create efficiencies, reduce risk and keep our costs low to maintain affordable rates for our customers.\nLooking at our forecasted customer growth. We expect it to remain strong and are maintaining a 1.5% to 2.5% guidance range for 2023. On sales growth, we expect continued strength, particularly in the C&I segment as economic diversification takes hold in areas such as semiconductor hubs, other large manufacturing and distribution. In fact, TSMC recently announced plans to build a second fab of the North Phoenix location increasing its original $12 billion investment to $40 billion. GSMC estimates the site will employ 4,500 permanent jobs, an increase from the earlier projection of 2000.\nIn addition, Procter & Gamble also announced plans for a $500 million investment in the manufacturing facility, creating 500 new jobs. Anchored by examples like these, we are expecting our weather-normalized sales growth range to be 3.5% to 5.5% for 2023. Turning to pension. As a reminder, our pension is 106% funded with no expectation for contributions needed in the near term. We remain committed to the long-term benefits of our liability-driven investment strategy and the reduced volatility of a fixed income weighted portfolio.\nNevertheless, we are expecting a headwind in 2023, primarily resulting from the net effect of higher discount rates. Higher benefit expense in 2023 is also impacted by negative 2022 investment returns and is partially offset by the impact of higher expense returns on assets in 2023. All in, we expect benefit expense to be a $0.33 headwind for 2023 as compared to 2022. However, we continue to evaluate options for regulatory recovery of higher benefit expense.\nTurning to interest expense. As the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates to try to combat inflation, we are closely monitoring our financing needs. I would highlight that we do not have any maturities until mid-2024, that we do expect higher interest expense year-over-year. We have also updated our capital plan to $5.3 billion from 2023 to 2025 with rate-based growth at an average annual growth rate of 5% to 7%.\nImportantly, the increase in CapEx is independent of any rate case outcome and is directly related to lower growth and the needed investments we are making in more resilient infrastructure. This update is needed simply to keep up with that growth and reliably serve customers. We have also updated our financing plan to meet the demands of our updated capital plan. We are continuing to defer any equity issuance into a resolution of the current rate case and remain focused on achieving a constructive regulatory outcome. The rest of our financial outlook remains consistent. Our outlook includes long-term earnings growth of 5% to 7% off the midpoint of our weather-normalized 2022 guidance range, we have a track record of dividend growth and the Board recently raised our quarterly dividend to $0.865 per share. While our current payout ratio is higher than our target, we believe our plan will allow us to achieve our long-term dividend payout ratio of 65% to 75% in the future, recognizing that all future dividends are subject to approval by our Board.\nWe have a path forward that is centered around our long-term track record of constructive rate case outcomes and robust service territory growth, continued balance sheet strength and cost discipline and a focused management team that is taking action. We look forward to building on the great work we were able to accomplish in 2022 and executing on this plan in 2023.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

(Operator Instructions). It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Amanda Ho. Ma'am, the floor is yours.\n\nAmanda Ho\n\nDirector of IR, Pinnacle West Capital Corporation\n\nThank you, Matt. I would like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and webcast to review our third quarter 2022 earnings, recent developments and operating performance. Our speakers today will be Chairman and CEO, Jeff Guldner; and our CFO, Andrew Cooper. Ted Geisler, APS President; and Jacob Tetlow, Executive Vice President, Operations, are also here with us.\nFirst, I need to cover a few details with you. The slides that we will be using are available on our Investor Relations website, along with our earnings release and related information.\nToday's comments and slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations, but actual results may differ materially from expectations. Our third quarter 2022 Form 10-Q was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language as well as the risk factors and MD&A sections, which identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures. A replay of this call will be available shortly on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through November 10, 2022. I will now turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey B. Guldner\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Pinnacle West Capital Corporation\n\nThank you, Amanda, and thank you all for joining us today. We continue to execute well on our operating performance and financial management. So as part of my operations update, I'll share with you our success in managing through one of the most challenging summer storm seasons that we've had in recent history. I'll also provide an overview of our rate case filing. And then Andrew will review our financial performance, including an update to our earnings expectations for the year due to higher sales growth and weather.\nFirstly, and very importantly, I want to recognize our field teams for doing an exceptional job, safely and quickly bringing customers back online after heavy storms swept through different parts of the state this summer. The extreme weather brought on damaging winds, heavy rains and flash flooding, which created a challenging environment where we saw a record number of poles damaged, and that's how we usually measure the intensity of a summer storm season. Typically, a storm season, we'll see an average of about 300 poles damaged. This year, we replaced over 800.\nMany teams across the company worked together to restore service from our supply chain teams, getting the necessary supplies, our field crews working day and night and our employees communicating with customers and making sure that they were kept apprised of the restoration efforts. Our careful long-term planning, resource adequacy, flexibility and innovative customer programs also proved beneficial through the summer. APS reached the third highest peak demand of 7,587 megawatts on July 11, and the temperature on that day was \"only\", and I put that in quotes \"only\" 115 degrees compared to our typical peak temperatures of 117 degrees or higher.\nGenerally, every degree is worth about 140 megawatts of peak demand. So had we seen 117 degrees, we would have easily set a new record for APS energy demand this year. In addition, in early September, a heat wave hit the Southwest and the region once again saw the lack of available capacity, resulting in 15 declarations of energy emergencies by other utilities across the West. During this period, we served our customers reliably and also helped our neighboring utilities by making off-system sales to the western wholesale market. Those off-system sales directly benefit APS customers by lowering our overall costs while helping to maintain regional grid stability.\nFor our own reliability, our baseload and fast-ramping assets, including Four Corners, Ocotillo and Palo Verde were ready when we needed them. Our nonnuclear generation fleet's equivalent availability factor, EAF, and that's the percentage of time that a generating unit is available and ready to perform when called upon, was 95% from June through September. Palo Verde generating stations capacity factor for the same time frame was 100.2%. Finally, with this completion of the summer run, Palo Verde 3 safely entered its planned refueling outage on October 8, and we're getting ready to complete that outage in the next few days.\nI'm also happy to share that APS continues to make quartile gains in every single driver of residential customer satisfaction, and that overall satisfaction is above industry benchmarks when compared to the company's large investor-owned peers. Continuing the progress that the company has been making over the last 2 years, APS' J.D. Power residential ranking through the third quarter firmly places the company into second quartile for residential customer satisfaction.\nOur strongest performing drivers through the first 3 quarters of 2022 were customer care, both phone and digital; power quality and reliability; corporate citizenship; and billing and payment. Additionally, APS's J.D. Power business customer midyear results puts the company in the first quartile nationally. APS continues to be one of the most improved utilities in the nation for both residential and business customer satisfaction. And we've committed to our customers, shareholders and our regulators that a top focus of improvement for our team will be improving the customer experience. That's been a cornerstone of my strategy as CEO, and I'm incredibly proud of our employees and proud of our progress so far and looking forward to closing out this year strong.\nTurning to a topic that's certainly top of mind to many of us, the Inflation Reduction Act. While we continue to evaluate the potential of the legislation as the regulations are being written, the tax benefits provide an opportunity to make Arizona a leader in clean investments. A few of the provisions that will benefit APS customers the most include the creation of an 8-year production tax credit for existing nuclear facilities, the inclusion of the EV and EV infrastructure tax credits, new credits for storage and hydrogen, a 10-plus year extension of the clean energy tax credits and a 3-year extension of the existing PTC and ITC.\nEach of these represents a big win for customers and for our industries. These incentives will help us to meet our clean energy commitment, and they will help us to enable the clean energy transition without compromising reliability and affordability. For a regulatory update, we filed a rate case on October 28, 2022. The key components of that filing include a requested 10.25% return on equity, a 1% return on a fair value increment, 51.93% equity layer and 12 months post test year plant. We've requested an increase in annual revenue of approximately $460 million, and we proposed that new rates go into effect on December 1, 2023.\nThis is an important rate case. It supports investments in our clean -- our energy infrastructure to ensure that all customers continue to receive the reliability that they count on and to increase resiliency under all weather conditions. We've made essential investments to maintain the health of the energy grid and to avoid outages. This rate case also helps to ensure that Arizonans have access to the energy they need when they need it as we make a reasonable and affordable transition to a clean energy future.\nWe're securing the energy needs of Arizona without compromising on affordability or reliability. We're balancing investments that optimize existing resources with investments in cost competitive clean energy generation that will power our state's future. Our filing contains proposals to further support our customers after a lot of work with stakeholders, we're proposing to enhance our limited income bill discount program to provide an additional discount for customers with the greatest need.\nAnd we're also proposing to eliminate in-network credit card and in-person kiosk payment fees for all customers. Programs and proposals like this demonstrate our commitment to improve customer satisfaction and make transacting with us more seamless and convenient. And lastly, we heard the commission's request for simplifying our adjustors. And in response, we proposed a number of modifications to our suite of adjustment mechanisms. Specifically, we propose reducing the number of adjustment mechanisms from 7 to 4 active adjustors with the elimination of the lost fixed cost recovery mechanism and the environmental improvement surcharge.\nWe also propose to modify our renewable energy surcharge mechanism to allow APS to invest in clean energy projects to support Arizona's growth while reducing the frequency of rate cases and smoothing out the financial impacts of the new projects. With this adjustment mechanism, tax credits from legislation like the IRA can reduce the overall cost of these investments, and we would be able to pass those savings to customers more quickly through an adjustor.\nFinally, we are not proposing any changes to our current power supply adjustor or transmission cost adjustor. As we look to wrap up 2022, our focus and priorities remain on improving our customer experience, continuing to engage with stakeholders to build alignment and executing on our mission of providing clean, reliable and affordable service to our customers. So I want to thank you all again for your time today, and I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew D. Cooper\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Pinnacle West Capital Corporation\n\nThank you, Jeff, and thanks again to everyone for joining us today. I will cover our third quarter results, including the impact from weather. I'll also provide additional details around our customer and sales growth, O&M as well as our expectations for the remainder of 2022. We earned $2.88 per share in the third quarter this year, down $0.12 compared to the third quarter last year but above our original expectation. As has been the case all year, the unfavorable rate case decision is the driver for lower year-over-year results, specifically the reduction to net income from no longer deferring the costs related to the Four Corners SCR and the Ocotillo modernization project.\nOther negative year-over-year impacts include lower LFCR revenues, higher O&M, higher depreciation and amortization and higher interest expense. Partial offsets this quarter to these negative drivers were lower income tax expense, continued customer and sales growth and weather. Weather was a significant benefit this quarter compared to last year. Third quarter 2021 was extremely mild, resulting in a large negative impact on margin. Third quarter this year was slightly warmer overall than normal and coupled with higher humidity, resulted in a $0.23 benefit to margins.\nOn customer growth, third quarter remained in line with our guidance at 2%. In addition, we have experienced strong weather-normalized sales growth all year. Third quarter saw an increase of 1.3%, driven by C&I sales growth of 4.9%, partially offset by a decline in residential usage. We are no longer experiencing increased usage impacts from COVID work-from-home trends. C&I sales growth in 2022 has largely been driven by strong sales among a diverse set of small C&I customers and from ongoing expansion of several large C&I customers.\nDue to the beneficial weather and strong sales and customer growth, we are updating our full year 2022 earnings guidance to $4.20 to $4.35 per share. I will note that without the weather benefit, we would have expected to be in line with our original guidance as our sales growth would have offset our increase in O&M, which I will talk about later.\nTurning to the economy here in Arizona. Maricopa County residential housing permits started the year off at a fast pace and are trending to finish 2022 at a level comparable to levels seen in 2020, 2021 despite macroeconomic risks. We continue to project steady population growth, largely driven by net migration, along with solid APS customer growth. Importantly, our growth is not solely reliant on residential housing or construction as the increase in business segments such as semiconductors, electric vehicle manufacturing and data centers provide increased diversity in our customer base. In fact, in October, Aligned Data Centers announced an expansion of an additional 2 million square feet over 2 sites.\nTurning to O&M. We continue to experience cost inflation, which is affecting all areas of the business. Our O&M levels are further impacted by the need to serve the significant growth in our service territory. As a result, we have experienced cost increases in categories, including chemicals, contract services, equipment and materials. We've been able to mitigate much of these cost increases through our customer affordability and lean efforts. In addition, similar to past years, the increased sales volumes and pension benefits have allowed us to flex up on spending to relieve some of those cost pressures and derisk future O&M spend.\nAs such, we are adjusting our O&M guidance for the year and expect our O&M to fall within the range of $880 million to $895 million. While our total O&M is increasing in the near term, we still expect our O&M per megawatt hour to decline over the long term. We remain focused on O&M, and we continue to look for opportunities to create efficiencies, reduce risk and keep our cost low to maintain affordable rates for our customers.\nFinally, I will briefly touch upon our liquidity and financial health. As the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates to try to combat inflation, we are closely monitoring our financing needs.\nWe continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and a well-funded pension. And I would highlight that APS does not have any long-term debt maturities until mid-2024 and limited floating rate debt. A couple of weeks ago, our Board approved a 1.8% increase in our quarterly dividend per share. We grew our dividend for 10 consecutive years and continue that trend this year. We continue to be confident in our plan and intend to grow back into our long-term dividend payout ratio target of 65% to 75% in the future.\nWe are grateful to be able to serve a state that continues to grow and thrive, and the weather tailwind this year will allow us to derisk our O&M expenses while enhancing the financial resources available (inaudible) records to provide (inaudible) reliability. As Jeff mentioned, we will continue to focus on our regulatory outcomes while executing our long-term plan to deliver value for our customers and for our shareholders. This concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

(Operator Instructions)\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Amanda Ho. Ma'am, the floor is yours.\n\nAmanda Ho\n\nDirector of IR, Pinnacle West Capital Corporation\n\nThank you, Matt. I would like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and webcast to review our first quarter 2022 earnings, recent developments and operating performance. Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Guldner; and our CFO, Ted Geisler. Barbara Lockwood, Senior Vice President, Public Policy; and Jacob Tetlow, Executive Vice President, Operations, are also here with us.\nFirst, I need to cover a few details with you. The slides that we will be using are available on our Investor Relations website, along with our earnings release and related information. Today's comments and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and actual results may differ materially from expectations. Our annual 2022 Form 10-Q was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language as well as the risk factors and MD&A sections, which identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures. A replay of this call will be available shortly on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through May 11, 2022.\nI will now turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey B. Guldner\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Pinnacle West Capital Corporation\n\nGreat. Thank you, Amanda. Thank you all for joining us today. 2022 started off in line with the financial guidance that we provided coming out of the rate case decision last year. And before Ted discusses the details of our first quarter results, let me provide a few updates on recent operational and regulatory developments, and then I'll touch on our progress towards achieving our 2022 goals.\nFirst off, as you know, safety is our #1 priority. And I do want to take this opportunity to commend and congratulate our employees for keeping safety and sharp focus in the first quarter. Significant injuries or fatalities or SIFs are the most important safety metric, and we completed the quarter with no serious injuries. SIF is a metric that's focused on preventing serious injuries by improving hazard recognition, risk-based decision-making, procedures, equipment selection, employee training and much more because we don't leave anything to chance when it comes to the safety of our people on the job. And I'm grateful to our employees for taking accountability to operate by one of our principles within the APS promise, that's anchoring and safety, and to help their coworkers to do the same.\nAs you all know, spring is an important time of year for our summer preparedness work. We have always had a robust summer preparedness program, but resource adequacy has become increasingly important as energy supplies in the southwest tighten. To serve our customers with top-tier reliability, each year, we perform preventative maintenance, emergency operations center drills, acquire critical spare equipment, conduct fire mitigation line patrols and execute a comprehensive plan to support public safety and first responders.\nIn fact, we've already started seeing the benefits of our preparation as we've had an early start to the Arizona wildfire season. Our system has fared well, and our defensible space around poles, what we call our DSAP program, is demonstrating great success while we continue to coordinate effectively with local first responder agencies to ensure that affected customers and communities have the support that they need.\nAlso during the first quarter, our Palo Verde nuclear facility operated at a 95% capacity factor. We've got Unit 1 currently in a planned refueling outage that began on April 8, and it's on schedule to return to service within the next few days. We expect our 2 refueling outages in 2022 to last approximately 30 days each, and that's a time frame that reflects sound planning and execution. And upon the successful completion of the latest refueling outages, all 3 units will be poised to provide around-the-clock energy to help meet the demands of the summer for the entire Desert Southwest.\nOur procurement process is another important way that we help to ensure long-term resource adequacy and progress towards our clean energy commitment. We're on track to bring into service 141 megawatts of battery storage located on 6 APS-owned solar sites this year. Last year, we received robust RFP responses to meet the growing needs of our customers. The RFPs resulted in an additional 60 megawatts of APS-owned batteries to be placed at APS solar sites and 150 megawatts of new APS-owned solar, all expected to be online in 2023 as well as additional clean energy resources through PPAs.\nWe're currently in the final stages of contracting for another APS-owned solar plus storage project that we look forward to announcing in the near future. And lastly, APS is working on another all-source RFP that's expected to be released in mid-May for new resources to be in service by 2024 and 2025.\nOn the regulatory front, we've been preparing for the upcoming rate case filing and continue to expect the filing midyear. The primary objectives of this next rate case will be to recover costs and investments that we've made to reliably serve our existing customers and to support the tremendous growth that we're seeing in our service territory. In addition, we continue to work with the Arizona Corporation Commission and many stakeholders in an effort to gain a common understanding on a variety of issues and to move forward with balanced solutions.\nOne example of the stakeholder work has been our most recent customer education and outreach plan, which was recently approved by the Corporation Commission after months of collaboration. I think this was a great example of the progress that we're making to align with stakeholders and the commission on issues that have been challenging in years past. We truly appreciate the individuals and organizations that have been involved in these discussions, and I want to personally thank them for their time and thoughtful participation. We look forward to continuing the dialogue and making further progress with respect to our state's regulatory environment.\nI've also already touched on the progress of some of our 2022 priorities, including enhancing our stakeholder relationships and continuing to execute on our clean energy commitment. In addition, I'd like to highlight improvements we're making in the customer experience and communication space. I'm proud to say that we're making solid progress in improving our J.D. Power Residential Customer Satisfaction Survey scores. APS made quartile gains in every single driver of customer satisfaction during Q1, moving the company to the top half of the third quartile for overall satisfaction when compared to its large investor-owned peers.\nAPS' strongest performing drivers in the latest JDP survey were power quality and reliability and customer care, and phone and digital, both of which performed well above the large investor-owned peer-set averages. Enhancements to our website, interactive outage map and alerts by text and e-mail have improved customer satisfaction with our digital experience and grown engagement with transactions completed through these tools.\nAlthough we're making solid progress, we know we still have much work to do, and we look forward to continuing to execute on our priorities throughout the year. With that, Ted, I'll turn the call over to you.\n\nTheodore N. Geisler\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Pinnacle West Capital Corporation\n\nThank you, Jeff, and thanks again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our first quarter 2022 financial results. I'll review the results and provide some additional details around the customer and sales growth.\n2022 started off in line with expectations despite being significantly lower than last year. In the first quarter of this year, we earned $0.15 per share compared to $0.32 per share in the first quarter last year. This is the first full quarter of financial impacts resulting from the last rate case. Although consistent with our guidance, the unfavorable rate case decision is the primary driver for the lower quarter-over-quarter results.\nThe largest contributing factor is the discontinuation of the Four Corners and Ocotillo accounting deferrals as those costs are now impacting the income statement without any new revenue to offset the costs. Other negative impacts include higher depreciation and amortization due to the increased plant additions, higher income taxes and lower pension and OPEB non-service credits. These negative impacts were partially offset by lower O&M expense, higher transmission revenues and the continued strong customer and sales growth. Our lower O&M this quarter is driven by continued cost management as well as timing of planned outage schedules.\nWe experienced 2.2% customer growth in the first quarter, which is in the upper end of our guidance range of 1.5% to 2.5%. Additionally, our weather-normalized sales growth remained strong at 4.4%, which is above our guidance range. The first quarter weather-normalized sales growth is comprised of 3.5% residential growth and 5.2% C&I growth. Although the sales growth is stronger than expected, we are not changing guidance at this time but we'll continue monitoring the usage trends and adjust as necessary.\nThe strong recovery of the Arizona labor market in 2021 is continuing into 2022. As a reminder, by July of last year, the Phoenix Metro area had recovered all jobs lost during the pandemic. And by the end of 2021, Arizona was one of only 3 states that have recovered all jobs lost during the pandemic. In March of this year, the Arizona unemployment rate fell to a historic low of 3.3% compared to the national average of 3.6%, which is the lowest state unemployment rate in nearly 50 years.\nArizona continues to benefit from high net migration into the state. Compared to the rest of the U.S., in 2021, Arizona was the third fastest-growing state, Phoenix was the second fastest-growing metro area, and Maricopa County was the fastest-growing county. As a result of this continued strong population growth, Maricopa County residential housing permits are off to another record start in 2022 and expected to have another robust year.\nWhile this growth is positive, it does not outweigh the negative impacts of the last rate case outcome. This growth underscores the need for substantial capital investment to keep up with the influx of customers in order to maintain grid reliability and resource adequacy and the need for reasonable and timely recovery of those investments.\nLastly, our focus and progress on cost management continues to produce results. As a recent example, our transmission and distribution teams began implementing mobile digital security stations at construction sites where multiple security guards have traditionally been used. Deployment of these stations is safer, more secure, more reliable than traditional security, plus the new practice has the additional benefit of reoccurring cost savings. This dedication to cost management is more important than ever as we are facing inflationary pressures across all areas of our business.\nWhile we expect our 2022 earnings results to remain in our guidance range of $3.90 to $4.10 per share, we are capturing the benefits of higher sales in the first quarter, along with our continued Lean Sigma initiatives to mitigate the inflation headwinds so we can finish the year strong. All other aspects of our financial outlook remain consistent with prior guidance.\nWe are confident that our laser focus on cost management, combined with the key initiatives Jeff highlighted for 2022 support our commitment to provide long-term value. We look forward to continuing to execute on our strategy and updating you on progress throughout the year.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

(Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Amanda Ho, Director of IR. Ma'am, the floor is yours.\n\nAmanda Ho\n\nThank you, Kate. I would like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and webcast to review our fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings, recent developments and operating performance. Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Guldner; and our CFO, Ted Geisler. Barbara Lockwood, Senior Vice President, Public Policy; and Jacob Tetlow, Executive Vice President, Operations are also here with us. First, I need to cover a few details with you. The slides that we will be using are available on our Investor Relations website, along with our earnings release and related information. Today's comments and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and actual results may differ materially from expectations. Our annual 2021 Form 10-K was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language as well as the risk factors and MD&A which identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures. A replay of this call will be available shortly on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through March 4, 2022.\nI will now turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey B. Guldner\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Pinnacle West Capital Corporation\n\nGreat. Thank you, Amanda, and thank you all for joining us today. And looking back on 2021, there are certainly a number of challenges and setbacks but also positive accomplishments and successes. Without question, the biggest setback of 2021 was the rate case outcome. Coming out of the rate case, we laid out a comprehensive plan on the third quarter earnings call, and we've already begun making progress towards that plan, and I'll briefly discuss that. I'll also provide an operations update and share some notable successes from our employees in 2021, and then Ted will discuss our 2021 earnings and our forward-looking financial expectations.\nI know we're all tired of talking about the last rate case and how disappointing that outcome was. As you know, the rate case decision makes everything that we're committed to doing more challenging and more costly for a time. Importantly, it's also cast our state at a negative light when it comes to our regulatory environment, and our efforts are focused on ways in which the company can support improving that regulatory environment. During our third quarter earnings call, we spoke of management actions that we planned on taking, which included the possibility of filing an appeal of the decision. That's not something that we took lightly, and I emphasize, I don't -- we don't take pleasure in litigating with the commission. Our #1 goal is doing what's right for the people and prosperity of Arizona, which includes working collaboratively with the commission and building a more constructive relationship.\nHowever, in this case, we really had no other choice. And in December, we filed a notice of appeal with the Arizona Court of Appeals in parallel with a special action with the Arizona Supreme Court. Although there were 7 other amicus brief. These are friend of the courts briefs filed in support of our special action filings, on February 8, the Supreme Court declined to take jurisdiction of the case. This was not particularly surprising since the Supreme Court only hears a small number of special action requests each year. And importantly, the Supreme Court's decision to decline jurisdiction does not impact our pending appeal with the Court of Appeals.\nWe don't know what the final resolution of that case will be. However, we look forward to the opportunity to share with the court, our arguments and the reasons why we believe the commission erred in its rate case decision. Turning to the operations side. Although 2021 was extremely challenging, it was not without successes. And I want to start by recognizing our field team's exceptional execution in 2021. We reliably served our over 1.3 million customers through the hottest June on record, followed by the third wettest monsoon season. Our non-nuclear fleet recorded an impressive reliability performance with a summertime equivalent availability factor or EAF of 94.4%. I just want to call out another data point on that nonnuclear fleet's performance. Out of [5,226] starts last year, there were only 9 misses and that start-up reliability is impressive, and it's important in our participation in the energy imbalance market and our actions in the broader market in the West and also benefits our customers.\nRecognizing that creating customer value is inextricably linked to increasing shareholder value, we remain focused on improving the customer experience. Although there's still much work to be done, we're not where we want to be yet, we're making positive progress. Thanks to the hard work of our employees, our fourth quarter J.D. Power overall residential customer satisfaction score jumped 1 quartile compared to the year prior among large investor-owned utilities in the U.S. We had year-over-year improvements in several key areas that are important to our customers, including power quality and reliability, billing and payment and customer call center performance. In fact, our customer ratings put us in the top decile nationally for perfect power and the second quartile nationally for our telephone customer care. APS was also named a 2021 Business Customer Champion by Escalent, which recognized the company as one of the top-performing electric utilities in the nation for business customer scores and brand trust, product experience, service satisfaction and customer effort.\nIn addition, we continue to make progress on the ESG front. On January 22, we celebrated 2 years since announcing our goal to reach 100% clean carbon-free energy by 2050. Over the past 2 years, we've procured nearly 1,400 megawatts of clean energy resources. These substantial investments are not only vital to our transition away from coal and into a clean energy future, but they're essential resources designed to help us keep pace with Arizona's tremendous growth at the same time that capacity markets are tightening across the entire West. And finally, I want to highlight 3 awards that we received in 2021 that recognize our commitment in the ESG space. First, APS was honored by the EPA with the Energy Star Partner of the Year Award for excellence in customer programs. Second, Pinnacle West was recognized by the global environmental nonprofit, CDP, for leadership in corporate sustainability with A- scores for both climate change and water security. That's significant because Pinnacle West is 1 of only 2 North American electric utility companies to achieve leadership scores in these areas.\nFinally, the 2021 Inclusive Workplace Award, a joint recognition from the Diversity Leadership Alliance and the Arizona Society Human Resources Management, acknowledging our efforts to create a diverse and inclusive environment for our employees. I'm extremely proud of the progress that our company continues to make and congratulate our employees on these important recognitions. As we look forward, our goals for 2022 include continuously improving our customer communication and engagement, enhancing our regulatory relationships and continued execution of our clean energy commitment. I want to once again recognize the near-term headwinds that were created by the unfavorable rate case outcome and how challenging it will make '22 but we believe in our ability to provide long-term value to both customers and shareholders. We look forward to executing our plan and continuing our proven cost management efforts, all against the backdrop of Arizona's incredible economic expansion.\nSo again, thank you all for joining us today, and I'll turn the call over to Ted.\n\nTheodore N. Geisler\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Pinnacle West Capital Corporation\n\nThank you, Jeff, and thanks again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our fourth quarter and full year financial results for 2021 and updated our outlook for 2022. As you can see, 2021 was better than anticipated, primarily due to stronger sales growth in the fourth quarter. While 2021 resulted in a solid year, this does not mitigate our outlook for 2022 and the reality that we remain in a financial reset as a result of the recent rate case outcome. Before I review the details of our full year 2021 results, I'll briefly discuss some key factors from the fourth quarter, which are shown on Slide 4.\nOur performance was strong in the fourth quarter as we earned $0.24 per share compared to a loss of $0.17 per share in the fourth quarter of 2020. Keep in mind, we had 2 unique items in 2020 that did not repeat last year. Our settlement with the Arizona Attorney General's office and the company-funded portion of the Coal Community Transition payment, both were booked in the fourth quarter of 2020, resulting in a year-over-year benefit. Mild weather was a factor again this quarter but was largely offset by higher sales and usage, which came in well above prior expectations, largely due to strong residential growth and the continued expansion of our commercial customer segment.\nTurning now to our full year results for 2021. We earned $5.47 per share compared to $4.87 per share in 2020. Looking at Slide 5, I'll review some key factors of these results. In gross margin, weather was unfavorable by $0.76 compared to the prior period. As you may recall, 2020 had the hottest summer on record, whereas weather in 2021 was slightly below normal. Continued strong sales and usage was a $0.51 benefit. The 2021 guidance established on our third quarter call assumed weather-normalized sales growth of 3.5%. However, we experienced a much stronger fourth quarter than anticipated with weather-normalized sales growth of 6.7%, resulting in full year weather-normalized sales growth of 4.2%. Our year-over-year retail customer growth ended strong at 2.2%. For 2021, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 4% compared to a national average of 2.8%.\nIn November, Arizona also achieved an important milestone Employment recovered to prepandemic levels, a milestone reached by only 3 other states. In addition, Arizona was once again the third fastest-growing state in the U.S. last year. As a result of this robust population growth, Maricopa County residential housing permits had their strongest year since 2005, finishing with just over 43,000 permits. We are investing heavily to support this level of growth, which is beneficial to our customers and the entire state. However, we must be able to receive constructive, regulatory recovery in a timely manner to continue to support this level of growth.\nNow turning to our 2022 outlook. As we shared last quarter, we reset our financial targets as an outcome from the recent rate case decision. The majority of what we shared last quarter has not materially changed, but I will discuss a few updates which result in a slight increase to our 2022 guidance range, now projected to be $3.90 to $4.10 per share.\nWe have updated Slide 6 to illustrate 2021 full year results of $5.47 per share compared to the midpoint of our new 2022 guidance range. In addition to increased sales, we plan to continue our track record of disciplined cost management to reduce O&M in 2022. However, we are not immune to inflationary pressures and recognize this will be more challenging than in years past. As you can see, we are still targeting a meaningful reduction in costs compared to 2021 as we remain laser focused on cost management through our Lean Sigma initiatives.\nJust as we shared in the third quarter, we continue to anticipate strong customer and sales growth in the range of 1.5% to 2.5% for 2022, while the total range has not changed given the stronger growth in the fourth quarter we have revised our residential growth projections higher, which is partially offset by slower growth in our commercial and industrial segments due to expansion delays. Sales growth through 2024 remains the same as we guided last quarter, 3.5% to 4.5%, and we remain confident in the long-term developments in our service territory.\nFinally, we've also updated our interest expense net of AFUDC to reflect higher interest rates and updated timing of debt issuances. The remaining aspects of our financial outlook remain consistent with our guidance provided last quarter, and we are committed to executing our plan through this reset period. We continue to benefit from a solid balance sheet despite recent downgrades by all 3 rating agencies after the rate case decision. That said, we do remain on negative outlooks as they closely monitor the Arizona regulatory environment. We look forward to showing progress in each area of our strategy, and we'll continue to provide updates as we move through the year. Meanwhile, we're focused on building an exceptional experience for our existing customers rapidly expanding the grid for our incoming customers and delivering long-term value for our shareholders.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

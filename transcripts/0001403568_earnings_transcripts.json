Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for a discussion of Ulta Beauty's results for the third quarter of fiscal 2025. Hosting our call today are Kecia Steelman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Chris Lialios, Interim Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, today's earnings release and the comments made by management during this call include forward-looking statements.

The company undertakes no obligation to revise any forward-looking statements. And as always, the IR team will be available for any follow-up questions after the call. Now I'll turn the call over to Kecia. Kecia?\n\nKecia Steelman\n\nPresident and CEO, Ulta Beauty\n\nThank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. The Ulta Beauty team delivered another quarter that exceeded our expectations. For Q3, net sales increased 12.9% to $2.9 billion. Operating profit was 10.8% of sales, and diluted EPS was $5.14 per share. These results highlight the expanding relevance of the Ulta Beauty brand for our guest, the favorable impact of investments that we're making to support our long-term strategy, and the continued commitment of our teams. Today, I'll take a few minutes to outline the key drivers that fueled our outperformance, update you on our progress against the Ulta Beauty Unleashed strategy, and discuss our outlook for the upcoming holiday.\nAs I reflect over the past 11 months in my role as CEO, I'm incredibly proud of the steps our teams have taken to accelerate our top-line growth and increase our market share, and how these actions continue to resonate with our guest and drive our results. The third quarter highlights are a clear result of these actions and include comparable sales growth of 6.3%, positive comps across all categories and channels, with notable double-digit strength in our e-commerce results, continued market share gains in mass and prestige beauty, including prestige market share gains in both brick-and-mortar and digital channels, loyalty member growth of 4% year-over-year to a record 46.3 million members, and ongoing improvement across several key performance indicators, including brand engagement, earned media value, and app engagement. The investments to support our Ulta Beauty Unleashed strategy are fueling our strong top-line results.\nAt the same time, we know we have opportunities to tighten SG&A spends and to optimize resources to drive long-term profitable growth, which will be a key area of focus as we turn to fiscal 2026. Before I dive into the drivers of our performance, let me touch on the beauty landscape more broadly. Despite a softening in overall consumer confidence in Q3, beauty engagement remained healthy. During the third quarter, both mass and prestige beauty markets delivered mid-single-digit growth, according to Circana. Turning now to the key drivers of our performance, which center around our three strategic priorities: strengthening our core US business, scaling new businesses, including expanding internationally to capitalize on key growth opportunities, and realigning our foundation for the future by streamlining our cost structure, optimizing our ways of working, and re-energizing our culture. Let me begin with our actions to strengthen our core US.\nbusiness, which continues to power our overall results. We have been focused on the fundamentals and elevating our go-to-market approach through operational excellence, marketing leadership, and compelling merchandising innovation. Our enhanced go-to-market collaboration between our merchandising, marketing, and store teams has been a key unlock to improving our performance, and we're leveraging this new approach to accelerate our brand-building, digital, and personalization efforts. In stores, our team's dedication to disciplined execution continues to underpin our performance. Stores are elevating and energizing the guest experience with improved in-stocks, well-staffed stores, friendly service, and engaging events, all translating into improving guest satisfaction results for the quarter. We drove solid in-store traffic and sales growth with successful execution of key moments and events, including Back to School, 21 Days of Beauty, and Fall Haul. In addition, we hosted nearly 33,000 in-store events across our fleet during the quarter.\nThese unique activations included celebrity appearances, brand launches, brand education, and highlighted our differentiated in-store experience, which truly makes Ulta Beauty an unmatched beauty destination for our guest. From a category perspective, all major categories exceeded our expectations and delivered positive comp growth against the third quarter last year. Fragrance sustained its position as our strongest growing category, delivering double-digit comp sales growth in Q3. Newness from luxury brands like Valentino and Dolce & Gabbana, alongside compelling new-to-market brand launches from Miu Miu, prestige, and Squishmallows in mass resonated with the guest. This quarter demonstrated the power of our unique low-to-luxury brand assortment. In October, we also rolled out incremental shelf space for fragrance in more than 60% of our US stores, which we believe positions us to capture holiday demand and beyond for this important and growing category.\nSkincare, our second-fastest growing category, delivered solid high-single-digit comp growth driven primarily by the strength of prestige Skincare and solid growth of mass skincare. Our unmatched K-beauty assortment continues to resonate and drive skincare sales. In addition, prestige Skincare also benefited from the highly successful launch of Fenty Skin Body, exclusive to Ulta Beauty, and strengths in brands like Tatcha and Dermalogica. Mass skincare benefited from newness and social media virality in key brands like Byoma and Starface. In addition, our newly expanded wellness assortment also contributed positively to skincare performance. Makeup delivered another quarter of mid-single-digit comparable sales growth, supported by growth in both mass and prestige makeup. Mass makeup growth was driven by compelling newness from brands like NYX, Morphe, and L'Oréal, as well as the benefit from market-wide price increases from select brands.\nprestige makeup growth in the quarter was supported by a highly successful 21 Days of Beauty event, with notable brand standouts being Estée Lauder and MAC within the event. Across the quarter, we also delivered strong growth across a number of our prestige brands, including Hourglass and NARS, and in our Only at Ulta brand portfolio with newness and DIBS. Our new K-beauty assortment in makeup is also driving strong growth. The hair care category delivered mid-single-digit comps, fueled primarily by strong performance in prestige hair. Mass hair, hair color, and accessories also contributed positively. This growth was partially offset by sales declines in personal styling tools, which continues to navigate pressures from tariff-related price increases. From a brand perspective, major new prestige launches from Moroccanoil and Nutrafol, along with guest favorites Redken and Matrix, resonated with guests and delivered strong growth.\nOur exclusive brand Cécred continued to drive guests into the hair care category and performed ahead of expectations. Finally, services delivered mid-single-digit comp growth in Q3, driven by strength in cut-and-color services, expanded brow services, and ongoing improvement in stylist productivity. During the quarter, we began offering Benefit brow services in our salon, expanding capacity and convenience for our guests. Execution of our salon workshop strategy featuring events like Back to School Blowout drove sales and member trial. Moving to our long-term strategy to enhance our assortment and brand-building capabilities. Overall, we are intensely focused on strengthening and modernizing our full low-to-luxury assortment, and during the quarter, we launched more than 35 new brands, many of which were exclusive. Our new brands are thoughtfully selected to drive incrementality and complement our balanced portfolio of the best brands across all categories, all life stages, and all price points.\nStrengthening our brand-building capability is key to the strategy, and we are focused on leveraging our unique advantages to be the retail partner of choice to launch, build, scale, and globalize brands. Our enhanced focus and capabilities are already delivering, with Beyoncé's hair care line Cécred, only available at Ulta, being a great example of how we can uniquely unlock the power of 46 million loyalty members to launch and scale a new retail-to-brand successfully in just a few months. Based on its first six months of performance, Cécred is the most successful prestige hair care launch in Ulta Beauty's history. Our K-beauty assortment is another example of our holistic brand-building strategy. With an already established stronghold in K-beauty skincare, with long-standing exclusive brands like Peach & Lily, we saw space for growing K-beauty trends in both skincare and makeup.\nWe moved with agility to build a complementary and largely exclusive pipeline, including a portfolio of new and many exclusive brands throughout 2025, like Anua, Medicube, TIRTIR, fwee, and Unleashia. We have leveraged all of the Ulta Beauty go-to-market levers to drive excitement and awareness of these new brands, attracting the next generation of beauty guests. Our core assortment is now being complemented with the recent launch of UB Marketplace, which I will give you more details on in a moment. Shifting to marketing, we are elevating our marketing efforts to spark excitement and awareness, drive engagement, and attract and retain loyalty members. During the third quarter, we debuted our new brand equity campaign, \"Beauty Happens Here,\" on social and across traditional and connected TV.\nThe new campaign aims to inspire and reinforce that Ulta Beauty is where beauty lives and is the destination for all ages and all life stages. The campaign is already driving significant awareness gains broadly and with key cohorts and is also driving strong brand health gains. In addition, we continue to leverage our integrated marketing efforts to support key events and strategies, including high-impact merchandising campaigns like 21 Days of Beauty and Fall Haul, designed to drive engagement and conversion against priority categories. Our exclusive only at Ulta brand launches and category plans, reinforcing our leadership in a differentiated way, and culturally relevant activations like hosting Ulta Beauty's first-ever multi-market experiential activation, the College Glow Up Tour, in collaboration with Her Campus. The tour delivered product sampling and education for various exclusive brands like Polite Society, Isamaya, and Snif.\nMoving to our digital platforms, our investments to accelerate digital engagement and personalization are delivering results, and we continue to add capabilities that drive app engagement, enhance the guest shopping experience, and remove friction. From new features like Replenish & Save and Wishlist to new payment choices like Venmo, to doubling ship from store locations to more than 1,000 stores, we are steadily improving the guest experience and fueling our momentum. Our app engagement continues to grow and accounted for 65% of our online member sales in Q3, up from 63% in Q2. In addition, strong buy online, pick up in store and store contribution highlights how guests value the powerful combination of our digital shop experience and the convenience of our stores. Next, turning to our second strategic priority, scale new businesses to capitalize on key growth opportunities and ensure that we remain relevant in a rapidly changing world.\nOur international expansion efforts are building momentum, and we are steadily growing our international presence. During the third quarter, we opened seven stores in Mexico through our joint venture partnership with Grupo Axo. I had the privilege of attending the unforgettable grand opening of our first store in Mexico City. The energy was palpable, and we had many key brand founders on site, including Isamaya, founder, and Grammy-winning musician Shakira, to celebrate this important milestone for our business. In addition, the first Ulta Beauty store opened in the Middle East in Kuwait last month through our franchise partnership with Alshaya Group. Similar to Mexico, the guest response to our arrival in the Middle East has been very positive, and our grand opening celebration, which featured Orebella founder Bella Hadid, was an exciting way to introduce Ulta Beauty to this new market.\nWe are excited about the uniquely Ulta Beauty experiences and curated assortments that we are bringing to these markets, which feature a mix of local brand favorites, exciting new-to-market brands, and only at Ulta exclusives. We are encouraged by the strong positive guest responses that we're seeing and excited to expand our presence over time. Finally, in the UK, Space NK continues to perform well, and our teams are making important progress in integrating Space NK with the rest of our business. I had the pleasure of spending time visiting stores in the UK with the incredibly talented Space NK leadership team during the quarter. I remain excited about the opportunity to transfer learnings across markets to elevate our business globally and capture even greater growth opportunities in the future.\nTurning to Marketplace, we reached a key milestone with the successful launch of UB Marketplace in the third quarter. Through our Marketplace initiative, we are expanding our assortment for our guests, offering a broader and complementary array of beauty, wellness, and lifestyle products from both established and emerging brands on ulta.com, with minimal inventory risk to our business. We launched the platform in late Q3, curating the addition of more than 120 brands and over 3,500 SKUs to our online assortment. We are pleased with the initial performance and optimistic about how this new capability can help us strengthen our existing category authority, attract new guests, and capitalize on incremental growth opportunities in new subcategories like luxury, professional, and wellness. In wellness, we're focused on leveraging our position as a trusted guide to expand more meaningfully into the vast and growing wellness category.\nWe believe we are uniquely positioned to meet guests' wellness needs in approachable, welcoming ways that celebrate a guest's individual journey. In the third quarter, we continued to add new brands to our assortment, like Therabody, Bird&Be, and Hatch sleep products, and continued our in-store expansion efforts with the introduction of elevated fixtures in about 50 stores. These investments will enable us to learn more about guest engagement and help us tailor the assortment as we continue to build upon our approach to maximize this key growth initiative. Turning to our third strategic priority, realigning our foundation for the future. During the third quarter, our supply chain and IT team successfully completed the retrofit of our Dallas distribution center, introducing advanced automation and robotics, an upgraded warehouse management system, and a new warehouse execution system. We incorporated key learnings from prior retrofits and executed this upgrade flawlessly.\nWe expect these upgrades to strengthen our foundation, further enhancing inventory flow and increasing capacity. As I've shared previously, one of my top priorities has to make sure that I have the right leadership team in place to drive our future growth, and I couldn't be more pleased than to welcome Chris DelOrefice to Ulta Beauty as he assumes the role of Chief Financial Officer tomorrow. He joins us from Becton Dickinson, where he serves as CFO for the last four years and brings more than 30 years of diverse corporate finance experience. I want to express my gratitude to Chris Lialios, our interim CFO, for his partnership and leadership during this important time of our business, and thankfully, he's not going anywhere. He will continue his role as SVP and Corporate Controller and help ensure that we have a smooth transition.\nIn addition to shaping our leadership team, I've been keenly focused on re-energizing our culture. Over the past several months, I've had the opportunity to spend time across our broader organization, from store visits in key regions to walking the floor of our distribution centers and engaging with our international teams and partners. I've been truly inspired by the energy, pride, and purpose that our teams bring to their work. These visits strengthen my belief that our success is built on people, their commitment to our values, their relentless focus on the customer, and their ability to adapt.\nFinally, to our plans and expectations for the upcoming holiday, our teams have been hard at work to ensure that we're well-positioned to deliver a strong 2025 holiday season, hiring and onboarding seasonal associates, developing compelling holiday assortments and merchandising strategies, creating bold celebrity glam-filled marketing plans, all offered in festive, fun, and easy-to-shop stores and digital channels, and our supply chain is ready to deliver with speed. The holiday season is in full flight, and we're pleased with our Black Friday and Cyber Monday performance. At the same time, we know the biggest selling weeks are still ahead of us, and we're mindful of the challenging macro backdrop. Our insights suggest beauty consumers' budgets are tight, and they are focused on value. Despite this, beauty enthusiasts tell us that they intend to spend on beauty for seasonal needs, affordable splurges, and gifts for loved ones.\nThey are focused on replenishing their essentials and strategically making smart purchases around strong value, holiday limited editions and deals, and early gift set drops. We will leverage these key insights to ensure that we're staying relevant and delivering for our guests during this important holiday season. We are confident in our plans and the improvements that we've made, and our teams are ready to go make holiday happen here at Ulta Beauty, driving excitement and delivering for our guests and their loved ones. I want to close by expressing my gratitude to our teams and partners across the globe. Their efforts are driving meaningful progress and positioning us well for the long-term value creation. With that, I'll turn it over to Chris to cover the financial results for the Q3 and our update financial outlook before we take your questions. Chris?\n\nChris Lialios\n\nInterim CFO, Ultra Beauty\n\nThanks, Kecia, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin with a discussion of our consolidated third quarter results and then share our expectations for the fourth quarter and full year. As a reminder, our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 include financial results for Space NK, which was acquired in July and is not material to our consolidated financial statements. The Ulta Beauty team delivered strong performance again this quarter, reflecting better-than-expected growth from comparable sales, favorable shrink results, and stronger merchandise margin. Consolidated net sales for the quarter increased 12.9% to $2.9 billion compared to $2.5 billion last year. During the quarter, we opened 28 new Ulta Beauty stores, remodeled 15 stores, and closed one store. We also opened two new Space NK stores, relocated one store, and closed one store. We ended the period with 1,500 Ulta Beauty stores and 84 Space NK stores.\nComparable sales increased 6.3%, driven by a 3.8% increase in average ticket and a 2.4% increase in transactions. Other revenue increased approximately $8 million versus the third quarter last year. Looking at the cadence of comp sales through the quarter, growth was fairly consistent across all periods. From a channel perspective, both store and digital channels contributed to comp growth, with e-commerce sales increasing in the mid-teen range and comp stores delivering mid-single-digit growth. Consolidated gross margin for the quarter increased 70 basis points to 40.4% of sales compared to 39.7% last year. The increase was primarily due to lower inventory shrink and higher merchandise margin, which was partially offset by adverse channel mix, reflecting strong growth from our digital platforms. Our team's focus on reducing inventory shrink while also delivering great guest experiences continues to produce meaningful results.\nOur investments in fixtures and process improvements, as well as focused associate training and store-specific action plans, have delivered shrink reductions across every category and almost every region. Merchandise margin increased this quarter primarily due to the timing of market-wide price actions from select brands and more effective promotion strategies. These benefits were partially offset by unfavorable category mix. While many of our brand partners continued to be cautious about passing through tariff-related price changes, we saw more brand-driven price increases in Q3 as compared to Q2. Reflecting on our average cost inventory valuation methodology, we often see a short-term benefit to cost of goods as we move through the lower-cost inventory after the retail price changes executed. Merchandise margin in the quarter also benefited from greater promotional effectiveness. We delivered strong performance from key events, including 21 Days of Beauty and Fall Haul, and eliminated unproductive offers.\nAs a result, the impact to merchandise margin from promotional activity was lower than last year. Moving to expenses, consolidated SG&A increased 23.3% to $841 million. SG&A growth was elevated this quarter, primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation, the impact of Space NK, and the timing of investments we're making to support our Ulta Beauty unleashed strategy. Excluding the impact of incentive compensation and Space NK, SG&A growth for the quarter was about 14%. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased 240 basis points to 29.4% compared to 27% last year, largely due to higher incentive compensation reflecting our better-than-planned performance, as well as the lapping of a benefit from lower incentive compensation in the third quarter last year. Higher store payroll and benefit expense, store expenses, and amortization of cloud-based software investments also deleveraged as a percent of sales.\nStore payroll and benefit expenses increased primarily due to additional selling hours to support the guest experience and higher healthcare costs. The deleverage of store expenses largely reflects higher supplies to support key merchandising initiatives and inflationary pressures. The growth of cloud investment amortization reflects the impact of technology investments we are making to support our long-term growth. Over the last several years, we've upgraded key elements of our technology infrastructure, including our ERP system, digital store platform, POS systems, data infrastructure, and critical supply chain systems. With this foundation in place, this year, we've invested in new go-to-market capabilities, including marketplace, personalization, and other digital enhancements to support the guest and associate experience. Many of these investments are cloud-based arrangements, and as we launch and operationalize these capabilities, we are experiencing higher operating expense.\nWhile these investments are driving near-term expense pressure, we expect they will support long-term revenue and market share growth. Operating profit was $309 million compared to $319 million last year. As a percent of sales, operating margin was 10.8% of sales compared to 12.6% last year. Wrapping up the P&L, diluted earnings per share was $5.14 per share, or flat to last year. Moving to highlights from the balance sheet and cash flow statement, we ended the quarter with $205 million in cash and cash equivalents and $552 million in short-term debt. Similar to the third quarter in past years, we leveraged our revolving credit facility during the quarter to support working capital needs and ongoing capital allocation priorities, including share repurchases and capital expenditures. As a reminder, we funded the Space NK acquisition in Q2 with cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facility.\nTotal inventory increased 16% to $2.7 billion compared to $2.4 billion last year, primarily reflecting additional inventory to support new brand launches, Space NK, and the impact of 63 net new Ulta Beauty stores. Capital expenditures were $87 million for the quarter, mostly driven by investments in new and existing stores and IT systems. Depreciation increased 13% to $76 million compared to $67 million last year, largely reflecting store investments. In the quarter, we repurchased 427,000 shares, bringing the year-to-date total for our share buyback program to 1.7 million shares for $693 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $2 billion remaining under our current $3 billion repurchase authorization. Turning now to our updated outlook for the year, we have increased our fiscal 2025 guidance to reflect our third-quarter results as well as our updated expectations for the fourth quarter.\nFor the year, we now expect net sales will be approximately $12.3 billion, with comp sales growth between 4.4% and 4.7%. We now expect operating margin will be between 12.3% and 12.4% of net sales, with the deleverage driven primarily by SG&A. We expect gross margin will be roughly flat for the year. Reflecting these assumptions, we expect diluted EPS for the year will be between $25.20 and $25.50. With one quarter left in the year, I want to share how we are thinking about Q4. We have increased our outlook for revenue growth, but believe it is prudent to continue to take a cautious view of consumer spending this holiday season, given the dynamic macroeconomic and operating environment. Reflecting our performance through Cyber Monday, we now expect Q4 comps growth will be between 2.5% and 3.5%.\nFor Q4 modeling purposes, we expect operating margin will be between 12% and 12.3%, driven by gross margin and SG&A deleverage, and we expect EPS for the quarter will be between $7.61 and 7.90. Now I'll turn the call over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now begin Q&A. To join the queue to ask a question, please press star five on your telephone keypad. Again, that's star five on your telephone to ask a question. Please limit to one question before jumping back in the queue. Thank you. We will now pause a moment to assemble the queue. Our first question will come from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nLorraine Hutchinson\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you. Good afternoon. Can you talk about what you're hearing from brands about pricing? The 3.8% ticket comp was very impressive. Do you think this might build in the coming quarters?\n\nKecia Steelman\n\nPresident and CEO, Ulta Beauty\n\nHi, Lorraine. Thanks for the question. I would say that we generally have pricing increases quarter-to-quarter as brands come through. There were plenty of publicly traded companies that announced that they were taking price increases: e.l.f., Coty, and Helen, and Victoria, just to name a few, that we were seeing some price increases with this quarter. Chris, maybe I'll let you give a little bit more color around what the pricing increases look like for the quarter, but pricing increases are not new in this part of the business, and I don't think that we saw anything that was extraordinary by any means. Chris?\n\nChris Lialios\n\nInterim CFO, Ultra Beauty\n\nYes. Hi, Lorraine. Thank you for the question. As we mentioned, we are starting to see more market-wide price increases come through with select brands versus Q2, but we continue to work with our brand partners to understand how they're thinking about tariff mitigation going forward and price increases, and they are being very thoughtful considering the consumer wallet pressures and making sure that we continue to provide value to our guests. As far as how the price increases flow through the P&L, as I had mentioned, there is a short-term benefit to cost of goods as we sell through the product, but eventually that catches up as we sell through the older product and we replenish with newer product.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.\n\nSteven Forbes\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nGood afternoon, Kecia and Chris. Kecia, you mentioned solid app engagement and also app online sales penetration. So I was curious if you can maybe just give us more color around what you're seeing from the consumer standpoint and whether consumers are actually migrating to purchasing across channels as you think about the mix of customers that are maybe dual-channel purchasers versus single-channel purchasers. And the reason I asked, right, is you think about that 15% or mid-teens e-commerce growth profile. It's sort of indicative of really strong wallet share and market share performance. So just trying to gain conviction around what's driving that.\n\nKecia Steelman\n\nPresident and CEO, Ulta Beauty\n\nWell, thanks, Steve, for the question. What I would like to highlight first is that we've had strength in both categories because stores are continuing to grow too. And if you look at the percentage of our business, 80% of our business is still coming from stores. Our app engagement. We're really pleased with what we're seeing.\nIt grew 65% from 63% last quarter. We are building on our momentum in e-comm. We've had three consecutive quarters of double-digit comp. I think that there's a couple of things that are playing into that. We've introduced new capabilities in 2025 that are really helping us strengthen our momentum in e-comm. In Q1, we had split cart launching, which made you could pick it up in the store. You could have something sent to your home. That was a new technology that we didn't previously have. In Q2, we launched Replenish and Save. Q3, Wishlist and Venmo just in time for the holiday season. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've added we have 1,000 stores now for ship from store, so speed is really important.\nAs our investments are continuing to elevate our digital experience and this whole acceleration around personalization is fueling our performance, it's really driving both channels up, and we're really pleased with what we're seeing across both stores and e-comm. What I will say is I'll just finish by saying that there's no finish line in our technology and our investments and the investments that we're making, and it's just great to see that our Ulta Beauty Unleashed plans and what we're investing in is really starting to come through and show on the top line sales.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital.\n\nAnthony Chukumba\n\nAnalyst, Loop Capital\n\nThank you so much for taking my question. Congrats on a really strong quarter. I guess my first question is, I look at your comp performance on a two-year stack basis. This is the second quarter where the comp accelerated on a two-year stack basis. And I guess, and I know it's probably hard to parse this out super finitely, but I was just wondering how much of that do you think is the product newness versus the better execution in store versus the better promotions? Maybe it's a mix of all of that, and it does sound like the industry is continuing to grow. So how do you just sort of think about that?\n\nKecia Steelman\n\nPresident and CEO, Ulta Beauty\n\nWell, I think it's all. Thanks, Anthony, for the question. I'll start by saying that, but I would say it's all of that really playing in together. And what I'm seeing is that the company is really hitting on all cylinders. We have a very clear plan, and everyone's working on the Ulta Beauty Unleashed plan and understands the role that they play.\nI couldn't be more pleased with what I'm seeing also from our frontline associates all the way to the senior executive team and really rising to the occasion and really driving the business. I'd say that there's four areas that we're really leaning into. It's merchandising, especially this time of year, we're really focused on gifting. Fragrance, we call that, was really strong. We've got a lot of holiday exclusives and newness that's driving the business. In digital, our capabilities, which I just shared in the last question, they're really driving that e-commerce channel. Marketing, we're amplifying the ways that we're communicating. We've launched our new brand equity campaign, and then it's all underpinned by operations and just delivering on a great guest experience from in stores to guest satisfaction and the speed in which we're delivering products to our stores.\nSo it's the game plan working together collectively along with the team supporting it that I think is where you're seeing the momentum come. We're going against the Super Bowl of the season here in fourth quarter, and we're just going to continue to lean into our operational excellence and continue to deliver the best results that we can have for the rest of this year.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Anna Andreeva with Piper Sandler.\n\nAnna Andreeva\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nGreat. Thank you so much. And let me add my congrats. A great quarter. We had a follow-up on SG&A. How much of that growth was the incremental brand campaign that you guys did during the quarter? And you've talked about 2025 being more of a catch-up year in terms of investments. Can you talk about if we should expect 2026 SG&A to be managed closer to sales?\nWhat areas are you guys still investing in? And, not sure if you can comment, how we should think about Space NK contribution to sales and as we think about SG&A for next year. Thanks so much.\n\nChris Lialios\n\nInterim CFO, Ultra Beauty\n\nThank you for the question, Anna. I'll start off with the SG&A increase. As you know, we deleveraged about 240 basis points primarily due to higher incentive comps, store payroll and benefit expense, store expenses, and the amortization of cloud-based software. As far as breaking out the advertising piece, we leveraged our advertising as a result of the higher top line revenue. And as far as the growth of store payroll expense, again, it's primarily due to additional selling hours to support the guest experience.\n\nKecia Steelman\n\nPresident and CEO, Ulta Beauty\n\nAnd then we're going to share more about our SG&A plans in March when we're going to talk about our 2026 plans. But we understand, and I shared in the comments, this is an investment year, and we knew that, and this was what the plan was, and we look like we're going to be hitting what our focus has been, forecast has been that we shared earlier, but we'll be able to share more about what the plans are around SG&A in March.\n\nAnna Andreeva\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nAll right. Fair enough. Best of luck for the holiday.\n\nKecia Steelman\n\nPresident and CEO, Ulta Beauty\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Also, congrats on a really nice quarter. So Kecia, just on the brand, or I guess the innovation pipeline, the exclusive brands, I know last year your team was very upbeat in terms of innovation for this year. So just curious, based on your current visibility into next year, just how do you feel about the pipeline out there?\n\nKecia Steelman\n\nPresident and CEO, Ulta Beauty\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question, Rupesh. Our merchandising vision is to really curate and inspire guests with the best beauty and wellness assortment for all life stages. And Lauren has come in and really brought some great thought leadership and is really helping us refine the merchandising vision and brand-building strategy. What I will say is that our merchants have been hard at work in developing their plans for fiscal 2026. We have an exciting pipeline of newness, and I'm pleased with what I see right now, and it's balanced across the portfolio very similar to how this year was. So while we're in the midst of our planning, and I'll share more specifics in March, the team has done a really nice job, and they have really prioritized newness and innovation because we know how important it is to really drive this business overall.\nSo I feel bottom line really great about what I'm seeing for 2026.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGreat. Thank you. Best of luck.\n\nKecia Steelman\n\nPresident and CEO, Ulta Beauty\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Kelly Crago with Citi.\n\nKelly Crago\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nHi. Thanks for taking our question, and congrats on a great quarter. Kecia, I was hoping you could elaborate on your philosophy around your EBIT margin, long-term EBIT margin of 12%. You're running ahead of that this year despite significant SG&A deleverage. Should we still anchor to the 12% as we think about F2026? And with that, you talked about SG&A maybe finding some efficiencies. Is SG&A a source of leverage as we look forward, or will you still sort of try to drive the gross margin and maybe invest against that? Thanks.\n\nKecia Steelman\n\nPresident and CEO, Ulta Beauty\n\nYeah. Thanks, Kelly, for the question. I will say this is a great position to be in because we're outperforming what the original plan was. While our guidance for 2025 now is between 12.3% and 12.4%, as we're looking at 2026, we're focused on building a plan that really positions us to deliver against our long-term targets. We're still in the planning process, and we need to see where 2025 lands because we still have the rest of this quarter to go. Reflecting on our commitment that 2026 will not be another big heavy investment year, we would not expect EBIT margin next year to deteriorate from 2025 levels. Now, you asked also about the long-term plan. While our performance is better than what we had planned, it's still premature to change our long-term growth targets at this time. We're confident that we can deliver our targets over time, but there are so much nuances that can happen from year-to-year.\nMy focus as a leader is to make sure that we're building a plan that we can continue to invest in this business, remain relevant, and take share. As you know, we have a brand new CFO starting tomorrow. As he gets into the operations, I'm sure he's going to have a perspective too. He and I are going to work together along with the board to make sure that we have a long-term plan that really supports our business, taking market share, and being a profitable business over time. So bottom line, I would say that you should not look for EBIT margins to deteriorate from fiscal year 2025 levels.\n\nKelly Crago\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nThank you.\n\nKecia Steelman\n\nPresident and CEO, Ulta Beauty\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Michael Lasser with UBS.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGood evening. Thank you so much for taking my question. Kecia, there's been some debate around the start of the holiday season. has carried a lot of momentum over the last six months. Are you finding that some of the momentum is starting to fade where consumers are shopping more around events and in between those periods got a little quieter? And does that give you pause about the need to continue to make investments in order to drive the business? Thank you so much.\n\nKecia Steelman\n\nPresident and CEO, Ulta Beauty\n\nThanks, Michael, for the question. What I would say is that comp growth during the quarter was really consistent across all periods. And as I shared, we were pleased with Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Beauty is still a very important category for the consumer in their lives and also for shopping for their holiday needs. And Ulta Beauty is also very important to them. I'm confident in our plans and staying really focused on execution. And we're having a lot of fun.\nWe're working really hard on this plan. The team's having a good time doing it. We've got momentum on our side. I like what I'm seeing in the newness pipeline. I think we're going to continue to play our game and continue to stay focused at keeping the consumer at the center of everything that we're doing. And I just don't necessarily see that momentum changing anytime soon.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThank you.\n\nKecia Steelman\n\nPresident and CEO, Ulta Beauty\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.\n\nIke Boruchow\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, good afternoon. Just I wanted to ask about the shrink benefits that you guys have seen all year. Any chance you could quantify it for the third quarter? Are you expecting benefits into the fourth quarter? And then I guess is there more tailwind to that, or was this a big kind of catch-up year for you guys?\nBecause I know two years ago there were some issues you've clearly worked through. So just kind of looking for more clarity there. Thanks.\n\nChris Lialios\n\nInterim CFO, Ultra Beauty\n\nThanks for the question, Ike. We are pleased with the progress, obviously, as we stated in our prepared remarks that we've made to reduce shrink. In Q3, there was a modest improvement, and in Q4, we expect another modest improvement in shrink. We do expect for the full year 2025 that shrink will be lower than 2024. We believe there's still some opportunity to reduce shrink further, but the teams are working very hard, and we're very pleased with all the initiatives that we've put in place.\n\nIke Boruchow\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Mike Baker with D.A. Davidson.\n\nMike Baker\n\nAnalyst, D.A. Davidson\n\nThanks. Could you discuss the competitive situation? Amazon Premium Beauty still seems to be growing a lot. I think Sephora at Kohl's actually comes negative, yet LVMH's selective retail was positive. A lot of different moving parts from your competitors. How do you see the competitive situation today versus four months ago or earlier in the year?\n\nKecia Steelman\n\nPresident and CEO, Ulta Beauty\n\nThank you for the question, Mike. Beauty has always been a competitive category, and there's been consistent growth, and it's been combined with attractive profit margins. It's attracted a variety of players into the category. But that's what our Ulta Beauty Unleash plan is designed to do, is to really accelerate and amplify our differentiation, what makes us unique. I will just say that we're doubling down on the drivers that we know. With us having 46.3 million loyalty members, we know what our consumers are purchasing, how they're purchasing. We have, like I said, the pipeline of newness.\nOur merchants are doing a fantastic job of listening to the consumer and what it is that they're looking for. We are the only one that really offers everything from low to luxe and everything in between, underpinned with services, activations, and the investments that we're making in our events. So the experiential shopping makes us different. When you look at our e-commerce business and you see one of the big drivers in e-com is BOPUS, it further substantiates that our e-com business strength is there, but they still like coming into the store. So I do think that while, yes, it's a very competitive environment, we are uniquely positioned to continue to win and take share in the industry. So like I said, I feel really great about our plans. The plans are working.\nWe're still in the early phases of them, and they're just going to continue to move. The momentum is going to continue to be on our side.\n\nMike Baker\n\nAnalyst, D.A. Davidson\n\nThank you.\n\nKecia Steelman\n\nPresident and CEO, Ulta Beauty\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.\n\nDana Telsey\n\nAnalyst, Telsey Advisory Group\n\nHi. Good afternoon, everyone, and congratulations on the nice results. Kecia, as you think of top line and you think of the categories and prestige and Mass, what are you seeing on prestige and Mass? Is there a difference? And as you go forward through this holiday season, is the newness at all different this holiday season than it was last year? Any way you're triangulating it? And lastly, you mentioned on Space NK bringing things here. What are you bringing? Has it been tested? How's it reacting? How do you see that moving forward? Thank you.\n\nKecia Steelman\n\nPresident and CEO, Ulta Beauty\n\nThank you, Dana. I think that might have been a three-part question. I'll try to make sure I cover all of the points. But in regards to market share, prestige Beauty, the industry grew in mid-single digits, and we gained share primarily driven by our strength in skin and fragrance. But makeup also increased. We're seeing steady improvements in prestige hair care in our trends. And what's great about prestige is that we gained share in both brick-and-mortar and digital channels with elevated competition even out there. And then in Mass, Mass grew as an industry mid-single digits in Q3, and we gained share primarily driven by strength in mass makeup. So what I would say is that I'm really encouraged to see that our plans are working to improve our performance and really drive market share. And our efforts are gaining traction. We're confident in our goal for plans.\nMarket share is a battle. So we're staying focused on building on our successes to continue to drive sustained market share improvements over the long haul. You asked a little bit about Space NK. What I would say is that with Space NK, it's still early. We're in the early innings. But one of the things that was really attractive to us is the nuance of their ability to really have clienteling and really have close relationships with their consumer, be really agile. They've just now launched their app themselves. It's just, like I said, I think this is a situation where one plus one can equal three. They've figured out how to do high street really well in smaller box locations and be really efficient with their space.\nI think what we can bring to them is back office operations and how do you continue to leverage the size, the scale, and the operational efficiencies that we have. So it's really early still in the innings is what I would say, but we have the ability to really learn a lot from each other. I want to protect what makes Space NK unique. I do not want to turn Space NK into a mini Ulta Beauty. I think that's what's made Space NK so special. But I think, like I said, there's learnings that we can share from them and to us and us and to them that will help us both be better in the long run.\n\nDana Telsey\n\nAnalyst, Telsey Advisory Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Michael Binetti with Evercore ISI.\n\nMichael Binetti\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nHey, guys. let me add my congrats. Great quarter. I'm still trying to get my head around the SG&A and how we got from 13% to 14% growth for the year on the last call to 23% in Q3. I think if growths are flat, back to 15% to 16% growth for the year now. I know you called out a couple of items within the 23% growth in Q3, but I don't understand if those were included in the 13% to 14% for the year previously or not. Just maybe help us understand the bridge there. Then I know you have talked a lot about SG&A a lot and the 12% margin, EBIT margin. But the gross margin flat for the year on a 4% to 5% comp.\nI was trying to think through that a little bit, and think what the comp leverage point is that you guys are comfortable with there. I think the last publicly available documents we saw, Space NK had a gross margin profile closer to 43% for a couple of years in a row, pretty stable, so three or four points higher than where you're at. Does that kind of a comp in the model leverage SG&A in a normalized environment once we get past some of the Space NK impact?\n\nChris Lialios\n\nInterim CFO, Ultra Beauty\n\nThanks for the question, Michael. It seems like there was more than one question there, so we'll try to tackle them.\n\nMichael Binetti\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThere's a couple in there.\n\nChris Lialios\n\nInterim CFO, Ultra Beauty\n\nTry to tackle them here. As far as Space NK, so Space NK does not become comp until Q3 of next year. So you will have some Space NK impact year-over-year in the first half of 2026. As far as the deleverage, FY2025, we expect gross margin will be roughly flat, again, driven by lower shrink and higher merchandise margin, offset by the deleverage of other revenue and store occupancy costs, as well as the adverse channel mix that we talked about. For the fourth quarter, we expect GMD leverage driven primarily by store fixed and other revenue as well, largely reflecting our fourth quarter comp expectation. And the adverse channel mixes, again, still plays into effect there in Q4, offset by we will see some leverage in our supply chain costs.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Adrienne Yih with Barclays.\n\nAdrienne Yih\n\nAnalyst, Barclays",
    "content2": "Great. Thank you very much. let me add my congratulations. The stores look fantastic. Just in one this afternoon. Kecia, can you talk about the target 1,800 number of stores? At the analyst day, it was a couple hundred more from the October 2024 kind of anchor. And your top line is 2x the sale, the rate of category growth. Next year, we're going to shed over 600 of the Target x Ulta. So I'm just wondering, how do you feel about the pace? And has anything changed there? And then for Chris, a question just on kind of the modeling of the kind of pricing with the price benefits that you had and the tariff inventory hitting the income statement. Should we expect more of a parity, a matching effect on the pricing actions versus the tariff impact actions starting in maybe Q1 or Q2? Thank you.\n\nKecia Steelman\n\nPresident and CEO, Ulta Beauty\n\nThanks, Adrienne, for the question. And I'm happy to hear in our stores, and hopefully you're shopping. I would say that our long-term algorithm of what we've shared for new stores is we've said 1,800, and we're still confident with that 1,800 store count going forward. And then Chris, I'll kick it over to you.\n\nChris Lialios\n\nInterim CFO, Ultra Beauty\n\nSo on the pricing impact, obviously, we'll talk more about the impact of price increases in Q1 and Q2 next year in March. But as far as the price increase in Q4, we do expect to see modest price increases like we've seen in other years.\n\nAdrienne Yih\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nAnd the inventory will not yet fully be expressed with the pressure. Is that correct? So it's similar to the third quarter in terms of a net benefit?\n\nChris Lialios\n\nInterim CFO, Ultra Beauty\n\nYeah. As you know, it's based on our inventory valuation method, the average cost. So it's going to take a while for it to reach the new cost level. But most likely, it takes about one or two quarters for it to flush through.\n\nAdrienne Yih\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you very much. Best of luck for holiday.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi everyone. Hi, Kecia. Can I take your temperature on newness? I think it's been a theme for 2025. What are you seeing as it wraps into next year? And if you're able to separate, this year has been a lot of improvement, some of it's newness, some of it's marketing. And then you've talked a lot about early innings of some things sound like basic things that you brought, like the payment thing. So can you talk about how much internal improvement you would chalk this year up to and how much more is to go in the future? Thanks.\n\nKecia Steelman\n\nPresident and CEO, Ulta Beauty\n\nYeah. Thanks, Simeon, for the question. I feel really good about the newness pipeline that I'm seeing for 2026. The merchants have been hard at work developing plans, and that's one of the rigors that Lauren's really brought, I think, into the company, is taking a look at the current year and building a plan, like how are we going to combat newness that's going to be flowing next year and being really balanced across the portfolio. So in regards to newness, I feel good about what next year looks like. The second part of your question was, I mentioned early innings and that there's some things that I think can continue to come play. What I mean by that is this has been a heavy, heavy investment year in a lot of our technology investments in our teams. And there's benefits to letting things marinate a bit.\nWe've been coming off of two what I call really high or a few high years of investment in our foundation. So for the last three years before this last year, we were investing in our ERP, our POS, supply chain, back-end operations, digital, I mean, pretty much all aspects of the business. Then we had fallen behind in our go-to-market. So that's what happened this year is we shifted more into the go-to-market type strategies. So it's been a heavy-up investment year in more guest-facing, sales-driving, market-driving initiatives. There is going to be benefit to being, I would say, hyper-prioritized next year. We always are going to want to invest in the business, but we're going to be more prioritized next year. There's going to be less investments next year, very thoughtfully done.\nWe need to see the benefits from some of these investments that we've made over the last few years really kind of settle in, marinate, and get the benefit from them. So that's why I'm saying I feel like we're still in the early innings is that there's major opportunity for us to continue to see these things come to play.\n\nKiley Rawlins\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Ulta Beauty\n\nI think we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question will come from Olivia Tong with Raymond James.\n\nOlivia Tong\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James\n\nGreat. Thank you. And congrats on the quarter. Your early read from Black Friday through Cyber Monday sounded promising. So just wondering if you could unpack the expectations for deceleration to two and a half to three and a half comp. Was there any impact from the government shutdown, any change in consumer habits with pricing? And if you could, what quarter to date looked like.\nThen just thinking about the initiatives going forward, you're going into next year with a ton of momentum, it seems. But curious how you think about some of these initiatives for next year to come some pretty amazing top-line growth this year. You already talked about the newness. But what about next 12 months versus last 12 months, and international, wellness, marketplace, other new initiatives, and the ability to continue to build those so that the contribution continues to get bigger as you comp these numbers? Thank you.\n\nKecia Steelman\n\nPresident and CEO, Ulta Beauty\n\nYeah. As I mentioned, thanks, Olivia, for the question. As I mentioned, Black Friday and Cyber Monday performance, we were really pleased with. And what I'm excited about is that we came out of a really strong business with even stronger insights than we've seen ever coming out of a holiday, peak holiday weekend.\nWhile this is challenging, this is also a very fun time, but these next nine weeks are big weeks, and there's just so much volatility that can happen. You could have bad weather that happens on a key critical weekend. Who knows what could happen between now and the end of the quarter? So I think we're just being very prudent in our guidance and making sure that I kind of like the plan of not missing a quarter as a new CFO and first year in position. So I'm wanting to put something out there that I feel like is an achievable plan and one that the team can continue to work towards.\nIn regards to your question around long-term and how confident am I in that we can continue to sustain momentum, I believe that we are a company that can continue to grow share, and that's what our plan that we've built is built to do. I look forward to sharing more with you in March after we finish the year and we can share what our plans are for next year. But the team's been working really hard along with myself to build a good game plan for what 2026 looks like. Like I said, we're in the early phases of that. We're looking forward to being able to share that with you all, but we've got good fundamentals in place. I grew up through operations. I understand the levers that it takes to really drive a profitable retail business, and I'm committed to doing that. All right.\nWell, thank you all for joining us today and discussing our third quarter results. We're excited about the progress we're making against our Ulta Beauty Unleashed strategy and focus on closing out the year strong. We appreciate your continued interest in Ulta Beauty and hope you all have a safe and happy holiday season. We look forward to speaking to you all again in March when we report our fourth quarter and full year results. Have a great evening, everyone.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for joining. This concludes today's call, and you may now disconnect."

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Kiley Rawlins, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rawlins, please proceed.\n\nKiley F.

Steelman\n\nCOO, Ulta Beauty, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll highlight overall performance, update you on the progress we made across our strategic priorities and talk to you about our outlook for the future. Fiscal 2025 is off to an encouraging start. With the Ulta Beauty team delivering better-than-planned financial performance. For the first quarter, net sales increased 4.5% to $2.8 billion. Operating profit was 14.1% of sales and diluted earnings per share was $6.70.\nDuring the quarter, admits considerable macro noise and uncertainty, guests responded positively to key actions that we took to drive our business. including improved execution, exciting new and exclusive brand launches, evolved promotional plans and relevant marketing. As a result, we drove improvement across several key performance indicators, including member growth, brand engagement and earned media value as well as in-store conversion and app engagement. Importantly, these efforts resulted in market share gains during the quarter. Consumer engagement with Beauty remains healthy, and our insights indicate beauty and wellness remain a top priority for beauty enthusiasts, who tell us that they're more willing to make trade-offs in other discretionary areas to maintain their beauty regimens.\nAt the same time, they are cautious and value is an increasingly important priority as they navigate ongoing wallet pressures. Many consumers indicate that they're leaning into beauty has a comfort and escape from the stress of macro uncertainty. And we expect this emotional connection will support the category's resilience going forward. Our teams are working through all these dynamics to ensure that we are well positioned to deliver on our guests' evolving needs and are working in close partnership with our brands to mitigate potential impacts of higher tariffs.\nIn March, I shared our Ulta Beauty unleash plan which is designed to accelerate our performance and enable us to achieve our long-term goals and reassert our leadership position. Today, I'll show progress we've made and highlight the key components of our strategy that drove our first quarter performance. Let me begin with all of our efforts to drive our core business growth. where we're focused on driving excellence in all areas of our operations and strengthening our go-to-market approach. Our teams have sharpened their focus on delighting our guests with every interaction in ensuring our stores are fully stocked staffed, clean and inviting.\nOur teams executed well, particularly for key events and holidays, delivering a very successful 21-day beauty campaign, along with strong Valentine's Day in Easter performance and drove comp growth across many of our major categories. I am incredibly proud of our store and field teams whose collective efforts drove improved in-store conversion and guest satisfaction and positive comp sales growth in stores for the first time in more than a year. From a category perspective, fragrance was our strongest performing category delivering double-digit growth, primarily driven by newness in women's and gender neutral fragrance brands, spring and Valentine's Day sets and continued strength in men's fragrance.\nNew and exclusive brands, XO, Khloe by Khloe Kardashian and Noise as well as Newness from Valentino and Billie Elish contributed to strong category performance. Sales in the Skin Care and Wellness category increased in the high single-digit range, driven by robust growth in Biocare, sun care and wellness. Prestige skin care was flat for the quarter. while mass skin care decreased modestly. New brands, including Tatcha, Naturium and Anua as well as trend-relevant brands, Millies, an exclusive K-Beauty brand, Peach & Lily, resonated with guests while expansions of Saudi Janeiro and Touch Land also contributed to category growth. The hair care category was roughly flat for the quarter, with growth in hair color and accessories, offset by decreases in hair care tools and mass hair care. Professional hair care was flat with growth from newness, offset by a timing shift of a key promotional event.\nNewness was fueled by the much anticipated debut of Beyonce's sacred haircare line in early April, which included a unique services activation. Comp sales in the makeup category decreased slightly, driven by mass makeup as strong newness from exclusive brand Morphe and Altaba collection did not fully offset headwinds from certain brands, which lapped strong newness and social engagement in the period last year. Prestige makeup was flat for the quarter. Guest engagement with newer brands, Elia, [indiscernible] as well as exclusive newness for MAC, Estee Lauder and [indiscernible] offset headwinds from brands, which have experienced increased distribution. Additionally, our spring 21-day of beauty event delivered strong growth for participating brands.\nFinally, services delivered low single-digit comps, driven by salon and specialty services, including ear piercing and makeup services. We also brought beauty to life in our stores through our always-on eventing strategy, which was amplified in our online channels with new tools that aim to drive greater awareness and sales. We hosted more than 20,000 in-store events during the quarter, many in partnership with our brands. Moving to marketing. We're evolving and reimagining our go-to-market strategy to spark excitement and awareness deepen engagement and attack the tracked and retained loyalty members.\nThis quarter, our integrated marketing delivered bold relevant campaigns that elevated brand visibility and drove traffic across all channels. we activated key moments with Precision, our Super Bowl campaign, which celebrated women and sports delivered record-level social impressions and engagement, amplifying reach and cultural relevance on the biggest stage in pop culture. 21 days of beauty and Spring Hall generated strong traffic and conversion, powered by creator led content that build anticipation and drove significant increases in member penetration. Following the successful launch of Beyonce sacred, we announced Ulta Beauty as the official beauty retail partner of our Cowboy Carter tour, a powerful collaboration featuring curated beauty looks, exclusive product assortments and immersive brand experiences across two markets.\nAnd finally, in April, we hosted our inaugural Ulta Beauty world an experiential beauty event giving about 1,400 all to fans and influencers, the opportunity to explore the best of beauty through live demos with our brands, Brand Founder, meet and greets and interactive experiences across makeup, skincare, care, fragrance and wellness. We are bringing the Ulta Beauty brand to life in new and exciting ways, and our guests are responding. We expanded our active loyalty member base to a record $45 million, up 3% year-over-year, while also driving higher engagement, record social impressions and meaningful earned media value. Turning to brand building. During the quarter, we launched 19 new brands, many of which are exclusive to Ulta Beauty. Newly launched brands like Tatcha, Milk Makeup, Elias, SatEUR all performed well and drove strong guest engagement. At the same time, exclusive brands are driving growth, including DIB's Beauty and influencer-led makeup brand, along with Anua, a viral K-Beauty brand and Snif a clean vegan crude quality free fragrance brand with accessible price points.\nWe're pleased to see that our brand building efforts are resonating with guests, and we're optimistic about new brand launches and activations planned for Q2 and the rest of the year. Turning to digital and personalization. We're accelerating our capabilities to deepen gas connection and drive performance. We've expanded automation and real-time content delivery across key digital channels, allowing us to respond faster, personalized at scale and enhance the overall guest experience. We also rolled out new features, including split card capabilities and new shop by store app functionality that provides guests real-time visibility to store assortment and inventory. These efforts are translating into stronger engagement, increased relevance and measurable business impact.\nWe look forward to building on our momentum and adding new digital enhancements in the coming quarters. Moving to our second strategic priority to scale new and accretive businesses to capitalize on key growth opportunities and ensure that we remain resilient in a rapidly changing world. As we look to the near-term actions we've taken to scale our new businesses, during the first quarter, we supported our wellness efforts with the launch of 9 new wellness brands online, including several nutrition-focused supplement and adjustable brands like Garden of Life, Women's Care brand, Hatch Mama and sleep-related fan favorite nod pod. We also continue to enhance and expand our retail media network, UV Media.\nWe capitalized on key opportunities for co-branded ads to support 21 Days of Beauty, which drove engagement and incremental ad revenue. In addition, we began piloting new ad products like connected television and streaming audio and brand support capabilities like our new self-service tool to provide faster, more transparent performance insights. At the same time, we're making investments to drive our long-term expansion. Our international efforts are progressing through our partnerships. We are targeting our first store openings in Mexico City Kuwait City and Dubai later this year. And our online marketplace initiative announcement in March has driven meaningful brand interest, and we remain on track for launch in the second half of this year.\nFinally, moving to our third strategic priority to realign our foundation for the future by streamlining our cost structure, optimizing our ways of working and reenergizing our culture. Our teams are adapting well to our new ways of working, and we are steadily advancing our optimization efforts. During the quarter, we leveraged new AI and machine learning capabilities to drive supply chain efficiencies and launch scheduling and enhanced payroll management tools to optimize our efforts and support our cost-saving goals.\nWe also announced that Lauren Brindley will join Ulta Beauty next week on June 3 as Chief Merchandising and Digital Officer. Lauren will have responsibility for our merchandising, e-commerce, wellness and marketplace strategies and will play an important role in our leading our brand-building efforts. With more than 2 decades of global beauty and retail expertise, having most recently served as CEO of Revolution Beauty, Lauren is a proven strategic leader with deep industry expertise, a global perspective and a passion for beauty, and we are thrilled to have her join the team.\nMy sincere thanks to Monica Arnaldo, who will retire next month for shaping Autobus world-class assortment and category innovation and her support during this transition. We wish Mike all the best in her retirement. On our last quarterly earnings call, I talked about our focus on reenergizing our culture. I truly believe that we have the best talent and culture in retail and reigniting this critical competitive advantage has been a key priority. In April, we brought together our field leaders, including more than 1,400 general managers along with corporate and DC leaders and brand partners at our annual field leadership conference to celebrate our recent wins, educate on how we can better serve our guests and align on our plans for the future.\nI walked away so inspired by the passion of the Ulta Beauty team. The shared excitement of our brand partners and the renewed energy to drive our next phase of growth together. It was a great reminder of the power of culture and I know that when we tap into this unique advantage that makes Ulta Beauty so special, we are unstoppable. To recap, we are encouraged by the progress we made in the quarter and the green shoots we're seeing as a result of the strategic actions we're taking. Together, they reinforce my confidence in the power of our team, our model and our plans to drive our long-term growth. As we look to the future, we are executing our go-to-market investments to position stronger growth in 2026 and beyond.\nThe operating environment is fluid, and we will stay prudent and agile to navigate the ever-evolving landscape. While uncertainty presents risk, it also provides opportunities and we are confident in our model and the diverse assortment uniquely position us to win. There is still work to be done, and it will take time to drive sustained improvement, but I know that we have the right team and plans in place to build on our momentum and drive sustainable long-term growth. And with that, I'll turn it over to Paula to cover the financial results for the quarter and our financial outlook before we take your questions. Paula?\n\nPaula M. Oyibo\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Kecia, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin with a discussion of our first quarter results and then share more about how we are thinking about the rest of the year. Starting with the quarter. The Ulta Beauty team delivered strong performance, reflecting better-than-expected growth from comparable sales, favorable shrink results and lower than planned investment spend. Net sales increased 4.5% to $2.8 billion compared to $2.7 billion last year. During the quarter, we opened 6 new stores, relocated two stores and remodeled 4 stores. Comparable sales increased 2.9%, driven by a 2.3% increase in average ticket and a 0.6% increase in transactions. Other revenue decreased $4 million to $56 million, primarily due to lower loyalty point redemptions and lower income from our credit card program. Looking at the cadence of sales. Growth accelerated as we moved through the quarter, reflecting strong guest engagement with product newness and our marketing and promotional events.\nEchoing Kecia's comments, we continue to strengthen our go-to-market strategies and optimize our promotions to drive profitable growth. In the first quarter, we eliminated less productive or overlapping offers. Leveraged our member data deploy new targeted offers and optimized key promotional events like Spring Hall and our Spring Haul Event. These efforts created distinct calls to action ensured guest clarity and supported stronger operational execution. As a result, sales growth was more balanced and the impact to gross margin from promotional offers was lower than last year. From a channel perspective, our stores and digital channels contributed to growth, with e-commerce sales increasing about 10% and comp stores delivering growth in the low single-digit range.\nFor the quarter, gross margin decreased 10 basis points to 39.1% compared to 39.2% last year. The decrease was primarily due to deleverage of store and supply chain fixed costs and lower other revenue, which were partially offset by lower shrink. In addition to ongoing benefits from investments in secure fragrance fixtures, associate training and process improvements, we saw meaningful progress, especially in select regions that were more challenged in the first quarter last year. Moving to expenses. -- increased 6.7% to $711 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased 50 basis points to 24.9% and compared to 24.4% last year. SG&A deleverage due in large part to higher store payroll and benefits and increased store expenses which were primarily offset by corporate overhead leverage.\nStore payroll and benefit expense increased primarily due to increased selling hours to support guest experience higher average wage rates and increased health care costs. The growth of store expenses was largely related to brand launches and in-store initiatives. Corporate overhead leveraged for the quarter as we lapped implementation costs associated with key infrastructure investments last year. Additionally, some investment spending initially planned for the first quarter is now expected to shift into later quarters.\nOperating profit was $402 million compared to $401 million last year. As a percentage of sales, operating margin decreased 60 basis points to 14.1% of sales. Diluted earnings per share increased 3.6% to $6.70. Moving to highlights from the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with $455 million in cash and cash equivalents. Total inventory increased 11.3% to $2.1 billion, primarily reflecting additional inventory to support new brand launches, investments to improve merchandise in-stocks in key growth categories and the impact of 56 net new stores. Capital expenditures were $79 million for the quarter, reflecting investments in new and existing stores, merchandise fixtures and supply chain investments.\nDepreciation increased 11% to $72 million compared to $65 million last year, primarily due to new store and supply chain investments. In the first quarter, we returned $359 million of capital to our shareholders through the repurchase of 987,000 shares. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.3 billion remaining under our current $3 billion repurchase authorization.\nTurning now to our updated outlook. We believe it is prudent to take a cautious approach to our guidance for fiscal 2025. While the beauty category has historically been resilient through economic downturns, it has not been immune to consumer pressure. The operating environment continues to be very dynamic, and the evolving global trade landscape has created more uncertainty related to consumer wallet pressures, especially for the second half of the year. For the year, we have updated our sales expectations to reflect our first quarter results as well as more uncertainty in the second half.\nWe now expect net sales will be between $11.5 billion and $11.7 billion with comp sales growth in the range of flat to up 1.5%. This outlook reflects the comp growth in the second half could be in the range of down low single digits to up modestly. We continue to expect operating profit will deleverage in the low double-digit range with operating margin between 11.7% and 11.8% of sales. reflecting our sales expectation and how we are now forecasting a flow of investment spend, we expect operating margin will be more pressured in the second half of the year than the first half.\nFor modeling purposes, our assumptions for the drivers of gross margin deleverage and SG&A growth have not changed since we provided our initial outlook in March. Reflecting these assumptions, we now anticipate diluted EPS for the year will be between $22.65 and $23.20 per share. Before closing, I want to provide some additional context on how we are thinking about the potential impact on our business from the evolving tariff and global trade landscape. For context, in fiscal 2024, only about 1% of our merchandise receipts were direct imports. The remaining receipts came from our portfolio of 600 brands. And we intend to continue to work closely with our brand partners to navigate the evolving environment and limit the financial impact on our business.\nBeyond merchandise, we have some exposure in indirect spend areas like fixtures and store supplies. However, we are confident we can mitigate any cost increases. In closing, we are encouraged by the improved results our team delivered in the first quarter, and we are being prudent about managing the business. As we look to the rest of fiscal 2025, we intend to invest to strengthen our competitive position and drive long-term profitable growth while also continuing to be thoughtful about pacing and prioritization of our investments.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to the operator to moderator for the Q&A.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce Ms. Kiley Rawlins, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rawlins, please proceed.\n\nKiley F. Rawlins\n\nVP - Investor Relations, Ulta Beauty, Inc.\n\nThank you, Alicia, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us for a discussion of Ulta Beauty's fourth quarter and fiscal '24 results. Hosting our call today are Kecia Steelman, Chief Executive Officer; and Paula Oyibo, Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind you of the company's safe harbor language. Many of our remarks today will contain forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today, March 13, 2025. We refer you to our earnings release and SEC filings, where you will find a number of factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements.\nKecia will begin our call with key highlights from our fiscal '24 results and share our priorities for fiscal '25. Then Paula will review our fourth quarter results in more detail and discuss our outlook for fiscal '25. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. Our call will be a little longer than usual this time and so to allow us to accommodate as many questions as possible during our scheduled for this call, we respectfully ask that you limit your time to one question. [Operator Instructions] And as always, the IR team will be available for any follow-up questions after the call.\nBefore I call the -- turn the call over to Kecia, I want to share that both Paula and Kesha are fighting seasonal colds, and you may notice that their voices are a bit raspy this afternoon.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Kecia. Kecia?\n\nKecia L. Steelman\n\nCOO, Ulta Beauty, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. I've had the pleasure of participating in these calls over the last few years as COO, and I'm excited to host my first call as CEO today. I appreciate your continued interest in Ulta Beauty and look forward to engaging with each of you.\nToday, I'll provide my perspective on the strength of our business, highlight where I focused my first 60 days as CEO and share some of our 2024 achievements and discuss how I'm thinking about our long-term growth opportunities and prioritizing our actions.\nIt all starts with our mission. Simply put, there's magic in our mission. Every day, we seek to use the power of beauty to bring to life the possibilities that lie within each of us. We have a unique opportunity to serve beauty enthusiasts at nearly every stage of life and in so many milestone moments, from their first date to their first job interview, to their wedding day and so many moments in between. It's a mission uniquely suited for Ulta Beauty, one I feel very privileged to steward. And I know that no one can bring this mission to life the way we can.\nWhile I've been at Ulta Beauty for more than a decade, in my first 60 days as CEO, I made it a priority to spend meaningful time with our brand partners, guests, leadership team and store associates to assess the state of our business, including where we're winning and where we have opportunities. I've made organizational changes to streamline decision-making and align our teams around guest-centric goals, and I've leaned in where we have immediate opportunities to improve our execution, all through the lens of protecting and nurturing the culture that we believe makes us so special.\nI step into this role with incredible optimism because it's evident to me that the foundational advantages of our business model are strong and more relevant than ever. We have an unmatched breadth of assortment. We provide convenient and engaging omnichannel accessibility. We've built meaningful brand equity and a leading loyalty program. We have a strong financial foundation with stable operating cash flow, and we have more than 58,000 talented associates who are the heart of our company and represent our brand to our guests every day.\nThe beauty landscape has fundamentally changed. Guest expectations continue to rise, and the pace of change is accelerating. The competitive environment in beauty has never been more intense. For the first time, we lost market share in the beauty category in 2024. I am aware of the challenges that we face. Some of them are external, while others we own. Our business is bigger and we've managed unprecedented category growth, and it is more complex as we've expanded our assortment and added new fulfillment choices like buy online, pick up in store, ship from store and same-day delivery.\nThese capabilities are driving guest engagement and enhanced accessibility that have also resulted in execution challenges, particularly in product transitions and launches as we leverage new tools and processes. As a result, our in-store presentation and guest experience today are not as strong as we would like. These are opportunities well within our control. We've identified specific gaps and we're working quickly to address. And I'm leaning in with our teams and brand partners to improve in-store presentation and inventory levels to deliver a better guest experience.\nIt's clear to me that how we've operated must change to ensure that we capture the opportunities in front of us. We are focusing to ensure the guest is at the center of everything we do. And we intend to move faster, invest strategically and optimize our business to achieve our long-term goals to drive profitable growth and market share.\nI'll dive into our long-term plan to achieve these objectives shortly. But first, let's review the progress made in 2024. We're proud to have finished the year ahead of our expectations. Paula will show -- share more about our financial performance in a few minutes, but I want to highlight just a few of our key 2024 achievements, including enhancing our assortment through the relaunch of our Ulta Beauty Collection; and the launch of 40 new brands, including exclusive brands like EksoCloi, Noise, Wind Beauty; and guest favorites like Charlotte Tilbury, ILIA and Kacha; expanding accessibility through the opening of 60 net new stores, 100 new Ulta Beauty at Target shop-in-shop locations; and improved digital functionality.\nWe also initiated plans to launch in Mexico and most recently announced our expansion into the Middle East in 2025; relaunching and growing our loyalty program 3% to a record high of 44.6 million members; driving significant gains in brand love and social engagement through compelling marketing and advertising efforts; and completing several transformational infrastructure investments, including the upgrade of our ERP system, digital store and data ecosystem.\nLooking forward, we remain optimistic about the strength and resilience of the beauty category. We are mindful that consumers are navigating a dynamic macro environment, but we continue to expect healthy consumer engagement in beauty. While the category has normalized, we believe in the positive dynamics within the categories, including a strong and growing connection between beauty and wellness, increased digital usage, a strong innovation pipeline and consumer engagement. And we expect these dynamics will support continued category growth in the low to mid-single digit range over the next few years.\nNow I want to share how we're prioritizing our actions as we look to deliver a stronger guest experience and value to our stakeholders. The long-term strategies and financial targets that we outlined in our October Investor Day will continue to guide our path forward. To bring further focus to our efforts, we've aligned our plan around 3 main priorities: first, drive core business growth; second, scale new accretive businesses; and third, realign our foundation for the future.\nWe're calling our plan Ulta Beauty Unleashed. We recognize the need to move quickly, and we will be deliberate about pacing and prioritization to ensure that we can execute well and manage the short-term financial impact.\nTurning to our first priority, driving core business growth. We have a strong model and have identified significant opportunities to unlock further advantages. This means continuing to push for excellence in all areas of our operations and strengthening our go-to-market approach with the guests always at the center of everything we do.\nAs I shared earlier, our teams are focused on opportunities to sharpen our execution and get back to the basics of running excellent stores that are easy to navigate, fully stocked, appropriately staffed, clean and inviting. Beyond the return to best-in-class execution, in 2025, we will focus primarily on 3 initiatives to drive core growth: brand building, personalization and digital acceleration.\nWe will enhance our assortment through further investments in brand building with a particular focus on exclusive, emerging and established brands. We've kicked off 2025 with an exciting start with the announcement of several notable brand ches. These include fan favorite Note Makeup and the innovative K-Beauty skincare brand AndNEA, exclusive to Ulta Beauty. And we're thrilled about the upcoming retail debut of Beyonce's haircare brand, Sacred, also exclusive to Ulta Beauty, which we will bring to life in unique ways through our funnel. We'll continue to build this momentum throughout the year and into 2026.\nWe will deepen guest engagement through accelerated personalization, increasing automation and real-time content across digital channels. We will accelerate our digital efforts, delivering new enhanced features on our app and website aimed at elevating the guest experience.\nSecond, we intend to scale new and accretive businesses to capitalize on key growth opportunities and ensure that we remain resilient in a rapidly changing world. In 2025, we'll focus on 4 initiatives: accelerating our focus on wellness; launching a new marketplace, which will expand our e-commerce presence and allow us to offer a broader array of beauty and wellness products to our guests; build upon our international presence; and we also plan to introduce several key enhancements to our Ulta Beauty Media offering, including new product innovation that provides brands with new ways to reach consumers, along with enhanced closed-loop measurements.\nFinally, turning to our third objective, realigning our foundation for the future. To successfully achieve our long-term growth ambitions, reassert our leadership position and deliver value to our stakeholders, we must optimize ways of working and streamline our cost structure. It starts by focusing on the heart of our company: our teams and our culture. At our core, I believe that we have the very best talent and culture in retail, and we're taking steps to reenergize this critical competitive advantage by optimizing the ways of working and positioning our leadership team to meet the needs of our evolving business.\nWe've made several organizational changes to accelerate decision-making, remove friction and align teams and resources around guest-centric goals. This includes incepts to optimize our corporate and field support staff, reducing management layers and shifting resources to higher-growth driving areas.\nAdditionally, I've made several changes to our executive leadership team to better focus on our key priorities. To support a stronger guest experience in stores, we've centralized all store functions under Amy Bayer Thomas, an Ulta Beauty veteran, who will serve in the newly created role of Chief Retail Officer. With this change, Amy will real estate and store design to our existing scope, which includes leadership of our store teams and the loss prevention organization.\nTo align our transformation efforts with our cost optimization initiatives, Mike Maresca, who joined our team in 2023, will add enterprise-wide responsibilities to his scope and will now serve as Chief Technology and Transformation Officer. Amy and Mike are transformational leaders who are guest- and associate-centric and results-driven, and they will continue to impact our organization with broader scope that result our strategic focus and vision for the future.\nTo facilitate a stronger omnichannel assortment of all things beauty and wellness, we've brought our digital and e-commerce teams together with our merchandising and planning teams under Monica Renato, who now serves as Chief Merchandising and Digital Officer. As you may know, Monica announced her plans to retire later this spring. Monica has been a great partner to me, and her vision has elevated our assortment, enhanced our brand partnerships and driven meaningful market share growth. I look forward to sharing an update on her successor very soon.\nWe've also promoted Kelly Mahoney to Chief Marketing Officer to advance our brand, personalization and loyalty efforts. Kelly is uniquely qualified for this role. Her understanding of the beauty enthusiasts is unmatched. And in her 10 years with Ulta Beauty, she has played a pivotal role in evolving and expanding Ulta Beauty Rewards loyalty program to more than 44 million members.\nAdditionally, Jodi Caro, our General Counsel, Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, has shared her intention to retire later this spring after more than 10 years of service to Ulta Beauty. An energetic and passionate leader, Jodi has been a true business partner, and I want to thank her for her contribution.\nAfter conducting a nationwide search, I'm pleased to announce that Renee Cazares, previously Chief Legal Officer for Macademy Sports, will be joining our team next month as Chief Legal Officer. Rene and Jodi will work together to ensure a seamless transition.\nToday, I've shared our plan to make important guest-facing investments, which are necessary to improve our competitiveness and reaccelerate long-term share growth. These investments will pressure profitability in 2025, but we believe they are critical to driving long-term sustainable growth in a competitive, innovative category.\nHowever, we cannot sustain this level of annual expense growth and achieve our long-term profitability goals. Disciplined management of our cost structure is an ongoing area of focus. As we've shared at our Investor Day in October, we are targeting cost optimization of $200 million to $250 million over the next 3 years. Since 2019, we've delivered $550 million in cost savings from optimization efforts across merchandising, real estate and operational process improvements, and I am confident that we can deliver our cost feature-saving target. We're in the early stages of these efforts, and we'll provide regular updates on our progress.\nOur Ultra Beauty Unleashed plan positions us to reassert our leadership position, building on our strengths by fueling growth of our core business, scaling new accretive businesses that further our differentiation and realigning our foundation for the future. While sales growth is the ultimate performance indicator, we are closely tracking a series of KPIs for each of our focus areas, including in-store conversion, member growth and retention, and app engagement. Over the coming quarters, we'll provide more details of our plan and updates on our progress.\nIn closing, I'm incredibly optimistic of the future of Ulta Beauty. 2025 will be an important year as we improve our execution and lay the groundwork to deliver on our long-term financial targets, including net revenue growth of 4% to 6%, mid-single-digit operating profit growth and low double-digit EPS growth. It will take time for us to fully see the impact of our efforts, but with our exceptionally talented team leading the charge, I believe we are taking the right steps to drive profitable growth and market share leadership in beauty and wellness over the long term.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Paula for some specific quarter results and our financial outlook before we take some questions. Paula?\n\nPaula Oyibo\n\nSenior Vice President of Finance\n\nThanks, Kecia, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will start with a discussion of our fourth quarter and full year financial results and then provide color on our expectations for fiscal 2025.\nStarting with the fourth quarter. We delivered better-than-expected performance across the P&L, reflecting stronger revenue growth, lower inventory shrink, better merchandise margin and continued financial discipline and expense management. Net sales for the 13-week quarter decreased 1.9% to $3.5 billion compared to $3.6 billion in the 14-week period last year. During the quarter, we opened 9 new stores, closed 1 store and remodeled 5 stores.\nComparable net sales -- comparable sales for the 13-week period increased 1.5% driven by a 3% increase in average ticket, partially offset by a 1.4% decrease in transactions. Other revenue declined $6 million to $71 million primarily due to lower income from our credit card program.\nNow looking at the cadence of sales through the quarter. Comp sales decreased in November and accelerated in December, reflecting the shift of Thanksgiving and a compressed holiday season. Growth moderated in January, primarily reflecting adverse winter weather.\nSharing more detail on our holiday performance. Comp sales for the combined November and December period increased in the low single-digit range, reflecting the cross-functional efforts of our team to deliver for our guests this holiday season. Our marketing and social strategies drove strong omnichannel traffic. Our enhanced fulfillment options provided increased convenience and accessibility for guests. And our curated assortment of new and exclusive core products, balanced with value-focused holiday kits, drove strong engagement. With additional staffing, new tools and unique events, our store teams delivered great guest experiences and our DC teams flexed up to ensure our stores recovered quickly post holiday.\nFrom a channel perspective, we saw growth across both store and digital channels. E-commerce sales for the quarter increased in the mid-single-digit range and comp store sales were modestly positive, an improvement from the third quarter trend.\nTurning to sales performance by category. Fragrance was our strongest category, delivering double-digit comp growth primarily driven by newness, men's fragrance and multi-branded gift sets. Comp sales in the skincare category increased in the mid-single-digit range as strong growth in body care was partially offset by decreases in prestige and mass skincare. New brands, including Sol de Janeiro, Natrium and Taca, delivered strong growth for the quarter. But this strength was partially offset by lower sales from brands, which have experienced increased distribution or lapped strong social engagement last year.\nComp sales in the hair category increased in the low single-digit range primarily due to newness and product exclusives in hair tools as well as healthy guest engagement with key promotional events. The makeup category experienced a mid-single-digit decrease largely driven by mass makeup, reflecting softness in brands, which lapped strong newness and social engagement last year. Finally, services delivered low single-digit comp growth driven by increases in salon and specialty services, including ear piercing and makeup services.\nFor the quarter, gross margin increased 50 basis points to 38.2% primarily due to lower inventory shrink. Our investments in protective fixture, training and labor, combined with enhanced inventory management processes, are delivering results. For the full year, shrink as a percentage of sales was 20 basis points lower than fiscal 2023. Additionally, gross margin in the quarter benefited from favorable channel mix due to lower e-commerce shipping costs and higher merchandise margins, mostly offset by higher supply chain costs, lower other revenue and deleverage of store fixed.\nMoving to expenses. SG&A was $816 million, $5 million lower than last year largely due to lower corporate overhead, partially offset by higher store payroll and benefits. Corporate overhead was lower for the quarter driven primarily by lower consulting expense as we anniversaried implementation costs associated with key infrastructure investments. The increase in store payroll and benefits was driven by higher health care costs, increased payroll hours per store to support the guest experience during holiday and higher average wage rates.\nAs a percentage of sales, SG&A increased 30 basis points to 23.4%. Depreciation increased 12% to $70 million for the quarter compared to $63 million last year, primarily reflecting new store and supply chain investments. Operating profit was $516 million, approximately flat with last year. As a percentage of sales, operating margin increased 30 basis points to 14.8% of sales and diluted earnings per share increased 4.7% to $8.46.\nI am proud of how our teams persevered in quarter and -- Q4 to deliver these results, positioning us to close out the year better than expected. And I want to express my sincere appreciation to all our Ulta Beauty associates for their continued commitment and focus on serving our guests while continuing to manage our business thoughtfully.\nTo recap full year, net sales increased 0.8% to $11.3 billion. Comp sales increased 0.7% driven by a 1.1% increase in average ticket and a 0.4% decrease in transactions. We opened 60 net new stores, relocated 2 stores and remodeled 41 stores. Gross margin deleveraged 30 basis points to 38.8%. SG&A expense increased 4.2% to $2.8 billion. Operating profit was 13.9% of sales compared to 15% of sales in fiscal 2023, and diluted EPS decreased 2.7% to $25.34 [ per year ].\nMoving to the balance sheet and our capital allocation priorities. We ended the quarter with $703 million in cash and cash equivalents. Total inventory increased 13% to $2 billion, primarily reflecting additional inventory to support new plan launches, the impact of 60 net new stores and investments to improve merchandise in stocks post holiday. From a category perspective, most of the inventory growth is attributable to investments made to support fragrance and body care, which are key growth categories.\nTurning to capital allocation. Our healthy business model generated more than $1.3 billion in cash from operations, enabling us to reinvest $374 million to support future growth and return $1 billion in capital to shareholders through our stock buyback program. Since launching our share repurchase program in 2014, we've effectively returned $6.8 billion to shareholders while continuing to invest in strategic growth drivers.\nTurning now to our outlook for 2025. The operating environment continues to be dynamic. And as we navigate ongoing consumer uncertainty, we believe it is prudent to take a cautious approach to our guidance for fiscal 2025. Additionally, as we shared at our investor meeting in October, we are planning fiscal 2025 to be a transition year, and our view has not changed.\nFor the year, we expect net sales will be between $11.5 billion and $11.6 billion with comp sales growth in the range of flat to up 1%. We expect operating profit will decrease in the low double-digit range as we began to implement our Ulta Beauty Unleashed plan and continue to manage inflationary headwinds and lap onetime expense benefits in 2024.\nReflecting our expectations for revenue growth, we expect operating margin will be between 11.7% and 11.8% of net sales. To share more color into the primary drivers of the expected operating margin pressure. The largest driver of the deleverage is expected inflationary pressure on wages, health care and transportation rates as well as impact of investments we've made over the last few years, including greater utilization of Software as a Service and higher depreciation.\nThe second largest driver is pressure from the investments Kecia discussed earlier, including brand building, personalization, digital acceleration, wellness and marketplace. Incentive comp will also be a headwind as we lap lower incentive compensation in 2024. We expect these pressures will be partially mitigated by lower inventory shrink, supply chain optimization, benefits from UB Media and targeted cost savings.\nWe are confident the investments we plan to make this year are critical to strengthening our long-term market position, and we are tracking our spend and returns closely to ensure we deliver expected benefits. We also recognize the operating environment will evolve, and we will continue to be thoughtful about pacing and prioritization.\nFor modeling purposes, we expect gross margin for the year will deleverage primarily driven by store occupancy costs and supply chain costs, partially offset by lower shrink. We expect SG&A will increase approximately 10% for the year driven primarily by our strategic investments and advertising as we -- as well as increased store payroll and benefits.\nReflecting these assumptions, we anticipate diluted EPS for the year will be between $22.50 and $22.90 per share. Finally, we plan to spend between $425 million and $500 million in CapEx, including approximately $250 million to $275 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $125 million to $165 million for supply chain and IT, and $50 million to $60 million for store maintenance and other.

Kimbell\n\nPresident & Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer, Ulta Beauty, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. Our team delivered improved performance for this quarter with better-than-expected sales and profitability.\nFor the quarter, net sales increased 1.7% to $2.5 billion and comparable sales increased 0.6%. Diluted EPS increased 1.4% to $5.14 per share. As we shared on our last call, we are navigating a number of headwinds, including the normalization of the U.S. beauty category a dynamic consumer environment and elevated competition, particularly in prestige beauty. We are starting to see benefit from actions we are taking to reinforce our market position and improve our performance. And while the headwinds have not abated, we are making progress. In the third quarter, our prestige market share trends improved, resulting in flat market share this quarter based on Circana data for the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024. The trend was driven primarily by improvements in makeup and hair and we continue to see strength in fragrance and skin care. Our share performance in mass beauty was consistent with the second quarter. Comp growth improved from the second quarter trend driven by stronger transaction trends across both stores and e-commerce channels. We continue to expand our loyalty program, ending the quarter with 44.4 million active members, 5% more than last year. We continued to convert new members. We reactivated more lapsed members and we improved existing member retention. Our marketing strategies to support our tent pole events and drive relevance and buzz delivered double-digit growth in earned media value and stronger sentiment. And we made progress to optimize our new ERP system and help our teams adapt to new processes, balance inventories across the network and deliver a better guest experience. Our teams are working hard to strengthen our market position, and I want to thank all of our associates for continuing to deliver great guest experiences while working collaboratively to drive improved performance in a dynamic operating environment.\nTurning to performance by category. Fragrance was our strongest category, delivering high single-digit comp growth, driven by men's fragrance, gender-neutral fragrances and new products, including new fall and holiday gift sets. The growth of men's fragrance was fueled primarily by newness from Armani and YSL and the appeal of established franchises from Jean Paul Gaultier and Valentino. Consumer interest in gender-neutral sense is increasing, and our assortment, including Billie Eilish and Noise and exclusive fragrance launched this summer is driving guest engagement. New women's brands, Kylie Jenner and Orebella, both exclusive to Ulta Beauty and new women's fragrances from Valentino, YSL and NEST also contributed to overall category growth. The skin care category delivered mid-single-digit comp growth this quarter as strong growth in body care was partially offset by a decline in prestige skin care. MA skin care was flat. The strong performance of body care was driven in large part by newer brand Sol de Janeiro, which continues to engage guests with exciting innovation and exclusivity and Touchland, which introduced compelling newness. In prestige skincare, newness from brands Ole Hendrickson, Shiatsu, Dime Beauty and others resonated with guests while engagement from Naturium, Bubble and La Roche Posay deliver growth in the mass skincare category. Comp sales in the makeup category decreased in the low single-digit range, driven primarily by softness in mass mega. Strong growth from recently relaunched Ulta Beauty Collection was offset by certain brands lapping space expansion, strong innovation or social media engagement last year. Prestige makeup was flat. New prestige brands, Charlotte Tilbury, Eliot Beauty and Dibs Beauty resonated with guests and compelling product newness, combined with in-store investments, delivered growth for established brands, Mac and Clinique. Promotional events during the quarter, including 21 Days of Beauty and Fall Haul performed well, driving growth for several makeup bans, while our engaging Wicked collaboration was well received highlighted by exclusive brand, R.E.M. Beauty. Comp sales for the hair care category also decreased in the low single-digit range. Exciting newness from Matrix, Way, Divi and Odele delivered growth for the category, while Redken continued to drive healthy guest engagement with their Hero product lines. In hair tools, new products from Shark Beauty and Dyson resonated with guests. This growth was offset by softness in key brands with expanded distribution and limited newness this year.\nOur Services business delivered low single-digit comp growth, primarily driven by engagement in core services, including color, styling and hair treatments. Ear piercing and makeup services also performed well, and our salon back bar takeovers, which get stylists an opportunity to introduce brands to guests continue to drive product attachment and new gas acquisition for participating brands. We are seeing improvements in our business, and we are focused on strengthening our market position and performance further. In October, we shared our refreshed strategic framework designed to lean into our existing strengths while also driving innovation to meet the evolving needs of beauty enthusiasts. As the beauty destination of a lifetime, we intend to drive profitable growth and market share leadership in beauty and wellness over the longer term through curating the best of all things beauty and wellness for all beauty enthusiasts fostering authentic empowering human connections that inspire, delight and engage at every touch point, engaging our guests wherever they want to shop by expanding our reach through seamless and immersive omnichannel experiences and building lifelong loyalty and brand bluff through member growth and personalization. We are confident our focus on these foundational areas will drive stronger revenue and earnings growth over the long term. And in the near term, we are addressing key areas to reinforce our competitive position.\nLet me share some highlights of the progress made this quarter, starting with our efforts to strengthen our assortment. We are enhancing our brand portfolio to drive category growth. During the third quarter, we launched new makeup brands, Eliot Beauty, Dibs Beauty and R.M.S. Beauty as well as emerging skincare brand, Oak Essentials. Additionally, we expanded our wellness offerings with emerging brands, the Honeypot and Joylocks. Looking ahead, we have an exciting pipeline of brand launches planned for the fourth quarter. including the recently announced prestige skincare brand, Tatcha, celebrated for balancing timeless Japanese botanicals with proven clinical ingredients, XO Chloe, an exclusive fragrance brand created by Khloe Kardashian and Apothe-Carrie, an emerging wellness brand. In addition to new brands, we launched 2 exciting exclusive collaborations this quarter. First, as the exclusive beauty retail partner with NBC Universal Pictures for the movie wicket, we worked with the key brand -- with key brands to develop a limited edition collection of products across multiple price points and categories. The Wicked-inspired collection features products from leading brands, including R.E.M. Beauty by Ariana Grande and Beekman 1802, both of which are exclusive to Ulta Beauty as well as OPI and Scuncry, among others. With immersive in-store experiences and engaging displays, Wicked came to life in Ulta Beauty stores through our digital channels and through Ulta Beauty at Target. Second, we launched an exclusive and a disruptive beauty offering of the beloved Mini Brands, which offers miniature versions of popular consumer brands. This first-ever beauty Mini Brands collection includes 68 tiny replicas of best-selling products from 13 brands, including e.l.f., Nyx, Drybar and Supergoop!. Both of these unique collaborations are driving strong sales awareness, traffic and engagement, especially with Gen Z and millennial members. As we discussed at our recent Investor Day, engaging guest experiences drive differentiation, loyalty and meaningful business value, and we are focused on creating authentic, personalized experiences across all our channels.\nIn Q3, we hosted more than 13,000 in-store events, including unique celebrity and brand founder events, multi-branded events and skin care-focused events. We also expanded our salon event, the workshop to more stores and invited guests to learn how to create salon worthy blowouts while receiving customized coaching and personalized recommendations from our talented in-store stylists. We are enhancing our digital experiences to drive traffic and sales. During the quarter, key online activations drove guest engagement and our expanded sampling program delivered double-digit sales growth. Our digital merchandising strategies, including enhanced search, guided navigation and enriched product pages drove conversion and our site optimization efforts are improving the guest experience and delivering stronger conversion trends.\nImportantly, we continue to drive increased app adoption. In the third quarter, we saw double-digit growth in member engagement with the app, which accounted for about 2/3 of our e-commerce sales in Q3, up about 600 basis points from last year. We continue to introduce new digital experiences and resources to drive discovery and trial. This quarter, we enhanced our suite of virtual try-on and AI-enabled skin and hair analysis experiences with the launch of GLAMlab 2.0, which includes a new 3D engine to enhance precision and stability, shoppable makeup looks and a new user interface that includes sharing capabilities. We also launched new digital buying guides that amplify search engine optimization, while providing guests with educational content, beauty tips and product recommendations. To deepen the meaningful connection we have with beauty enthusiasts, we launched UB Community, a welcoming inclusive digital form for guests to connect, learn, empower and engage in the immersive world of beauty to foster authentic connections. Launched in October, our community amplifies the intersection of beauty, wellness and joy, and our user count is already 3x our initial target, confirming the meaningful role Ulta Beauty plays in our members' lives. With more than 44 million active members, Ulta Beauty Rewards is an unmatched strategic asset that provides us with unique consumer insights to drive sales.\nIn Q3, we expanded personalization across digital channels with enhanced product recommendations replenish your reminders, site experiences and retargeted and social channels. Leaning into targeted life cycle campaigns in both owned and paid channels, we reactivated members with greater efficiency. Additionally, we grew our platinum and diamond member base, leveraging unique incentives like exclusive and early access to key events and brain launches, gifting and personalized offers that drive engagement. Platinum and diamond members shop more frequently and spend more each visit and continue to retain at best-in-class rates. Increasingly, social relevance drives authentic customer connection and brand advocacy, especially in beauty, and we're evolving to position social at the center of our marketing strategies to accelerate browse and earned media value growth.\nDuring the third quarter, we leveraged our marketing and social capabilities to lean into emerging trends, amplify key growth brands and activate new trend-focused events. We also engage talent from our UB Collective, our affiliate program, and Ulta Beauty's, our new associate ambassador program as well as key brand founders to support key brand launches, exclusive collaborations and tent pole events in new and innovative ways across social channels to drive guest bus and engagement. Efforts delivered accelerated EMV growth, increased impression and expanded key brand health metrics. We continue to enhance our product capabilities to grow our retail media network, UB Media. We recently partnered with e-commerce tech company, Rocket, to introduce AI non-endemic ads for products and services outside the beauty category, and we are partnering with Roblox, the ultimate virtual universe to create innovative advertising opportunities for our partners. Over the years, our Ultaverse has grown into one of the largest beauty games on Roblox, attracting over 11 million visits. With growing interest from beauty brands to participate in our Ultraverse we're unlocking new possibilities at the intersection of gaming, innovation and media to bring those brands to life in exciting new ways through our UB media capabilities.\nNow leveraging lessons in the second quarter, we continue to evolve and tailor our promotional strategies to reiterate our value offering and drive sales and traffic. We began the quarter with a new hair event showcasing the glossy hair trend, replacing last year's fall Gorgeous Hair band, this event featured a strong promo offer, new and exclusive items from Dyson and a spotlight on glass and shine products. especially strong in stores, the new event exceeded our expectations and drove strong results for participating brands.\nAt the end of August, we brought back our beloved 21 Days of Beauty event, new beauty steals, member-only events and bonus offers, combined with robust marketing and social support, 21 Days of Beauty delivered strong growth versus last year's event. We wrapped up the quarter with a successful Fall Haul event, which drove mass engagement and new member acquisition with compelling offers that surprised and delighted guests. In addition to strengthening and evolving our merchandising tent pole events, we optimized our loyalty offers, proactively pending the timing type and target audience of these offers. As a result, our promotional effectiveness improved from the first half trend.\nShifting now to our plans and expectations for holiday. The formal holiday season is in full flight. And while we're encouraged by our performance through Cyber Monday, we have several significant holiday sales weeks still ahead. While consumers continue to spend, our insights suggest that economic concerns are driving a greater focus on value. With our diverse assortment of products and price points, compelling offers and convenient omnichannel touch points, we are well positioned to support our guests as they celebrate the season and our teams are excited, engaged and ready to help them deliver a joyful holiday. Our holiday campaign this year is find joy in the present.

With the goal of driving deeper emotional engagement, our campaign is supported with robust integrated activation across media, member marketing, PR and social channels as well as festive experiences in stores and on our digital platforms. We have strategies in place to fortify our competitive positioning and manage through the compressed holiday selling season. We are transforming our channels into a concierge for all things holiday providing greater value to consumers with real-time beauty solutions, gift guides and tips tailored to our guests' needs and creating fund experiences that drive awareness and make Ulta Beauty the go-to destination for the holidays.\nOur merchandising team has created an exciting holiday assortment, with a strong focus on newness and exclusives balanced with value-driven holiday kits and core items that make great gifts.

I am confident we are well positioned to deliver another successful holiday season.\nIn summary, I am encouraged by the improving trends we are seeing in the business and optimistic about our holiday plans. We believe the beauty category will remain resilient, and we are confident the actions we are taking to deliver stronger performance combined with our outstanding associates who are committed to offering guests authentic inclusive experiences across all of our touch points will enable us to reinforce our market position and drive long-term profitable growth.\nNow before Paula discusses our financial results, I want to share that Monica Arnaudo, Chief Merchandising Officer, has announced her plan to retire from Ulta Beauty in the spring of 2025. Since joining Ulta Beauty in 2017, Monica has built an outstanding team and elevated our assortment in ways that have helped us deliver remarkable sales and market share growth. while furthering our mission to be our guests most loved beauty destination. I want to thank Monica for everything she has contributed as a member of our executive team and for the impact she has had on our organization. While we work to identify Monica a successor, she is fully committed to supporting her team and Ulta Beauty with a successful transition.\nAnd now I will turn the call over to Paula for a discussion of the financial results. Paula?\n\nPaula Oyibo\n\nSenior Vice President of Finance\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to echo Dave's sentiments and congratulate Monica. Monica has been a trusted leader in steadfast ambassador of our brands, and we are so grateful for all of our contributions. .\nNow turning to our financials. I'll begin with a discussion of our third quarter financial results and then provide more color on our fourth quarter and full year expectations. For the third quarter, we delivered better-than-expected performance across the P&L, reflecting stronger top line growth, continued financial discipline and expense management and favorable shrink trends. Net sales for the quarter increased 1.7%, sales contribution from new stores and a 0.6% increase in comp sales was partially offset by lower other revenue. During the quarter, we opened 28 new stores, closed 2 stores and remodeled 27 stores. The comp sales increase was driven by a 0.5% increase in transactions and a 0.1% increase in average ticket. Other revenue declined $5 million to $48 million, primarily due to an increase in deferred revenue related to our loyalty program, driven by the expansion of our member engagement efforts, which were partially offset an increase in income from our credit card program.\nLooking at the cadence of sales throughout the quarter. Comp sales in August decreased slightly primarily due to a shift in timing of our semiannual 21 Days of Beauty event, which resulted in stronger comp performance in September. October trends were positive but softened compared to the previous period. From a channel perspective, our e-commerce channel delivered mid-single-digit sales growth. The sales trend in comp stores improved from the second quarter, decreasing modestly compared to last year.\nFor the quarter, gross margin decreased 20 basis points to 39.7% compared to 39.9% last year. The decline was primarily due to deleverage of fixed costs and lower other revenue, which was partially offset by favorable channel mix due to lower e-commerce shipping costs and lower shrink. Lower revenue growth resulted in deleverage of store and supply chain fixed costs. Additionally, more new store openings and the expansion of our supply chain network pressured these areas. As a percentage of sales, inventory shrink was lower than last year. Our investments in secure fragrance fixtures combined with new inventory management processes and enhanced training for our field teams are helping us control inventory shrink. Year-to-date, shrink as a percentage of sales is roughly flat with last year, and we continue to expect shrink will be flat for the full year. Merchandise margin was flat with lower inventory reserves primarily related to the relaunch of LTD collection, offset by unfavorable brand mix.\nMoving to expenses. SG&A increased 3.2% to $682 million. Overall, SG&A spend was better than planned again this quarter, primarily due to focused expense management. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased 40 basis points to 27% compared to 26.6% last year, reflecting lower top line growth, most expenses deleveraged this quarter. In addition, SG&A deleverage, primarily due to higher store payroll and benefits, primarily due to higher average wage rates and higher corporate overhead, primarily due to strategic investments. These pressures were partially offset by lower incentive compensation, reflecting operational performance that was below our internal targets. Depreciation was $67 million for the quarter compared to $61 million last year, primarily due to new store and supply chain investments. Operating profit decreased 2.7% to $318.5 million. As a percentage of sales, operating margin was 12.6% of sales compared to 13.1% of sales last year, and diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 1.4% to $5.14 compared to $5.07 last year.\nMoving to the balance sheet and our capital allocation priorities. We ended the quarter with $178 million in cash and cash equivalents and $200 million in short-term debt. Similar to third quarter last year, we drew on our revolving credit facility during the quarter to support working capital needs and ongoing capital allocation priorities, including share repurchases and capital expenditures. Total inventory increased 1.9% to $2.4 billion compared to $2.3 billion last year. The increase was primarily due to the impact of 63 net new stores. Year-to-date, through the third quarter, we generated $302 million in operating cash flow. Capital expenditures were $114 million for the quarter, primarily reflecting investments in new and existing stores, IT investments and merchandise fixtures. In the third quarter, we returned $267 million of capital to our shareholders through the repurchase of 731,000 shares. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.9 billion remaining under our $3 billion share repurchase program we announced at our investor meeting in October.\nNow turning to our outlook. We have refined our sales and EPS guidance for the fiscal -- for fiscal 2024 to reflect our third quarter results, while continuing to take a cautious view of the consumer and operating environment. We expect net sales for the year will be between $11.1 billion and $11.2 billion, with comp sales growth between negative [ 1 ] and flat. For the year, we continue to plan to open approximately 60 to 65 net new stores and remodel or relocate 40 to 45 stores. We expect operating margin will be between 12.9% and 13.1% of net sales, with deleverage to come from both gross margin and SG&A, reflecting our top line expectations. Reflecting these assumptions, we now expect diluted EPS for the year will be between $23.20 and $23.75.\nWith 1 quarter left in the year, I want to share how we are thinking about Q4. While we are encouraged by our third quarter results and our performance quarter-to-date, we also acknowledge that the fourth quarter will likely be impacted by a compressed holiday season, a dynamic operating environment and continued uncertainty around underlying consumer demand. For Q4 modeling purposes, we expect comp sales will decline in the low single-digit range and operating margin will be between 11.6% and 12.4%.\nOne final update. We have updated our capital expenditure expectations for the full year and now expect to spend between $400 million and $425 million in CapEx in fiscal 2024, including approximately $230 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures; $130 million for supply chain and IT; and about $50 million for store maintenance and others.\nIn closing, we know it will take time to see the full benefits from our efforts, but we remain confident that our go-to-market strategies and investments along with continued operational and financial discipline will enable us to drive stronger sales and value creation over the long term.\nAnd now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session.",

Before I dive into the key drivers of our performance, I want to touch on what we're seeing across the beauty and consumer landscape.\nEngagement with beauty and wellness remains healthy. The growth of the U.S. beauty category has been fairly stable with low single-digit growth in mass and mid-single-digit growth in prestige beauty during the second quarter, according to [indiscernible] Our insights suggest consumers continue to prudently manage their day-to-day spending and are watchful of pricing trends in response to tariffs.

And we are driving connection with the beauty enthusiast by strengthening Ulta Beauty's cultural relevance with unique activations at Catella and lalapluzab and serving as the official beauty retail partner of the Kelway Carter tour, a powerful collaboration featuring curated beauty looks exclusive product assortments and worse brand experiences across beyond Phase 2 markets in the U.S.\nAs beauty continues to move at the speed of culture, we're keeping pace with strong social media engagement and trend-forward content that is engaging and relevant to our consumers, resulting in meaningful growth in unaided awareness brand engagement and earned media value. At Ulta Beauty, we celebrate the transformative power of beauty and wellness inspiring self-expression, empowerment, well-being and connection. We believe that beauty goes beyond the surface. It's really what radiates from within. This belief fuels our purpose to unlock the possibilities within each of us through beauty and wellness. We have been on a journey to bring this purpose to life, creating emotional connections, building trust and shaping a brand that truly champions and celebrates every guest, all ages and life stages.\nThis fall, we will take the next full step with our multiyear brand platform. Beauty Happens Here celebrated by the debut of our new brand campaign. It begins with a powerful declaration, we are beautiful, an inspiring way to share that Ulta Beauty is where beauty lives, and when we inspire our guests and connect with our guests, beauty spreads to others, making the world a more beautiful place. Stay tuned for more in the coming weeks.\nTurning to our long-term strategy to enhance our assortment and brand building capabilities. We're focused on launching, building, scaling and globalizing brands to strengthen our position as the partner of choice for B and wellness brands. We continue to make exciting progress in enhancing our assortment and merchandising approach. During the quarter, we launched 24 new brands, many of which are exclusive to Ulta Beauty newly launched brands like [indiscernible] Beauty are driving excitement for our guests. At the same time, our exclusive brands, including Cécred, SNF, Half Magic, Live Tinted, DIBS are all driving growth and market share. And there is more to come.\nOur merchants are hard at work to ensure that we complement the strength of our existing core assortment with the hottest new brands and innovation in beauty and wellness. This includes the introduction of Moroccan Oil, a fan favorite was launched in stores and online this week. We continue to lead the market in body care, and we are excited for Tracy Elis Ross's entry antibody care with Pattern Body launching first at Ulta Beauty and for the debut of new skin line, Venti Skin Buddy, which will launch exclusively at Ulta Beauty in a few short weeks.\nOur brand-building efforts are driving guest engagement and results, and we're optimistic about the new brand launches and activations planned for the rest of the year. Moving to digital and personalization. We are accelerating capabilities to deepen guest connection and drive performance. During the second quarter, we continued to expand automation in real-time delivery content enabling us to deliver a more personalized customer experience across key digital channels.\nNew features like Split Cart and recently launched Replenish and Save combined with personalized recommendations are removing friction, increasing reliance and driving measurable results. Taken together, these enhancements contributed to strong measurable results in e-commerce. We're leveraging our power as an Omnical retailer to deliver speed to guests and provide more choices in the way they shop.\nDuring Q2, half of e-commerce orders were fulfilled by the stores the highest rate we've ever recorded. Moving to our second strategic priority, the team made steady progress to scale new businesses to capitalize on key growth opportunities and ensure that we remain relevant in a rapidly changing world, beginning with our international expansion.\nWe reached a major milestone in our national journey with our entry into the U.K. market. As one of the largest beauty markets in the world, the U.K. represents an attractive market with a healthy growing beauty landscape. Our acquisition of the U.K. specialty beauty retailer, SpaceNK was a unique and strategically compelling opportunity to enter the growing U.K. market with an established and successful player, a top destination for beauty levers based on K operates 83 U.K. and Ireland stores and a vibrant online platform.\nSpaceNK will continue to operate as a stand-alone subsidiary with CEO, Andy Lightfoot and his team staying at the helm leading operations from the U.K. We see opportunities to leverage each other's strength, talent and expertise. And over the long term, we will focus on sharing best practices and transferring learnings between markets particularly around assortment, guest experience and scaling growth. Chris will share more about the financial details of the acquisition shortly.\nIn addition to our expansion in the U.K., we just celebrated the soft opening of our first Ulta Beauty store in Mexico with the grand opening to come in a few weeks and we remain on track to open our first store in the Middle East later this year. In wellness, we're focused on leveraging our position as a trusted leader to expand more meaningfully into wellness. Our goal is to establish ourselves as a one-stop shop for relevant products to support living a well-balanced lifestyle through improvements to the mine, body and spirit. During the second quarter, we launched several new wellness brands and expanded the in-store footprint of the wellness shop in about 370 stores.\nIn the third quarter, we will introduce a larger enhanced guest experience with elevated fixtures in 50 additional stores. Moving to our online marketplace initiative. Our merchandising vision is to create and inspire guests with the best beauty and wellness for all life stages. The Ulta Beauty marketplace, which we'll launch in the third quarter is a curated invitation-only online platform that allows guests to explore a broader and complementary array of beauty, wellness and lifestyle products on ulta.com from both established and emerging brands. This new platform will enable us to not only strengthen our existing category authority that go after new subcategories and trends to build incremental growth for our business.\nFinally, moving to our third strategic priority to realign our foundation for the future. Our culture is truly a differentiator for our business and we are on a journey to reenergize this critical competitive advantage. We know that stronger employee engagement leads to better customer experiences. We recently completed our annual culture survey, and I'm proud to share that our participation leads and results exceeded industry benchmarks. Associate engagement has increased across the enterprise, reflecting decisive steps that we've taken to streamline decision-making and power creativity and align our teams around guest-centric goals.\nWhile we always have work to do, we are proud of this progress and intend to build upon it. associates are the heart of our business, and I am proud of how our teams have embraced our Ulta Beauty unleash strategy and new ways of working and are leading through our values, all while keeping our guests at the center of all in do.\nFinally, earlier this month, we announced our mutual decision with Target not to extend our shop-in-shop partnership, which will conclude in August of 2026. The -- we've achieved a lot together, and we remain committed to supporting the shopping experience for guests through the end of the partnership as well as continuing to support our teams and partners during the transition.\nLooking forward, we believe the successful execution of our Ulta Beauty unleash strategy will maximize key growth opportunities in beauty and wellness and enable us to bring to life the Ulta Beauty experience in new ways and define the next chapter of growth for our brand. For perspective, the royalty revenue from our target partnership in fiscal 2024 was well below 1% of net sales.\nTo recap, we are proud of the steady progress we're making against our Ulta Beauty unleash strategy to accelerate our performance and lay the groundwork for sustained long-term growth. As we look to the future, we remain focused on controlling what we can control, executing our plans with excellence and building on our momentum to drive future growth.\nWhile we are pleased with our year-to-date performance and the level of engagement we've seen with beauty enthusiasts, we remain cautious in our approach to planning our business, given the rapidly evolving macro landscape and ongoing wallet pressures.\nI want to again thank our incredible associates for their hard work in delivering these results. Our results reaffirm my confidence in our team, strategy and business model and in our ability to deliver for our guests and create enduring profitable growth for our shareholders. I'll now turn it over to Chris to cover the financial results for the second quarter in our updated financial outlook before we take your questions. Chris?\n\nChris Lialios\n\nSenior VP, Interim CFO & Controller\n\nThanks, Kecia, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm honored to serve as interim CFO and and I'm grateful to Kecia and the Board for their trust and confidence. I'll begin my comments with a discussion of our second quarter results and then share how we are thinking about the rest of the year. Before we discuss the results, I want to remind you that we acquired SpaceNK on July 10.\nOur second quarter results include financial results for SpaceNK for the week since the transaction closed and preliminary estimates of the purchase consideration in fair value of SpaceNK's net assets. The acquisition was funded with cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facility and is not material to our consolidated financial statements.\nTurning now to the second quarter financial results. The Ulta Beauty team delivered strong performance this quarter, reflecting better-than-expected growth from comparable sales, favorable shrink results and merchandise margin expansion. Consolidated net sales for the quarter increased 9.3% to $2.8 billion compared to $2.6 billion last year.\nDuring the quarter, we opened 24 new stores, relocated 2 stores remodeled 5 stores and closed 2 stores. Comparable sales increased 6.7%, driven by a 3.7% increase in transactions and a 2.9% increase in average ticket. Other revenue was approximately flat versus the second quarter last year.\nLooking at the cadence of comp sales through the quarter. Growth was strongest in May and July primarily reflecting shifts in the timing of key promotional events. From a channel perspective, both store and digital channels contributed to control with e-commerce sales increasing in the low double-digit range, and comp sales delivering mid-single-digit growth.\nFor the quarter, consolidated gross margin increased 90 basis points to 39.2% of sales compared to 38.3% last year. The increase was largely due to lower inventory shrink and higher merchandise margin, which was partially offset by the deleverage of supply chain fixed costs and other revenue. Our team's collective focus on reducing inventory shrink while also improving merchandise in-stock levels continues to deliver results fixture investments, process improvements associate training and specific store level actions are driving improved trends.\nAnd I'm pleased to share that we've experienced shrink reductions across every category and every region. Merchandise margin increased primarily due to the impact of more effective promotional strategies. Similar to Q1, we continue to strengthen our go-to-market strategies. We optimized key events and offers to align with relevant shopping moments and provide guests with value.\nWe eliminated unproductive and overlapping offers to drive increased clarity, and we implemented new functionality such as replenish and save to drive greater engagement. As a result, the gross margin impact from promotional activity was lower than last year. Supply chain fixed costs increased, reflecting higher wage rates and higher depreciation and implementation costs associated with our ongoing supply chain optimization efforts.\nMoving to expenses. Consolidated SG&A increased 15% to [indiscernible] million, including approximately $7 million of onetime transaction expenses related to the acquisition of Space NK. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased 130 basis points to 26.6% compared to 25.3% last year, driven in large part by higher incentive compensation, store payroll and benefits and corporate overhead. Incentive compensation deleverage for the quarter, reflecting our better-than-planned second quarter performance as well as the lapping of a benefit from lower incentive compensation last year.\nStore payroll and benefit expense increased primarily due to higher health care costs and additional selling hours to support the guest experience. And the growth of corporate overhead largely reflects investments to support our Ulta Beauty unleash strategy.\nOperating profit increased 4.8% to $345 million compared to $329 million last year. As a percent of sales, operating margin decreased 50 basis points to 12.4% of sales compared to 12.9% last year. Wrapping up the P&L, diluted earnings per share increased 9.1% to $5.78 per share, including $0.03 of benefit due to income tax accounting for stock-based compensation.\nMoving to highlights from the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with $243 million in cash and cash equivalents and $289 million in short-term debt. During the quarter, we drew on our revolving credit facility, primarily to support the acquisition of Total inventory increased to $2.4 billion compared to $2 billion last year primarily reflecting additional inventory to support new brand launches, the impact of 62 net new stores and the acquisition of Space NK.\nCapital expenditures were $77 million for the quarter, mostly driven by investments in new existing stores. Depreciation increased 9% to $71 million compared to $65 million last year, largely reflecting supply chain and store investments. In the quarter, we repurchased 245,000 shares, bringing the year-to-date total for our share buyback program to 1.2 million shares or $468 million.\nAt the end of the quarter, we had $2.2 billion remaining under our current $3 billion repurchase authorization. Turning now to our updated outlook for 2025. We have increased guidance for the year to reflect our strong first half performance and the impact of Space NK, which was not contemplated in our previous forecast, reflecting the momentum we saw in the first half, we have increased our sales expectation for the second half, but we continue to believe it is prudent to take a cautious approach given continued uncertainty around consumer spending. We now expect consolidated net sales for the year will be between $12 billion and $12.1 billion, with comp sales growth in the range of 2.5% to 3.5%. This outlook reflects our expectation that comp sales will be in the range of flat to up low single digits in the second half.\nWe now expect operating profit for the year will decrease in the high single-digit range and operating margin will be between 11.9% and 12% of sales reflecting our updated sales expectations, higher incentive comp and how we are forecasting the flow of investment spend, we expect operating margin will be between 10.7% and 10.9% of sales for the second half of the year.\nFor modeling purposes, we continue to expect gross margin for the year will deleverage primarily driven by store occupancy and supply chain costs partially offset by lower shrink. We've updated our expectations for SG&A growth and now expect SG&A will increase between 13% and 14% for the year driven largely by higher incentive compensation, our strategic investments, including increased advertising and the addition of Space NK. We expect SG&A growth will be elevated in the second half reflecting both the shift of investment spending initially planned for the first half as well as the lapping of last year's expense trend.\nAs a reminder, SG&A grew 1% in the second half of fiscal 2024 as we proactively reduced planned spend in response to lower-than-expected revenue growth. Reflecting these assumptions, we now anticipate diluted EPS for the year will be between $23.85 and $24.30 per share. These EPS estimates include the impact of share repurchases and assume a tax rate of approximately 24%.\nIn closing, we remain focused on executing our Ulta Beauty Unleashed strategy and committed to investing in our operating model to position sustainable growth. We are encouraged by our first half performance but we remain cautious about how consumer demand may evolve in the second half of the year. As we look to the rest of fiscal 2025, we intend to invest to strengthen our competitive position to deliver long-term profitable growth while also continuing to be thoughtful about pacing and prioritization as the environment evolves.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce Ms. Kiley Rawlins, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rawlins, please proceed.\n\nKiley F. Rawlins\n\nVP - Investor Relations, Ulta Beauty, Inc.\n\nThank you, Sherry.

Kimbell\n\nPresident & Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer, Ulta Beauty, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kylie, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. For the first quarter, net sales increased 3.5% to $2.7 billion, and comp sales grew 1.6%. Operating profit was 14.7% of sales and diluted EPS was $6.47 per share. We expected comp growth this quarter would be in the low single-digit range as we lapped strong performance last year. I am proud of how our teams adjusted our go-to-market activity to adapt to a rapidly evolving marketplace, thoughtfully managed expenses across the enterprise and, importantly, continue to execute our transformational agenda with excellence.\nAs we look forward to the rest of the year, we believe it is prudent to anticipate a continuation of the dynamic environment we experienced in the first quarter and therefore have adjusted our expectations for the remainder of the year. Paula will give more detail on these revisions later in her prepared comments. Before we talk about the quarter, I want to emphasize a few important points. First, we are confident in our model and our ability to gain share and drive significant sustainable value over the long term. The actions we have taken and investments we have made over the past few years have fortified our operating foundation, and we are a stronger, more profitable company today than we were just a few years ago. And we have an outstanding team that knows how to execute and deliver profitably and they are doing so every day with focus, passion and determination.\nHowever, we are not satisfied with our market share trends, and we are taking actions to reinforce our leadership position and accelerate growth. For more than 30 years, Ulta Beauty has disrupted the beauty industry by bringing mass brands, prestige brands, luxury brands and services together in an accessible fun shopping environment. This differentiated strategy, combined with welcoming and inclusive guest experiences, has enabled us to shape consumer expectations and drive profitable growth.\nToday, we operate in nearly 1,400 stores and manage a multibillion-dollar digital business, providing guests with unique opportunities to play, discover and try beauty. With warm and authentic experiences, our passionate associates are creating strong emotional connections with our guests and helping them discover beauty on their own terms. We've created a world-class loyalty program that engages with more than 43 million active members and provides us with valuable customer and transaction data. And we've expanded our differentiated assortment and build strong strategic partnership with large and emerging brands around the world. We operate in a healthy growing category, while growth is moderating as expected after 3 years of unprecedented expansion and competitive intensity is increasing, we have a powerful operating model, excellent brand partnerships, and I believe the impact of our winning culture and outstanding teams will enable us to protect and expand our leadership position. In the first quarter, we've strengthened our market position in several areas.\nConsumer awareness and brand law for Ulta Beauty continues to increase. our marketing amplification of key brand launches, elevation of our [indiscernible] events and culturally relevant social activation delivered 4 points of improvement in unaided brand awareness this quarter, driven primarily by key growth cohorts. Trust for our expertise, welcoming guest experiences a diverse assortment and efforts to increase convenience through multiple touch points, drove our brand love metric to record levels with strong gains among both Gen X and baby boomers, which demonstrates the broad appeal of our model.\nNewness is resonating with our guests, recent brand launches, including [indiscernible], Charlotte Tilbury and exclusive brands win by Serena Williams and Kylie Jenner fragrance are driving sales, new member acquisition and member reengagement. We delivered traffic growth in both our store and digital channels. We increased marketing investments across TV, audio and social platforms to maximize our brand launches, support our semiannual beauty and spring haul [indiscernible] events and amplify our brand equity with the Joy project.\nThese strategic media investments drove higher traffic across our web and app platforms and increased traffic growth per store, even as we lapped strong double-digit growth last year. Our world-class loyalty program expanded again this quarter with the retention of our most valuable members remains very strong. We ended the quarter with 43.6 million Ulta Beauty Rewards members, 6% higher than last year, primarily driven by member retention.\nAdditionally, we continued to acquire new members and reengage lapsed members. Targeted marketing efforts are elevating more members to our platinum and diamond tiers and exclusive promotions, point accelerators and personalized contents are driving engagement and retention of these valuable members. Our new store portfolio continues to perform well. During the quarter, we opened 12 stores, 7 more than last year, and their performance exceeded our expectations.\nOur associate retention has improved across stores, distribution centers and our corporate teams. And we are on track to complete critical elements of our transformational agenda this year, giving us a stronger foundation for future growth. Our teams are operating at a high level as we execute these transitions, and it is worth noting that they delivered several significant operational milestones this quarter. First, we successfully completed the final phase of our digital store transition and are on track to decommission the legacy platform in the second quarter. Second, we completed an important phase of Project Store with a successful transition of our Dallas, Greenwood and Fresno distribution centers to our new ERP system.\nNow all of our primary distribution centers are operating on the same platform. Third, we began the process of migrating stores to our new ERP system, and I am pleased to share that we have completed the transition in 30% of our fleet. The benefits include an upgrade of a key digital application to provide our store teams with a guided user experience, enhanced reporting to support inventory management and increased visibility to product information to elevate the guest experience. Beauty is a competitive category, and our success reflects the differentiation we provide in the market and our effectiveness in creating meaningful and enduring guest connections.\nThese strengths have enabled us to outperform the market, especially through the pandemic recovery. According to Cercina data between 2019 and 2023, Ulta Beauty expanded its share of both prestige and mass beauty significantly. More recently, the strength of the beauty category, combined with an attractive margin profile has drawn significant and diverse competition to the category. Today, there are significantly more places to buy beauty, especially prestige beauty, with more than 1,000 new points of distribution opened in the last 2 years.\nAdditionally, Prestige brands are expanding their online availability as digital penetration grows in the category. As a result, our market share has been more challenged for the last few quarters, particularly within the prestige beauty category. Using the consumer lens of how guests experience Ulta Beauty through all of our touch points, we estimate we maintained our share of the total U.S. beauty product industry this quarter. Based on [indiscernible] data for the 13 weeks ended May 5, 2024, we outpaced the growth of the mass market, but lost share in prestige beauty, primarily driven by pressure in makeup and hair. This prestige share pressure was concentrated in stores as we increased share in e-com for the quarter. Given our proven ability to engage our guests and lead the industry, I am confident we can reinvigorate market share gains. At our Analyst Day in October, we will share longer-term plans to drive share growth.\nBut today, I want to highlight actions we are taking now to leverage our traffic growth, increase conversion and accelerate top line growth. Our plans are focused on 5 key areas: strengthening our assortment, accelerating our social relevance, enhancing our digital experience, leveraging our world-class loyalty program and evolving our promotional levers. Starting with our assortment. We are enhancing our assortment with the addition of highly recognized brands as well as emerging and exclusive brands. This year, our brand pipeline includes more than 25 new brands, including many exclusive to Ulta Beauty. Importantly, this year's pipeline includes a balanced mix of category growth driving brands like [indiscernible] and Charlotte Tilbury and [indiscernible] and emerging exclusive brands like Win and makeup brand developed by Serena Williams and Arabella, a fragrance band developed by Bella Hadid.\nTo support stronger growth of our core assortment, we plan to accelerate growth with key exclusive brands, including Polite society, libtented and Lola, among others. We plan to expand key growth-driving brands into more stores, and we are excited to relaunch the Ulta Beauty Collection this summer. Additionally, we intend to leverage our marketing and social capabilities to lean into emerging trends, amplify key growth brands and drive relevance and engagement and activate new trend-focused events across all our channels. Social media is amplifying and accelerating Beauty. Social relevance is the gateway to customer reach, connection and engagement and relevance to drive sales and loyalty. While we have increased our EMV and share of voice across key platforms, including TikTok and Instagram, we see further opportunity to ensure we are at the heart of the social and cultural conversation for beauty.\nTo accelerate our social relevance, we will scale our creator network, amplify brand networks and collaborations and use our platforms to showcase our unique assortment. With the completion of our digital store transition, we are increasing our focus on leveraging new capabilities and optimizing the guest experience to accelerate traffic, drive conversion and increase average ticket. We recently expanded our partnership with DoorDash with our launch on DoorDash marketplace, which extends our unique assortment to the more than 70 million active users of the DoorDash app. We will introduce new digital buying guides that amplify search engine optimization while providing guests with educational content, beauty tips and product recommendations. We will improve the path to purchase through guided navigation and leverage new innovative search capabilities to facilitate discovery and we will accelerate app adoption through targeted communication and offers as app users spend nearly 2x more. In the first quarter, our app accounted for 57% of our e-commerce sales, up more than 450 basis points compared to last year.\nOur loyalty program is a powerful strategic asset, and we will lean into this platform to drive greater engagement and support top line growth. Earlier this year, we rebranded the program to Ulta Beauty Rewards, enhance the birthday experience and launched a refreshed look in stores, online and across social. These improvements are driving greater awareness and deepen connections with our members. We have also introduced new mobile POS capabilities to engage existing members and drive new member acquisition, and we are testing new ways for guests to engage with loyalty benefits in store transactions. At the same time, we are leaning in to amplify the value of the program through member love events and social engagement, and we are also testing new gamification platforms, creating new ways to engage with our program and Ulta Beauty. And later this year, we will activate new marketing technology that will advance our personalization efforts with our guests. Finally, we continue to enhance our promotional events and strategies. We will evolve our unique temple events to drive basket and new member acquisition and try [indiscernible] less productive offers, and to create new platforms and offers to excite and engage our guests. In closing, we continue to expect the beauty category will grow in the mid-single-digit range this year, barring a major economic event. We are confident we have identified the right actions to deliver stronger revenue growth, and our associates are working together as one unified Ulta Beauty team to expand our leadership position and deliver engaging guest experiences across all our touch points. I look forward to sharing our progress with you throughout the year.\nAnd now I will turn the call over to Paula for a discussion of the financial results. Paula?\n\nPaula Oyibo\n\nSenior Vice President of Finance\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave shared, our team responded to the dynamic operating environment with focus and financial discipline. As a result, we delivered net income and diluted EPS in line with our internal expectations. We are focused on reinforcing our leadership position and driving stronger performance. And while we believe our efforts will deliver results, we think it is prudent to expect many of the pressures we identified in phase throughout the first quarter, may continue for the balance of the year and, therefore, have revised our annual guidance. .\nI'll begin with a discussion of our first quarter results, followed by comments about our updated full year outlook. Net sales for the quarter increased 3.5%, driven by 1.6% growth in comp sales. The contribution from 36 net new stores opened since the first quarter last year and a $9 million increase in other revenue, primarily due to an increase in credit card income and growth in royalty income from our target partnership.\nComp transactions for the quarter increased 1.3%, driven by traffic growth in stores and on our digital platforms. Average ticket increased 0.3%. Looking at the cadence of sales throughout the quarter. Comp sales in February decreased slightly as we lapped strong double-digit comps last year. Comp growth accelerated in March, reflecting the impact of our semi angle beauty event and the benefit of the Easter shift. April trends were positive but softened compared to March, primarily reflecting the adverse impact of the Easter shift.\nFrom a channel perspective, e-commerce sales increased in the high single-digit range. Sales from comp stores were flat compared to last year, reflecting the expansion of brick-and-mortar distribution points and the lapping of strong comp growth last year. Turning to comp sales performance by category. Fragrance delivered double-digit growth driven by newness from existing brands and exciting brand launches, including Cosmic, from Kylie Jenner, which is exclusive to Ulta Beauty. Additionally, Valentine's Day drove strong growth across both men and women's fragrances. The skin care category delivered mid-single-digit comp growth this quarter, primarily driven by double-digit growth in body care and mass skincare, which was partially offset by a decline in prestige skin care.\nThe strong performance of Body Care was driven primarily by the launch of [indiscernible] and the expansion of key emerging brands into additional Ulta Beauty stores. The growth of mass skincare was primarily due to strong engagement with our dermatologist recommended platform as well as the expansion of in-store presentations of select emerging brands. Our Prestige business was challenged this quarter, reflecting the impact of increased distribution for key plans, timing shifts of product movements and the lapping of the impact of strong social media engagement with certain brands last year.\nTarte comp sales increased to low single-digit range. primarily due to [indiscernible] and care tools, the inclusion of Prestige haircare in our semiannual beauty event and high engagement with mass hair care products during our spring fall event. Makeup comp sales decreased to mid-single-digit range. While new brands and guest engagements with our luxury platform was strong, this growth was more than offset by sales decreases from brands that experienced extraordinary growth last year. Newness from existing brands that did not meet expectations and increased points of distribution. In addition, sales of the Ulta Beauty Collection were impacted by planned markdowns as we prepare to relaunch the brand this summer. Finally, the strength of our services business continued with high single-digit comp growth in the quarter, driven by increases in hair treatment, specialty services, including ear piercing, [indiscernible] and makeup and core salon cut and color services. For the quarter, gross margin decreased 80 basis points to 39.2% compared to 40% last year. This decrease was primarily due to lower merchandise margins and higher inventory shrink, which were partially offset by growth in other revenue. Merchandise margin declined during the quarter, primarily due to increased promotions, adverse impacts from brand mix and the lapping of benefits from price increases last year.\nPromotional activity in the quarter was higher than last year, reflecting the expansion of our semiannual beauty event and incremental offers to drive traffic. Inventory shrink was higher in the quarter. Our investments in new fixtures and operating processes are reducing shrink in the fragrance category, but this improvement is being offset by higher shrink in other prestige categories. Moving to expenses. SG&A increased 8.8% to $666 million. Overall, SG&A spend was better than planned due to disciplined expense management. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased 120 basis points to 24.4% compared to 23.2% last year. In addition to the impact of lower top line growth, higher corporate overhead, store share roll and benefits and store expenses contributed to the deleverage in the quarter.\nCorporate overhead expense increased in the quarter, primarily due to technology-related strategic investments. The increase in store payroll and benefits was driven primarily by higher average wage rates and the increase in store expenses was primarily due to IT investments and increased testers. Operating margin was 14.7% of sales compared to 16.8% of sales last year. Net interest income for the quarter was $6.9 million compared to $7.3 million last year.\nLower average cash balances were partially offset by the benefit of higher average interest rates. The company's tax rate increased to 23.2% compared to 22.8% in the first quarter last year. The higher effective tax rate is primarily due to less benefit from income tax accounting for stock-based compensation. For the quarter, diluted GAAP [indiscernible] earnings per share was $6.47 compared to $6.88 last year.\nNow moving to the balance sheet and capital allocation. We ended the quarter with $524.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. Total inventory increased 8.8% to $1.9 billion compared to $1.8 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 36 new stores, the increase was primarily due should inventory needed to support new plans and our new market fulfillment center in [indiscernible], South Carolina.\nCapital expenditures were $91 million for the quarter, reflecting investments in merchandise fixtures, new and existing stores and IT investments. Depreciation was $64.7 million compared to $57.9 million last year, primarily due to higher depreciation related to new stores and IT investments. In the first quarter, we returned $285.1 million of capital to our shareholders through the repurchase of 588,000 shares. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.8 billion remaining under our current $2 billion of repurchase popularization. Now turning to our outlook. We have updated our expectations for the full year to reflect our first quarter performance, the dynamic operating environment and the actions we are taking to drive stronger top line growth.\nWith this in mind, we currently expect net sales to be between $11.5 billion to $11.6 billion, with comp sales growth in the range of 2% to 3%. We continue to expect comp growth to be in the low single-digit range in the first half of the year. We expect comp growth to accelerate in the second half of the year to be between 2% and 4%. Reflecting the impact of our sales driving initiatives, our [indiscernible] pipeline and decelerating growth in the second half of last year. We hardly expect operating margin to be between 13.7% and 14% of net sales, primarily driven by SG&A deleverage as we protect sales driving investments, including marketing and store labor. Complete many of the elements of our transformational agenda and operationalize assets made in 2023. We will also continue to maintain our financial discipline. For the full year, we now expect SG&A growth to be in the mid- to high single-digit range, with growth in the low double-digit range in the first half of the year and in the low to mid-single-digit range in the second half of the year. We expect gross margin for the year to be down modestly as lower merchandise margin and deleverage of fixed costs are mostly offset by lower supply chain costs and other revenue growth. For modeling purposes, we anticipate gross margin will deleverage in the first half of the year, primarily driven by lower merchandise margins, deleverage of fixed costs due to lower sales and higher shrink, partially offset by growth of other revenue.\nIn the second half of the year, we expect gross margin to be flat to up modestly as higher merchandise margin and lower supply chain costs offset deleverage of fixed costs. As a result, we now anticipate diluted EPS to be in the range of $25.20 to $26 per share. We expect diluted EPS to be time in the first half of the year and be flat to up modestly in the second half of the year, including the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2023. which was $181.9 million of net sales and $0.46 of diluted EPS. Finally, we continue to expect to repurchase $1 billion of Ulta Beauty stock this year, reflecting the strength of our cash flow and the confidence we have in our future. And now I'll turn the call back over to Dave. Dave?\n\nDavid C. Kimbell\n\nPresident & Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer, Ulta Beauty, Inc.\n\nBefore we begin the Q&A session, I'd like to recap our perspective on the first quarter and reiterate our confidence in our plans. Love for the Ulta Beauty brand is growing. Our member retention is strong, and our teams are laser-focused on delivering great guest experiences while managing through an evolving environment. We are pleased with the progress we are making across key areas of our business, and we are taking steps to drive stronger performance through strengthening our assortment, expanding our relevance, enhancing our digital experience leveraging our world-class loyalty program and evolving our promotional levers. We have a strong plan in place to navigate near-term pressures while continuing to invest in support of the long-term opportunity.\nI am confident in the power of our differentiated business model and our team's ability to execute with excellence against our priorities and deliver value for our shareholders. Ulta Beauty is a force in the beauty industry as we captured a large share of this dynamic category, and I am as optimistic as ever about the future of our business. And now I'll turn the call over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session.",

Kimbell\n\nPresident & Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer, Ulta Beauty, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. The Ulta Beauty team delivered strong performance again this quarter with sales, operating margin and EPS, all exceeding our internal expectations. Our traffic trends remained healthy. Our brand awareness reached all-time highs, and we drove strong member growth and retention. For the quarter, net sales increased 10.2% to $3.6 billion. Operating profit was 14.5% of sales, and diluted EPS was $8.08 per share.\nComparable sales increased 2.5%, driven by high single-digit growth from digital channels. Store comp sales increased slightly as we lapped high-teen growth last year. A thoughtfully curated assortment, engaging marketing strategies and new fulfillment and technology capabilities, enabled our teams to deliver mid-single-digit comp growth for the holiday period. Our holiday campaign this year centered around the gift is just the beginning, which underscored our belief in the power of Beauty and Ulta Beauty.\nTo support the campaign, we created relevant storytelling, which inspired authentic connection, leading to record breaking impressions, significant growth in share of voice and strong social engagement. These successful marketing efforts complemented our engaging in-store messaging and events, which focused on bringing beautytainment to guests and building the basket. Compelling content, combined with successful promotional strategies, drove strong new member acquisition and reactivation while increasing shopping frequency and retention.\nFrom a market share perspective, we continue to outpace the growth of the mass market for the 14 weeks ended February 3, 2024, according to Circana data. Our marketing share -- our market share of Prestige Beauty was more challenged as we lapped strong share growth in 2022 and continue to face pressure from the expansion of distribution points in Prestige. While competitive intensity has increased, we remain confident our differentiated model and sales-driving strategies will support our ability to capture additional market share over the long term.\nTurning to performance by category. Skincare was our fastest-growing category, delivering double-digit comp growth. Brands leading into relevant trends like BIOMA, Bubble and Good Molecules, which is exclusive to Ulta Beauty, delivered strong growth. Dermatologist-recommended brands also continue to appeal to consumers looking for efficacious products from trusted brands, fueling growth for La Roche-Posay, Dermalogica and Cetaphil.\nThe fragrance and bath category also delivered low double-digit comp growth again this quarter. Newness from Valentino, Burberry and Tree Hut, and holiday gift sets from consumer favorites, YSL, Gucci and Billie Eilish contributed to strong performance. In addition, in January, we welcomed Sol de Janeiro, a Brazilian-inspired body care brand to the Ulta Beauty family. Available in 700 stores and online, Sol de Janeiro has quickly become a guest favorite driving growth in the category.\nComp sales for the makeup category decreased in the low single-digit range. Softness in prestige cosmetics was partially offset by growth in mass makeup. Lip layering and blush proliferation continue to resonate with beauty enthusiasts and brands leaning into these trends, including e.l.f. and exclusive brand, Juvia's Place, delivered strong growth.\nWhile prestige makeup was challenged in totality as we lapped strong growth last year, luxury brands, Dior, Natasha Denona and Pat McGrath continue to engage guests and HOURGLASS, Tarte and Lancôme saw success with compelling holiday offerings. Finally, comp sales for the hair care category decreased in the mid-single-digit range, primarily due to a decline in hair tools and the lapping of strong brand launches in 2022.\nProducts focused on silane and foundational routines drove growth for professional brands, Redken, Kenra and Biolage, and interest in hair health and treatments drove increased guest engagement with [indiscernible] and Divi. Newer brands, including Shark Beauty and also resonated with guests. Our services businesses delivered high single-digit growth for this quarter, driven by an increase in transactions.\nIn addition to core styling services, specialty offerings, including extensions, hair treatments, texture services and ear piercing, drove strong engagement with guests. Turning now to the full year. Net sales for the year increased 9.8% to $11.2 billion, comp sales increased 5.7%, operating profit was 15% of sales and diluted EPS increased 8.4% to a record $26.3 per share.\nIn addition to delivering strong financial results, we also made meaningful progress against our strategic priorities. Let me share highlights of advances made this year. Reflecting our efforts to drive growth through all things beauty, we strengthened our assortment with compelling newness and the expansion of strategic cross-category platforms. Using the consumer lens of how guests experience Ulta Beauty through all of our touch points, we estimate we maintained our share of the total U.S. beauty product industry.\nWe launched customer favorite brands, including Dior, Beautycounter and Sol de Janeiro and introduced emerging and exclusive brands, including Half Magic and Polite Society. We launched Luxury at Ulta Beauty, a strategically curated luxury beauty experience, and we expanded our cross-category platforms. We ended the year with more than half of our brand portfolio certified in at least 1 conscious beauty pillar and continue to drive greater awareness and discovery through unique sample kits and greater marketing support.\nWe expanded our black-owned or founded brands to 50 brands, and welcome to the second cohort of brands to our Accelerator Program, a program designed to help early-stage brands prepare for retail readiness. Additionally, we expanded the wellness shop to nearly all stores and refresh the presentation to inspire and educate guests how to integrate wellness into their everyday lives.\nTurning to our second strategic pillar, all in your world, we improved the guest experience across all of our touch points. We enhanced our physical footprint, opening 33 new stores and renovating or relocating 25 stores. Our services business delivered double-digit comp growth for the year, increasing frequency with members who already engaged in services, while also introducing new members to our offering, and we drove greater experiential shopping through more in-store events focused on engaging and educating the guest about new products, new techniques and the latest beauty trends.\nWe also delivered significant improvements in our digital store experience. We successfully transitioned key guest-facing and commerce elements to a new modern architecture, delivering a fresh guest experience across both ulta.com and our app and providing our teams with new tools to optimize the guest experience. These enhancements, combined with our efforts to drive omnichannel member penetration, resulted in high single-digit growth in e-commerce sales and a 30% increase in member utilization of our app.\nTo support stronger omnichannel experiences, we continue to improve our buy anywhere, fill anywhere capabilities. We expanded same-day delivery to all stores and increased our ship-from-store capabilities to 450 stores. Between BOPIS, same-day delivery and ship from store, 37% of our digital orders this year were fulfilled by stores, up from 31% last year. Finally, we strengthened our partnership with Target with the introduction of new brands and the opening of 155 additional Ulta Beauty at Target locations, ending the year with 510 shops.\nAnd we deepened guest engagement as reflected in growth of new member conversions, reengagement labs guests and greater loyalty account linkage as well as increased bounce back to Ulta Beauty stores. Moving to our third strategic pillar, expanding and deepening guest engagement and loyalty by operating at the heart of the beauty community. Our marketing strategies, media investments and brand building efforts resulted in record level unaided awareness, brand love and loyalty. To drive awareness and spark deeper connection engagement, we launched the Joy Project, a multiyear brand equity initiative to make beauty and the world a more joyful place.\nWe expanded our social media engagement across multiple platforms with new trendsetting series and compelling content, which drove strong engagement, positive social sentiment and share of voice. And we achieved an important milestone. In December, we surpassed 1 million followers on TikTok, reinforcing our position as a social brand leader in beauty.\nWith improved member retention, strong new member acquisition and healthy reactivation of lapsed members, we expanded our loyalty program by 8%, ending the year with 43.3 million loyalty members who shopped more frequently and spent more with us on average. Leading into the power of our best-in-class loyalty program in January, we rebranded the program to Ulta Beauty Rewards, featuring a stronger birthday experience and a refreshed look in stores and online and across social to drive greater awareness and deepen connection with our members.\nWe are excited to reward our members with even more of what they love and showcase how much we appreciate them. Finally, UB Media, our retail media network, continued to deliver value. This year, we expanded the team, introduced new on-site products and launched an innovative omnichannel solution, which supports the measurement of campaigns across both digital and physical stores. Our fourth strategic pillar is to drive operational excellence and optimization to enable us to capture additional market share, fund guest experience enhancements and deliver future profitable growth.\nI am very proud of what our teams accomplished in fiscal 2023, which was an ambitious year of foundational transformation for Ulta Beauty. We completed the retrofit of our Greenwood distribution center, began the retrofit of our Dallas distribution center, opened our Greer market fulfillment center and began work on our Bolingbrook market fulfillment center. We successfully transitioned our Jacksonville, Greer and Chambersburg distribution facilities and key merchandising processes to our new enterprise resource planning platform.\nAnd we converted key merchandising and commerce elements of our digital store to a new architecture, while maintaining digital operations. We built a new enterprise data platform on Google Cloud infrastructure, establishing a modern ecosystem for future analytics and data-driven decision capabilities. And we completed our rollout of new POS systems, including mobile checkout in all stores. Our teams enable our success, and we continue to invest in protect and cultivate our world-class culture and talent.\nThis year, we introduced a new leadership competency model, redesigned our succession and talent review processes, expanded our associate development offering and completed enterprise-wide training to reinforce inclusivity and address unconscious bias. Associate retention improved across stores, distribution centers and our corporate team. And our 2023 culture survey results reinforce that our overall associate engagement remains strong.\nFinally, we made progress against our sixth strategic pillar to expand our environmental and social impact. We continue to improve the energy efficiency of stores through LED lighting retrofits, HVAC retrofits and energy management system upgrades and established 2030 emissions reduction goals approved by the science-based target initiative. I am incredibly proud of what our teams accomplished in 2023. Our teams worked through unexpected challenges with agility and grace, and I'm grateful for their steadfast commitment to deliver value for all stakeholders while also enabling new capabilities for future growth.\nAs we look forward, we remain optimistic about the strength and resiliency of the beauty category. Over the last 3 years, the beauty category has experienced unprecedented growth. In 2024, we expect the category will remain healthy, but the growth will moderate to the mid-single-digit range, barring a major economic event. Beauty is an attractive category, and competitive intensity continues to increase as channels blur and distribution expands. To protect and expand our leadership position, this year, we expect to advance our transformational agenda with the completion of key projects while also investing in core traffic and experienced drivers to strengthen engagement and enhance the guest experience.\nStarting with our go-to-market strategic pillars, we will innovate, evolve and expand All Things Beauty to excite and engage the beauty enthusiast. To strengthen our differentiated position, we will continue to expand our assortment with compelling and relevant brand launches like Sol de Janeiro and Charlotte Tilbury, while also building exclusive emerging brands in our pipeline yet to be announced.\nIn addition, this year, we will refresh Ulta Beauty Collection and position the brand as the cornerstone of our conscious beauty platform. And we will continue to enhance and amplify Luxury at Ulta Beauty and across category platforms. Reflecting the importance of omnichannel engagement, we will invest in the guest experience across all of our touch points. We will further expand and enhance our physical footprint through additional new stores, remodels and relocations. In all stores, we will focus on enhancing the guest experience through friendly and helpful associates, fast and frictionless fulfillment and engaging services and events, while also improving operational excellence through simplification, prioritization and optimizing our store teams.\nWe also plan to drive growth across digital platforms as we leverage new capabilities to amplify brand launches and events, drive greater digital discovery and conversion and expand personalization across our digital platforms. And we will expand and enhance our partnership with Target as we support new Ulta Beauty at Target shops, evolve the assortment and deepen member engagement through targeted loyalty strategies.\nOperating at the heart of the beauty community, we intend to expand and deepen guest loyalty and engagement. To support long-term brand equity and drive deeper emotional connection with consumers, we will amplify the Joy Project with a continuous rhythm of engaging activations and drive community through an expanded creator network and affiliate program. We will support brand activations and events to drive new member acquisition, while also leveraging our unique data insights to expand our targeting and member engagement.\nWe will evolve our strategic promotional events to inspire and engage our beauty community, drive trips and encourage omnichannel engagement, and we plan to expand the impact and value of UB Media. Turning now to our operational excellence and optimization efforts. In fiscal 2024, we plan to complete many of the foundational elements of our transformational agenda, including Project SOAR, Digital Store and the upgrade of our data management capabilities. We also plan to invest in a new MarTech stack to support our personalization, retail media and overall e-commerce efforts.\nOur supply chain optimization journey will continue as our Bolingbrook market fulfillment center is completed, we continue to retrofit our Dallas distribution center and we began the retrofit of our remaining full-service DCs in Chambersburg and Fresno. In addition, we intend to leverage our established continuous improvement capabilities to drive additional cost efficiencies with a priority on improving processes to reduce shrink.\nTo protect our culture and cultivate our talent while also enabling future business performance, we will continue to invest in our associates and team. We intend to focus on enrichments to the frontline associate experience, enhanced associate learning and development and deepen our DEI impact. Turning to our final strategic pillar. We intend to stay focused on our environmental and social impact.\nBuilding on progress made in 2023, we plan to implement our road map to achieve our emission reduction goals. Finally, I want to share an update on how we are approaching expansion opportunities outside the U.S. International expansion represents an incremental long-term opportunity for Ulta Beauty to extend our reach and leverage our differentiated value proposition. Today, we are excited to announce our planned market entry into Mexico.\nThe Mexican beauty market is sizable, growing and has significant beauty opportunity. Our research suggests there is a healthy awareness of the Ulta Beauty brand with local beauty enthusiasts, and we also see strong engagement in stores located in geographically adjacent markets. After extensive evaluation, we prioritized an asset-light partnership approach to enable us to move quickly. And I am excited to announce we have formed a joint venture with Axo, a highly experienced operator of global brands to launch and operate Ulta Beauty in Mexico in 2025.\nAs a result of this partnership approach, we do not expect this venture to be material to our financials in fiscal 2024. For competitive reasons, we're not sharing more details today, but we'll provide updates as appropriate. In closing, the Ulta Beauty team delivered strong financial performance in fiscal 2023, while also achieving meaningful progress against our strategic priorities. As we look to 2024, I remain excited about the opportunity to enhance our market leadership and drive profitable growth. We operate in a growing category with strong consumer engagement, and I am confident that our proven differentiated business model, strategic priorities and outstanding, passionate team will enable us to move beauty forward in ways that create values for our shareholders and have a positive impact on our guests, associates and the communities we serve.\nNow, as many of you know, this will be Scott's last earnings call, and I want to recognize and thank Scott for his many contributions to Ulta Beauty. He has been an exceptional partner to me and an inspirational leader for our entire team. Now today, you will also hear from Paula Oyibo, who will become our CFO on April 1. Paula joined Ulta Beauty in 2019 and is a dynamic finance executive with broad industry experience. She understands our business and our guests, and I know she will have a strong impact on our business going forward. And now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of our financial results. Scott?\n\nScott M. Settersten\n\nCFO, Treasurer & Chief Accounting Officer\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. I will review our fourth quarter financial results before turning it over to Paula Oyibo, who will walk through the outlook for fiscal 2024. Financial results for the fourth quarter came in ahead of our expectations across the top and bottom line, reflecting strong holiday performance, growth in other revenue and healthy traffic trends as well as strong execution and focused expense management.\nNet sales for the quarter increased 10.2%, driven by 2.5% growth in comp sales, strong new store performance, a $25 million increase in other revenue as well as the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2023. Net sales for the 53rd week were $181.9 million. The growth in comp sales was driven by a 4.5% increase in transactions. Average ticket declined 1.9%, driven by lower units per transaction, which were partially offset by higher average selling price.\nReflecting a more normalized pricing environment, we estimate that product price increases contributed about 100 basis points to the overall comp increase. Looking at the cadence of sales through the quarter, comp sales were solid in November and December, reflecting strong holiday performance. As expected, sales were more challenged in January as we lap the exceptional results from our strongest month in fiscal 2022.\nDuring the quarter, we opened 13 new stores, relocated 2, remodeled 2 stores and closed 2 stores. For the quarter, gross margin increased 10 basis points to 37.7% of sales. The increase was driven by strong growth in other revenue, lower shipping rates and leverage of supply chain costs, which were largely offset by lower merchandise margin. Our efforts to grow other revenue continue to yield benefits with performance driven by increased credit card income, greater loyalty point redemptions and royalties earned through our target partnership.\nAt the same time, we realized benefits from our supply chain optimization efforts as our carrier diversification strategy drove improved profitability. As anticipated, merchandise margin was pressured during the quarter, reflecting the lapping of benefits from price increases, increased promotionality as well as the impact from brand mix. These pressures were partially offset by ongoing category management efforts. The impact of promotional activity was above last year, but continues to be well below 2019 levels.\nNotably, shrink was flat during the quarter, slightly better than our expectations, reflecting the impact of our investments this year in training, labor and new fragrance fixtures. For the full year, shrink as a percentage of sales increased 40 basis points. Moving to expenses. SG&A increased 7.6% to $820 million. Overall, SG&A spend was better than planned due to focused expense management and a shift in timing of certain strategic investments.\nAs a percentage of sales, SG&A decreased 50 basis points to 23.1% compared to 23.6% last year, primarily due to lower incentive compensation and leverage of marketing expenses and store payroll and benefits, which was partially offset by deleverage of corporate overhead and store expenses. Incentive compensation drove 40 basis points of leverage in the quarter, reflecting operational performance that was more in line with our internal targets compared to last year's significant outperformance.\nIn addition to the impact of higher sales, marketing expense leverage was driven by the timing of advertising expenses, while store payroll and benefits leverage reflected fewer payroll hours per store, which more than offset ongoing wage rate pressures. Offsetting these benefits, corporate overhead expense deleveraged during the quarter, primarily reflecting investments related to our strategic priorities, including Project SOAR, Digital Store and other IT capabilities and UB Media.\nFor the full year, we invested $62 million of incremental spend to support our strategic initiatives, which was at the lower end of our expectations, reflecting the shift in timing of certain projects into 2024. Finally, store expenses also deleveraged, driven by investments to support merchandising initiatives as well as ongoing inflationary pressures across the business. Operating margin was 14.5% of sales compared to 13.9% last year. The company's tax rate decreased to 24.2% compared to 24.6% in the fourth quarter last year. The lower effective tax rate is primarily due to benefits from a decrease in state income taxes.\nDiluted GAAP earnings per share increased 21% to $8.08 compared to $6.68 last year. The EPS impact of the 53rd week was $0.46. To recap the full year, net sales increased 9.8% to $11.2 billion. Comp sales increased 5.7%, driven by a 7.4% increase in transactions and a 1.5% decrease in average ticket. We estimate that product price increases contributed about 200 basis points to the overall comp increase for the year. Operating profit was 15% of sales, with deleverage coming evenly from gross margin and SG&A, and diluted EPS increased 8.4% to a record $26.3 per share.\nMoving on to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 8.6% to $1.7 billion compared to $1.6 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 30 net new stores, the increase reflects inventory to support new brand launches, the new market fulfillment center in Greer, South Carolina as well as the impact of product cost increases. Our well-established business model continues to generate significant cash from operations, including nearly $1.5 billion in fiscal 2023.\nOur capital allocation approach remains consistent. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business to drive future growth, followed by returning excess cash to our shareholders. In fiscal 2023, we invested $435 million in capital expenditures, including approximately $178 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures; $124 million for IT; $73 million for supply chain; and $60 million for store maintenance and other.\nDepreciation for the year was $244 million compared to $241 million last year and primarily reflects the ongoing shift of IT investments from capital to cloud expense. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 352,000 shares at a cost of $159 million, bringing total share repurchase to 1 billion for the full year. Since launching our stock buyback program in 2014, we've purchased more than 18 million shares at a weighted average price of $313, effectively returning $5.8 billion to shareholders, while continuing to invest in strategic growth drivers.\nBefore I turn the call over to Paula, I want to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to our teams for delivering these strong results for our shareholders this year and throughout my tenure with Ulta Beauty. It has been an honor to serve as the company's CFO and a privilege to lead and serve alongside such talented associates. I'm excited to Paula, who I know will be an excellent leader and steward of Ulta Beauty's business going forward.\n\nPaula Oyibo\n\nThank you, Scott. I am honored and humbled to be assuming the position of Chief Financial Officer at Ulta Beauty, and I am excited to lead our talented finance organization and to drive Ulta Beauty's next phase of growth. I want to thank Scott for his mentorship over the years and wish him all the best in his well-deserved retirement. I look forward to working with those on the call today and meeting those of you I have not yet met.\nBefore we talk about our expectations for fiscal 2024, I want to share 2 capital allocation update. First, yesterday, we amended our revolver agreement to $800 million and extended the term to 2029. Reflecting the current rate environment, we reduced the size of the revolver to lower the impact of higher fees, but retain flexibility to upsize the capacity if needed. Second, having essentially completed the authorization announced in March 2022, today, we announced a new share repurchase authorization for $2 billion.\nNow turning to our outlook for fiscal 2024. We expect net sales will be in the range of $11.7 billion to $11.8 billion, with comp sales growth expected to be between 4% and 5%. We anticipate comp growth will be in the low single-digit range in the first half and then increase to mid-single-digit growth in the second half of the year. We expect operating margin will be between 14% and 14.3% of sales, primarily driven by SG&A deleverage as we complete many of the foundational elements of our transformational agenda and move to investments to enable growth, operationalize the investments made in 2023, manage ongoing wage pressures and support core traffic and experienced drivers.\nIn total, we expect SG&A growth for the year will moderate into the high single-digit range from 12.5% growth in fiscal 2023. We expect SG&A growth in the first half will be in the low double-digit range as we annualize investment spend in 2023 and complete key milestones of our transformational agenda and then slow to mid-single-digit growth in the second half. We expect gross margin for the year will be down modestly as lower merchandise margin and deleverage of supply chain costs are partially offset by other revenue.\nOur assumptions result in a diluted earnings guidance in the range of $26.20 to $27 per share. We are planning EPS to the decline in the first half and then accelerate to high single-digit growth in the second half of the year. For modeling purposes, we expect operating margin to be the most challenged in the first quarter with meaningful deleverage across SG&A and gross margins.\nFinally, we plan to spend between $415 million and $490 million in CapEx, including approximately $270 million to $282 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures; $120 million to $155 million for supply chain and IT; and $45 million to $53 million for store maintenance and other. We expect depreciation for the year will be between $275 million and $280 million.\nWe believe the outlook for the beauty category is bright, and we are confident our strategic framework and strong financial foundation will enable us to drive long-term growth and shareholder returns. Before we take your questions, I want to announce that we plan to host an investor event here in Chicago this fall to share our longer-term plans and outlook. We will share more of the logistical details later this summer. And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A.",

Kimbell\n\nPresident & Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer, Ulta Beauty, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. I'll start today with comments about our CFO transition plans and then discuss our third quarter performance. Then Scott will review the financial results and our outlook.\nStarting with the succession plans we announced this afternoon. After nearly 20 years with Ulta Beauty and more than a decade as CFO, Scott Settersten, has shared with us his decision to retire, effective April 1, 2024. From his early days helping take Ulta Beauty public and throughout the last 10 years as CFO, Scott's impact on Ulta Beauty has been tremendous. He's been a passionate steward of our business and the strong and constant shareholder returns achieved during his tenure are a testament to his leadership and disciplined approach to driving profitable growth.\nI want to express my sincere gratitude to Scott for his partnership and his remarkable contributions to our business. He has been an exceptional partner to me and an inspirational leader for our team across the company.\nWith Scott's retirement, I'm very pleased to announce that Paula Oyibo will be our next Chief Financial Officer. Paula is a dynamic finance executive with broad industry experience, and I am confident she is the right leader for this next chapter of Ulta Beauty's growth.\nSince joining the company in 2019, she has established herself as a trusted partner and visionary leader. Her deep understanding of our business, experience leading large finance organizations and strong commitment to nurturing talent with an inclusive culture make her the ideal person to serve as Ulta Beauty's next CFO. Paula will be a great addition to our dynamic executive team, and I look forward to partnering with her as we continue our growth journey.\nThis announcement represents another great succession story for Ulta Beauty. I am grateful to Scott for being intentional and thoughtful in ensuring we have a seamless plan for this critical leadership role. And I am excited that Paula will bring her business-first mindset, influence and energy to the executive team.\nOkay. Now let's talk about our third quarter performance. The Ulta Beauty team delivered strong performance again this quarter, with sales, gross profit and EPS all exceeding our internal expectations. Our traffic trends remain healthy. Our brand awareness and loyalty program reached all-time highs, and our transformational initiatives are on track. I want to thank all Ulta Beauty associates for maintaining their focus on creating great guest experiences and delivering these results while executing against our transformational agenda.\nFor the quarter, net sales increased 6.4% to $2.5 billion. Operating profit was 13.1% of sales and diluted EPS was $5.07 per share. Comparable sales increased 4.5%.\nAs discussed on prior calls, we expected the sales growth to moderate from the first half as we lapped 2 years of strong double-digit comp growth. Comp sales growth for the quarter was driven by approximately 10% growth from our digital channels. Stores delivered low single-digit comps as we lapped high-teen growth last year. Store traffic remained healthy, increasing in the high single-digit range.\nTurning to performance by category. Skincare was again our fastest-growing category, driven by double-digit growth in mass and prestige segments. Beauty enthusiasts have maintained their skincare routines while also experimenting with new regimens. Consumer interest in moisturizers, serums and cleansers is driving growth, and brands leading into these trends like Drunk Elephant, Good Molecules and COSRX contributed to our strong results.\nDermatologist-recommended brands also continued to resonate, driving growth for brands like La Roche-Posay, [ Cedeo ] and Dermalogica. The fragrance and bath category delivered low double-digit growth. Newness from Ariana Grande, Burberry and YSL contributed to the category's performance. Prestige brands, Valentino and Carolina Herrera and luxury brands, Chanel and Dior also drove meaningful growth.\nSales in the makeup category were flat, with mid-single-digit growth in mass makeup offsetting a modest decline in prestige makeup. New brands like Dior and NATASHA DENONA and Beautycounter and existing brands with compelling newness and innovation, including e.l.f., Juvia's Place, MAC and OPI, all delivered growth during the quarter. While many mass brands continue to benefit from engaging newness and social engagement, our prestige makeup business was more challenged as we continue to lap the strong impact of last year's Fenty launch.\nFinally, Comp sales for the hair care category decreased in the low single-digit range, primarily driven by a decline in hair tools. Newer brands, including exclusive brand L'Oreal [indiscernible], and Shark Beauty and Donna's Recipe as well as newness from Not Your Mother's and Way deliver growth for the category. Trend-relevant products from Redken and Biolage resonated strongly with guests while social virality drove growth for IGK and Maya.\nComparing to mass beauty dollar sales for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023, and we continue to outpace the growth of the mass market according to Circana data. In Prestige Beauty, our share gains in skin care and fragrance were offset by softness in makeup and hair according to Circana.\nFrom a channel perspective, we gained prestige beauty share across digital channels, but were more challenged in brick-and-mortar channels, reflecting the impact of increased distribution for prestige beauty. While these dynamics increased competitive intensity in the short term, we are confident our sales-driving strategies will support our ability to capture more market share over the long term. Our Services business delivered high single-digit comp growth, primarily driven by engagement in core services, including haircuts, blowouts and makeup services. ear piercing, one of our newer services also performed well, and salon backbar takeovers, which give our stylists an opportunity to introduce brands to guests continue to drive product attachment and new guest acquisition for participating brands.\nUnlike other discretionary retail categories, the U.S. beauty category has consistently driven growth over time. Based on data from Euromonitor, in the 15 years prior to the pandemic, the U.S. beauty category grew in the low to mid-single-digit range every year except during the Great Recession when the category experienced low single-digit declines and in 2020 when the category declined 6%.\nIn 2021 and 2022, the category experienced unprecedented double-digit growth as consumers recovered from the pandemic. And as we lap the strong growth this year, consumer spend has remained healthy. While we expect growth will continue to normalize to historic ranges, we remain confident the category will continue to grow, barring a macroeconomic event.\nIn addition to factors that have driven the category historically, including a strong emotional connection with consumers, newness and innovation and societal changes, today, consumers are thinking differently about the role beauty can play in their wellness routine which we believe will drive increased usage for the category.\nAs we think about the opportunity to expand our market leadership and drive long-term profitable growth, our strategic framework guides our priorities and focus. Let me share some highlights of the progress made this quarter.\nStarting with our efforts to drive growth with an expanded definition of All Things Beauty. During the quarter, we enhanced our assortment with trend relevant brands in every category. In makeup, we introduced luxury brand, Pat McGrath Labs, expanded our presence with MAC to nearly all stores, launched several exclusive and innovative brands, including Half Magic, Polite Society and Rabanne.\nIn skincare, we launched PanOxyl, a dermatologist-recommended brand popular with Gen Z. In haircare, we launched Sharp Beauty, an innovative brand of hair styling tools at accessible price points. And in fragrance, we launched Snif an emerging brand offering gender-neutral sense available only at Ulta Beauty.\nBuilding on our long-term partnership with Chanel and other luxury fragrance brands, we see an opportunity to expand our luxury offering into makeup and skincare. In Q1, we launched Luxury at Ulta Beauty and our member analytics confirms that our new luxury assortment is driving incrementality and increased spend per member.\nIn addition to strengthening our core assortment, we are leaning into broader trends in beauty through our cross-category platforms. We continue to expand our Conscious Beauty platform. At the end of the quarter, more than half of our brand portfolio was certified in at least one pillar, with 260 brands certified in more than one pillar. Newly-certified brands include COSRX, Loving Tan and Polite Society.\nWe also increased our portfolio of BIPOC brands, welcoming Pat McGrath Labs, [indiscernible] Mix, Better World Fragrance House by Drake and Pound Cake to the portfolio. And we expanded our wellness assortment with the launch of at-home spa tools from LUV SCRUB, Solawave and Skin Gym Jim.\nIn addition, we expanded the wellness shop to an additional 500 stores and refresh the presentation with elevated aesthetics, improved navigation and more storytelling graphics to inspire and educate our guests how to connect to wellness in their everyday lives. Guests are moving effortlessly between physical and digital channels, and we are investing to enhance the guest experience across all touch points. We have been on a multiyear digital transformation journey to upgrade our infrastructure and deliver a more engaging and seamless digital guest experience while also positioning future growth.\nIn August, we completed a significant step in this process with the transition of our digital commerce experience, including cart, motions, checkout and member account data to our new architecture.\nOverall, our team successfully executed these changes, and I am pleased to report our new digital experience performed very well over the high demand Thanksgiving weekend, including Cyber Monday. The modernization of our digital technology ecosystem is nearly complete, enabling us to elevate and optimize our existing guest experience while driving digital innovation, utilizing a modern, agile approach.\nIn addition to our digital platforms, we are also enhancing our in-store experiences. Our member data demonstrates that an excellent guest experience drives spend, increase frequency and creates lasting loyalty. This quarter, we launched a refreshed guest engagement model, which elevates the guest experience through authentic engagement, helpful experiences and friendly interactions to create a genuine human connection.\nWhile still early, we are encouraged by the improving trends in guest satisfaction scores. We continue to expand and enhance the Ulta Beauty at Target experience. We opened 89 Ulta Beauty at Target shops during the quarter, ending the quarter with 510 shops. This quarter, we were excited to launch Fenty Beauty, delighting our guests with a new way to shop this fan favorite brand. Created exclusively for Ulta Beauty at Target, the Fenty snacks assortment features a curated lineup of best-selling must-haves, minis and unique sets. And just in time for holiday, we launched a curated assortment of Dyson hair tools in select stores and exclusive holiday sample kits in all Ulta Beauty at Target shops.\nBeauty is an emotionally-driven category, and we are investing to drive greater love, loyalty and connection with Ulta Beauty. We continue to strengthen the Ulta Beauty brand, unaided brand awareness increased to a record level this quarter with meaningful gains among Gen Z and millennial beauty consumers. We also expanded the connection guest field for Ulta Beauty as measured by significant growth in brand love. These gains reflect the impact of our strategic brand building efforts as well as our marketing actions to support key promotional events and brand launches.\nAt Ulta Beauty, our mission is to use the power of beauty to bring to light the possibilities that lie within each of us. Building on our commitment to make beauty a force for good, we've created The Joy Project, a multiyear initiative to make beauty and the world a more joyful place. We launched The Joy Project in September with an integrated campaign across national TV, PR, social media and our owned channels.\nIn addition, we created a training curriculum for transforming the way our associates think about self-confidence, and to give them tools to empower our guests to do the same.\nIn October, we expanded The Joy Project while reinforcing our role at the intersection of beauty and culture as the exclusive beauty partner for TikTok's first ever beauty month. Grounded in TikTok's theme of reclaimed joy. This month-long activation, leveraged creator content and events, premium platform advertising placements and custom filters that allowed users to see their inner joy.\nWe continue to adjust our promotional strategies as the category normalizes and consumers navigate rising cost pressures. Responding to consumer needs and competitive shifts, we continue to evolve our key tentpole events like 21 Days of Beauty, while also deploying new offers with more relevant storytelling to drive sales and traffic.\nWhile our promotional activity increased this quarter, our targeting capabilities and promo optimization efforts enabled us to manage the financial impact. Notably, overall promotional levels remained meaningfully below 2019 levels.\nTurning to our loyalty program. We ended the quarter with 42.2 million active members, 8% higher than last year, driven primarily by improving member retention and new member acquisition. Spend per member remains healthy, driven by greater shopper frequency. As we engage members with exclusive promotions, point accelerators and personalized content and recommendations, we are driving engagement spend and frequency. These targeted efforts are also enabling us to elevate more members to our platinum and diamond tiers. Compared to last year, the number of platinum and diamond members has increased more than 20%.\nTurning now to our efforts to drive operational excellence and optimization. We are executing a multiyear transformation agenda intended to unlock new capabilities and efficiencies to fuel our growth.\nIn addition to the digital store progress achieved this quarter, we continued to advance our road map in other key areas. We completed the retrofit of our Greenwood distribution center began shipping to stores and fulfilling e-commerce orders from our new Greer market fulfillment center and transitioned our Chambersburg distribution center to our new ERP platform. Our teams have delivered several major milestones this year, and we are on track to complete many of our transformational projects next year. We plan to complete the transition of our digital store in the first half of 2024, and we expect to complete the upgrade of our ERP platform and the expansion of our data management systems in the second half of 2024.\nWe will advance our supply chain optimization efforts next year with the continuation of our Dallas DC retrofit, as well as the conversion of our Romeoville, Illinois fast fulfillment center to a new market fulfillment center.\nFinally, as the nation's leading specialty beauty retailer, we strive to be good stewards of our environment. Reflecting our commitment to leave a positive legacy, I am excited to share we have established a mission reduction goals approved by the science-based target initiative. Details of our commitments are available in the ESG section of our investor website.\nShifting now to our plans and expectations for holiday. The holiday is off to a good start. But we know the biggest selling weeks are still ahead of us. Our insights suggest that consumers are ready to celebrate even as they navigate in an uncertain economic environment. With our diverse assortments and convenient omnichannel touch points, we are well positioned to help our guests celebrate this season.\nOur holiday campaign this year is the gift is just the beginning, which underscores our belief in the power of beauty and Ulta Beauty. While a gift can be a signature fragrance or an innovative hair tool, beauty can also be the gift of self-care, fun and joy. Through this campaign, we're celebrating the moments that make the holiday special, family, friends, connections, joy and pairing them with the perfect gifts. Our merchants have thoughtfully created a holiday assortment of exclusive first-to-market items along with iconic classics. With products across mass, prestige and luxury, we offer guests both value-first and splurge-worthy items to help them find perfect budget-friendly guests for others or themselves.\nOur store teams are ready to bring the holiday to life for our guests. Our new POS system enables associates to easily order items not currently available in their store and our new mobile POS tools provide guests with an elevated and faster checkout process. And with BOPUS and same-day delivery options in every store, it's never been easier or more convenient to shop at Ulta Beauty. Our teams have been working hard all year to ensure Ulta Beauty is ready to bring joy to our guests this holiday season, and I am proud of how well they are executing for our guests.\nWhile the beauty category will likely be a bit more promotional this holiday season, I'm confident our marketing and assortment strategies combined with new capabilities will position us to deliver another successful holiday. In closing, the beauty category remains healthy, and consumer engagement remains high. We remain confident in the resilience and power of beauty and in our ability to drive market share and profitable growth.\nAnd now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott?\n\nScott M. Settersten\n\nCFO, Treasurer & Chief Accounting Officer\n\nThanks, Dave. Good afternoon, everyone. I want to echo Dave's sentiments and thank the Ulta Beauty team for delivering third quarter financial results that were ahead of our internal expectations.\nSolid sales growth supported by strong guest traffic and new store sales performance helped to mitigate some of the unique margin pressures we faced in the third quarter and enabled us to deliver gross margin modestly ahead of plan. SG&A spend was in line with expectations, resulting in operating margin of 13.1%.\nTurning to the P&L. Net sales for the quarter increased 6.4%, driven by 4.5% growth in comp sales, strong new store performance and solid growth in other revenue. Transactions for the quarter increased 5.9%, driven by healthy traffic across both channels. Average ticket decreased 1.4% as the decline in average units per transaction more than offset the impact of a higher average selling price.\nWhile retail price increases remain a benefit to our comp performance, the overall environment continues to normalize, and we are seeing the extraordinary pricing benefits from last year continue to roll off. We estimate price increases contributed less than 200 basis points to the overall comp in the third quarter.\nDuring the quarter, we opened 12 new stores and relocated 2 stores. In addition, we remodeled 11 stores.\nQ3 gross margin decreased 130 basis points to 39.9%, compared to 41.2% last year. The decrease was primarily driven by lower merchandise margin, higher inventory shrink and higher supply chain costs which were partially offset by strong growth in other revenue. Overall merchandise margin was lower primarily due to lapping the timing benefit of retail price changes last year, as well as increased promotional activity this year.\nWhile promotional activity continues to normalize, the overall financial impact remains meaningfully below 2019 levels. Inventory shrink continued to be a headwind. Our efforts to address shrink appear to be stabilizing the impact, but the overall environment remains challenging.\nIn addition to new fragrance fixtures, which have been installed in nearly 3/4 of the store fleet, we continue to invest in associate training, staffing and operational improvements to mitigate the impact of shrink. And we continue to work with our retail industry partners to influence macro changes aimed at improving the overall environment.\nSupply chain costs were higher during the quarter, reflecting depreciation related to investments in our supply chain transformation, as well as the recent opening of our new market fulfillment center in South Carolina. These gross margin pressures were partially offset by strong growth in other revenue, primarily due to growth in both credit card income and royalty income from our Target partnership.\nSG&A increased 10.8% to $661.4 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased 110 basis points to 26.6%, compared to 25.5% last year, primarily due to higher corporate overhead, greater store expenses, investments in store payroll and benefits as well as higher marketing expense which more than offset lower incentive compensation. Corporate overhead expenses were higher in the quarter primarily due to investments related to our strategic priorities, including Project SOAR, Digital Store, other IT capabilities and UB Media.\nYear-to-date through the third quarter, we have invested about 75% of our planned $60 million to $70 million of incremental spend to support our strategic initiatives.\nStore expenses were higher in the quarter, reflecting ongoing inflationary pressures across the business. The increase in store payroll and benefits was primarily due to the impact of planned investments in average wage rates. Higher marketing expenses in the quarter were largely driven by increased investments to drive member acquisition, loyalty and brand awareness across key channels, including social, video and streaming.\nLower incentive compensation was a benefit in the quarter, reflecting operational performance that is more in line with our internal targets compared to last year's significant outperformance. Operating income for the quarter declined 9.6% to $327.2 million. As a percentage of sales, operating margin decreased 240 basis points to 13.1% compared to 15.5% last year. Diluted earnings per share decreased 5.1% to $5.07 per share compared to $5.34 per share last year.\nTurning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. Total inventory increased 9.8% to $2.3 billion, compared to $2.1 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 31 additional stores, the increase reflects inventory to support higher demand and the stocking of our new market fulfillment center in South Carolina, as well as new brand launches and product cost increases.\nCapital expenditures were $106 million for the quarter, reflecting investments in new and existing stores as well as supply chain and IT investments to support our transformational agenda. Depreciation was $61.4 million in the quarter compared to $58.5 million last year. We repurchased approximately 687,000 shares at a cost of $281.5 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 1.8 million shares at a cost of $840.5 million.\nDuring the quarter, we drew on our revolving credit facility to support our ongoing capital allocation priorities, including share repurchases and capital expenditures during a period in the year when our working capital needs peak as we build inventory for holiday. I would note our recent activity does not reflect a change in our capital allocation philosophy rather a lever to short support short-term cash needs. We ended the quarter with $195.4 million in short-term debt and $121.8 million in cash and cash equivalents.\nMoving to our outlook. We are narrowing our sales and EPS guidance for fiscal 2023 to reflect our actual performance through the first 3 quarters of the year and our expectations for Q4. We expect net sales for the year will be between $11.1 billion and $11.15 billion, with comp sales growth between 5% and 5.5%.\nFor the year, we continue to plan to open approximately 25 to 30 net new stores and remodel or relocate 20 to 30 stores. Our expectations for operating margin for the year remains unchanged, at between 14.6% and 14.8% of sales, with deleverage to come from both gross margin and SG&A, with slightly more deleverage coming from SG&A. Reflecting these assumptions, we now expect diluted EPS for the year will be between $25.20 and $25.60.\nWe have refined our expectations for Q4 to reflect the expected resilience of the beauty category as well as potential risks from cautious consumer spending, increased points of distribution for prestige beauty and higher promotional activity. We continue to expect comp sales will be flat to up modestly for the fourth quarter. We still have several important weeks left in the holiday season and the operating environment continues to be dynamic.\nIn addition, we are lapping exceptional results last year, including an incredibly strong January, which was our strongest monthly comp sales performance of fiscal 2022. For modeling purposes, we now expect gross margin to deleverage modestly and operating margin to be flat to down compared to last year.\nOne final update. We now expect to spend between $400 million and $425 million in CapEx in fiscal 2023, including approximately $180 million for supply chain and IT, $170 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, and about $60 million for store maintenance and other. We expect depreciation for the year will be around $245 million. We now expect share repurchases to be approximately $950 million.\nOur teams delivered another solid quarter amidst a dynamic operating environment. As we look ahead, we are focused on delivering our plans for the holiday season and finalizing our plans for next year. We will share more about our expectations for fiscal 2024 when we report our year-end results. But we remain confident we are well positioned to deliver performance in line with our financial targets of 3% to 5% comp sales growth and 14% to 15% operating margin, with EPS growth next year, reflecting the lapping of an extra week in fiscal 2023.\nBefore I turn it over to our operator to moderate the Q&A, I want to take a moment to say thank you. It has been an honor and a privilege to serve as CFO for this special company for more than a decade. I look forward to passing the baton to Paula Oyibo, who I've worked with closely over the last several years. We will continue to work together over the coming months to ensure a smooth transition. Thank you again.\nAnd now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce Ms. Kiley Rawlins, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rawlins, you may proceed.\n\nKiley F. Rawlins\n\nVP - Investor Relations, Ulta Beauty, Inc.\n\nThanks, [ Paul ].\nGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for a discussion of Ulta Beauty's results for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Hosting our call today are Dave Kimbell, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Kecia Steelman, Chief Operating Officer, will join us for the Q&A session.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind you of the company's Safe Harbor language. The statements contained in this conference call, which are not historical facts, may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the company's filings with the SEC.

We have no obligation to update or revise our forward-looking statements except as required by law, and you should not expect us to do so.\nWe'll begin this afternoon with prepared remarks from Dave and Scott. Following our comments, we'll open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] As always, the IR team will be available for any follow-up questions after the call.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave?\n\nDavid C. Kimbell\n\nPresident & Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer, Ulta Beauty, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kiley, and good afternoon. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty.\nThe Ulta Beauty team delivered strong performance again this quarter with sales, gross profit and SG&A expenses all better than planned. Net sales increased 10.1% to $2.5 billion, and comparable sales increased 8%. Operating profit was 15.5% of sales and diluted EPS increased 5.6% to $6.02 per share. In addition to delivering great financial results, our teams executed against our operational priorities. During the quarter, we drove growth across all major categories, increased the number of loyalty [ program ] members, strengthened our brand engagement and achieved important milestones within our multiyear transformation initiatives.\nThrough the first half, our financial results are ahead of our internal expectations, and I remain confident we can deliver against our updated guidance for fiscal 2023. I want to express my sincere appreciation to all Ulta Beauty associates for their continued commitment to delivering great guest experiences while working collaboratively to execute our ambitious transformational agenda.\nStarting with the discussion of our operational results, we saw strong sales -- solid sales performance across both our store and digital channels, driven by double-digit traffic growth. All major categories delivered comp growth for the quarter, supported by strong engagement with the overall beauty category, compelling product newness and innovation and successful execution of cross-category promotional events, including our reimagined Big Summer Beauty Sale. Building on last year's promotional events, we consolidated key summer events like our popular Jumbo Love and Mix and Match [ Minis ] into a broader, more cohesive event with holistic storytelling and impactful messaging. The 3-week long Big Summer Beauty Sale drove market disruption, member conversion and strong sales across our Hair Care, Makeup and Skin Care categories.\nTurning to performance by category. Skin Care continues to be 1 of our strongest categories, even as we lap unprecedented growth during the pandemic. For the quarter, both Prestige and Mass skin care delivered double-digit growth. Newer brands, including Bubble, BIOMA and Beautycounter and innovation from existing brands like The Ordinary, Drunk Elephant and Supergoop! contributed to the strong sales results. Reflecting consumer interest in dermatologist recommended brands, La Roche-Posay and CeraVe continued to perform well, and brands like Good Molecules, Hero Cosmetics and Peach Slices continue to benefit from social virality.\nThe Fragrance and Bath category delivered double-digit comp growth again this quarter. Layering and wardrobing scents as a form of self-expression, especially among Gen Z consumers, continues to drive category engagement. Newness from Ariana Grande, Valentino and Burberry contributed to the category's performance, and key gift-giving events like Mother's Day and Father's Day drove growth for luxury brands like Carolina Herrera, Chanel and YSL.\nThe Hair Care category delivered mid-single-digit comp growth driven by newness and guest engagement with our strategic events. Hair Care focused on bonding, scalp treatments and other repair solutions as well as products that offer healthy heat styling options continue to drive consumer engagement. Trend-relevant products from professional brands, Redken, Biolage and Matrix as well as newness from prestige brands, [ Way ] and IGK resonated strongly. New brands, including exclusive brands [indiscernible], created by Jennifer Anderson, and [ Donna's Recipe ] also contributed to growth this quarter. While still challenged as we lap several years of strong growth, sales trends in hair tools improved from the first quarter, driven by compelling newness from Dyson and innovation from [ Bio Ionic ].\nFinally, makeup delivered low single-digit comp growth, driven by strong performance in mass cosmetics. New brands like Dior, NATASHA DENONA and Beautycounter drove growth during the quarter, while new and exclusive products from a wide range of brands, including e.l.f, NYX and OPI also contributed positively. Compelling events, including our Big Summer Beauty Sale, National Lipstick Week and our foundation event as well as successful Barbie and Little Mermaid collaborations drove guest engagement. While the performance of mass cosmetics benefited from engaging newness in social content, our prestige makeup business was challenged as we lapped the significant impact of the Fenty launch last year.\nOur Services business delivered double-digit comp growth again this quarter, primarily driven by increased appointments. Guests are engaging in core cut, color and blowout services as well as newer services, including extensions and scalp and hair treatments. We continue to enhance our service offering, and this quarter, we launched ear piercings chain-wide and introduced a new Keratin Express treatment.\nThe Beauty category growth remains healthy across both Prestige and Mass price tiers as consumers maintain their post-pandemic routines and expand their definition of beauty. When we look at the total beauty market, our analysis demonstrates we continue to gain market share. In Mass Beauty, we gained share this quarter across all major categories. In Prestige, we continue to drive solid gains in skin and fragrance but saw pressure in makeup and hair based on [ Cercanias ] beauty sales data. Our proprietary insights suggest consumers are becoming less focused on product pricing tiers and are trading around, choosing to engage with brands that offer on-trend newness and compelling social media content.\nAs the only beauty retailer to offer a curated assortment of products from entry-level mass to luxury and everything in between, we are uniquely positioned to capture share of the total beauty market as consumers shift. We remain confident in the resilience of beauty. Our strategic framework guides our priorities and positions us to expand our market leadership and drive long-term profitable growth.\nLet me share some highlights of the progress we made against this framework in the second quarter. Starting with our efforts to drive growth with an expanded definition of All Things Beauty. Newness and innovation are critical growth drivers for Beauty. Newness comes to life in the form of new brands, products and product lines, shade extensions and reformulations, and fuels discovery and drive trips and engagement. As we seek to continuously delight guests with All Things Beauty, we continue to expand our assortment and innovate -- with innovative and emerging brands.\nBuilding on newness introduced in the first half, we have several exciting launches planned for the third quarter, including [ Half Magic ], a vegan and cruelty-free makeup brand created by Euphoria makeup artist [ Donnie Davey ], exclusive to Ulta Beauty; [ Polite Society ], a prestige makeup brand exclusive to Ulta Beauty curated -- created by the founders of Too Face Cosmetics; [ Raban ], a contemporary and relevant Spanish fashion brand launching cosmetics exclusively at Ulta Beauty; hair styling tools at accessible price points from [ Shark Beauty ]; PanOxyl, a dermatologist recommended brand popular with Gen Z; and [ Snip ], an emerging fragrance band offering gender neutral sense available only at Ulta Beauty.\nReflecting the growth and popularity of luxury products with younger generations, last quarter, we launched Luxury at Ulta Beauty in 200 stores and on ulta.com. The program has exceeded our expectations, and we continue to see strong guest engagement with our offerings across all categories. Building on this success, we are excited to launch [ Pat McGrath ] Labs, a [ BIPOC ] luxe artistry makeup brand. Pat McGrath is a trusted expert who has shaped and disrupted the cosmetic category.\nNow, let me share an update on our key cross-category platforms which lean into broader emerging trends in beauty, products that are good for the world, inclusivity and wellness.\nAs we seek to provide guests with a diverse assortment that reflects their personal values and individual needs, we continue to expand our assortment of brands featuring clean, cruelty-free and vegan ingredients, leveraging sustainable packaging and driving positive impact through our Conscious Beauty platform. At the end of the quarter, 314 brands were certified in at least 1 pillar, with more than 270 brands certified in multiple pillars. To ensure all guests feel connected and reflected at Ulta Beauty, we continue our important efforts to drive inclusivity.\nIn addition to amplifying our portfolio of BIPOC brands through informative marketing and in-store presentations, this quarter, we hosted a summit for our BIPOC brands, providing them with opportunities to network with peers while learning more about the beauty industry and operational best practices.\nLastly, as the importance of beauty as a form of self-care and wellness continues to build, we enhanced the wellness shop assortment with the launch of 2 exciting supplements: Lemme Gummies created by Kourtney Kardashian, and the introduction of [ Big Brain Probiotics ] from [ Love Wellness ].\nTurning now to our second strategic pillar, All In Your World. We are enhancing guest experiences across all of our touch points. Guests continue to shift effortlessly between physical and digital channels, depending on their individual needs, and we are committed to meeting them wherever they are in their beauty journey. Reflecting our efforts to enhance our Buy Anywhere, Bill Anywhere capabilities, we have expanded our same-day delivery option to essentially every store and improved our store fulfillment process to drive greater efficiency and speed. Between [indiscernible], same-day delivery and ship from store capabilities, 31% of our e-commerce sales and 39% of our digital orders were fulfilled by our store teams this quarter.\nOur consumer insights and member data confirm the importance of physical shopping in beauty. More than 75% of our members choose to transact with us only in stores, and yet we know many of these members use our digital platforms for discovery, [ try-on ] and inspiration. Converting these members to omnichannel members is a meaningful opportunity to increase engagement and spend per member as omnichannel shoppers spend 2.5x to 3x more than single channel shoppers. Importantly, the increase in spend is largely incremental.\nExpanded engagement with our mobile app is 1 way we are driving omnichannel conversion. Through our digital store refresh, we enhanced the user search and discovery experience, seamlessly blending commerce and content for a more personalized experience. We also continue to expand and enhance our digital try-on capabilities. This quarter, we launched a virtual try-on tool that enables guests to try multiple nail looks simultaneously, and we upgraded our virtual hair try-on experience with expanded color options and enhanced transfer quality and speed. These enhancements, combined with awareness campaigns, unique offers to drive utilization and increased associate education have delivered meaningful growth. Over the last 12 months, 9 million active members have engaged with our mobile app, double the number of members who engaged with the app before the pandemic. And we're seeing stronger engagement, with more than 55% of e-commerce sales coming through our mobile app.\nTurning to our partnership with Target. We opened 62 Ulta Beauty at Target shops during the quarter, ending the quarter with 421 shops. Our marketing teams work closely with our target partners to build awareness for newer brands, including Billie Eilish and Ariana Grande Fragrances, [ Glamnetic ], and [ Living Proof ], while also amplifying [ Summer Prestige ] must-haves and minis. As the partnership scales, we are learning more about the Ulta Beauty at Target guests and the role this touchpoint plays in their beauty journey, and we will continue to leverage our expertise to develop unique assortments that reflect the preferences of the Ulta Beauty at Target guests.\nMoving to our third strategic pillar, operating at the Heart of the Beauty community, we are focused on driving greater love, loyalty and emotional connection with Ulta Beauty. We began this quarter with a Mother's Day campaign that highlighted exclusive cross-category gifts, including our luxury assortment and hero fragrances. Moving into June, we positioned Ulta Beauty as the destination for Summer Beauty, driving top-of-mind awareness and traffic with compelling points offers and special deals across the assortment to celebrate our members. Finally, we closed the quarter with our Big Summer Beauty Sale, a bold and disruptive event that offered opportunities to save on fan favorite beauty items across all categories and price points from a variety of established and emerging brands. These key events, paired with our culturally-relevant content amplifications, drove record-level highs in unaided awareness, with our greatest gains among Gen Z consumers.\nTurning to our loyalty program. We ended the quarter with 41.7 million active members, 9% higher than last year, driven by strong member acquisition and reactivation combined with healthy retention of existing members. Spend per member also increased, driven by greater shopper frequency. The strength of our loyalty program continues to be a powerful and differentiated strategic asset for Ulta Beauty, and we are pleased with its elevated growth and performance.\nOur continued efforts to nurture the member life cycle is driving results. We accelerated new member acquisition and continue to engage and retain members with meaningful events, compelling points offers, personalized content and special guests. These strategies also delivered growth in our Diamond and Platinum tiers, which increased nearly 30% compared to the same period last year, reflecting strong loyalty and engagement with all Ulta Beauty offers.\nTurning now to our efforts to drive operational excellence and optimization. We are executing an ambitious multiyear road map of transformation initiatives intended to unlock new capabilities and efficiencies to fuel our future growth. As we have discussed on previous calls, we are expanding and optimizing our supply chain, upgrading our enterprise resource planning platform, transitioning our digital store to a new platform, enhancing our data management systems and upgrading store POS systems.\nI am pleased to share that our teams have delivered several key milestones. Our new Greer, South Carolina market fulfillment center began receiving inventory last month, and we expect to start shipping to stores next week. We completed the installation of a new automated storage and retrieval system in our Greenwood distribution center, which will increase capacity and enable greater productivity. We expanded our ship-from-store capabilities to an additional 276 stores. Today, we fulfill e-commerce orders from 400 strategically-located stores, enabling faster, more cost-effective delivery to the guest. We successfully transitioned 2 distribution centers, Jacksonville and Greer, to our new ERP platform.\nAs part of our digital store transformation, we successfully completed a large-scale upgrade of our end-to-end e-commerce platform and migrated to a new, modernized platform that includes a new promotion engine, guest account, cart and checkout. This is a significant milestone in our multiyear effort to elevate our digital experience in a way that positions us for long-term growth in this critical channel. Finally, we completed the POS upgrade in all stores. While our transformation agenda is not finished, we have made significant progress, and I am proud of how our teams have worked to execute our plans while limiting disruption to guests and associates.\nLooking forward, we continue to operate in a dynamic environment. While consumer confidence has strengthened, there are signs pointing to moderating growth going forward. Many consumers have begun to reduce overall spending, credit card debt remains high and the restart of student loan repayments is approaching. It is unclear how these factors will impact consumer behavior in the near term, but despite these factors, Beauty has remained a bright spot.\nBased on [ Sircana's ] beauty sales data, total U.S. beauty sales for the first half of 2023 increased double digits compared to the same period last year, with Prestige beauty channels delivering higher growth than Mass beauty channels. Looking to the rest of the year, we believe growth for the U.S. beauty market will remain healthy but normalize into the mid-single digits as we lap 2 years of strong growth, experience less impact from pricing and face more economic uncertainty.\nAs category growth normalizes, we continue to expect promotional activity within the category will also normalize. Over the last 2 years, unprecedented category growth and strong demand limited promotional activity. As a result, the promotional environment in 2021 and 2022 was unsustainably low. Reflecting these factors, we planned for higher promotional activity this year but continue to expect promotions will remain well below 2019 levels.\nIn closing, we operate in an attractive and growing category. We have a strong, proven business model and a winning culture and outstanding teams. Through the first half of fiscal 2023, we have exceeded our internal financial expectations, and we remain confident we can deliver our updated expectations for the rest of the year.\nAnd now, I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott?\n\nScott M. Settersten\n\nCFO, Treasurer & Chief Accounting Officer\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone.\nAs Dave shared, we delivered second quarter financial results that were ahead of our expectations. Strong sales growth supported by healthy guest engagement and strong in-store sales performance drove better-than-expected gross margin. SG&A spend was also lower than planned, resulting in an operating margin of 15.5%.\nTurning to the P&L. Net sales for the quarter increased 10.1%, driven by 8% growth in comp sales, strong new store performance and solid growth in other revenues. Transactions for the quarter increased 9%, primarily driven by healthy traffic on both channels. Average ticket decreased 1% as the decline in average units per transaction more than offset the impact of higher average selling price. The increase in average selling price was primarily driven by the impact of retail price increases, many of which were executed last year. We estimate price increases contributed about 300 basis points to the overall comp. During the quarter, we opened 3 new stores and relocated 2 stores. In addition, we remodeled 3 stores.\nSecond quarter gross margin decreased 110 basis points to 39.3% compared to 40.4% last year. The decrease was driven by lower merchandise margin, an increase in inventory shrink and higher supply chain costs. Overall merchandise margin was lower due primarily to increased promotional activity, unfavorable category mix and less benefit from the timing of retail price changes. While promotional activity continues to normalize, it is important to note that overall promotions remain well below 2019 levels.\nInventory shrink continued to be a headwind this quarter. Our efforts to address shrink are having an impact, but the overall environment remains challenging. Today, we have the new fragrance fixtures in more than 50% of our stores and expect to have these installed in 70% of the fleet by year-end. We remain focused on taking action in areas we can control, including continued investment in fixtures, associate training, staffing as well as operational improvements, and leveraging our influence to enact broader changes that will [ disincentivize ] unlawful behavior.\nSupply chain costs were higher, primarily driven by ongoing investments in our supply chain transformation, as we made progress on the retrofit of our Dallas and Greenwood distribution centers and prepared to open our new market fulfillment center in Greer, South Carolina. These gross margin pressures were partially offset by strong growth in other revenue and leverage of store fixed costs due to top line sales growth.\nSG&A increased 12.4% to $600.7 million. SG&A increased 40 basis points to 23.7% compared to 23.3% last year. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales was driven by deleverage of corporate overhead due to strategic investments, planned increases in store payroll and benefits and higher store expenses, which more than offset lower incentive compensation. Corporate overhead expense deleveraged in the quarter primarily due to investments related to our strategic priorities, including [ Project Soar ], other IT capabilities and UB Media. Year-to-date through the second quarter, we have invested a little less than half of our planned $60 million to $70 million of incremental spend to support our strategic initiatives.\nThe increase in store payroll and benefits was primarily due to the impact of planned growth in average wage rates and increased staffing levels compared to the same period last year. Incentive compensation was a tailwind in the quarter, reflecting operational performance that is more in line with our internal targets compared to last year's significant outperformance.\nOperating income for the quarter was $391.6 million, flat to last year. As a percentage of sales, operating margin decreased 150 basis points to 15.5% compared to 17% last year. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 5.6% to $6.02 per share compared to $5.70 per share last year.\nTurning to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 9% to $1.82 billion compared to $1.67 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 37 additional stores, the increase reflects inventory to support higher demand, increases in product costs and new brand launches. Capital expenditures were $95 million for the quarter compared to $49.4 million last year. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily related to investments in IT and supply chain to support our transformational agenda, as well as merchandising investments to support the rollout of our luxury assortment and brand expansions. Depreciation was $61.9 million in the quarter compared to $60.9 million last year. We ended the quarter with $388.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 594,000 shares at a cost of $275.5 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 1.1 million shares at a cost of $559 million. At the end of the second quarter, we had $541 million remaining under our current $2 billion repurchase authorization.\nMoving to our outlook. We are updating our guidance for fiscal 2023 to reflect our better-than-expected second quarter performance. We have raised our top line expectations and now project net sales will be between $11.05 million and $11.15 billion, with comp sales growth between 4.5% and 5.5%. Our updated outlook reflects our strong first half performance while continuing to consider risks and uncertainties that could impact demand in the second half of the year, including rising consumer debt levels and the expected resumption of student loan repayments. We continue to expect comps will moderate to the low single digits in the second half of the year, and we remain on track to open 25 to 30 new stores and renovate or relocate 20 to 30 stores this year.\nReflecting our year-to-date performance, we've raised the low end of the range of operating margin and now expect operating margins for the year will be between 14.6% and 14.8% of sales, with deleverage to come fairly evenly from both gross margin and SG&A. Our expectations reflect the continuation of the trends we experienced through the first half of the year around shrink, promotional activity and supply chain costs, as well as greater headwind from lapping the merchandise margin benefits from the timing of retail price increases last year. For modeling purposes, we expect third quarter operating margin will be meaningfully more pressured than what we saw in the second quarter as we lap greater pricing benefits in the third quarter last year, as well as a shift of investment spending from Q2 to Q3. As a result, we expect earnings per share for the third quarter will be lower than last year.\nReflecting these updated assumptions, we now expect diluted earnings per share for the year will be between $25.10 and $25.60. As a reminder, fiscal 2023 is a 53-week year. We anticipate the additional week will add between $165 million to $175 million in sales and approximately $0.40 of earnings per share.\nIn closing, our results through the first 6 months of fiscal 2023 highlights the ongoing power and resilience of our business model. I'd like to thank our associates for their dedication and commitment to keeping our guests at the center of all we do and giving them more reasons to shop Ulta Beauty. As we look to the future, we are focused on capitalizing on the growth opportunities in the beauty category and executing our strategic framework to deliver long-term sustainable growth for all our stakeholders.\nAnd now, I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

Kimbell\n\nPresident & Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer, Ulta Beauty, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. Fiscal 2023 is off to a good start. For the first quarter, we delivered net sales, operating margin and diluted EPS that were consistent with our internal expectations.\nNet sales increased 12.3% to $2.6 billion, and comparable sales increased 9.3%. Operating margin was 16.8% of sales and diluted EPS increased 9.2% to $6.88 per share. Our store traffic remained healthy and member growth continued to be strong. We delivered growth across key categories, and we strengthened engagement with the Ulta Beauty brand. I want to thank our Ulta Beauty associates for their focus on creating great guest experiences while continuing to adapt to a dynamic environment and executing our transformational agenda.\nThe operating environment continues to evolve and consumers are exploring how best to navigate the economic uncertainty. Inflation concerns remain high and consumers are spending more selectively while also showing a continued willingness to splurge and treat themselves. Engagement with beauty remains strong, reflecting the prioritization of self-care. Category growth is healthy but moderating as we lap 2 years of unprecedented growth. And as category growth normalizes, promotional activity is increasing. While we do not intend to lead promotional intensity, we will respond as appropriate to protect and expand our share using a variety of tools we have developed and invested in over the last several years. Using the consumer lens of how guests experience Ulta Beauty through our multiple touch points to include our physical stores, our e-commerce business and Ulta Beauty at Target, the Ulta Beauty experience is resonating with our guests and gaining share. As we have seen in previous quarters, sales in our mass category grew faster than prestige categories. It is difficult to know with certainty if the robust growth of mass products is due to strong engagement with innovative mass brands such as e.l.f. and La Roche-Posay or due to increased consumer price sensitivity. Importantly, Ulta Beauty is the only beauty retailer that offers a wide variety of price points from entry level mass to luxury and everything in between. And as such, we are uniquely positioned to capture any consumer shifts within price points in the beauty category.\nSkin Care was our best performing category again this quarter with both prestige and mass delivering double-digit comp growth, driven primarily by newness, engaging social media content and strong performance through 21 Days of Beauty and Spring Hall. Newness from innovative brands like the ordinary Drunk Elephant and Hero Cosmetics, as well as new brands, including Bumble, Beautycounter and BIOMA, contributed to growth during the quarter. In addition, social media platforms continue driving content category engagement resulting in robust growth for dermatologist-recommended brands like La Roche-Posay and trend forward brands like CASRx. The fragrance and bath categories delivered low double-digit percent growth this quarter lapping 2 consecutive years of strong double-digit growth. Newness from Ariana Grande, Carolina Herrera and Valentino contributed meaningfully and our monthly fragrance crush program fueled strong engagement with newer brand Billie Eilish as well as established brands, Lancome and Dior. In addition, Valentine's stay gift giving was healthy across both men's and women's fragrances. Makeup delivered high single-digit growth for the quarter, driven by newness and guest engagement with 21 Days of Beauty and Spring Hall. Soft bronzing, glossy lips and expressive eyes and nails are trends driving growth for the category.\nNew brands like Dior, about-face and NATASHA DENONA drove sales during the quarter while new products from a wide range of brands, including e.l.f., NT and NIC also contributed to growth. In addition, the expansion of MAC into more stores, combined with compelling newness continued to drive sales. Finally, the hair category was flat for the quarter, with growth in hair care products and color offset by lower demand for tools as we lapped strong newness last year. products focused on hair health, including bonding scalp treatments and hydration as well as those focused on styling or resonating strongly. Newer brands like Donna's Recipe, Odell and Divi as well as new products from masstige brands Eva Nyc, Batiste and Andrew Fitzsimmons were notable drivers for the category. Trend-relevant products from Way, Redken and Kenra resonated with guests while engaging social media content drove healthy growth for May and IGK.\nOur services business delivered double-digit comp growth again this quarter, driven by growth in cut and style, blowout and makeup services. As we have expanded our service offerings and enhanced our stylist talent, more members are using services. And our salon back bar takeovers will give our stylists a unique opportunity to introduce new brands and products to guests drove sales growth and new member acquisition for participating brands. Now similar to what other retailers have shared, we continue to see pressure from inventory shrink this quarter and we have updated our full year guidance to reflect the persistence of this trend. While shrink is the result of various factors, theft, specifically organized retail crime or ORC is an increasingly concerning challenge, especially as we've seen a rise in violence and aggression during these incidents.\nOur first priority is the safety and well-being of our associates and our guests. We are committed to ensuring a safe work environment and are investing in fixtures, training, support structures and increased staffing and security to aggressively address this concerning trend. ORC impacts all of our stakeholders, guests, associates, brand partners, investors and communities, and it will not be solved by retailers alone.\nGiven the complexity, it will take collaboration across retail, manufacturing, law enforcement and legislative levels to solve these problems. Now working together, I am optimistic we can create meaningful impact and bring forward creative, sustainable solutions to restore safe shopping experiences for everyone. As we have previously discussed, beauty is not immune to macroeconomic challenges, but has historically been more resilient compared to other discretionary categories due to its deep emotional connection with consumers. We believe this connection is even greater today given the importance of beauty as a form of self-care and wellness. As we navigate this dynamic operating environment, our strategic framework guides our priorities and positions us to build on our market leadership and drive long-term profitable growth.\nLet me give you an update on the progress we've made against this framework in the first quarter. Starting with our efforts to drive growth with an expanded definition of All Things Beauty, our strategy is to the light beauty enthusiast with our thoughtfully curated assortment focused on inclusivity and leading trends. During the first quarter, we further enhanced our assortment with the launch of several exciting brands, including NATASHA DENONA, luxury artistry brand known for high-quality makeup pallets across eye, base and cheek, Beautycounter, a clean beauty pioneer, offering high-performing skincare and makeup with unmatched ingredient safety standards and Odell a hair care brand focused on clean, accessible products for the whole family. To drive engagement and capture additional market share this quarter, we launched luxury at Ulta Beauty in 200 stores and on ulta.com. Driven by social platforms and strong Gen Z interest, luxury brands are fueling beauty category growth.\nOur vision for luxury at Ulta Beauty is to provide guests with a uniquely modern luxury beauty experience. strategically curated to reflect what guests are engaging most in, including iconic luxury with brands like Dior and Lancome, Absolute, clean luxury with brands like our glass and Chanel Numero and Luxe artistry brands like NATASHA DENONA. In addition to strengthening our core assortment, we continue to expand, evolve and amplify our cross-category platforms.\nLet me share some first quarter highlights. We ended the quarter with 306 brands certified and at least one conscious beauty pillar, including newly certified brands, Nutritious VyesteLauder, Winky Lux and Maya. In celebration of Earth Day, to promote sustainability and the drive discovery, we launched a collectible Ulta Beauty reusable tote and a conscious beauty essential sample kit with Hero products from 14 certified brands, including Bouche, Beekman 1802 and ACURE. We continue to support black-owned and founded brands with the launch of new brands, HANAHANA Beauty and gold. We created a black-owned and founded brands discovery kit featuring 11 brands and 100% of the purchase price of this kit was donated to Big Brothers Big Sisters of America.\nIn recognition of Black History Month, we celebrated and supported the Black community through rich owed to Black Beauty storytelling and used our digital and social platforms to highlight innovative brands like new sugar, Beauty Bakery and Sunday to Sunday. As we meet beauty enthusiasts, wherever they are on their beauty journey all in your world, we are investing to enhance guest experiences across all of our touch points. This quarter, we completed the 2-year phased rollout of the guest-facing element of our digital store, delivering a fresh, innovative front-end guest experience across both ulta.com and our app. Today, guests enjoy more seamless navigation and checkout experiences can discover and browse new experiences, including buy more, save more, Luxury at Ulta Beauty and our new foundation finder and also benefit from enhanced search and recommendation capabilities.\nLater this year, we will finish the transition by converting our back-end infrastructure to support enhanced checkout, order and inventory management and pricing and promotion capabilities. The completion of the front end of our digital store is a major milestone in our journey to enhance our omnichannel experiences. And it is worth noting our teams executed these changes while maintaining an active digital platform and delivering our e-commerce growth goals.\nWhile we experienced some minor disruption during the transition, I am proud of how our digital, IT and guest services teams have worked together while minimizing the guest impact. To support omnichannel guest experience is -- we continue to expand our buy anywhere, fill anywhere capabilities. This quarter, we introduced same-day delivery in 6 new markets, bringing the number of stores with this convenient option to 540 stores across 18 markets. In addition, we're making it easier for store associates to assist guests in ordering products online when not available in store through our upgraded POS system. We have refreshed store POS systems in 1,100 stores and are on track to complete this transition before holiday.\nTurning to our partnership with Target. We opened 4 Ulta Beauty shops in the quarter, ending with 359 locations. This touch point introduces new guest old to beauty and enables reengagement of lapsed guests, and we are leveraging our CRM capabilities to ensure bounce back to Ulta Beauty. Our dedicated field team continues to support the support and partnership with training and field engagement, and we are working together with our target partners to deliver an outstanding guest experience.\nBeauty is a personal emotionally connected category. To increase consideration loyalty and engagement, we are creating authentic connections with our guests with work that sits at the heart of the beauty community. In the first quarter, we executed impactful activations around key cultural moments, including Black History Month, Prom and Earth Day and delivered improved brand health metrics with significant increases in awareness across Gen Z Black and Hispanic consumers. These trends confirm that the Ulta Beauty brand is continually becoming stronger, more relevant and more meaningful to guests. We ended the first quarter with 1 million active members, 9% higher than the first quarter last year, driven by new member acquisition, lapsed member reactivation and healthy retention rates. Spend per member also increased driven primarily by trip frequency and growth of Elite members. Increased visibility, personalized reminders and incentives are driving growth of Diamond and Platinum members.\nAt the end of the first quarter, the number of members in these higher tiers increased more than 30% compared to the same period last year, which is a strong indicator of high loyalty and elevated engagement in all that Ulta Beauty has to offer. Our multifaceted go-to-market plan to drive member growth and nurture the member life cycle is delivering results.\nTo drive new member acquisition and reactivate lapsed members, we refreshed store associate training and created new tools to help associates communicate the program's benefits. We enhanced the integration of our loyalty program across our refreshed digital experiences and introduced guest-facing signage in stores to drive awareness. And we executed targeted reactivation campaigns and tested new personalized digital communications to improve retention and contactability.\nTurning to UB Media, our Retail Media Network, we are harnessing the power of our exclusive first-party data to transform the way our brands connect with beauty enthusiasts. With dedicated resources and new tools in place, this quarter, we engaged with more brands manage more digital campaigns and expanded our product portfolio to include advertising opportunities on Ulta-owned digital properties. As UB Media continues to scale, we are confident it will add meaningful value to our company over time.\nReflecting our priority to drive operational excellence and optimization, we are executing an ambitious multiyear road map of transformation initiatives, which will unlock new capabilities and operation -- operating efficiencies to fuel our future growth. We are upgrading our enterprise resource planning platform, expanding and optimizing our supply chain with new facilities, systems and processes, transitioning our digital store to modern technology and architecture while upgrading our order management system, expanding our data management systems to enable further analytical capabilities and upgrading POS systems in all stores. We have made good progress against our road map and expect to deliver major milestones over the next several months. While change of this magnitude can be disruptive, our teams have consistently moved quickly and collaboratively to limit impact to guests and associates. Our success is enabled by our people. and we are investing purposely in our teams to protect and cultivate our world-class culture and talent.\nIn the first quarter, we launched a refreshed and modernized Ulta Beauty competency model across the enterprise to drive further consistency in talent management processes, establish clear measures of success and enhance culture with common language. We also launched a new service award recognition program to elevate the associate experience and reward associates in meaningful ways. And we hosted our annual field leadership meeting, bringing together our general managers, district managers, field support teams and brand partners for several days of recognition, leadership development and product education. I walked away from this event inspired by our talented associates and their passion for serving our guests and driving Ulta Beauty's growth. Finally, we continue to expand our environmental and social impact. This quarter, we partnered with PAC collective to test the packaging recycling program in select locations with the goal of collecting the beauty industry is hard to recycle packaging so that it is diverted from landfills and put to its highest and best use. We also published our 2022 ESG report which describes our approach to priorities in these areas and provide key updates on our ESG initiatives, their connectedness to our business and the positive impact of beauty as a force for good.\nIn closing, fiscal 2023 is off to a good start. Our teams are executing well against an ambitious transformational agenda while navigating a dynamic environment. While we expect the operating environment will continue to evolve we are confident the resilience of the category combined with the power of our proven business model and world-class team position Ulta Beauty for continued profitable growth.\nAnd now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott?\n\nScott M. Settersten\n\nCFO, Treasurer & Chief Accounting Officer\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave said earlier, today, we reported results for the first quarter that were generally in line with our expectations. We entered 2023 anticipating that the unprecedented growth in the beauty category would moderate and that the promotional environment would increase. These trends materialized in the first quarter and are reflected in our results.\nStarting with the income statement. Net sales for the quarter increased 12.3%, driven by 9.3% growth in comp sales and strong new store performance. In addition, other revenue increased $19 million, primarily due to growth in both credit card income and royalty income from our target partnership. The comp sales growth for the quarter was driven by an 11% increase in transactions, primarily due to double-digit growth in store traffic, which more than offset a 1.5% decline in average ticket. The decline in average ticket reflected lower units per transaction which more than offset higher average selling price. We estimate that product price increases, most of which were executed last year, contributed about 400 basis points to the overall countries.\nLooking at the cadence of sales through the quarter, momentum from post-holiday tailwinds continued into February, which also benefited from lapping a coded headwinds last year. Comp sales subsequently moderated to mid-single digits as we move through the quarter. During the quarter, we opened 5 new stores and closed 1 store. In addition, we relocated 1 store and remodeled 2 stores. For the quarter, gross margin was down 10 basis points compared to the same period last year at 40% of sales. Higher inventory shrink, lower merchandise margin, higher supply chain costs, and deleverage of salon expenses were partially offset by strong growth in other revenue and leverage of store fixed costs. As Dave shared earlier, we continue to experience a worsening trend of theft and organized retail crime. We are actively working to stabilize and mitigate these trends through investments in staffing, training and fixtures, and we are working collaboratively with law enforcement and third-party organizations to address these challenges. In addition to greater pressure from shrink, gross margin was acted by lower merchandise margin, primarily due to increased promotional activity and category mix shifts, which more than offset benefit from price increases. We also incurred additional costs in the quarter related to our supply chain optimization efforts.\nSG&A increased 22.2% to $612 million, which was slightly better than our plan. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased 180 basis points to 23.2% compared to 21.4% last year, primarily due to deleverage of store payroll and benefits corporate overhead and marketing expense, partially offset by leverage of incentive compensation and store expenses due to higher sales. Store payroll and benefits expense increased driven primarily by higher average wage rates and increased staffing levels compared to the same period last year. Corporate overhead expense deleveraged in the quarter primarily due to investments related to our strategic priorities, including Project SOAR, other IT capabilities and UB media. Marketing expense increased, reflecting investment in strategies to drive member acquisition and retention, increase brand awareness, and expand Omni member penetration.\nOperating margin was 16.8% of sales compared to 18.7% of sales in the first quarter of 2022. As expected, the decline in operating margin primarily reflects the impact of SG&A deleverage and lapping our extraordinary results in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Net interest income for the quarter increased to $7.3 million, driven by higher average interest rates and higher average cash balances during the quarter. The company's tax rate decreased to 22.8% compared to 24.2% in the first quarter last year. The lower effective tax rate is primarily due to greater benefit from income tax accounting for stock-based compensation. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 9.2% to $6.88 compared to $6.30 last year.\nMoving on to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 11.5% to $1.8 billion compared to $1.6 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 41 net new stores, the increase reflects the impact of higher purchases to support demand, product cost increases and inventory to support new brand launches and expansion of existing brands. Capital expenditures were $109.8 million for the quarter compared to $71.1 million last year. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily related to investments in IT and supply chain, as well as new remodeled and relocated stores. Depreciation decreased to $57.9 million compared to $62.8 million last year, primarily due to lower store depreciation and a shift of IT investments from capital to cloud expense. We ended the quarter with $636.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. In the first quarter, we repurchased 541,000 shares at a cost of $285.8 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $816 million remaining under our current $2 billion repurchase authorization.\nTurning now to our outlook. We have refined our expectations for the full year to reflect our first quarter actual performance and recent trends. We are maintaining our expectations for annual comp sales growth and diluted earnings per share but are updating our outlook for operating margin. We continue to expect comp sales growth for the year will be between 4% and 5% with growth moderating as we move through the year. As we shared on our last call, we expect comp growth for the first half to be in the upper single-digit range and then moderate to low single-digit growth in the second half. We now expect operating margin for the full year will be between 14.5% and 14.8% of sales, primarily reflecting an updated view of gross margin. We have increased our expectations for gross margin deleverage from our original outlook to include the impact of higher shrink and a more competitive and promotional environment. We continue to expect SG&A deleverage driven primarily by $60 million to $70 million of incremental spend to support strategic investments as well as the impact of ongoing inflationary pressures. We have updated our assumptions for interest income to reflect the current interest rate environment and are now planning for about $17 million of interest income for the year. We have also incorporated our first quarter tax rate into our full year forecast and now expect the effective tax rate for the year will be approximately 23.8%. These assumptions result in guidance for diluted earnings per share in the range of $24.70 to $25.40 per share.\nIn closing, fiscal 2023 is off to a solid start. We remain optimistic about the health of the beauty category, confident in our team and our growth strategies and steadfast in our belief that our proven business model uniquely positions us to deliver for our guests, associates and shareholders.\nAnd now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session.",

Kimbell\n\nCEO & Director, Ulta Beauty, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. Our fourth quarter was a strong end to a record-setting year. For the first time in our 33-year history, our annual revenue surpassed $10 billion, and our annual net income exceeded $1 billion. In addition, we expanded our loyalty program to more than 40 million members. Achieving such meaningful milestones reflects healthy consumer engagement with the beauty category, the power of Ulta Beauty's highly differentiated model and the impact of our winning culture and outstanding teams.\nThe Ulta Beauty team continues to execute with excellence and inspire me daily with their passion and leadership. I want to thank all of our associates for their commitment to delivering great guest experiences and for working together as one team to move our business forward. I am honored to lead such a great company of talented associates who bring our mission, vision and values to life for all of our stakeholders.\nNow to the results. Starting with the fourth quarter, net sales increased 18.2% to $3.2 billion. Operating profit increased to 13.9% of sales, and diluted EPS increased 23.5% to $6.68 per share. Sales of all major categories exceeded our expectations, and we saw solid sales momentum across both our store and digital channels.\nAdditionally, we continued to see healthy growth in spend per member across all income demographics. This broad-based strength reflects successful execution of our key fourth quarter events, including holiday, Jumbo Love and Love Your Skin. Our holiday marketing plan, which included new television advertising, engaging storytelling and robust digital and social support, delivered strong guest engagement and drove significant increases in top-of-mind awareness. Our holiday gifting assortment, which was thoughtfully curated across every category and budget, resonated with guests, and our innovative and inclusive gift card program delivered strong double-digit growth across Ulta Beauty-owned and third-party channels.\nTurning to performance by category. All major categories delivered double-digit growth again this quarter, and we increased our market share in prestige beauty versus the fourth quarter last year based on data from the NPD Group.\nSkin care delivered the strongest growth this quarter with double-digit growth in both prestige and mass. Growth in the quarter was primarily driven by serums, moisturizers, acne treatments and holiday gift sets. Guests engaged with newness from brands like Drunk Elephant, The Ordinary and Hero cosmetics. While dermatology-based brands like La Roche-Posay and CeraVe also resonated strongly with guests. Our successful Love Your Skin event also contributed to the category's strong growth.\nIn addition to converting members to the skin care category with prestige skin care offers, we also introduced guests to our wellness assortment with new beauty steals from a variety of brands, including Truly, Love Wellness and Sugarbear.\nThe fragrance and bath category delivered another quarter of double-digit growth on top of strong double-digit growth last year. Compelling newness from luxury brands like Burberry, YSL and Dior as well as exclusive newness from Billie Eilish and Ariana Grande including her latest fragrance, MOD, contributed to the positive growth. In addition, the category benefited from strong engagement with our exclusive holiday fragrance gift sets and monthly Fragrance Crush programs.\nGrowth of the makeup category accelerated from the third quarter with double-digit growth in both prestige and mass makeup. Top subcategories were base and lip driven by newness in foundation, concealers and lip balms and glosses. New brands like Fenty Beauty, r.e.m. beauty and recently launched Dior contributed to growth during the quarter, while new products from a wide range of brands, including Tarte, e.l.f., NYX and Clinique also continued to engage guests.\nFinally, hair care delivered double-digit growth driven by newness and innovation focused on hair health. Newer brands like OLAPLEX, MAËLYS and recently launched Donna's Recipe contributed to the quarter's growth. Our Jumbo Love event drove healthy growth for key professional brands like Pureology, Redken and Biolage as well as masstige brands, KRISTIN ESS and Batiste.\nHair tools continued to experience broad softness as we lapped strong newness last year. Our services business also delivered strong double-digit growth again this quarter, driven by an increase in transactions. Leveraging our CRM capabilities, we continue to welcome new members to services while increasing frequency with members who already engaged in our service offering. And the salon back bar takeovers which give our stylists a unique opportunity to introduce new brands and products to guests, help drive growth and new member acquisition for OUAI and Bumble and bumble.\nNow turning to the full year. Strong consumer demand and outstanding execution by our teams fueled broad-based strength across our business. Net sales for the year increased 18.3% to $10.2 billion. Operating profit increased to 16.1% of sales, and diluted EPS increased 33.5% to a record $24.01 per share.\nIn 2021, we introduced a new strategic framework designed to guide our priorities and enable Ulta Beauty to expand our market leadership and drive profitable growth. Let me share a few highlights of the progress we made against this framework in fiscal 2022.\nOur first strategic pillar is to drive growth through an expanded definition of All Things Beauty. And this year, we continued to enhance our offerings to engage and excite beauty enthusiasts. All major categories delivered double-digit comp growth, and we increased our market share in prestige beauty versus fiscal 2021 based on data from the NPD Group.\nWe strengthened our assortment with the addition of leading brands in every major category, including Fenty Beauty, Dior, BYOMA and MAËLYS and expanded MAC and Chanel Beauté into more doors. We also introduced guests to exciting emerging brands, including about-face, Divi, sk*p and Vacation through our Sparked platform.\nWe enhanced conscious beauty at Ulta Beauty, ending the year with 300 brands certified in at least 1 conscious beauty pillar and made it easier for guests to identify brands and products that reflect their values in this important space. We added 12 black-owned and founded brands to our assortment and launched our Muse Accelerator program to help early-stage BIPOC brands prepare for retail readiness. And we expanded The Wellness Shop to an additional 330 stores and enhanced our online offering to include intimate wellness.\nTurning now to our second strategic pillar, All In Your World. We're focused on evolving guest experiences through a personalized connected omni-channel ecosystem. In fiscal 2022, we continued to enhance the guest experience across all our touch points. We expanded our physical footprint, opening 47 new stores and renovating or relocating 32 stores. We relaunched makeup services and introduced new salon services, including curl-specific treatments and extensions. These enhancements, combined with record-setting stylist productivity and increased transactions, resulted in strong double-digit growth for our services business.\nReflecting our efforts to enhance our buy anywhere, fill anywhere capabilities, we expanded our same-day delivery offering to 6 new markets and delivered significant improvement in guest satisfaction with the BOPIS experience. Between BOPIS, same-day delivery and ship from store capabilities, 31% of our digital orders this year were fulfilled by stores, up from 28% last year.\nWe also created new digital experiences through the phased refresh of our digital store and the expansion of virtual try-on capabilities, including GLAMlab Skin Advisor 2.0 and the hair style try-on.\nFinally, our successful partnership with Target continued to grow with the opening of 254 additional Ulta Beauty at Target shop-in-shop locations. We also created a dedicated field team to help unlock greater opportunity with the partnership, and through engaging store visits and communications, this team had a positive impact on staffing, training and loyalty.\nMoving to our third strategic pillar, expanding and deepening our engagement with guests by ensuring Ulta Beauty operates at the heart of the beauty community. During the year, we continued to drive guest love, loyalty and share of wallet, and our efforts created stronger, more emotional connections with our guests. Overall, unaided awareness grew significantly with meaningful gains among key audiences including Gen Z, Hispanic and Black beauty consumers.\nImportantly, we increased the number of active members in our loyalty program by more than 3 million members, ending fiscal 2022 with a record-breaking 40.2 million Ultamate Reward members, who shopped more frequently and spent more with us on average. And we launched our retail media network, UB Media, with a dedicated sales team and supported by new processes and tools.\nOur fourth strategic pillar is to drive operational excellence and optimization to enable us to capture additional market share on guest experience enhancements and deliver future profitable growth. In fiscal 2022, we made progress on a number of initiatives that will enable us to scale more easily, including successfully executing Phase 1 of Project SOAR, our 3-year effort to upgrade our enterprise resource planning platform on time and on budget.\nIn addition to successfully navigating inflationary pressures in wages and fuel, we initiated a multiyear supply chain optimization effort, breaking ground on our first market fulfillment center and beginning the planned retrofit of our Greenwood distribution center. Both facilities are on track to be fully operational in fiscal 2023.\nOur winning culture is key to driving our success, so our fifth strategic pillar is focused on protecting and cultivating our world-class culture and talent. Our vision is to create a highly aligned, engaged workforce and an inclusive workplace that creates opportunities for our people and our business, and I am proud of the progress we made last year.\nWith strong participation rates in our annual company-wide engagement survey, our overall engagement remains high and continued to exceed retail benchmarks. And our investments in our team and culture enabled us to promote more than 11,000 associates into new roles and improve associate retention across the enterprise.\nFinally, our sixth strategic pillar is to expand our environmental and social impact. As the largest U.S. beauty retailer, we can influence how the world sees beauty while driving positive impact. In fiscal 2022, we delivered on our DEI commitments by investing $50 million across our major areas of focus, including multicultural media to amplify underrepresented voices, dedicated support for BIPOC brands, and associate training to reinforce inclusivity and address unconscious bias.\nOn the environmental side, we continue to reduce our energy usage through the expansion of our LED lighting retrofit program to an additional 100 stores and our Chambersburg DC as well as additional energy efficiency project in select stores. We also enhanced our ESG disclosures in our second ESG report and submitted emissions targets to The Science Based Target Initiative, a globally recognized organization that validates these targets.\nFiscal 2022 was an outstanding year, and I am incredibly proud of our associates' dedication to delivering value for all stakeholders while building the foundation for the future. As we move into fiscal 2023, we remain optimistic about the strength and resiliency of the beauty category and the opportunities for Ulta Beauty. Over the last 2 years, the U.S. beauty category experienced unprecedented growth, reflecting various factors such as product innovation, expanding regimens, new social media platforms, return to work and resumed social activities, and the elevated connection between beauty and overall self-care.\nIn addition to these consumer drivers, an elevated level of price increases also contributed to growth for the category. While some are unique to the post-pandemic recovery, we believe other factors will continue driving growth for the category. Importantly, consumer engagement with beauty is stronger than ever and is more connected with wellness. These factors give us confidence that the growth of the U.S. beauty category will remain healthy but moderate to the higher end of the category's historical annual growth rate of between 2% and 5%, barring a major economic event.\nBuilding on the progress made in fiscal 2022, we intend to continue executing against our strategic framework to further expand our market leadership, drive profitable growth and transform our business for the future in fiscal 2023. Starting with our consumer-centric strategic pillars, we will continue to innovate, evolve and expand All Things Beauty to excite and engage the beauty enthusiast. Today, Ulta Beauty is the preferred destination for mass and prestige beauty. To maintain this leadership and capture additional market share, we will continue to add relevant brands to our assortment across categories and price points.\nAdditionally, building on customer insights and strong engagement with our current portfolio of luxury brands, we see luxury beauty as an emerging opportunity. In fiscal 2023, we will expand our luxury beauty offering with an engaging experience in select stores and an elevated presence on ulta.com. In addition to strengthening our core assortment, we will continue to expand, evolve and amplify our cross-category platforms, including Conscious Beauty, our BIPOC-founded brands, The Wellness Shop and Sparked, our emerging brands platform.\nAs we meet beauty enthusiasts, wherever they are in their beauty journey, All In Your World, we will continue to invest in our omni-channel experiences. Our physical footprint is a strategic advantage, and we plan to open 25 to 30 net new stores and remodel or relocate 20 to 30 stores throughout the year. As we expand our physical footprint, we will also accelerate growth across digital platforms, supported by the completed transition of our digital store to a modern technology and architecture as well as the expansion of our buy anywhere, fill anywhere capabilities.\nOur partnership with Target will continue to expand as we support additional Ulta Beauty at Target shops, evolve the assortment and leverage our dedicated field team to deliver elevated guest experiences. This newest touch point is introducing new guests to Ulta Beauty, and we intend to leverage our customer insights and CRM capabilities to continue driving additional member acquisition and bounce back to Ulta Beauty.\nTo operate at the heart of the beauty community, we will continue to create and nurture authentic meaningful connections with our guests to drive stronger relevance and brand consideration, especially with key constituents. We plan to expand the power of our loyalty program by enhancing our media mix to acquire new members and elevate the loyalty program throughout our digital shopping experience.\nWe plan to leverage our analytics and data insights further to reactivate lapsed guests, increased retention and shift share of wallet. And we intend to leverage our digital and physical assets to drive greater omni-channel member penetration. Finally, we plan to accelerate UB Media to capture greater demand from our brand partners. Building on the foundation established in 2022, we will offer new opportunities on Ulta-owned properties and enhanced existing products with advanced reporting and optimized audience selection.\nTurning now to our operational excellence and optimization efforts. In fiscal 2023, we plan to implement the next phase of Project SOAR, transitioning key supply chain and merchandising processes to the new platform. We will continue our supply chain optimization efforts as we complete the retrofit of our Greenwood DC and the opening of our first market fulfillment center. In addition, we will begin the retrofit of our Dallas DC and construction of our second market fulfillment center here in Bolingbrook, Illinois. This new facility will replace our existing Romeoville facility and transition our experienced team to a new state-of-the-art facility. In addition to these transformation initiatives, we will leverage our established continuous improvement capabilities to drive additional cost efficiencies.\nOur success is enabled by our world-class culture. Values-based and anchored in caring for each other, the Ulta Beauty culture attracts and retains top talent who deliver great guest experiences across multiple channels every day. To protect and cultivate our culture and enable future business performance, we will invest purposefully in our associates and teams. This year, we plan to modernize our talent strategy and planning practices, enrich our learning and development offerings, and enable a leading DEI ecosystem.\nFinally, in 2023, we will stay focused on our environmental and social impact. Being good stewards of resources, taking care of each other and creating a positive impact on the world is part of our DNA, and our ESG priorities are integrated into our guest-facing, operational excellence and culture strategies.\nBuilding on progress made to date, we expect The Science Based Targets Initiative to take action on our submission in the first quarter, and based on their feedback, we plan to develop a road map to achieve our emission reduction targets. We also plan to launch packaging, recycling and reusable bag pilots as we explore ways to support a more sustainable beauty industry. We will continue working to expand our DEI efforts to amplify underrepresented voices, support Black entrepreneurs in the business industry, ensure inclusivity remains a top priority in every guest engagement, and foster an inclusive bias-free and equitable workplace for all associates.\nAnd we will continue to strengthen our corporate governance practices. Over the last several years, our Board has updated our governance guidelines to better express our commitment to diversity, implemented an age limit for directors to encourage Board refreshment and updated committee charters to address oversight of ESG risks. This year, our Board will propose, for stockholder approval, changes to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, which, among other things, will declassify the Board and provide for the annual election of each director for 1-year terms.\nIf approved, the Board will be fully declassified by our 2025 annual stockholder meeting. These proactive measures reflect our commitment to operating with best-in-class governance practices. More detail about these proposed changes will be provided in our 2023 proxy statements.\nIn closing, the Ulta Beauty team delivered an outstanding performance in fiscal 2022, on top of a very strong performance in fiscal '21. As we look to 2023, I am optimistic about our opportunities to expand our market leadership and drive profitable growth. We are leaders in a culturally relevant growing category with a strong proven business model and a winning culture with outstanding associates who are passionate about caring for our guests and each other.\nI remain confident we will continue to lead the category and move beauty forward in ways that have a positive impact on our guests, our associates and the communities we serve.\nAnd now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott?\n\nScott M. Settersten\n\nCFO, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary, Ulta Beauty, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our financial results, I want to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to our teams for delivering these exceptional results for our shareholders. We have long known our associates are our competitive advantage, and this year's results are an ongoing reflection of their relentless commitment to our guests and to executing with excellence.\nNow to our fourth quarter results beginning with the income statement. Results for the quarter were well ahead of our expectations, primarily driven by strong holiday sales and robust guest demand, which accelerated post holiday.\nSales growth across both physical and digital channels were stronger than expected, resulting in less gross margin deleverage than planned and greater SG&A leverage. As a result, operating margin increased to 13.9% for the quarter. Net sales for the quarter increased 18.2%, driven by 15.6% growth in comp sales and strong new store performance.\nIn addition, other revenue increased $18 million, primarily due to credit card income growth and an increase in royalty income from our partnership with Target. The growth in comp sales was primarily a result of a 13.6% increase in transactions driven by double-digit growth in store traffic. Average ticket increased 1.8% driven by higher average selling price, which more than offset lower units per transaction. Similar to last quarter, we estimate that product price increases contributed about 500 basis points to the overall comp increase.\nLooking at the cadence of sales through the quarter, sales moderated in November from the third quarter trend as we lapped more challenging comparisons, but well-executed holiday plans drove strong results and momentum that accelerated in January. Post-holiday results benefited from robust guest traffic in stores and the lapping of weather and impacts from COVID-19 variants during the same period last year. During the quarter, we opened 12 new stores, relocated 1 and remodeled 12 stores.\nFor the quarter, gross margin was flat compared to the same period last year at 37.6%. Leverage of fixed costs, favorable channel mix shifts and strong growth in other revenue were offset by higher inventory shrink. The impact of promotional activity was flat compared to last year.\nConsistent with trends we experienced in the first 3 quarters of the year, in the fourth quarter, robust top line growth delivered significant fixed cost leverage. Channel mix was favorable as the penetration of e-commerce sales was about 270 basis points lower than last year, and solid growth in other revenue was primarily driven by increased credit card income and royalties earned through our Target partnership.\nSG&A increased 17% to $763 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&A decreased 20 basis points to 23.6% compared to 23.8% last year, primarily due to leverage in marketing expenses and incentive compensation due to higher sales, partially offset by deleverage of store payroll and benefits and corporate overhead.\nMarketing expenses during the quarter were lower as a percentage of sales compared to the same period last year. As we have discussed on previous calls, this year, we offset the incremental marketing expense of digital campaigns we manage for our brand partners with vendor income that is a direct reimbursement for these specific costs within total marketing expense. We will begin to cycle this change in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.\nIncentive compensation drove 50 basis points of leverage in the quarter, primarily driven by higher sales and a shift in the timing of bonus accruals for store associates. Offsetting these benefits, corporate overhead expense was higher than the same period last year, primarily reflecting investments related to our strategic priorities, including Project SOAR and other IT capabilities, UB Media and Ulta Beauty at Target.\nStore payroll and benefits spend in the quarter was higher than last year driven by an increase in the number of store associates and higher average wage rates. Operating margin was 13.9% compared to 13.8% last year. Healthy top line growth driven primarily by stores combined with the impact of our ongoing cost optimization efforts supported better operating margin performance.\nThe company's tax rate increased to 24.6% compared to 22.9% in the fourth quarter last year. A higher effective tax rate is primarily due to less benefit from income tax accounting for share-based compensation and state tax credits.\nDiluted GAAP earnings per share increased 23.5% to $6.68 compared to $5.41 last year.\nTo recap the full year, net sales increased 18.3% to $10.2 billion. Comp sales increased 15.6% driven by a 10.8% increase in transactions and a 4.3% increase in average ticket. We estimate that product price increases contributed about 400 basis points to the overall comp increase for the year. Operating profit increased to 16.1% of sales primarily driven by strong revenue growth, and diluted EPS increased 33.5% to a record $24.01 per share.\nMoving on to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 7% to $1.6 billion compared to $1.5 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 47 new stores, the increase reflects inventory purchases to support new brand launches and brand expansions as well as the impact of inventory cost increases.\nOur well-established business model continues to generate significant cash from operations, including more than $1.4 billion in fiscal 2022. Our capital allocation philosophy remains consistent. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business to drive future growth followed by returning excess cash to our shareholders.\nIn fiscal 2022, we invested $312 million in capital expenditures, including approximately $136 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $74 million for IT, $70 million for supply chain, and $32 million for store maintenance and other. Depreciation for the year was $241 million compared to $268 million last year primarily due to a shift of IT investments from capital to cloud expense.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we repurchased 722,000 shares at a cost of $328 million, bringing total share repurchases to $900 million for the year. Since launching our stock buyback program in 2014, we purchased more than 16 million shares at a weighted average price of $293, effectively returning $4.8 billion to shareholders while continuing to invest in strategic growth drivers.\nTurning to our outlook for fiscal 2023. We ended fiscal 2022 with strong momentum and are confident the U.S. beauty category will remain healthy. Our financial expectations reflect this optimism but are risk adjusted to reflect an uncertain macro environment, increasing competitive pressures and the reality that we will lap 2 years of stronger-than-expected performance.\nSpecifically for fiscal 2023, we plan to open between 25 and 30 net new stores and remodel or relocate 20 to 30 existing stores. As we shared on our last earnings call, we are seeing project delays resulting from external real estate and construction issues as well as supply chain disruption for key equipment. We continue to expect to open about 100 stores over the next 2 years, but the timing of openings are expected to shift between fiscal 2023 and 2024 as we navigate these external challenges.\nWe expect net sales will increase 7% to 8% with comp sales growth between 4% and 5%. We anticipate comp growth in the first half will be in the upper single-digit range driven by stronger growth in the first quarter and then moderate to low single-digit growth in the second half of the year. We expect operating margin for the year will be between 14.7% and 15% of sales driven primarily by SG&A deleverage, reflecting investments to support our strategic priorities and higher store expenses as well as ongoing wage pressures.\nWe expect gross margin will deleverage modestly as we lap benefits from the timing of retail price changes in 2022 and plan for a more normalized promotional environment in 2023. We expect to invest an incremental $60 million to $70 million to support our strategic priorities, including Project SOAR, our digital store and other IT capabilities and UB Media. In fiscal 2022, we invested $52 million to support our strategic agenda.\nThese assumptions result in guidance for diluted earnings per share in the range of $24.70 to $25.40 per share, including the impact of approximately $900 million in share repurchases. As a reminder, fiscal 2023 will be a 53-week year. We anticipate the additional week will add between $165 million to $175 million in sales and approximately $0.40 of earnings per share.\nFinally, we plan to spend between $400 million to $475 million in CapEx, including approximately $200 million to $220 million for supply chain and IT; $155 million to $205 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures; and $45 million to $50 million for store maintenance and other. We expect depreciation for the year will be between $245 million to $250 million.\nIn closing, our business has recovered from the pandemic faster than initially expected. Our annual net sales this year exceeded $10 billion, which is 2 years earlier than planned and when combined with our ongoing efforts to optimize our model, has enabled record profitability. In fiscal 2022, operating margin was a record 16.1% of sales as compared to 12.1% in fiscal 2019 driven primarily by fixed cost leverage, higher merchandise margin and other revenue growth, partially offset by shrink and channel mix.\nWhile stronger revenue growth has resulted in a meaningful improvement compared to pre-pandemic levels, our efforts to optimize our model through this period of disruption are delivering sustainable benefits. As a result, we are updating our expectations for operating margins. We remain confident we can deliver comp sales growth between 3% to 5% but now believe we can maintain operating margins between 14% to 15% of sales over the next few years. We believe the outlook for the beauty category is bright, and we are confident our strategic framework and strong financial foundation will enable us to drive long-term growth and shareholder returns.\nAnd now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. And it is now my pleasure to introduce Ms. Kiley Rawlins, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Rawlins, please proceed.\n\nKiley F. Rawlins\n\nVP of IR, Ulta Beauty, Inc.\n\nThank you, John. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our discussion of Ulta Beauty's results for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Hosting our call are Dave Kimbell, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Kecia Steelman, Chief Operating Officer, will join us for the Q&A session.\nThis afternoon, we announced our financial results for the third quarter. A copy of the press release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind you of the company's safe harbor language. The statements contained in this conference call, which are not historical facts, may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual future results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the company's filings with the SEC.\nWe caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today, December 1, 2022. We have no obligation to update or revise our forward-looking statements, except as required by law, and you should not expect us to do so.\nWe'll begin this afternoon with prepared remarks from Dave and Scott. Following our prepared comments, we'll open the call for questions. To allow us to accommodate as many questions as possible during the hour scheduled for this call, we respectfully ask that you limit your time to one question and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you requeue. And as always, the IR team will be available for any follow-up questions after the call.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave?\n\nDavid C. Kimbell\n\nCEO & Director, Ulta Beauty, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. The Ulta Beauty team delivered outstanding performance this quarter with strong revenue growth driving operating margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth. We accomplished these results because the Ulta Beauty teams continue to execute at a high level, and I want to thank all of our associates for their commitment to delivering great guest experiences, ensuring operational excellence, strengthening our culture and working together as one team to move our business forward as the leader in beauty.\nFor the third quarter, net sales increased 17.2% to $2.3 billion, and comp sales increased 14.6%. Operating margin increased to 15.5% of sales and diluted EPS increased 35.5% to $5.34 per share. Reflecting these results and our updated fourth quarter expectations, we have increased our outlook for the full year. Scott will share more details about our expectations later in the call.\nOur third quarter results are a testament to the resilience of the beauty category and our team's ability to drive strong guest engagement that fueled broad-based growth across our business. All major categories exceeded our expectations, and we increased our market share in prestige beauty versus the fiscal third quarter last year based on dollar sales according to point-of-sale data from the NPD Group.\nWe delivered growth across our store and digital channels and achieved record loyalty membership of 39 million members. Additionally, we continue to see growth in spend per member across all income demographics.\nOur strategic framework, anchored by the power of our differentiated model, continues to drive our ambitions and successes as we work to expand our market leadership and drive profitable growth. This afternoon, I will share an update on our progress against several of our strategic pillars.\nStarting with our efforts to drive disruptive growth through an expanded definition of All Things Beauty, our strategy to engage and delight beauty enthusiasts with a thoughtfully curated assortment focused on inclusivity and leading trends is delivering results. Our double-digit comp this quarter was a result of growth from our core assortment, price increases executed this year and compelling newness.\nAlthough pricing contributed more to our comp than last quarter, the majority of our third quarter comp was fueled by growth from our core assortment and newness. Historically, sales of new products have averaged 20% to 30% of our sales, and the overall mix of newness this year has been in line with our historical experience.\nTurning to performance by category. Skincare, fragrance and bath, hair care and makeup all delivered double-digit comp growth against the third quarter last year. From a segment perspective, we saw double-digit sales growth across both prestige and mass, with mass generally outperforming prestige. While it's hard to know with certainty if we are starting to see consumers trade down, as the only beauty retailer that offers a wide variety of price points from entry level mass to high-end luxury and everything in between, Ulta Beauty is uniquely positioned to capture any consumer shifts within price points in the beauty category.\nTurning to the performance of our core categories, starting with our fastest-growing category, skincare. Beauty enthusiasts are maintaining their skincare routines with a focus on science-backed and dermatologist-recommended products. Guests are engaging with newer brands, like Drunk Elephant, Super Goop and Good Molecules, while new products from established brands like the Ordinary Hero Cosmetics and the Roche-Posay also contributed to sales growth.\nTo drive discovery and support guest education, this quarter, we introduced our Skincare We Love All in all stores. This curated presentation highlights exciting brands and best-selling items across key categories. The fragrance and bath category delivered another impressive quarter, as Gen Z guests engaged with the category, leveraging multiple fragrances to express themselves. Recently launched Ulta Beauty exclusive Billie Eilish, as well as Nescens from Burberry, Gucci and Victor and Ralph drove meaningful sales growth. While our monthly fragrance crush program drove engagement with established brands including Versace and Jimmy Choo.\nIn addition, the category benefited from strong guest engagement with our holiday fragrance gift sets, which were available earlier this year.\nHaircare, our second largest category, delivered solid growth, primarily driven by newness and innovation. Key category trends include hair health, damage repair and targeted treatments. Prestige brands, including Way and Briogeo, saw strength in treatments and core assortments, while masstige brands, including EBA, NYC, (inaudible) and Kristin S., and professional brands such as Pure Allergy, Redken and Kenra, continued to resonate with guests.\nWithin the category, strong hair product growth was offset by softer performance in hair tools as we lapped strong performance last year.\nFinally, our largest category, makeup, delivered double-digit comp growth, driven by newness and the strength of our key events, including 21 Days of Beauty and Fall Haul. Growth in foundation, concealers, blush and lip continue to lead the category. New brands like (inaudible), R.E.M. Beauty and [Numero OneChannel] drove sales during the quarter, while new products from a wide range of brands, including Clinique, e.l.f. and NYX also contributed to growth. In addition, the expansion of MAC, Chanel Beaute and Bobby Brown into more stores has continued to drive prestige sales.\nNow let me give you an update on our key cross-category platforms. Conscious Beauty, Black-Owned and by pack brands and wellness. With 290 certified brands, Conscious Beauty continues to resonate strongly with beauty enthusiasts, reflecting growing interest in products that are good for the world. This quarter, we certified 15 new brands, including 8 cosmetics, Morphe and Dime Beauty, and introduced the Conscious Beauty essentials kit, featuring minis for more than 15 brands, such as Dermalogica, Koula and our own Ulta Beauty Collection.\nDuring the quarter, we expanded our buy pack brand assortment with 4 new buy pack brands: Pebble, Bread Beauty Supply, Sugar Dough and Undefined Beauty. As another way we look to create foundational industry change, we proudly launched our MUSE Accelerator program to support early-stage buy pack brands as they prepare for retail readiness. Our inaugural class included 8 buy pack founders, with innovative brands across skin care, makeup, fragrance, haircare and wellness.\nIn addition to financial support, each MUSE Accelerator participant took part in an intensive 10-week training program, learning from Ulta Beauty leaders, industry subject matter experts and leading buy pack brand owners. We are honored and excited to be a part of their journey as they build their business and expand their reach.\nFinally, we continue to increase our presence in wellness. During the quarter, we further enhanced our assortment to reflect our guest evolving needs. And in September, we expanded our offering to include intimate wellness as the sixth online-only pillar of the wellness shop.\nWhile wellness represents a small part of our overall business today, we believe it is a significant longer-term growth opportunity given the incrementality of the purchase and the strong emotional connection consumers have with self-care.\nTurning now to our efforts to evolve the omnichannel experience through a connected physical and digital ecosystem, all in your world. Store traffic trends accelerated this quarter and exceeded pre-pandemic levels for the first time, representing an important milestone in our COVID recovery. In addition to strong sales growth from stores, we continue to deliver growth in e-commerce, further reinforcing the incrementality of this important channel. The convenience of BOPIS for e-commerce orders continues to resonate with guests. During the quarter, BOPIS increased 18% to 23% of e-commerce sales, compared to 20% last year. Our services business accelerated and delivered another quarter of double-digit comp growth, primarily due to higher stylist retention, increased stylist productivity and increased capacity in our salons as we lap capacity constraints due to the pandemic.\nOur targeted CRM efforts to drive awareness, trial and frequency are working, delivering increases in salon appointments from both existing and new members. Additionally, our in-store back bar events continue to drive product attachment and new guest acquisition for participating brands.\nAs industry leaders, we're always working to enhance guest experiences across all of our platforms. During the quarter, we introduced a new layout in about a dozen stores to showcase our categories better, improve navigation, enhance the services experience and create more opportunities for discovery. The most noticeable changes include the repositioning of skincare, an important growth category to the front of the store. All products grew by category with delineated fixtures and visuals and a flow from prestige to masstige to mass.\nElevated gondolas that showcase key iconic and service brands, new beauty bars that offer our brow and makeup services, as well as supporting in-store events, dedicated space in the front of the store to feature brand and product launches across categories and a relocated checkout closer to the salon. We are excited to introduce this new store layout to guest. And as we've done in the past, we intend to introduce this new experience in new stores, remodels and relocations. At this time, we have no plans to retrofit existing stores.\nStores are a critical part of our ecosystem. And while most Ulta Beauty's transactions occur in stores, we know the guest journey often begins online. To assist guests along their journey, we offer a suite of virtual digital tools, including GLAMlab, Skin Advisor and our hairstyle tool, among others.\nThe latest addition is a fragrance finder designed to help guests explore fragrances by favorite brand or ingredient, launched just in time for the holiday season. Finally, we continue to be excited about the long-term opportunity with our strategic Target partnership. This touch point enables us to connect and reconnect with members. And while the partnership isn't material yet to our overall member growth, it has contributed positively. Importantly, we are seeing members bounce back to Ulta Beauty after becoming an active member while at the Ulta Beauty at Target shop.\nNow let me give you an update on some of the steps we're taking to drive love, loyalty and emotional connection with Ulta Beauty. Recognizing the beauty is personal. We are on a multiyear journey to create stronger, more emotional connections with our guests and bring our brand purpose to life. Launched in September, our latest brand building campaign Beauty And is rooted in insights from cultural leaders and beauty enthusiasts. The creative content on owned and paid channels has driven broad improvement in top-of-mind awareness and is resonating with our guests, particularly Black and Latin beauty enthusiasts.\nTurning to our loyalty program. Our efforts to nurture loyalty in personalized ways is driving member growth and delivering incremental value. We ended the quarter with 39 million active members, 9% higher than the third quarter last year. Overall spend per member increased driven by increased frequency and higher average ticket. While price increases are having an impact, we are encouraged to see unit growth per member. Our loyalty program is a strategic asset and an important driver of our long-term growth. We prioritize member engagement, loyalty and retention across every Ulta Beauty touch point. The growth and strength of our loyalty program starts with ensuring that our existing guests stay engaged. Nurturing our existing members through our Member Love events and life cycle marketing strategies has enabled us to maintain healthy retention rates, which have contributed to member growth and higher spend per member.\nMember reactivation remains a priority, and we are leveraging CRM tools to personalize offers and reengage members in more targeted ways. And, of course, conversion of new members also contributes to overall member growth, and we continue to acquire new members in our stores, digital platforms and through our partnership with Target.\nShifting now to our plans and expectations for holiday. The holiday season is in full flow, and our teams are executing well. While predicting holiday shopping patterns this year is challenging, I am optimistic about the opportunity for Ulta Beauty this holiday season. Our engaging holiday messaging, one-of-a-kind assortment, with exceptional seasonal options and diverse touch points, all paired with our team's unrelenting passion for delivering great guest experiences, position us well to deliver another successful holiday season.\nGrounded and robust consumer insights, our holiday marketing strategy positions Ulta Beauty as the place for gifting, glamming and self-care this season. Our intent is to empower guests to celebrate the season however they want. And our integrated media plan for the holiday aims to build broad awareness of Ulta Beauty as a holiday destination, spark connection with key audiences, leverage our beauty expertise and drive consideration and purchase.\nOur merchandising team has built an outstanding holiday gifting assortment, whether guests want to get others or treat themselves, we have thoughtfully curated options across every category and budget, with a balanced approach to the mix of seasonal holiday items and core items that make great guests. We entered the holiday season with well-staffed stores in DCs, and our teams are excited, engaged and ready.\nFor the first time since 2019, our store teams gathered in person to review our holiday strategies. And I know their excitement and enthusiasm for our plans will be felt in every guest interaction. And our corporate and DC teams have worked cross-functionally to ensure Ulta Beauty is positioned to deliver for our store teams and our guests.\nIn closing, I am incredibly proud of our year-to-date results, and I'm excited about our holiday plans. Even as consumers continue to navigate economic headwinds, we believe the beauty category will remain resilient, and we are confident that our differentiated model and growth strategy, combined with our outstanding associates, will continue to position Ulta Beauty as the preferred beauty destination.\nAnd now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott?\n\nScott M. Settersten\n\nCFO, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary, Ulta Beauty, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported results that were better than our initial expectations. Strong double-digit revenue growth resulted in record-setting third quarter operating margin performance. These excellent results reflect the continued focus and hard work of our store, DC and corporate teams. And I want to thank all of our Ulta Beauty associates for working together to deliver another outstanding quarter for our shareholders.\nNow to the financial results, starting with the income statement. Net sales for the quarter increased 17.2%, driven by comp sales growth of 14.6% and strong new store performance. In addition, other revenue increased $20 million, primarily due to credit card income growth, higher loyalty point redemptions and an increase in royalty income from our partnership with Target.\nBreaking down the comp performance further. Comp transactions for the quarter increased 10.7%, primarily driven by strong growth from in-store transactions. Average ticket increased 3.5% due to an increase in average selling price, partially offset by slightly lower average units per transaction. The increase in average selling price primarily reflects the impact of retail price increases executed this year. We estimate that price increases contributed about 500 basis points to the overall comp increase. While average units per transaction was slightly lower than last year, the total number of units sold increased about 10% on a comp basis.\nDuring the quarter, we opened 18 new stores, relocated one store and remodeled 8 stores. For the quarter, gross margin increased 160 basis points to 41.2% of sales compared to 39.6% last year. The increase was primarily due to the leverage of store fixed costs, other revenue growth and higher merchandise margin, partially offset by higher inventory shrink. Robust top line growth and benefits from our ongoing occupancy cost optimization efforts resulted in healthy leverage of store fixed costs.\nThe improvement in merchandise margin was primarily due to benefits resulting from the timing of retail price changes, partially offset by brand mix. As we have discussed, we have executed a number of price increases from our brand partners this year. Generally, when the new price is effective at the shelf, we are still selling the inventory purchased at the lower cost. As a result, there's a short-term benefit to cost of goods as we move through the lower cost inventory.\nAs expected, our promotional activity increased from the second quarter, but the impact to margin was not meaningful compared to last year. SG&A increased 18.6% to $597.2 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased 30 basis points to 25.5% compared to 25.2% last year, primarily due to increases in store payroll and benefits and corporate overhead, partially offset by lower marketing expenses.\nStore payroll and benefits deleverage this quarter primarily due to increased labor hours to maintain service standards, higher average wage rates to support recruitment and retention and a timing shift of incentive compensation accruals.\nCorporate overhead expense deleveraged in the quarter, primarily reflecting investments related to our strategic priorities including Project SAR and other IT capabilities, UV Media and Ulta Beauty at Target. These headwinds were partially offset by lower marketing expense. As we have discussed on previous calls, this year, we are offsetting the incremental marketing expense of digital campaigns we manage for our brand partners, with vendor income that is a direct reimbursement for these specific costs within total marketing expense.\nSimilar to what we saw in the first half, this resulted in about 70 basis points of favorable impact to SG&A in the quarter. Operating income for the quarter increased 27.3% to $361.9 million. As a percentage of sales, operating margin increased 130 basis points to 15.5% of sales compared to 14.2% last year. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 35.5% to $5.34 per share, compared to $3.94 per share last year.\nMoving to the balance sheet and cash flow. Total inventory increased 10.3%. In addition to the impact of 41 additional stores, the increase reflects purchases to support key brand launches and increases in inventory costs, as well as ongoing efforts to maintain strong in-stock to support expected demand.\nCapital expenditures in the quarter were $83.5 million compared to $51.1 million last year. The increase was primarily related to investments in new remodeled and relocated stores, IT projects and merchandising improvements.\nDepreciation was $58.5 million compared to $65.2 million last year, primarily due to a shift of IT investments from capital to cloud expense. We ended the quarter with $250.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. During the quarter, we repurchased 340,000 shares at a cost of $137.5 million. At the end of the third quarter, we had $1.4 billion remaining under our current $2 billion repurchase authorization.\nTurning now to our outlook. We have raised our financial guidance for fiscal 2022 to reflect our strong third quarter performance and increased expectations for the fourth quarter. We now expect net sales for the year will be between $9.95 billion and $10 billion, with comp sales growth between 12.6% and 13.2%. This guidance reflects our expectation that fourth quarter comp growth will be between 6% and 8%, up from our previous expectation for low single-digit increase.\nSales growth moderated in November as we lapped last year's strong performance, but we are pleased with the sales trends we saw through the Thanksgiving holiday shopping weekend, including Cyber Monday. We still have several important weeks left in the holiday season, and the operating environment continues to be dynamic. Our Q4 comp outlook, reflects both the expected resilience of the beauty category as well as potential risks from shifts in consumer spending, increased points of distribution for prestige beauty and higher promotional activity.\nFor the year, we plan to open approximately 47 net new stores and remodel or relocate 33 stores. Our new store performance continues to be strong. But like many other major retailers, we are seeing project delays resulting from external real estate and construction issues, as well as supply chain disruption for key equipment. These external factors have impacted our fiscal 2022 plans and will likely shift new stores originally planned for fiscal 2023 into 2024. We continue to expect to open about 100 stores over the next 2 years, but the timing of opening between fiscal 2023 and 2024 may shift as we navigate these external challenges.\nThe operating environment is fluid, and we will provide specific targets for fiscal 2023 when we report in March. We now expect operating margins for the year will be between 15.5% and 15.6% of sales. We expect gross margin for the year will increase with leverage of fixed costs and growth in other revenue, partially offset by lower merchandise margin, higher shrink and higher supply chain costs. We continue to expect SG&A expense for the year will increase between 15% and 16% or approximately flat as a percentage of sales, driven primarily by $60 million to $65 million of expenses related to our strategic priorities, as well as higher wage rate growth across the enterprise, partially offset by lower marketing expense. Reflecting these assumptions, we now expect diluted earnings per share for the year will be between $22.60 and $22.90.\nOne final update. We now expect to spend between $300 million and $350 million in CapEx in fiscal 2022, including approximately $160 million for supply chain and IT, $140 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, and about $30 million for store maintenance and other. We expect depreciation for the year will be around $250 million.\nWhile we are not providing guidance for next year on this call, we want to share some high-level thoughts for your consideration as you model fiscal 2023. The beauty category has been stronger this year than expected. Barring a major economic event, we would expect category growth to continue in 2023, albeit at lower rates, reflecting strong consumer engagement with the category, and we remain confident we can deliver comp sales growth in fiscal 2023 within our longer-term targeted range of 3% to 5%.\nIn this sales scenario, we would expect operating margin deleverage versus our fiscal 2022 guidance. In addition to inflationary pressures on wage rates and other operational expenses, we expect to increase investment spending related to our strategic priorities, reflecting timing shifts from fiscal 2022 and the planned ramp-up of key IT and supply chain investments.\nFinally, fiscal 2023 will be a 53-week year for Ulta Beauty. We are still finalizing our budget for fiscal 2023 and plan to provide specific financial guidance, and update our longer-term growth targets, if appropriate, on our March earnings call.\nAnd now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session.",

(Operator Instructions) And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. And it is now my pleasure to introduce Ms. Kiley Rawlins, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Rawlins, please proceed.\n\nKiley F. Rawlins\n\nVP of IR, Ulta Beauty, Inc.\n\nThanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our discussion of Ulta Beauty's results for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Hosting our call are Dave Kimbell, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer; Kecia Steelman, Chief Operating Officer, will join us for the Q&A session.\nThis afternoon, we announced our financial results for the second quarter.

Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the statements contained in this conference call, which are not historical facts, may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nActual future results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the company's filings with the SEC.

Now I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave?\n\nDavid C. Kimbell\n\nCEO & Director, Ulta Beauty, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kiley, and good afternoon. We appreciate your continued interest in Ulta Beauty. The Ulta Beauty team delivered outstanding performance again this quarter. For the second quarter, net sales increased 16.8% to $2.3 billion. Operating profit increased to 17% of sales and diluted EPS increased 25% to $5.70 per share.\nWe continue to be very pleased with the broad-based strength of our business. For the quarter, all major categories exceeded our expectations, and we increased our market share in prestige beauty versus last year based on point-of-sale data from the NPD Group. Sales in stores and digital channels also increased -- exceeded our expectations with both channels delivering solid comp growth in the quarter. And we saw healthy sales gain from members across all income demographics.\nConsumer engagement with beauty remains strong, reflecting a deep emotional connection with the category as well as the continued importance of self-care and wellness. This healthy engagement paired with solid operational execution from our teams, fueled our results. Before we talk about the results, I want to recognize and thank our Ulta Beauty associates. Their collaborative commitment to serving our guests, caring for each other and executing our plans with absolute excellence has enabled us to continue navigating a dynamic environment and deliver outstanding results.\nThe strength in our business, despite a turbulent environment reflects the power of our differentiated model and our ability to capitalize on the strength of the overall beauty category. Our unique enduring value proposition continues to drive our success and our strategic framework anchors our focus as we look forward.\nThis afternoon, I want to share an update on our strategic progress. Our first strategic priority is to drive disruptive growth through an expanded definition of all things beauty. We engage into light beauty enthusiasts with a curated differentiated assortment focused on inclusivity and leading trends, and this approach continues to deliver results.\nFrom a category perspective, fragrance and bath, skincare, haircare and makeup all exceeded expectations, delivering double-digit comp growth against the second quarter last year. We are encouraged that the vast majority of our comparable sales growth was fueled by growth from both core and newness with a modest benefit from recently executed price increases.\nAs we have discussed on previous calls, we have received a large number of price increases from our brand partners in the first half of this year. Given ongoing cost pressures facing our brand partners, we expect to receive additional increases as we move throughout the rest of the year.\nTurning to the performance of our core categories, starting with our largest category, makeup. Compared to the second quarter of 2021, both prestige and mass makeup delivered double-digit comp growth. As consumers participated in more in-person activities, traveled and increasingly used makeup as a form of self-expression. Guests continue to engage with new brands like Fenty Beauty, R.E.M. Beauty and recently launched About-Face by Halsey, while new products from established brands like Clinique, NYX, e.l.f. and ColourPop also contributed to the sales growth. In addition, the ongoing expansion of MAC and Chanel Beauté into more stores contributed to the strong prestige performance.\nHaircare, our second largest category, delivered another quarter of double-digit growth driven by newness and strong engagement in our semiannual Gorgeous Hair Event, a strategic event designed to acquire new guests, increase existing member spend and drive salon penetration. New brands like OLAPLEX as well as new product launches from (inaudible) and Living Proof contributed to the category growth in the quarter and the initial launch of Dyson's latest Airwrap styling tool with new features and attachment sold out quickly.\nGuests continue to engage with core professional brands like Redken and Pureology and our salon [Back Bird] takeovers drove strong growth with Joico and recently launched Andrew Fitzsimons.\nSkin care was one of our best-performing categories this quarter with both prestige and mass delivering double-digit comp growth, driven by new brands and product innovation. Newness continued to appeal to guests with newer brands such as Drunk Elephant, Fresh, Supergoop! and recently launched Vacation as well as new products from Peach & Lily, OSEA and Hero cosmetics contributing to category growth during the quarter. And Skinfatuation, our monthly skincare program, which works to demystify skin care with educational content and focused themes delivered nice growth for established brands like Tula, Sun Bum, COOLA and Good Molecules.\nThe fragrance category again delivered strong double-digit comp growth on top of extraordinary growth last year. Compelling newness and strong engagement with our Mother's Day and Father's Day events contributed to this performance. Recently launched Ulta Beauty exclusive Billie Eilish and Charli D'Amelio Born Dreamer as well as (inaudible) from Gucci, YSL and Dior drove meaningful sales growth. While our monthly Fragrance Crush program drove greater engagement with established brands like Valentino and [Armada].\nIn addition, in core category growth, we are investing in 3 cross-category platforms to increase guest engagement and expand our market share. We know consumers seek beauty brands that are good for the world and align with their values. And Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty continues to resonate with guests as it addresses these interests.\nAt the end of the second quarter, 290 brands offered certified products in at least 1 Conscious Beauty pillar, including newly certified brands, Born Dreamer, About-Face, (inaudible) and Good Light. To increase the visibility of Conscious Beauty and to make it easier for guests to identify products that align with what is important to them, this quarter we refreshed the landing page on ulta.com and added digital badging to all product pages. Now guests can quickly identify certified brands and products across our Conscious Beauty pillars, whether shopping in stores or on our digital channels.\nMoving to our efforts to expand and support our assortment of BIPOC brands, we are committed to diversifying our assortments, so all guests can see themselves reflected at Ulta Beauty. In addition to continuing to expand our portfolio of BIPOC brands and enhance our marketing support for these brands, we are focused on driving structural change within the beauty industry.\nAs the leader in beauty, we believe we have a responsibility to take tangible steps to create foundational industry change through the investment of capital and resources. As such, next month, we will officially launch our MUSE Accelerator program focused on early-stage BIPOC brands. Through this program, we will provide 8 diverse leaders, founders and entrepreneurs with resources, mentorship and support to prepare them for retail readiness. I look forward to sharing more about our inaugural class on future calls.\nFinally, we continue to enhance our wellness shop to support guests as they prioritize self-care. This quarter, we expanded the shop to additional stores and now roughly 750 stores offer guests an elevated cohesive presentation of wellness products to help them easily navigate their personal journey. Today, we offer a curated omni assortment of more than 140 brands, including newly launched brands, Womeness and Olay and more than 700 SKUs to help our guests feel their best inside and out.\nMoving now to our ongoing efforts to evolve the omnichannel experience through a connected physical and digital ecosystem, all in your world. Store traffic trends were strong again this quarter as guests return to in-store shopping and services. While store traffic remained slightly below pre-pandemic levels, the trend continues to improve. Our services business delivered another quarter of double-digit comp growth, primarily due to increased capacity and new service offerings. In addition, we implemented modest price increases for core services in May.\nNotably, member engagement with services accelerated from the first quarter, reflecting our ongoing efforts to amplify our salon services and encourage first-time trial through our Member Love offers. As guests return to stores, they are also engaging in our digital channels. After lapping the tremendous digital acceleration prompted by COVID, our e-commerce channel returned to more normalized growth, delivering mid-single-digit comp growth for the quarter.\nWe continue to incentivize guests to try alternative delivery options for e-commerce orders while also investing to improve the guest experience. During the quarter, BOPIS increased 32% to 25% of e-commerce sales compared to 20% last year. Importantly, we saw a significant improvement in guest satisfaction with the BOPIS experience, reflecting the engagement and focus of our store associates. While limited to 12 markets, guests are also increasing their use of our same-day delivery options, and we continue to be pleased with the AOV and profitability metrics of this fulfillment capability. Between BOPIS, same-day delivery and ship from store, more than 1/3 of our digital orders were fulfilled by stores.\nWe continue to expand and enhance our guest experience across all channels. In our digital channels, our teams continue to deliver a more seamless experience through what we call our digital store of the future. This quarter, we introduced new, more engaging products on both ulta.com and our mobile app.\nWe are also improving our physical store experience. Next month, we plan to introduce a new front of store presentation that will allow us to enhance our ability to support more editorial storytelling around newness, events and trends. And later this fall, we will introduce a new layout in select stores to elevate key growth categories, unify the presentation of skincare and makeup and enhance the store -- the services experience.\nLonger term, we are exploring innovative ways to connect our digital and physical stores and deliver forward-thinking guest experiences. This quarter, we officially launched Prisma Ventures, a $20 million fund focused on investing in early-stage start-ups and emerging tech entrepreneurs who will shape the future of retail and beauty.\nTo date, the fund has partnered and invested in a variety of startups to enable greater personalization, including Haut.AI, Adeptmind, Revea and ReStyle. And we recently announced an investment in LUUM, a startup that provides robotic lash extensions, opening new intersections between beauty and robotics.\nFinally, we continue to enhance and expand our partnership with Target. During the second quarter, we opened 59 Ulta Beauty at Target shops, ending the quarter with 186 locations. During the quarter, we refreshed the assortment, expanding the fragrance offering, launched 2 Black-owned brands, Sunday to Sunday and Melanin Haircare and introduce newness from existing brand partners, including Benefit, Morphe and Tula.\nAs we anniversary the initial launch of this innovative partnership and reflect on the progress made, we continue to be pleased with overall guest engagement and we are encouraged by the behavior of new members who enter our ecosystem through this new channel. The foundation of our partnership is strong, and we are focused on driving further loyalty conversion to unlock even greater value as we scale.\nNow let me give you an update on some of the steps we're taking to drive love, loyalty and emotional connection with Ulta Beauty. We have been on a multiyear journey to create a stronger, more emotional connection with our guests and bring our brand purpose to life. Beauty is inherently inclusive. Every individual is unique and beauty can help celebrate this uniqueness. As the leader in the category, we want to move beauty forward, making it a force for good for all and inspiring everyone to discover their own possibilities through the power of beauty.\nBuilding on our previous brand equity work, we are launching a new brand equity campaign, beauty and to celebrate the expansive nature of beauty and empower people to embrace their endless possibilities. The campaign will launch with content across paid, owned and earned media with unique elements that we believe will prompt new culturally relevant conversations about beauty and inspire greater inclusivity and positivity in our industry and the world. This campaign has performed extraordinarily well in consumer testing, and I'm proud of the efforts Ulta Beauty is making to change the way the world sees beauty.\nTurning to our loyalty program. We ended the quarter with 38.2 million active members in our Ultimate Rewards loyalty program, 10% above the second quarter last year. In addition to converting new members and reengaging lapsed members, we are maintaining healthy retention rates, especially among our Diamond and Platinum members. Overall spend per member increased again this quarter, driven by both increased trip frequency and higher average ticket. And our channel metrics remain steady with in-store-only members totaling 76% of members and omnichannel-only members totaling 17%.\nOver the last several years, we have expanded our CRM capabilities and developed stronger life cycle marketing strategies that will allow us to drive loyal shopping behaviors more precisely through promotional activity. Today, we are leveraging predictive decisioning to target strategic member segments with personalized communications and offers to increase frequency and drive higher lifetime value. We are seeing encouraging engagement in these offers, resulting in increases in spend per member. As promotional intensity increases in beauty and across retail, these capabilities enable us to rely less on mass market promotions and leverage more targeted and profitable offers.\nIn May, we launched UB Media, our new retail media network and the response from brand partners has been tremendous. Our brand partners are excited about the opportunity to leverage the power of our exclusive first-party data to transform the way they connect with beauty enthusiasts. Our team is ramping up well, and we remain excited about the opportunity to unlock a new income stream and drive sales as we enable our brand partners to engage consumers more effectively.\nIn closing, I am incredibly pleased with the strength we have seen across our business so far this year. Our operational and financial performance is a testament to the power of our values-based culture, our business model and the important role beauty plays in our customers' lives. We recognize beauty is not immune to macroeconomic challenges, but the category's deep emotional connection has historically resulted in stronger resilience compared to other discretionary categories. And as our results illustrate, we believe this is even more true today given the importance of self-care and wellness.\nAs we look to the future, we know there will be challenges, particularly with the wide-ranging impact of rising inflation, both on our business and our guests. But we remain confident in the resilience of the beauty category and our ability to lead the beauty category and drive long-term profitable growth.\nAnd now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott?\n\nScott M. Settersten\n\nCFO, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary, Ulta Beauty, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave indicated, our second quarter results were better than we expected. Strong sales growth due to several factors, including the resilience of the beauty category, stronger-than-expected sales growth from stores and the impact of new brands, drove better-than-expected performance in gross margin and SG&A leverage, resulting in an operating margin of 17%. These results reflect the hard work and commitment of our associates, and I want to thank all of our teams for staying focused on serving our guests and managing our business through this dynamic operating environment.\nNow to the financial results, starting with the income statement. Net sales for the quarter increased 16.8%, driven by 14.4% growth in comp sales, a $19 million increase in other revenue and strong new store performance. Transactions for the quarter increased 8.3%, primarily driven by growth from stores. Average ticket increased 5.6%, resulting primarily from an increase in average selling price. Average units per transaction were down slightly. The increase in average selling price primarily reflects the impact of product mix and retail price increases executed this year. We estimate that price increases contributed about 300 basis points to the overall comp.\nDuring the quarter, we opened 7 new stores and relocated 4 stores. For the quarter, gross margin decreased 20 basis points to 40.4% of sales compared to 40.6% last year. Although we had less total promotional activity during the quarter, overall merchandise margin was lower than last year, primarily due to the impact of brand mix and lapping benefits from favorable inventory reserve adjustments in the second quarter last year.\nGross margin was also negatively impacted by higher inventory shrink primarily due to increased theft across the retail landscape, theft and organized retail crime are increasing, and we are seeing similar trends in our business. We are working diligently to keep our associates and guests safe and to reduce the risk of impact through investment in new fixtures, additional associate training, innovative technology solutions and increased staffing levels.\nWe are also working with and supporting retail industry organizations and the Buy Safe Coalition to address opportunities at the legislative level. These gross margin headwinds were partially offset by leverage of fixed costs due to the strong top line growth and an increase in other revenue. Double-digit growth in supply chain costs persisted into the second quarter, driven by increased freight costs and higher wage rates in our distribution centers. Strong top line growth enabled us to mitigate the gross margin impact this quarter but as sales growth moderates, we continue to expect that higher supply chain costs, including fuel costs, which are expected to remain above last year, will be a larger headwind to gross margin in the second half of the year.\nSG&A increased 15.1% to $534.5 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&A decreased 30 basis points to 23.3% compared to 23.6% last year. Lower marketing expense and leverage of store payroll and benefits due to higher sales were partially offset by the leverage of corporate overhead primarily reflecting strategic investments as well as higher incentive compensation, reflecting our strong performance. Year-to-date through the second quarter, we have invested about 1/3 of our plan in support of our strategic initiatives.\nAs we discussed last quarter, this year, we are offsetting the incremental marketing expense of the digital campaigns we manage for our brand partners with the vendor income that is a direct reimbursement for these specific costs within total marketing expense. Similar to the first quarter, this resulted in about 70 basis points of favorable impact to SG&A in the second quarter. Operating income increased 17.8% to $391.4 million compared to $332.3 million last year. As a percentage of sales, operating margin increased 10 basis points to 17% compared to 16.9% last year. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 25% to $5.70 per share compared to $4.56 per share last year.\nMoving to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 15.4% to $1.67 billion compared to $1.44 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 29 additional stores, the increase reflects inventory purchases to support key brand launches and increases in inventory costs as well as ongoing efforts to maintain strong in-stocks of key items to support expected demand.\nCapital expenditures were $49.4 million for the quarter compared to $22.7 million last year. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily related to investments in new, remodeled and relocated stores, supply chain investments and merchandising improvements. Depreciation was $60.9 million compared to $69 million last year, primarily due to a shift of IT investments from capital to cloud expense.\nWe ended the quarter with $434.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. During the quarter, we repurchased 798,000 shares at a cost of $301.6 million. At the end of the second quarter, we had $1.6 billion remaining under our current $2 billion repurchase authorization.\nTurning now to our outlook. Reflecting our second quarter performance and sales trends we've experienced so far in August, we are increasing our outlook for fiscal 2022. We now expect net sales to be between $9.65 billion and $9.75 billion, with comp sales growth between 9.5% and 10.5%. Our updated outlook reflects year-to-date trends while continuing to consider uncertainties that could impact the second half of the year, particularly during the holiday season.\nEmbedded in our forecast is an expectation for mid-single-digit comp growth in the second half, reflecting the risk of potential shifts in consumer spending due to inflationary pressures, the impact of increased points of distribution for prestige beauty and the likelihood of a more promotional holiday season. We now expect operating margin for the year will be between 14.6% and 14.8% of sales. We expect operating margin will deleverage in the second half as sales growth moderates and cost pressures and planned investments have a greater impact. We expect gross margin expansion for the year with leverage of fixed costs and growth in other revenue, partially offset by lower merchandise margin, higher shrink and higher supply chain costs.\nWe continue to expect SG&A expense will deleverage for the year, driven primarily by $60 million to $65 million of expenses related to our strategic priorities, as well as higher wage rate growth across the enterprise, partially offset by lower marketing expense. In addition, we expect inflationary pressure in operating expenses will continue. These assumptions result in updated full year guidance for diluted EPS growth between $20.70 and $21.20.\nOne final update. We now expect to spend between $350 million and $400 million in CapEx in fiscal 2022, including approximately $195 million for supply chain and IT, $180 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, and about $20 million for store maintenance and other. We expect depreciation for the year will be around $250 million.\nIn closing, we are very pleased with our performance year-to-date. While we continue to face uncertainties in the current macro environment, we are focused on delivering great guest experiences and driving sustained profitable growth. Longer term, we believe the beauty category will continue to be resilient, and we are confident that we are differentiated and proven model and growth strategy, combined with our outstanding associates will continue to position Ulta Beauty as the preferred beauty destination.\nAnd now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session.",

(Operator Instructions) And as always, the IR team will be available for any follow-up questions after the call.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Dave. Dave?\n\nDavid C. Kimbell\n\nCEO & Director, Ulta Beauty, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kiley, and good afternoon. Fiscal 2022 is off to an outstanding start with the Ulta Beauty team delivering another quarter of excellent performance on top of last year's record results.\nFor the quarter, net sales increased 21% to $2.3 billion, comp sales increased 18%, operating profit increased to 18.7% of sales and diluted EPS increased 54% to $6.30 per share. During the quarter, all major categories exceeded our expectations, and we increased our market share in Prestige Beauty based on point-of-sale data from the NPD Group.\nWe also increased the number of members in our Ultimate Rewards Loyalty Program, introduced innovative digital experiences for our guests and continued to execute major strategic projects, including investments in new stores, supply chain and technology infrastructure, all while successfully navigating supply chain challenges, a tight labor market and operating cost pressures.\nI want to express my sincere appreciation to all of our Ulta Beauty associates for their collaborative efforts to create great guest experiences, execute against our plans and deliver these outstanding results.\nConsumers continue to be highly engaged with the beauty category as they participate in more in-person activities, engage in more travel and lean into experiential spending. And while macroeconomic pressures, such as rising inflation are top of mind for consumers, their resilience and emotional connection to beauty continues to drive the recovery of the category. This consumer demand, paired with strong execution of our strategic priorities, fueled our exceptional results.\nLooking at our operational performance for the quarter, I will focus on the progress we are making with our consumer-facing priorities and then share an update on our optimization efforts. Let's start with our first strategic priority to drive disruptive growth through an expanded definition of All Things Beauty.\nFrom a category perspective, fragrance and bath, hair care, makeup and skin care all delivered double-digit comp growth against the first quarter last year. Importantly, sales of makeup exceeded pre-pandemic levels in both mass and prestige cosmetics. The makeup recovery is progressing faster than we expected coming into this year. Compared to the first quarter of 2021, prestige cosmetics outperformed mass cosmetics, driven by new and expanding brands and a strong 21 Days of Beauty event.\nFrom a trend standpoint, foundation, concealers, eyeliners, and lipstick continue to deliver strong comp growth. New brands like Fenty Beauty, r.e.m. Beauty by Ariana Grande and Treslúce, a mass cosmetics brand founded by Latin Musician, Becky G, contributed to growth during the quarter. While new product launches from a wide range of brands, including Clinique, Lancome, NARS, e.l.f. and NYX also delivered strong sales growth.\nIn addition, this quarter, we expanded MAC into 233 additional stores and introduced Chanel Beauté into 104 stores. Even as they increase makeup usage, beauty enthusiasts are maintaining their skincare routines. As a result, skin care delivered another quarter of strong double-digit sales comp on top of robust double-digit growth in the first quarter last year.\nMoisturizers, eye serums and acne treatments continue to drive category growth in the quarter. We also saw strong growth in sun protection and self-tanning that consumers increased travel and social activities. NEWNESS continued to appeal to guests with new brands, including Drunk Elephant, Fresh, Super Goop and Good Molecules, as well as new products from TULA, StriVectin and First Aid Beauty, contributing to the category growth during the quarter and established brands, including Peter Thomas Roth and La Roche-Posay continue to benefit from engaging social media content.\nHair care delivered another quarter of double-digit growth, driven by strong guest engagement with NEWNESS and our core assortment as well as successful salon back bar takeover events. Trends focused on hair health like damage repair, color care and scalp treatments continue to resonate with guests and interest in hair styling aids increased with the rise of social occasions. New brands like OLAPLEX as well as new product launches from [WEI] and Briogeo, contributed to category growth in the quarter. And Dyson's Airwrap styling tool continue to be a member favorite. Guests continued to engage with core professional brands like Redken, Pureology and Biolage and our salon back bar takeovers drove strong growth for FEKKAI and IGK as our stylists engaged guests with these brands.\nConsumer strong engagement with the fragrance category continued, driving double-digit growth on top of a phenomenal results last year. Exciting newness, a strong Valentine's Day and strategic events, including 21 Days of Beauty and Spring Haul, contributed to this performance. The in-store launch of Ulta Beauty exclusive Billie Eilish as well as newness from Gucci and Carolina Herrera resonated with guests, and our monthly Fragrance Crush program drove growth for established brands like YSL and Valentino.\nIn addition to driving core category growth, we are investing in key cross-category platforms to drive guest engagement and market share growth. Since launching Conscious Beauty in 2020, we have continued to expand brand participation, increase guest awareness and drive trial. At the end of the first quarter, more than 280 brands offered certified products in at least 1 pillar. And while we continue to certify existing brands and SKUs, many new brands are launching with certification in place. One such example is Andrew Fitzsimons, a hair care brand that offers proprietary bonding technology at accessible price points, which was certified across all 4 pillars when it launched in the first quarter.\nAnother example is Sk*p, an Ulta Beauty exclusive hair and body care brand packaged in a fully recyclable, shower-friendly paper beauty carton, which also launched in the first quarter.\nMoving now to our efforts to continually expand and support our assortment of bipack brands, we launched 5 new bipack brands, BeautyStat, Rosen Skincare, Fenty Beauty, Treslúce Beauty and Mielle Organics. We also expanded Black Girl sunscreen into all stores. To promote trial, we introduced a spotlight display in select stores to showcase our bipack founders. In recognition of Black History Month, we launched a compelling omnichannel campaign to recognize, celebrate and support the black community and black-owned brands. We feature black-owned brands in stores and across enhanced digital and print channels, and we offered compelling loyalty rewards on black-owned brand purchases to drive awareness.\nFinally, our wellness shop continues to resonate with guests as they prioritize self-care and wellness journeys. We recently expanded the shop to an additional 266 stores, now reaching about 55% of our fleet and refresh the digital landing page on ulta.com. With easy ways to explore our curated assortment and helpful tips about easy self-care routines, guests can now more readily incorporate wellness into their busy schedules.\nTurning now to our efforts to evolve the omnichannel experience through a connected physical and digital ecosystem, All In Your World. Store traffic trends were strong in the quarter as guests capitalized on their preference for in-store shopping with fewer COVID restrictions in place than last year and store capacity returned to normal levels.\nWhile store traffic is still below pre-pandemic levels, the trend is improving.\nAs a core differentiator for Ulta Beauty, beauty services deepen engagement and loyalty through human connection. Consumers are resuming their beauty service routines as they participate in more in-person activities. In the first quarter, our beauty services delivered double-digit comp growth, primarily due to increased capacity and new offerings, including OLAPLEX Repair and PROTECT and express color by Redken.\nTo meet growing guest interest and services and experiences, we continue to expand our in-store events and enhance our service offerings. In April, we relaunched makeup services in all stores, just in time to support special events such as proms, graduations and weddings. As guests are coming back to shop in stores, they are also maintaining their use of convenient engaging digital channels. Reflecting these trends, we continue to enhance our omnichannel offerings, including buy online, pickup in store and same-day delivery.\nDuring the quarter, BOPIS increased 26% to 21% of e-commerce sales compared to just 16% last year. While still limited, guests are increasing their use of our same-day delivery options. Based on engagement trends, we recently expanded same-day delivery to 5 new markets, including New York City. And today, about 30% of our stores offer guests this convenient option.\nDuring the first quarter, we continued to expand and enhance our digital experiences. As part of our Digital Store of the Future Journey, we introduced a new homepage for both ulta.com and our mobile app. We also launched 2 Virtual Try-On tools, each powered by technology developed by companies we have invested in through our digital innovation fund.\nFirst, we launched GLAMlab Skin Advisor 2.0, powered by global artificial intelligence startup, pot.ai. This best-in-class skin analysis technology enables us to provide guests with a more accurate skin diagnosis, which has resulted in stronger satisfaction with the tool.\nWe also launched GLAMlab hairstyle try-on powered by [RE/STYLE], a beauty tech start-up that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to enable virtual try-on of more than 50 different hair styles, including options by gender and texture. We also introduced innovative AR and virtual reality experiences to support our launch of Fenty Beauty and r.e.m. Beauty.\nFinally, we continue to enhance and expand our partnership with Target. This leading partnership is part of our long-term strategy to build brand loyalty and engagement with Ulta Beauty. We are seeing existing ultimate reward members, take advantage of the convenience of shopping while earning points at Ulta Beauty at Target. And we are leveraging Target's strong traffic to introduce Ulta Beauty and Ultimate Rewards to new guests.\nDuring the first quarter, we opened 26 Ulta Beauty at Target shops, ending the quarter with 127 locations. One of our priorities in 2022 is to leverage marketing to build engagement as we scale. As an example, in support of our 21 Days of Beauty event, we co-created brand-relevant digital and in-store communications with Target to support this strategic Ulta Beauty event, which resulted in strong performance and guest engagement across both channels.\nMoving to our efforts to drive love, loyalty and emotional connection with Ulta Beauty by expanding and deepening our presence at the heart of the beauty community. During the first quarter, we continued to optimize our marketing mix to reach guests through the most relevant channels and platforms. We leveraged audience data to execute a targeted digital-first approach to 21 Days of Beauty and Spring haul driving greater awareness and increased sales. We launched content partnerships to engage new audiences and increase awareness of our cross-category platforms, and we created innovative marketing campaigns to support key brand launches.\nWe ended the quarter with 37.7 million active members in our Ultimate Rewards Loyalty Program, 17% above the first quarter last year. This increase was primarily driven by continued member reactivation growth, new member acquisition and strong retention. Our strategy is to reengage lapsed members, many of whom dropped off during the pandemic are delivering results. Additionally, new member conversion remains strong in stores and online conversion rates are improving, as we increase the visibility and value of ultimate rewards throughout the guests online journey.\nI'm also excited to share that we launched UB Media, our retail media network. Through UB Media, we will harness the power of our exclusive first-party data to transform the way brands connect with beauty enthusiasts. Building on our successful digital marketing partner program, UB Media offers brand partners an enriched portfolio of advertising products and channels as well as enhanced measurements in reporting, including audience and creative insights.\nThe media network offers advertising, access fee display, video, search, product listing ads, social and influencers on both open web platforms and Ulta Beauty-owned properties. In addition to unlocking a new income stream while helping brand partners build digital campaigns to effectively engage audiences, we expect to see sales benefits as campaigns lead consumers back to Ulta Beauty properties to transact.\nUnderlying these customer-facing priorities is a focus on to drive operational excellence and optimization. Last fall, we shared our updated supply chain strategy, including our plan to build market fulfillment centers, or MFCs, to supplement our existing DC network capacity and provide greater speed to stores and e-commerce guests in specific markets. We recently broke ground on our first MFC in Greenville, South Carolina, and expect the facility will be fully operational in the third quarter next year.\nIn addition, our planned retrofit of our full service distribution center in Greenwood, Indiana is on track to be complete in the second quarter of 2023. I am confident our infrastructure investments, including key supply chain and IT investments, will enable Ulta Beauty to continue to deliver strong results and capitalize on future growth opportunities.\nIn closing, a few weeks ago, I had the privilege to welcome nearly 2,000 members of the Ulta Beauty team to our annual field leadership meeting, bringing together our general managers, district managers, field support teams and brand partners for several days of recognition, leadership development and product education. The excitement was palpable and the optimism about our future was truly inspiring. We celebrated everything we have accomplished throughout the last 2 challenging years and set the stage to deliver on the incredible opportunities ahead for Ulta Beauty. I left the event even more excited about all we can do together as 1 Ulta Beauty team to refine -- redefine how the world sees and expresses beauty.\nAs we look forward, the world around us continues to be dynamic. Product prices and operating costs are rising and consumers are increasingly concerned about the impact of inflation. While it is difficult to forecast how inflation may impact consumer behavior going forward, we are monitoring guest engagement and remain encouraged by the underlying trends we see in our business and in the beauty category. I am confident our team will continue to navigate near-term pressures, and I remain excited about the long-term opportunity for Ulta Beauty to continue to deliver profitable growth.\nAnd now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott?\n\nScott M. Settersten\n\nCFO, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary, Ulta Beauty, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to echo Dave's comments and thank our Ulta Beauty associates for delivering another outstanding quarter. Their collaborative efforts and commitment to serving our guests enabled this extraordinary performance.\nOur first quarter results were stronger than we planned. Robust top line growth due to several factors, including the continued resilience of the beauty category, stronger-than-expected store performance and the impact of new brand launches drove better-than-expected leverage in both gross margin and SG&A, resulted in record operating margin of 18.7%.\nNow let's dig into the details of our results. Starting with sales. Net sales for the quarter increased 21%, driven by 18% growth in comp sales, an increase in other revenue and strong new store performance. From a channel perspective, stores delivered strong double-digit comp growth, reflecting fewer COVID restrictions than last year, while e-commerce sales were flat, in line with our plan.\nTransactions for the quarter increased 10%, driven by double-digit growth in store transactions. Average ticket increased 7.3%, resulting primarily from an increase in average selling price. The increase in average selling price reflects the impact of product mix, retail price increases executed in the quarter and lower promotions.\nOther revenue increased $20.4 million, primarily due to growth in credit card income and higher loyalty point redemptions. The increase in credit card income was primarily due to stronger sales growth. The increase in loyalty point redemptions reflects the improving trend in store traffic and the impact of our proactive member engagement campaigns.\nDuring the quarter, we opened 10 new stores and relocated 6 stores. For the quarter, gross margin increased 120 basis points to 40.1% of sales compared to 38.9% last year. The increase was primarily due to leverage of fixed costs, the growth of other revenue and favorable channel mix, partially offset by lower merchandise margin.\nRobust top line growth and benefits from our occupancy cost optimization efforts resulted in meaningful leverage of store fixed costs. Despite experiencing double-digit growth in supply chain costs, primarily resulting from increases in wage rates, transportation costs and fuel surcharges, strong top line growth during the quarter enabled us to leverage supply chain costs. As sales growth moderates through the rest of the year, we expect higher supply chain costs to become more of a headwind.\nReflecting strong sales performance of stores, channel mix was favorable this quarter. As a percentage of sales, e-commerce sales were about 400 basis points lower than the first quarter last year. Although the impact of lower promotions was favorable during the quarter, merchandise margin was lower than last year, primarily due to the impact of brand mix and lapping benefits from favorable inventory reserve adjustments last year.\nAs planned, SG&A increased 12.9% to $501 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&A decreased 150 basis points to 21.4% compared to 22.9% last year. Lower marketing expenses and leverage of store payroll and benefits due to higher sales were partially offset by deleverage of corporate overhead, reflecting investments related to our strategic priorities.\nAs Dave shared, we recently launched UB Media, a more sophisticated and expanded version of our digital marketing partner program. Reflecting the expected scaling of this platform, we are offsetting the incremental marketing expense of the digital campaigns we manage for our brand partners with the vendor income that is a direct reimbursement for these specific costs within total marketing expense. This resulted in about 70 basis points of favorable impact to SG&A in the quarter.\nOperating income increased 43.4% to $437.7 million compared to $305.3 million last year. As a percentage of sales, operating margin increased 290 basis points to 18.7% of sales compared to 15.8% last year. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 53.7% to $6.30 per share compared to $4.10 per share last year.\nMoving on to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 16% to $1.57 billion compared to $1.35 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 28 additional stores, the increase reflects inventory purchases to support key brand launches as well as continued efforts to maintain strong in-stock of key items to support expected demand and mitigate anticipated global supply chain disruptions.\nCapital expenditures were $71.1 million for the quarter compared to $34.6 million last year. The increase in capital expenditures reflects a more normalized investment cadence versus the last couple of years and includes investments in IT systems, merchandising improvements and store maintenance and other. Depreciation was $62.8 million compared to $70.6 million last year, primarily due to a shift of IT investments from capital to cloud expense. We ended the quarter with $654.5 million in cash and cash equivalents.\nIn the first quarter, we repurchased 332,000 shares at a cost of $132.8 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.87 billion remaining under our current $2 billion repurchase authorization.\nTurning now to our outlook. Reflecting our strong first quarter performance and sales trends we've experienced so far in the second quarter, we are increasing our outlook for fiscal 2022. We now expect net sales to be between $9.35 billion and $9.55 billion with comp sales growth between 6% and 8%. Our updated outlook reflects trends year-to-date while continuing to consider uncertainties that could impact the second half of the year, including inflationary risk to consumer spending and the impact of increased points of distribution for Prestige Beauty. We anticipate comp growth will be in the low to mid-teens in the first half and then moderate to low single-digit growth in the second half.\nWe now expect operating margin for the year to be between 14.1% and 14.4% of sales. We anticipate operating margin will leverage in the first half but deleverage in the second half, as sales growth moderates and cost pressures and planned investments have a greater impact.\nWe continue to expect gross margin for the full year will be lower than fiscal 2021, driven primarily by lower merchandise margin resulting from the impact of brand mix, more normalized assortment management activity and a more normalized promotional environment. In addition, we believe fuel prices will continue to be volatile, resulting in higher supply chain costs than initially planned.\nWe continue to expect SG&A expense will deleverage for the year, driven primarily by $70 million to $75 million of expenses related to our strategic priorities, including investments to support UB Media, Ulta Beauty at Target, Project SOAR and other IT capabilities as well as higher wage rate growth across the enterprise, partially offset by lower marketing expense and incentive compensation.\nIn addition, we are seeing inflationary pressure on operating expenses like service provider fees, labor, supplies and travel, and we expect these trends to continue throughout fiscal 2022. These assumptions result in updated full year guidance for diluted EPS growth in the high single to low double-digit range.\nFor modeling purposes, some expenses initially planned for Q2 are expected to shift into Q3, primarily reflecting availability of resources and equipment. As a result of these shifts and a stronger than initially planned sales trend, we now expect to deliver earnings growth in the second quarter.\nIn closing, fiscal 2022 is off to a great start, but uncertainties remain. Our updated outlook reflects stronger top line performance and greater cost pressures as well as economic and global uncertainties that could adversely impact consumer spending later in the year.\nWhile our updated expectations for fiscal 2022 are above our longer-term targets for comp sales and operating margin, we are not changing our long-term financial targets at this time, given our limited visibility into the economic environment and expected cost pressures as we move through the rest of the year and into 2023.\nAnd now, I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce Ms. Kiley Rawlins, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rollins.

Kimbell\n\nCEO & Director, Ulta Beauty, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. Before discussing our results, I want to share how proud I am of our associates performance throughout 2021. While consistently providing care and service to our guests and to each other, they successfully navigated pandemic-related challenges and delivered exceptional results for all of our stakeholders.\nIn fiscal 2021, the beauty category recovered earlier and faster than we expected. And our teams adjusted quickly in many ways, including working with our brand partners, accelerate receipts and manage in stocks, creating highly relevant content that reflected the rapidly evolving mindset of our guests, adjusting staffing levels across the organization to meet growing demand and protecting and strengthening our culture, leading with their hearts and working together to create new ways to delight and excite guests, all while continuing to execute against our strategic priorities and drive our business forward.\nNow moving to our results for the quarter. The Ulta Beauty team delivered record fourth quarter financial results despite COVID and winter weather disruptions. Net sales increased 24.1% to $2.7 million -- $2.7 billion. Operating profit increased to 13.8% of sales and diluted EPS increased to $5.41 per share for the quarter.\nThe decisions our team has made and plans they executed with excellence around assortment strategies, inventory flow, marketing and staffing levels positioned us to take advantage of a positive consumer environment this holiday season and deliver strong results. I want to express my sincere appreciation to all Ulta Beauty associates, particularly in our stores and distribution centers, who show up every day positive and optimistic, ready to serve our guests while facing personal challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic. Their dedication enabled us to deliver these outstanding results and I am grateful for their flexibility as circumstances shifted.\nWe kicked off the holiday season in early November with our multichannel Celebrate More campaign. Our audience tailored creative and contextually relevant storytelling connected with consumers in fresh and bold ways across platforms, and we continue to expand live streaming and social selling experiences.\nWe enhanced our member love events, rewarding members with new loyalty offers to drive engagement, reactivation and retention, and we leveraged our CRM capabilities to further enhance the productivity of our promotions. We also enhanced our gift card program, including more innovative and inclusive designs and new multipack options, which helped deliver strong double-digit growth in card sales across stores and third-party channels.\nOur decision to proactively manage inventory flow resulted in strong sell-through of holiday merchandise and core product, and our teams transitioned quickly after Christmas to support our strategic Jumbo Love and Love your Skin event as well as significant brand launches. In January, we executed 4 exciting new brand launches at Ulta Beauty, OLAPLEX, Numero decene, Super Group and Billy Eilish.\nAs the #1 prestige hair care brand in the market, OLAPLEX offers patented bond building products and is changing how consumers engage with the hair care category. While our initial assortment included only 7 SKUs, it was one of the strongest brand launches in Ulta Beauty history. With the unique ability to offer guests the professional service in our salons and the retail products to take home, we are delighted to expand our partnership with OLAPLEX.\nIn makeup, we are excited to partner with Chanel Beauty as the exclusive U.S. retailer for the historic launch of Numero. Offering luxury to younger generations, this new line is sustainably sourced with clean ingredients and sustainable packaging. With an assortment spanning skin care, makeup and fragrance, is currently available in 250 Ulta Beauty stores and on ulta.com. This launch is a key element of our luxury beauty strategy, and we're very pleased with the initial results.\nIn skin care, we launched Super, known for its sunscreen expertise. Super is made with clean re-friendly ingredients is free and leverages sustainable packaging. And in fragrance, we launched a new offering exclusive to Ulta Beauty from acclaimed recording artist, Billy Eilish.\nTaking a closer look at sales trends in the quarter, guests were excited to return to in-store holiday shopping. Even doors delivered robust double-digit comp growth. E-commerce sales exceeded our expectations, increasing slightly on top of last year's 70% growth. This reinforces us that e-commerce is complementary and incremental to the physical shopping experience.\nGuests continue to increase their utilization of buy online, pick up in store while also engaging with our new same-day delivery option. During the quarter, BOPIS sales increased 20% to account for 17% of e-commerce sales compared to 15% in the fourth quarter last year. While only available in about 200 stores, we are pleased with the performance of our new same-day delivery options.\nFrom a category perspective, all major categories delivered double-digit comp growth compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, driven by cycling last year's disruption from COVID, strong execution of our holiday plans and product newness. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, fragrance, bath, hair care and skin care, all continued to deliver strong double-digit growth. Makeup was more challenged this quarter with trends decelerating from the third quarter across both prestige and mass makeup, although sales of mass makeup continued to be positive compared to 2019.\nOver the last year, as the beauty category has recovered, the performance of makeup has been more volatile and lagged other categories, in part reflecting higher sensitivity to COVID fluctuations. We remain confident that makeup will return to growth as consumer optimism and comfort with out-of-home activities increases. But we recognize timing and rate of recovery will continue to be impacted by changes in the COVID environment.\nLooking specifically at the fourth quarter trends in makeup, ACE, Lip and continued to deliver strong growth, driven by blush, tinted moistures, lip balm and lashes. Newness from El, Kiss and Ardell continue to excite and engage guests, while prestige brands like MAC, Clinique and Lancome also delivered positive growth. In addition, this quarter, we expanded Chanel into 50 additional stores and launched the full assortment on ulta.com.\nHair Care delivered double-digit growth, increasing to 28% of net sales. Consumer focus on hair health drove strong growth in treatments, shampoo and conditioner and tools like the Dyson were hot holiday gifts this year. New brands like OLAPLEX, KRISTIN ESS and Briogeo, as well as guest favorites like Redken and Living Proof delivered nice growth during the quarter.\nThe fragrance and path category was again the best performing major category during the quarter, delivering robust double-digit comp growth and increasing to 18% of net sales. Compelling newness from luxury brands like Gucci, Dior and Carolina Herrera as well as exclusive newness from Ariana Grande and Billy Ailish contributed to the strong growth. In addition, our holiday fragrance programs and our monthly fragrance crush program performed very well.\nFinally, skincare delivered another quarter of double-digit sales growth. Beauty enthusiasts are maintaining their skin care regimens as they continue to focus on self-care. Category growth in the quarter was primarily driven by moisturizers, cleansers and sun care. Newness continued to peel the guest as new brands, including Drunk Elephant, Good Molecules, Fresh and Black Girl Sunscreen as well as new products from Tula drove strong growth during the quarter. In addition, dermatology-based brands like Serve and La Roche Pose continued to resonate with guests.\nThe performance of our services business accelerated in the quarter, increasing more than 30% over last year, driven primarily by growth in transactions. During the quarter, we expanded salon capacity to 100% in all Ulta Beauty salons and benefit brow bars except for limited by state or local mandates and we relaunched services in 130 stores.\nIn addition, our recently launched salon services, Express Color and OLAPLEX Repair and Protect continue to bring in new members to our salons, an encouraging trend as we know members who use our services are some of our most valuable and engaged guests. Reflecting this momentum, during the quarter, we hired approximately 1,000 new associates to support our expanding business.\nNow turning to our results for the full year. The Ulta Beauty team delivered record sales of $8.6 billion, recorded operating margin of 15% of sales and record diluted EPS of $17.98 per share. Comparable sales increased 37.9% compared to fiscal 2020 and 12.6% compared to fiscal 2019. We expanded our market share in prestige beauty based on dollar sales for the 52 weeks ended January 29, 2022, compared to the same period last year based on point-of-sale data from the NPD Group.\nWe continue to fuel guest desires for newness with relevant brand launches such as Drunk Elephant, Bobby Brown, OLAPLEX, KRISTIN ESS and Verb. We expanded our conscious beauty platform to 270 certified brands, launch SKU level certification for the clean ingredients and vegan peelers and expanded are made without list. We doubled the number of black-owned brands in our assortment, welcoming Black Girls Sunscreen, Camille Rose, Homebody and Black Opel, among others, to the Ulta Beauty family and introduced dedicated space for brands in 260 stores.\nWe launched the wellness shop, a cross-category platform that offers guests self-care for the mind, body and spirit on ulta.com in more than 450 stores. We opened 44 net new stores, relocated 7 stores, remodeled 9 stores and negotiated more than 150 lease renewals. We continue to drive higher BOPUS utilization with new guest incentives, increased marketing to drive awareness and operational improvements to the guest and associate experience. As a result, BOPUS sales increased to 18% of e-commerce sales compared to 14% in fiscal 2020. Between BOPUS and our ship from store capabilities, about 28% of our digital orders this year were fulfilled by stores.\nWe launched our exciting new partnership with Target Corporation and opened 100 Ulta Beauty at Target locations. I'll share more on this later. We drove member growth through new acquisition, member reengagement and targeted retention efforts, increasing the number of Ultimate Rewards members to a record 37 million members.\nWe grew aided awareness to 94% and maintained unaided awareness at 48%. Importantly, we significantly increased Ulta Beauty consideration with Gen Z, Hispanic and Black Beauty Enthusiast, and created deeper, more emotional connections with consumers. We successfully navigate macro headwinds, including supply chain challenges and tight labor markets. We proactively invested in our teams with appreciation bonus for our store and DC associates. We doubled our renewable energy credit, invested in energy management system retrofits, dirted nearly 15 tons of waste from landfills through our recycling efforts and joined other leading retailers in the consortium to reinvent the retail bag.\nAnd we made meaningful progress against our DE&I commitments including launching the Muse platform, signing the 15% pledge, investing in in-store guest experience training reimagining our diverse leaders development program and integrating DE&I and across our internal talent life cycle.\nNow as we turn to fiscal 2022, consumers in the operating environment are changing faster than ever. Consumers are becoming increasingly resilient to COVID surges, but macro headwinds, global uncertainty and potential pandemic setbacks will likely continue to impact consumers. The beauty category is healthy and growing, and our proprietary consumer insights give us confidence that the recovery, which began last year will continue in 2022 as consumers maintain their self-care routines and engage in more social activities.\nAnd as consumers increase their consumption of services and experiences, our assortment and service offerings position us to benefit from these shifts. We know there will be challenges, but I am more excited than ever about the opportunity for Ulta Beauty to grow and continue to lead the beauty category. Last fall, we introduced a new strategic framework which will shape our future and enable us to deliver against our long-term financial targets.\nLet me share our fiscal 2022 priorities through the lens of each of our strategic pillars. Starting with our first pillar, we will drive breakroom and disruptive growth through an expanded definition of all things beauty. Our differentiated assortment is core to our success. And in fiscal 2022, we intend to enhance and expand our conscious beauty platform, further increase our assortment of black-owned, black-founded and black-lead brands in support of our 15% pledge and build the infrastructure to support these brands, expand the wellness shop to an additional 300 stores and continue to evolve and expand our offering across core categories to engage and excite the beauty enthusiasts.\nTo drive growth and capture market share, we will continue to add relevant brands to our assortment. In recent weeks, we've executed one of our most anticipated brand launches ever, Fenty Beauty. Partnering with Rihanna and Fenty Beauty, we announced the news on February 17 through social channels, achieving higher mentioned volume and reach than any other Ulta Beauty brand launch announcement. The initial guest response was incredibly positive, trending as the #1 topic on the day of the announcement.\nTurning now to our second pillar to evolve the guest experience through our personalized and connected omnichannel ecosystem, all in your world. Beauty enthusiasts are increasingly leveraging both physical and digital channels, and we have the power to connect and engage with them across the beauty journey and meet them wherever they are.\nIn fiscal 2022, we intend to leverage our real estate pipeline to pilot a new in-store experience with a layout and flow that reflects our key merchandising strategies and consolidates guest services in a central location. Test a small store format with an optimized assortment and service offering in a handful of small markets, enhance our buy anywhere, fill anywhere efforts by expanding our same-day delivery option, continue to create leading digital experiences through the ongoing refresh of our digital store to provide guests with an experience that seamlessly merges content with commerce, the expansion of our virtual try-on capabilities and new capabilities resulting from our digital fund investments.\nWe'll provide guests with more convenience through the launch of Afterpay as a payment option in stores and will expand the Ulta Beauty at Target shop in more than 250 new target locations.\nAs part of our efforts to expand our omnichannel ecosystem, last year, we joined forces with the Target Corporation to create a new way for guests to discover prestige beauty. In just 9 short months, the Ulta Beauty and Target teams work together to design a space that feels authentic to both brands. We connected 2 independent loyalty programs. We made it easy for guests to link their accounts and we onboarded more than 50 prestige brands.\nI am pleased to share that in our Ulta Beauty at Target location, customer awareness remains very strong. Guests are shopping across categories and more than 1 million members have linked their Ultimate Rewards and Target Circle accounts. Building on this foundation, this year, our focus is on accelerating new member acquisition, optimizing the guest experience and continuing to amplify marketing as we scale.\nMoving now to our third pillar, expand and deepen our presence across the guest beauty journey, firmly placing Ulta Beauty at the heart of the beauty community. In fiscal 2022, we intend to further build upon our brand purpose and elevate our marketing efforts to include more action-based programming that address the needs of key audiences; expand live streaming and social selling; drive member growth and leverage data and analytics to increase the personalization of our communication, deepen engagement and shift share of wallet; and launch our retail media network, UB Media.\nOur fourth pillar is to drive operational excellence and optimization. We are investing in multiple significant cross-functional projects that require capital and resources, but position us to capture additional market share, fund enhancements to the guest experience and deliver future profitable growth.\nIn fiscal 2022, we plan to execute the first phase of Project SOAR, our multiyear effort to upgrade our enterprise resource planning platform, migrate to Google Cloud as our data and analytics platform to facilitate data accessibility, enhanced reporting and faster decision-making, begin a 2-year effort to refresh our store POS systems and leverage our continuous improvement capability to identify, prioritize, activate and measure meaningful cross-functional process optimization opportunities.\nIn support of our supply chain optimization efforts, this year, we plan to begin an upgrade and retrofit of our Greenwood distribution center, began construction of our first market fulfillment center and implement new transportation tools to provide better visibility to loads in transit.\nOur winning culture is a key driver of Ulta Beauty's success. And our fifth strategic pillar is to protect and cultivate our world-class culture intent. We strive to make Ulta Beauty a great place to work by leading with our hearts, caring for each other in everything we do and demonstrating integrity, authenticity and inclusivity daily.\nTo reinforce our position as an employer of choice and enable us to continue to successfully navigate anticipated tight labor markets, this year, we intend to increase investments in training and development programs to enhance the guest experience, improve personal performance and help associates manage their, continue leveraging our diverse slate recruitment efforts, further enhance and optimize our talent acquisition processes, increase investment in development programs to help associates plan and develop their careers and continue to navigate the pandemic with safety at the forefront for all of our associates.\nFinally, our sixth strategic pillar is to expand our environmental and social impact. As the largest U.S. beauty retailer, we have the power to shape how the world sees beauty and responsibility to inspire positive change. Building on the progress we made in 2021, this year, we plan to continue to amplify underrepresented voices through media investments with multicultural platforms, the expansion of our platform and increased brand marketing support for black-owned, black founded and black lead brands within our assortment, build an ecosystem to support the pipeline of bypback brands, including the creation of an accelerator program focused on early-stage bypack beauty brands to educate, inspire and support brand participants, to prepare for retail readiness and an investment in new voices, a venture capital firm that partners with and invest in entrepreneurs of color to drive scalable, sustainable businesses, continue to invest in training and internal programming to ensure our guests, associates and communities feel connected to and reflected at Ulta Beauty.\nAnd as we look to reduce our carbon footprint, we plan to expand our LED lighting retrofit program, double our investment in renewable energy credits and explore opportunities to collaborate with our brand partners to identify opportunities to reduce Scope 3 emissions together.\nWe recently published our 2021 ESG report, which includes information about our strong corporate governance practices and commitment to operating and ethical business. In addition, it includes disclosures aligned with the SASB Index and TCFD as well as updated EE01.\nIn closing, I am incredibly proud of what the Ulta Beauty team has accomplished and excited about the opportunities ahead. We operate in a healthy culturally relevant and growing category. We have a strong proven business model, and we have a winning culture and simply outstanding associates. We have ambitious plans, and I am confident we have the right team to execute our strategies and deliver for our guests, associates and shareholders.\nAnd now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott?\n\nScott M. Settersten\n\nCFO, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary, Ulta Beauty, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our financial results, I want to echo Dave's comments and express my sincere appreciation to all our Ulta Beauty associates for their focus on providing great guest experiences and managing the business, especially in such a dynamic operating environment. Their dedication to our guests and each other enabled us to deliver another strong quarter and an outstanding year for our shareholders.\nNow to our fourth quarter results, beginning with the income statement. Overall, results for the quarter were better than anticipated, primarily driven by stronger-than-expected holiday sales and our rational promotional environment. Sales growth across both physical and digital channels were stronger than expected, resulting in gross margin and less SG&A delevered than planned. As a result, operating margin increased to 13.8% of sales for the quarter.\nNet sales for the quarter increased 24.1%, driven by 21.4% growth in comp sales and strong new store performance. Transactions for the quarter increased 10.4%, driven by double-digit growth in store traffic. And average ticket increased 9.9%, resulting from both a higher average selling price and an increase in units per transaction.\nLooking at the cadence of sales for the quarter, November was the strongest month, supported by our successful marketing efforts and guests early holiday shopping. Post-holiday overall growth moderated, driven primarily by a deceleration of store traffic, likely reflecting disruption from weather and the Omicron variant.\nDuring the quarter, we opened 6 new stores, relocated 3 stores and remodeled 1 store. Compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, total sales increased 18.4% and comp sales increased 15.4%. For the quarter, gross margin increased about 250 basis points to 37.6% of sales compared to 35.1% last year. The increase was primarily due to the leverage of fixed costs, favorable channel mix shifts and higher merchandise margin.\nConsistent with trends we experienced in the first 3 quarters of the year, in the fourth quarter, strong top line growth and benefits from our occupancy cost optimization efforts resulted in significant leverage of fixed costs. Channel mix was favorable as the penetration of e-commerce sales was about 600 basis points lower than last year, and merchandise margin improved, primarily due to lower promotional activity and ongoing benefits from our category management efforts.\nComparing this year's performance to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, gross margin improved by 260 basis points. Higher merchandise margin and fixed cost leverage were partially offset by adverse channel mix. As planned, SG&A increased 26% to $650 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased 40 basis points to 23.8% compared to 23.4% last year, primarily due to higher incentive compensation and store payroll and benefits, partially offset by leverage of marketing expense due to higher sales.\nReflecting strong operational performance versus our internal targets, incentive compensation associated with our annual bonus programs increased compared to last year. In addition, we elected to grant discretionary appreciation bonuses to our store associates in recognition of their efforts to deliver this outstanding performance. In total, higher incentive compensation drove about 60 basis points of deleverage in the quarter.\nStore payroll and benefits expense in the quarter was higher than last year, reflecting an increase in the number of store associates and higher average wage rates. Compared to fiscal 2019, SG&A as a percentage of sales was about 140 basis points unfavorable, primarily due to higher incentive compensation and marketing expense.\nOperating margin was 13.8% of sales compared to 10.2% of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 on a GAAP basis and 11.6% of sales on an adjusted basis. Strong top line growth, driven primarily by stores, combined with the impact of our ongoing cost optimization efforts, resulted in record level operating margin performance.\nThe company's tax rate decreased to 22.9% compared to 23.4% in the fourth quarter last year. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to a benefit from the income tax accounting for share-based compensation and state tax credits. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased to $5.41 compared to $3.03 last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in Q4 of last year was $3.41.\nTo recap the full year, our teams delivered sales and profits that far exceeded pre-pandemic levels. Compared to fiscal 2019, sales increased 16.7% to $8.6 billion. Operating profit increased 44% to $1.3 billion or 15% of sales and diluted EPS increased 48% to $17.98 per share.\nMoving on to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 28% to $1.5 billion compared to $1.2 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 44 net new stores, the increase reflects inventory purchases to support new brand launches, including OLAPLEX, Fenty and Chanel as well as proactive efforts to maintain strong in-stocks of key items to support expected demand and mitigate anticipated global supply chain disruptions.\nIn fiscal 2021, we invested $172 million in capital expenditures, including approximately $89 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $60 million for supply chain and IT, and about $23 million for store maintenance and other.\nDepreciation for the year was $268 million compared to $298 million last year, primarily reflecting the impact of last year's store impairments and store closures. Ulta Beauty continues to generate significant cash from operations. As we shared at our October Analyst Day, our priority for use of cash is to reinvest in the business to drive profitable growth. After investing to support growth, we will continue to look to return excess capital to shareholders.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.9 million shares at a cost of $760 million . We elected to accelerate repurchases in the fourth quarter to take advantage of better-than-expected cash flow. Since launching our stock buyback program in 2014, we've purchased 14 million shares at an average price of $275, effectively returning $3.9 billion to shareholders while continuing to invest in strategic growth drivers. Having essentially completed the authorization announced in March of 2020, Today, we announced a new share repurchase authorization for $2 billion.\nTurning now to our outlook. We are emerging from the pandemic as a stronger, healthier business. Over the last 2 years, we've strengthened category margins and improved our ability to optimize promotions. Our real estate portfolio is healthy and improved economics. Our e-commerce business is larger and more profitable, and we've strengthened our analytical capabilities and adjusted our cost structure.\nAt our Analyst Day in October, we shared an updated growth algorithm with investors. Over the next 3 years, we expect to deliver net sales growth between $0.05 and $0.07 on a compound annual growth basis using fiscal 2019 as the base year; operating profit between 13% and 14% of sales; low double-digit diluted earnings per share growth on a CAGR basis, again using fiscal 2019 as the base year; and maintaining capital ventures between 4% and 5% of sales.\nAs we look to fiscal 2022, we continue to expect that sales growth and operating margin will be in line with these longer-term targets. Our EPS guidance of low to mid-single-digit growth reflects lapping extraordinary performance in fiscal 2021. Our guidance for fiscal 2022 also includes macro considerations including continued wage pressures and higher supply chain costs as well as the impact of a more normalized investment agenda.\nSpecifically, in fiscal 2022, we plan to open approximately 50 net new stores and remodel or relocate approximately 35 stores. We expect net sales will be between $9.05 billion and $9.15 billion with comp sales growth between 3% and 4%. Our sales outlook reflects a more normalized growth trend for the beauty category, including a modest recovery in makeup while also considering various uncertainties, including inflationary risks to consumer spending and the impact of increasing points of distribution for prestige beauty.\nFor your modeling purposes, we anticipate comp growth in the first half will be in the mid-single-digit range, driven by stronger growth in the first quarter and then moderate-to-low single-digit growth as we lap last year's recovery. We expect operating margin for the year will be between 13.7% and 14% of sales compared to 15% in fiscal 2021, with deleverage from both gross margin and SG&A. We anticipate operating margin deleverage will be greater in the first half as we lap last year's strong performance.\nWe expect gross margin will be lower than fiscal 2021, driven primarily by lower merchandise margin resulting from the impact of new brand launches, lapping onetime benefits from favorable inventory reserve adjustments and a more normalized promotional environment. We also expect supply chain costs will increase more than sales resulting in additional pressure on gross margin.\nWe expect SG&A expense will deleverage, driven primarily by $70 million to $75 million of expenses related to our strategic priorities, including investments to support UB Media, Ulta Beauty at Target, Project Sour and other IT capabilities as well as higher wage rate growth across the enterprise, partially offset by lower incentive compensation. These assumptions result in guidance for diluted earnings per share in the range of $18.20 to $18.70 per share including the impact of approximately $900 million in share repurchases.\nWe are not providing specific quarterly guidance, but as you update your financial models consider that the second quarter will likely be our most challenging quarter of the year as we lap extraordinary performance in fiscal 2021. As a result, we are currently planning for EPS in the second quarter to decrease about 10%.\nFinally, we plan to spend between $375 million and $425 million in CapEx, including approximately $195 million for supply chain and IT, $150 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, and about $55 million for store maintenance and other. We expect depreciation for the year will be between $250 million and $255 million.\nI would note that our guidance assumes no changes in federal tax rate environment and no material increases in the federal minimum wage.\nIn closing, a rapidly recovering environment, combined with the outstanding efforts of our teams and the work we have done to strengthen the business, enabled us to deliver record performance in fiscal 2021. While lapping this performance will be difficult, we remain confident in our longer-term growth targets. Ulta Beauty has established significant long-term competitive advantages, and we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities within the $140 billion U.S. beauty products and salon services industry and continue to deliver long-term shareholder value.\nAnd now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, October 30, 2025. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now turn the call over to Andrew Schaeffer, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets of MAA for opening comments.\n\nAndrew Schaeffer\n\nSenior VP, Treasurer & Director of Capital Markets, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Regina, and good morning, everyone. This is Andrew Schaeffer, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets for MAA. Members of the management team participating on the call this morning are Brad Hill, Tim Argo, Clay Holder and Rob DelPriore.\nBefore we begin with prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of this discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34-F filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results.\nDuring this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. Our earnings release and supplement are currently available on the For Investors page of our website at www.maac.com.\nA copy of our prepared comments and an audio recording of this call will also be available on our website later today. After some brief prepared comments, the management team will be available to answer questions.\nI will now turn the call over to Brad.\n\nAdrian Bradley Hill\n\nExecutive VP & CIO, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. As highlighted in our earnings release, our third quarter core FFO results met our expectations, reinforcing the resilience of our platform and strategy. While the broader economic environment has introduced some challenges, including slower job growth and tempered pricing power in new leases, we are still seeing recovery. Strong occupancy, solid collections and year-over-year improvements in new renewal and blended lease rates in the third quarter demonstrate our momentum.\nDemand across our markets remains healthy and we are encouraged that the record level of lease-ups in our region are being absorbed with occupancy levels increasing 450 basis points over the past 5 quarters and now approaching pre-COVID levels. Supply levels in our markets, though elevated historically, are trending down at a faster pace than many other regions. As new deliveries continue to decline each quarter, we anticipate a strengthening recovery in pricing power and operating performance.\nImportantly, new starts remain below long-term averages and have for the past 10 quarters, and we see no indication of an acceleration in starts. In fact, per our third-party data provider, our markets saw just 0.2% of inventory in new starts in the third quarter. And starts over the trailing 4 quarters were just 1.8% of inventory, roughly half the historical norm, positioning us for sustained improvement.\nOur diversified presence across high-growth markets and more affordable price point provides access to a broader segment of the rental market that is financially strong, supporting continued strong collections. Additionally, our region continues to capture one of the highest levels of annual wage growth, as evidenced by the increasing incomes of our new residents, driving favorable rent-to-income ratios, which remain at a healthy low of 20%.\nImproving leasing conditions also bolster our redevelopment pipeline and offering residents a newly renovated unit at a more affordable price as compared to the higher-priced new multifamily supply. Due to persistent single-family affordability challenges, our strong customer service and demographic trends that support renting, residents are choosing to stay longer with only 10.8% of our move-outs occurring due to home purchases.\nOur balance sheet remains a key strength with our recent credit facility expansion, which Clay will discuss in a moment, providing exceptional flexibility. While the transaction market has been active at sub-5% cap rates, we continue to identify select accretive opportunities such as our recent Kansas City acquisition, a stabilized suburban 318-unit property that we purchased for approximately $96 million and is expected to deliver a year 1 NOI yield of 5.8%.\nSubsequent to quarter end, we purchased an adjacent land parcel for an 88-unit Phase 2 that will expand the stabilized NOI yield on our total investment to nearly 6.5% after capturing additional scale and efficiencies from the Phase 2 development. We are also advancing our development pipeline and securing additional attractive long-term investment opportunities. In today's equity-constrained environment, our access to capital and development expertise remain competitive advantages.\nFollowing quarter end, we acquired land, plans and permits for a shovel-ready project in Scottsdale, Arizona scheduled to begin construction in the fourth quarter. This project, like others we've recently launched reflects our ability to capitalize on situations where developers face equity challenges, allowing us to secure projects at a compelling basis. The Scottsdale development is expected to deliver a stabilized NOI yield of 6.1%.\nIn total, we now own or control 15 development sites with approvals for over 4,200 units. And if market conditions remain supportive, we anticipate starting construction on 6 to 8 projects over the next 6 quarters. driving meaningful earnings contribution in the years ahead.\nWith a 30-year track record of delivering through economic cycles, we remain confident in our ability to execute during this transition. Our focus on high-demand, high-growth markets, significant redevelopment opportunities, efficiency gains from technology initiatives rolling out in '26 and beyond and a growing external growth strategy position us for stronger earnings growth.\nOur portfolio will continue to benefit from job growth, wage growth, household formation and migration and population trends that outpace other regions. We are encouraged by the building blocks that are in place in what we expect will be an acceleration of the recovery cycle in 2026 leading to sustained revenue and earnings growth and new deliveries continue to decline and the recovery advances.\nTo all our associates across our properties and corporate offices, thank you for your unwavering dedication and commitment during this busy leasing season. Your efforts continue to drive our success.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call over to Tim.\n\nTimothy P. Argo\n\nExecutive VP, Chief Strategy & Analysis Officer, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, we saw increasing occupancy and strong retention and renewal lease rates but experienced continued lack of traction and the ability to push on new lease rates. We believe broad economic uncertainty and slower job growth, as evidenced by a downward revision to the job growth numbers, contributed to prospects being more cautious about making decisions to move and to operators prioritizing occupancy over new lease rents.\nDespite the challenging environment for new leases, we continue to see new lease-over-lease pricing improve over the prior year at minus 5.2%, up 20 basis points as compared to the third quarter of 2024 with the strong renewal lease-over-lease performance of plus 4.5%, which was up 40 basis points over the prior year. Blended pricing for the quarter was positive 0.3%, improving 50 basis points from the third quarter of last year.\nAs mentioned, average physical occupancy sequentially improved to 95.6% in the third quarter, representing a 20 basis point increase from the second quarter. Additionally, we had another quarter of strong collections with net delinquency representing just 0.3% of billed rents.\nA number of our mid-tier markets particularly in the Mid-Atlantic region continue to be outperformers relative to the portfolio. Richmond and the D.C. area markets remain strong, and other markets such as Savannah, Charleston and Greenville all demonstrated strong pricing power in the quarter. Of our larger markets, Houston continue to be steady and we are seeing encouraging progress in Atlanta and the Dallas-Fort Worth area properties, where blended pricing in both of these markets improved sequentially from the second quarter and outperformed the same-store portfolio.\nThe lagging markets we have noted for the past few quarters remain consistent with Austin continuing to work through its record supply pressure resulting in weak new lease pricing and National facing significant pricing pressure as well.\nIn our lease-up portfolio, we had 3 properties: West Midtown, Daybreak and Milepost 35 reach stabilization in the third quarter. We continue to make progress with our other 4 lease-up properties, which have a combined occupancy of 66.1% as of the end of the third quarter and the 2 development properties that are currently leasing units. We have seen the uncertainty and higher leasing price on a portion of our lease-up portfolio and pushed the stabilization date by 1 quarter for [ Valdosta ] and Phoenix.\nWhile Liberty Road just started leasing the other 5 properties with units delivered are well into the lease-up process and rents are in line with the original performance. This helps preserve the long-term value creation opportunity despite the overall leasing velocity being a little bit behind original expectations.\nOur various targeted redevelopment and repositioning initiatives continued in the third quarter, and we still expect to accelerate these programs into 2026. During the third quarter of 2025, we completed 2,090 interior unit upgrades, achieving rent increases of $99 above nonupgraded units and a cash-on-cash return in excess of 20%. This was an acceleration of both volume of completed units and rate growth achieved from the second quarter.\nDespite this more competitive supply environment, these units leased on average 10 days faster than nonrenovated units when adjusted for the additional turn time. We still expect to renovate approximately 6,000 units in 2025.\nAnd for our common area and amenity repositioning program, we continue the repricing phase at 6 recent projects with 5 of the 6 past the halfway point in repricing. So far, the results are encouraging with double-digit NOI yields and far exceeding peer MAA properties. 5 additional projects are now underway with the anticipated repricing to coincide with the prime 2026 leasing season. We are live on 5 2025 retrofit projects for community-wide WiFi with go live base planned through the remainder of 2025 at an additional 15 communities.\nAs we approach the end of October, our current occupancy is 95.6% and 60-day exposure at 6.1%, 20 basis points and 30 basis points, respectively, better than this time last year, which keeps us in a position for stable occupancy heading into the slower traffic season. As Brad referenced, new supply pressure continues to moderate and remains strong with market-level occupancies including lease-ups at the highest level since mid-2019.\nOur theme of strong renewal performance continued in the fourth quarter with higher retention rates and lease-over-lease growth rates on renewals accepted for October, November, December, ranging between plus 4.5% and plus 4.9%. Moderating construction starts, Sunbelt market demand dynamics and high retention rates underlie our optimism for an improving leasing environment, particularly as we get into the spring and summer leasing season of 2026.\nThat's all I have in the way of prepared comments. Now I'll turn the call over to Clay.\n\nA. Clay Holder\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We reported core FFO for the quarter of $2.16 per diluted share, which was in line with the midpoint of our third quarter guidance. Favorable overhead expenses of $0.01 and same-store expenses of $0.05 and were offset by unfavorable same-store revenues of $0.05 and nonsame-store expenses of $0.01.\nAs Tim alluded to in his comments, our occupancy and renewal lease performance remained strong and were in line with our projections for the quarter while new lease rates performed below our expectations. During the quarter, we funded approximately $78 million in development cost for our current $797 million pipeline, leaving $254 million to be funded on the current pipeline over the next 3 years. Our balance sheet remains well positioned to support these and other future growth opportunities.\nAt the end of the quarter, we had $815 million in combined cash and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 4.2x. At quarter end, our outstanding debt was approximately 91% fixed with an average maturity of 6.3 years at an effective rate of 3.8%.\nSubsequent to quarter end, we amended our revolving credit facility, increasing the capacity of the facility from $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion and extending the maturity of the facility to January 2030. In addition, we amended our commercial paper program to increase the maximum amount of outstanding commercial paper borrowings to $750 million. We have an upcoming $400 million bond maturity in November that we expect to refinance in the fourth quarter.\nFinally, we have adjusted our core FFO and same-store guidance for the year as well as revised other areas of our detailed guidance previously provided. Primarily due to the lower recovery trajectory on new lease rents as the broader economy and employment markets moderated over the summer months, we are making slight adjustments to our guidance associated with same-store rent growth. We are lowering the midpoint of effective rent growth guidance to negative 0.4% while maintaining average fiscal occupancy guidance at 95.6% for the year.\nTotal same-store revenue guidance for the year is revised to negative 0.05%. We are also lowering our same-store property operating expense growth projections for the year to 2.2% at the midpoint. The lower guidance is primarily due to favorable third quarter property tax valuations as compared to our original expectations. The changes to our same-store revenue and property operating expense projections resulted us adjusting our same-store NOI expectation to negative 1.35%.\nIn addition to updating our same-store operating projections, we are revising our 2025 guidance to reflect favorable trends in overhead expenses, along with adjusting our acquisition and disposition volume for the year given the current transactions market. The impact of these adjustments, combined with the updated expectations for our non-same-store portfolio, resulted in us adjusting the midpoint of our full year core FFO guidance to $8.74 per share and narrowing the range of $8.68 to $8.80 per share.\nThat is all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So Regina, we will now turn the call back to you for questions."

After some brief prepared comments, the management team will be able to answer questions.\nI will now turn the call over to Brad.\n\nAdrian Bradley Hill\n\nExecutive VP & CIO, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone.\nAs detailed in our release, second quarter core FFO results were ahead of our expectations. With the sequential improvement in new renewal and blended lease-over-lease rates all exceeding the prior year's sequential improvement. While the economic uncertainty has caused the pace of recovery in pricing power to slow across the country, the recovery in our portfolio is underway. And as the economic uncertainty stabilizes and deliveries continue to decline, the recovery should accelerate. Demand remains resilient with absorption across our markets, reaching the highest level in over 25 years.\nEncouragingly, absorption has now outpaced new deliveries for 4 consecutive quarters, with the gap between the trailing 12-month absorption and new deliveries in our markets approaching the level lasting during COVID. The downward trend in new deliveries is helping market conditions to firm up with market-level occupancies, improving in many of our markets, and we are seeing pockets of decreasing concessions, a combination that should lead to improved pricing power. With a stable employment sector and strong wage growth, our residents are financially healthy, leading to continued good collections and improving rent-to-income ratios.\nOur diversified portfolio focus on high-growth markets and operating scale continue to position MAA best to capitalize on these favorable trends to a greater degree as the demand/supply balance moves more in our favor. The resilience of our platform is evident. In the midst of still elevated supply, we have maintained stable occupancy, achieved higher renewal rates and increased our retention, the result of our team's focus on customer service and operational consistency.\nOn the external growth front, because of our access to capital, we continue to find select compelling development opportunities. We remain committed to the disciplined expansion of our development pipeline, and we are making progress towards that goal. In the second quarter, we started construction on a 336 unit suburban project in Charleston, South Carolina, which is expected to deliver a stabilized NOI yield of 6.1%, bringing our active pipeline to 2,648 units at nearly $1 billion. We own or control 12 additional sites with approvals of nearly 3,300 more units.\nAmid record pressure from competitive lease-ups in our markets, we remain patient in our approach to leasing up our new communities and are prioritizing rents and long-term value creation, allowing us to achieve our expected lease-up rents and deliver stabilized NOI yields that continue to trend above our original expectations. Our development projects are well positioned to benefit from the declining new starts and the tightening supply backdrop. The acquisition market remains relatively quiet. Transaction volumes are still muted as bid-ask spreads persist and capital remains cautious given elevated interest rates. That said, we are evaluating several opportunities. We have a stabilized suburban acquisition with a small Phase II development component in the Kansas City market under contract, and we expect it to close upon the completion of our due diligence review during the third quarter.\nOur strong balance sheet and liquidity position will allow us to be opportunistic should more attractive acquisition opportunities become available in the second half of the year. With a 30-year track record of navigating economic cycles, we remain confident in our ability to execute through this transition period and that our focus on high demand and high-growth markets will continue to lead to higher earnings and lower volatility over the full cycle. Our markets continue to benefit from higher job growth, wage growth, household formation and demographic tailwinds than the national average. We're encouraged by the building blocks that are in place and the growing momentum heading into the back half of the year and remain confident in our ability to deliver compounding revenue and earnings performance as the recovery continues to accelerate.\nTo all our associates across our properties and in our corporate and regional offices, thank you for your continued dedication and focus during this pivotal leasing season.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Tim.\n\nTimothy P. Argo\n\nExecutive VP, Chief Strategy & Analysis Officer, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone.\nFor the second quarter, we saw a steady progression in new lease over lease rates from what was achieved in the first quarter. Though, as Brad mentioned, broad economic uncertainty did slow the pace of new lease pricing recovery that we saw through April and caused May and June new lease pricing to be a bit below our expectations. The uncertainty showed up twofold with prospects being more selective in making decisions and operators continuing to lean toward occupancy despite broadly improving market level occupancies. However, renewal lease performance represented by the high level of renewal acceptance and the rates achieved continue to outperform expectations. As a result, we saw lesser lease pricing improvement from the first to second quarter that exceeded 2024 for new leases and renewals, which manifested into stronger sequential blended pricing growth as compared to the prior year. Blended pricing for the quarter was 0.5%, which represented a 100 basis point improvement from the first quarter. Along with the stronger pricing trend, we had stable average physical occupancy of 95.4% and another quarter of strong collections with net delinquency representing just 0.3% of billed rents. Our strongest performing markets continue to be consistent with what we have seen in the last few quarters, led by many of our mid-tier markets. Our Virginia markets remain strong and other mid-tier markets such as Kansas City, Charleston and Greenville, all demonstrated strong pricing power. Of our larger markets, Tampa continued to show pricing recovery and Houston was steady as well. We also continue to see a slow but steady recovery in Atlanta, which had our largest year-over-year improvement in both blended pricing and occupancy of any of our higher concentration markets. Austin continues to face record supply pressure, resulting in weaker new lease pricing, Phoenix and Nashville are 2 other markets facing significant pricing pressure. We have seen the uncertainty and higher leasing pressure particularly impact the leasing velocity in our lease-up portfolio. And in turn, we pushed the stabilization dates by 1 quarter for 3 of our lease-up properties, West Midtown, Vale and Valvista. However, across our lease-ups, we've achieved rents to date, 2.5% ahead of pro forma. We had 1 property, MAA Boggy Creek, reached stabilization in the quarter, and our 6 remaining lease-up properties ended the quarter with a combined occupancy of 80.7%. Despite supply concerns, we continue to execute various targeted redevelopment and repositioning initiatives in the second quarter, and we expect to accelerate these programs over the remainder of 2025 and into 2026. Through the second quarter of 2025 year-to-date, we completed 2,678 interior unit upgrades, achieving rent increases of $95 above non-upgraded units and a cash-on-cash return in excess of 19%. This was an acceleration above volume and rent growth achieved from the first quarter. Despite this more headed supply environment, these units leased on average 9.5 days faster that non-renovated units when adjusted for the additional turn time. We still expect to renovate approximately 6,000 units in 2025 with more expected in 2026.\nFor our repositioning program, we began repricing in the second quarter at 5 of our 6 recent repositioning projects with the last slated to begin repricing in August. Early results are encouraging with NOI yields in the low teens based on current pricing. We have identified several additional projects to start later this year with anticipated repricing in time for the [indiscernible] in 2026 leasing season. Work also continues on 23 retrofits for community-wide WiFi with go-live dates planned through the remainder of 2025.\nWith July closeout in process, we continue to see seasonal pricing and occupancy trends that are aligned with our guidance. July pricing is trending better than the second quarter and our current occupancy at the end of July is 95.7%. Our 60-day exposure for July of 7.1%, 10 basis points lower than last year and keeps us in a position for stable occupancy to allow for pricing power, assuming demand fundamentals remain intact. Brad noted the exceptionally strong absorption with absorption in our markets exceeding new supply for the fourth straight quarter or said another way, the fourth straight quarter with fewer available units for lease in our markets than the prior quarter. [ Strict ] in our renewals continues with the percentage of our residents accepting real offers exceeding last year's record level at least a release growth rates on renewals accepted for July, August and September in the 4.5% range. Strong absorption, declining deliveries and high retention rates underlie our optimism for an expected continuously improving lease environment over the next several quarters.\nThat's all I have in the way of prepared comments. Now I'll turn the call over to Clay.\n\nA. Clay Holder\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone.\nWe reported Core FFO for the quarter of $2.15 per diluted share, which was $0.02 per share ahead of the midline of our second quarter guidance. The favorability to our guidance driven by $0.025 related to favorable overhead expenses, $0.01 of favorable interest expense and other nonoperating income and $0.005 from our same-store NOI performance, partially offset by unfavorable non-same-store NOI of $0.02, which was mostly driven by the impact of elevated supply pressure on the lease-up portfolio.\nOur same-store revenue results for the quarter were in line with our expectations as revenues benefited from strong collections during the quarter. Our same-store expense performance was better than expected, primarily driven by real estate tax expense. We now have more information relating to our real estate expense for the year as municipalities have started providing 2025 property valuations, which I'll discuss more with our revised guidance in a moment.\nDuring the quarter, we funded approximately $92 million in development costs for the current $943 million pipeline, leaving an expected $326 million to be funded on our current pipeline over the next 2 to 3 years. Our balance sheet remains well positioned to support future growth opportunities with $1 billion in combined cash and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, and our low debt net to -- debt-to-EBITDA at 4x. At quarter end, our outstanding debt was approximately 94% fixed with an average maturity of 6.7 years at an effective rate of 3.8%. We have an upcoming $400 million bond maturity in November that we plan to refinance later this year.\nFinally, we are reaffirming the midpoint of our same-store NOI and Core FFO guidance for the year while revising other areas of our detailed guidance that we've previously provided. Given our operating results achieved in the second quarter, we are making slight adjustments to our guidance associated with same-store growth. We are lowering the midpoint of effective rent growth guidance to negative 0.25% and while maintaining average fiscal occupancy guidance at 95.6% for the year. Total same-store revenue guidance for the year is revised to 0.1%, which also reflects continued [indiscernible] collection performance over the back half of the year. We are lowering our same-store property and operating expense growth projections for the year to 2.25% at the midpoint. We have better insight into our real estate tax expense for 2025 and have lowered the midpoint of our guidance to 0.25%. The lower guidance is primarily due to favorable property valuations in certain jurisdictions as compared to our original expectations. Also, we recently renewed our property and casualty insurance program on July 1 and achieved an overall premium decrease on our property and casualty lines. We now expect our interest expense for the full year to increase by 1.3% as compared to last year. The changes to our property operating expense projections, combined with our updated same-store revenue expectations, resulted in us reaffirming our original expectation for same-store NOI at negative [ 1.15%. ]\nIn addition to updating our same-store operating projections, we are revising our 2025 guidance to reflect favorable trends in overhead expenses, along with adjusting our acquisition and disposition volume for the year given the current transaction market. The impact of these adjustments, combined with our continued focus on pricing in our lease-up portfolio resulted in us maintaining the midpoint of our full year Core FFO guidance at $8.77 per share by narrowing the range to $8.65 to $8.89 per share.\nThat is all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So Regina, we will now turn the call back to you for questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, May 1, 2025.\nI will now turn the call over to Andrew Schaeffer, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets of MAA for opening comments.\n\nAndrew Schaeffer\n\nSenior VP, Treasurer & Director of Capital Markets, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Regina, and good morning, everyone. This is Andrew Schaeffer, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets for MAA.

After some brief prepared comments, the management team will be available to answer questions.\nI will now turn the call over to Brad.\n\nAdrian Bradley Hill\n\nExecutive VP & CIO, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. As detailed in our release, first quarter performance results were ahead of our expectations, as strong demand was evident in multiple areas of our performance, including occupancy, collections and pricing trends. While pricing trends for new resident move-ins continue to reflect the impact from new supply delivering in several of our markets, renewal pricing remains strong and our retention rate increasing, leading to the first quarter '25 blended lease pricing that was ahead of our expectations.\nWe are encouraged by the resilience our portfolio has displayed in the face of the unprecedented levels of new supply that we've experienced over the past year as well as our positioning to capture continued improvement as we enter the summer leasing season. As Tim will discuss in more detail, we are seeing encouraging signs that indicate leasing conditions are poised to support stable occupancy and improvement in blended lease rates that align with the outlook that we provided in our prior guidance, having a compounding impact on revenue performance throughout the year. While macroeconomic uncertainties have increased due to the potential tariffs, our exclusive focus on high-growth markets, lower average price point, broad diversification by market, submarket and price point, our operating efficiencies and scale should position MAA to weather tariff or economic challenges and allow us to take advantage of growth opportunities that may arise.\nBecause of these portfolio characteristics, MAA has not only outperformed in previous downturns in times of uncertainty, but delivered good performance over the past year in the face of a 50-year record high level of supply. In the first quarter, we were able to increase our year-over-year occupancy by 30 basis points and produce average effective rent per unit that was only down $9 per unit from the level we achieved in first quarter of '24.\nOur current metrics are indicating no material change in customer behavior. Leads and leasing traffic remains strong. Collections are solid. Migration trends are positive and the challenges of single-family home availability and affordability continue to support our strong renewal performance.\nOur focus on customer service is paying off as reflected in our sector-leading Google scores, contributing to our growing retention rates. Supported by our asset management group, the teams are focused on harvesting the benefits of several leasing and reporting tools introduced over the past few years to maximize our operational effectiveness. We continue to invest in key areas that will support future earnings growth, including various new technology initiatives that enhance efficiencies and support our centralization and specialization efforts. We are ramping up the rollout of property-wide Wi-Fi across our portfolio and investments in our interior renovation and repositioning programs are increasing.\nOn the external growth front, our pipeline of lease-ups and active development spend at a combined cost of $1.5 billion. Our operating performance at these properties should benefit from a supply environment that is trending below historical levels. We continue to believe investing in new developments with strong future earnings growth, especially considering the declining new starts and additional headwinds from decreased equity capital available for new projects. We anticipate starting between 3 to 4 new developments this year with a suburban development in the Charleston, South Carolina market, on track to start construction during the second quarter.\nBased on our expected starts and completions for the year, our development pipeline should remain in the $1 billion to $1.2 billion range, a very comfortable level given our scale and balance sheet strength. We are focused on buying properties where we can utilize our various platform capabilities to generate attractive long-term returns for capital. But with the transaction market pretty slow, we'll likely in the back half of the year before we see more compelling opportunities to begin to materialize.\nAs part of our ongoing recycling efforts to improve the earnings quality of our portfolio, during the first quarter of '25, we exited Columbia, South Carolina. With the sale of 2 properties with an average age of 32 years, they went under contract in 2024. We expect continued recycling efforts to occur later this year.\nWith a 30-year performance record focused on high-growth markets and an average executive team member for tenure of 16 years, we have operated through prior cycles of high supply and uncertainty. I remain optimistic about the approaching recovery cycle in our markets to absorb the new supply. Today, our more diversified and higher quality portfolio on our operating platform and stronger balance sheet position us to compete at an even higher level. Our high-growth markets continue to see stronger job growth, household formation and investor demand.\nThrough our internal and external investments, we have meaningful future value growth on the horizon as new supply deliveries declined and leasing conditions strengthen. We remain excited about the outlook over the next few years.\nTo all our associates at the properties in our corporate and regional offices, thank you for your hard work and dedication and preparation for the busy leasing season. Your commitment and dedication to our residents and fellow associates are greatly appreciated.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Tim.\n\nTimothy P. Argo\n\nExecutive VP, Chief Strategy & Analysis Officer, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Following up on Brad's comments, we are encouraged by the first quarter operating trends with winded pricing, occupancy and collections all slightly outperforming our expectations. We entered 2025 with occupancy and exposure in a strong position that helped drive a steady increase in pricing, particularly on our new leases. The acceleration in new lease-over-lease pricing growth was greater than what we have seen on average historically, increasing 180 basis points sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2024. The resulting new lease pricing on a lease-over-lease basis for the first quarter was negative 6.3%. Additionally, renewal rates for the quarter showed strength, growing 4.5% on a lease-over-lease basis, which was a 30 basis point increase sequentially over the fourth quarter. The resulting lease-over-lease pricing on a blended basis was negative 0.5%, which represented a 160 basis point improvement sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2024.\nAverage physical occupancy was 95.6%, up 30 basis points as compared to the same period in 2024. Collection continued to outperform expectations with net delinquency representing just 0.3% of billed rents. These factors combined drove the resulting same-store revenue growth of 0.1% for the quarter.\nMany of the markets that were outperformed in 2024 from a blended lease-over-lease pricing standpoint continues to do well in the first quarter of 2025, including several of our mid-tier markets. Virginia stands out with Richmond, Norfolk, Fredericksburg and our 4 Northern Virginia properties all exceeding the portfolio average. Charleston, Savannah and Greenville also demonstrated strong pricing power.\nOf our larger markets, Tampa continue to show pricing recovery, Houston held steady and encouragingly, we saw significantly improved performance from Atlanta, particularly as compared to market conditions there in the first quarter of 2024. Austin remains the laggard as it continued to face significant supply pressure with Phoenix and Nashville continuing to struggle with nearing supply concerns also.\nTouching on our lease-up portfolio, we had one property, MAA Optimist Park, reached stabilization in the quarter. Our 7 remaining lease-up properties are competing well against the record new supply being delivered in our markets, and ended the quarter with a combined occupancy of 71.6%. We pushed the expected stabilization date back in 1 quarter for MAA Bogie Creek in Orlando and expect list 7 lease-up properties to stabilize in 2025. Rents for the group continue to exceed our expectations and should result in significant value creation for this portfolio.\nWe continue to execute on our various redevelopment and repositioning initiatives in the first quarter, and we expect to accelerate these programs over the course of 2025 and into 2026. For the first quarter of 2025, we completed 1,102 interior unit upgrades, achieving rent increases of $90 above non-upgraded units and a cash-on-cash return of just under 18%. Despite this more competitive supply environment, these units were making, on average, 9 days less and non-renovated units went into the additional term time.\nWe expect to renovate even more units in Q2 and Q3 with a goal to renovate approximately 6,000 units in '25 with an even larger increase expected in 2026. For our repositioning program, we have effectively completed the repricing phase on all the legacy 2023, 2024 projects with NOI yields approaching 10%. We have an additional 6 projects finishing up construction that will begin the repricing phase between now and July and what we believe will be a strengthening leasing environment.\nWe are also now live on the 4 property-wide WiFi retrofit projects we began in 2024 and are currently in the planning or construction phase for an additional 23 projects that we targeted for 2025. As we closed out April, we continue to see encouraging trends that are aligned with our guidance. New lease and blended pricing in April improved as compared to both March and the full first quarter with average daily occupancy for the month of 95.5%. Our 60-day exposure for April was 8.4%, 20 basis points lower than this time last year. It keeps us in a position for stable occupancy to allow for pricing power assuming the strong demand we've seen today remain fact.\nOn the demand side portion in our markets in the first quarter was at a record level and represented the third straight quarter units absorbed exceeded units delivered, putting our markets in a good position to achieve a robust recovery as supply continues to decline. Additionally, the percentage of our residents accessing renewal offers exceed last year's record level with lease-over-lease growth rates on renewals accepted for May and June, outpacing our strong year-to-date renewal growth rates. The slower turnover is another mitigating factor against supply pressure with fewer units coming to market. Improving new lease rates should further help support continued strong renewal performance throughout the spring and summer leasing season.\nThat's all the way I have in prepared comments. Now I'll turn the call over to Clay.\n\nA. Clay Holder\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We reported core FFO for the quarter of $2.20 per diluted share, which was $0.04 per share above the midpoint of our first quarter guidance. About $0.025 of the favorability was due to same-store NOI performance with an additional $0.025 due to favorable timing of overhead interest expenses partially offset by $0.01 of non-same-store NOI performance.\nIn addition to our same-store revenue performance slightly exceeding our expectations, real estate tax expense was favorable in the quarter due to the timing of tax litigation settlements that were initially projected to be completed in the second quarter. Personnel costs, repair and maintenance expenses and marketing costs were all generally in line with our expectations. During the quarter, we funded approximately $67 million of development costs of the current $852 million pipeline, leaving an expected $305 million to be funded on our current pipeline over the next 2 to 3 years. We also invested approximately $17 million of capital in the first quarter through our redevelopment, repositioning and wide fire retrofit initiatives that Tim spoke about earlier.\nOur balance sheet remains strong with $1 billion of combined cash and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility and our low net debt-to-EBITDA at 4x, our balance sheet is well positioned to take advantage of opportunities should they emerge. At quarter end, our outstanding debt was approximately 94% fixed with an average maturity of 7 years at an effective rate of 3.8%.\nFinally, with much of the leasing season still ahead of us, coupled with the uncertain macroeconomic environment, we are maintaining our core FFO and same-store guidance for the year. As outlined in our release, we expect core FFO for the second quarter 2025 to be in the range of $2.05 to $2.21 per diluted share or $2.13 per share at the midpoint. This midpoint includes the timing impact of the real estate activation settlement previously discussed, along with the typical seasonality of leasing and maintenance-related operating expenses.\nThat is all that we have in the way of prepared comments. we will now turn the call back to you for questions."

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, February 6, 2025. The I will now turn the call over to Andrew Schaeffer, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets of MMA for opening comments.\n\nAndrew Schaeffer\n\nSenior VP, Treasurer & Director of Capital Markets, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ian, and good morning, everyone. This is Andrew Schaeffer, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets for MAA. Members of the management team participating on the call this morning are Eric Bolton, Brad Hill, Tim Argo, Clay Holder; and Rob DelPriore.\nBefore we begin with prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of this discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data.\nOur earnings release and supplement are currently available on the For Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. A copy of our prepared comments and an audio recording of this call will also be available on our website later today. After some brief prepared comments, the management team will be available to answer questions.\nI will now turn the call over to Eric.\n\nH. Eric Bolton\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThanks, Andrew, and good morning. As reported in our earnings release, MAA finished calendar year 2024 in line with our expectations and is in a great position for the recovery cycle for apartment leasing that should be increasingly evident over the course of this year. While we are still working through the impact of record high levels of new supply delivered over the past year, we are encouraged with some of the early recovery trends that we are capturing with lease-over-lease pricing performance. While it would take some time for the recovery momentum to build, it seems clear tide is starting to turn, and we look forward to a productive spring and summer leasing season when the improving trends will have a more obvious compounding impact on overall portfolio results late this year and into 2026.\nBefore turning the call over to Brad, I did want to take just a few minutes this morning and tell you why I'm excited and confident about the prospects for MAA's earnings outlook over the emerging recovery cycle. It starts with my confidence that our leadership team. As we disclosed in December, effective April 1, we plan to execute on the next step in our CEO succession planning program. And Brad, will assume the role of President and CEO. I'll remain active in supporting Brad and our Board as Executive Chairman. Brad and his executive leadership team have an average tenure of 6 years with our company. I know this leadership team well, and I have a lot of confidence in them.\nBrad and his team have a deep understanding of our strategy and our approach to executing on that strategy, which has delivered sector-leading long-term results for shareholder capital. Beyond my confidence in our leadership team, while our markets have more recently been challenged with a 50-year high record of new supply deliveries, there is increasing evidence that the worst of the pressure from this new supply is poised to materially moderate especially as we get into the summer leasing season. As we have discussed, we historically have seen the actual delivery and leasing pressure from competing new development at roughly 2 years after the start of construction.\nBased on our analysis, the volume of new construction started in calendar year 2023 or 2 years ago, dropped 39% and from the peak of starts during the extraordinary low interest rate environment in calendar year 2022 and then start to sequentially drop another 50% in calendar year 2024. So this is expected to result in a significant decline in actual unit deliveries starting this year and into 2026 and 2027. Given where we are currently with interest rates and construction loss, we continue to see challenges in the market's ability to meaningfully restart and increase in new projects.\nTaken together, we believe these conditions will manifest in a sharp drop in new supply delivery starting this year and continuing for several years. In addition to the supply dynamic and the impact of leasing conditions, we believe that our portfolio is uniquely well positioned to capture the benefits from job growth, population growth and high single-family housing costs. This continues to drive a resulting growth in the demand for apartment housing across our markets that will outpace national trends over the long haul. This strong positioning for the demand side of the equation coupled with the material drop in new supply this year and beyond, we believe will have a significant impact on market rent growth across the portfolio for the next few years.\nFurthermore, I'm excited about the various new tech initiatives we have underway, aimed at driving enhanced services for our residents and more efficiencies within our operating platform. Several new initiatives that we have more recently implemented coupled with new projects that will launch over the coming year, we expect will further increase our margin and accelerate earnings over the next few years. And finally, our external growth pipeline is stronger and larger than any time in our company history. We have several new projects slated to deliver over the emerging recovery cycle with other new sites already lined up. And importantly, the balance sheet is strong and well positioned to continue to support this growth.\nSo in summary, the experience and proven capabilities of our leadership team, our orientation towards the strongest growth in housing demand markets in the country, the strength of our operating platform with growing efficiencies and the more robust external growth pipeline we have in place that is supported by a sector leading a strong balance sheet, all combined to drive much enthusiasm and confidence in my outlook for MAA over the next few years. As this will serve as my last earnings call prior to the transition of the CEO role, I'd like to extend my appreciation and thanks to our shareholders and to the analyst community for your trust and our company and our team.\nIt's truly been an honor to serve the public capital markets over the past 30 years here at MAA. Our culture at MAA is crowded and a strong belief that our stewardship of assets and shareholder capital is an all time focused on creating value for the benefit of our residents our shareholders, our associates and the communities where we operate. I'm proud of our associates at MAA. I appreciate their hard work and support and hope forward to M&A delivering even higher value in the future for those that we serve. Turning it over to Brad now.\n\nAdrian Bradley Hill\n\nExecutive VP & CIO, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. As expected, during the fourth quarter, our focus on occupancy, combined with higher new supply and the typical seasonal slowdown in leasing traffic weighed on new resident lease pricing during the quarter, but the seasonal decline in lease-over-lease rates was less than we've seen in previous years. Encouragingly, this pressure has continued to moderate in January with blended pricing improving more from the fourth quarter's performance than in previous years, predominantly due to improvement in our new lease pricing. I share Eric's optimism for our growth prospects and momentum toward delivering strong long-term earnings.\nAs Tim will discuss in more detail, we are seeing encouraging signs that indicate leasing conditions are poised to support improvement in blended lease rates and have a compounding impact on revenue performance throughout the year, continued strong absorption. Occupancy and exposure improved seasonal performance and an expected more meaningful reduction in supply pressure all contribute to a favorable outlook for our existing portfolio. Additionally, we are continuing to invest in several key areas that will significantly impact future earnings, including various technology initiatives that will support our centralization efforts and enhanced efficiencies.\nIn 2025, we will begin to more aggressively roll out property-wide WiFi across our portfolio, and we will ramp up the rollout over the next couple of years as a number of our properties transition off of our legacy bulk WiFi program. We also plan to increase our investments in the interior renovation and repositioning programs, both of which benefit from the higher priced new supply that has delivered into the market recently. On the external growth front, we're committed to maintaining an active development pipeline of around $1 billion. In 2024, we invested in a record 5 projects expected to deliver average NOI yields at stabilization of 6.3%. And ending the year with 7 projects under construction, representing over 2,300 units at a cost of approximately $850 million.\nWe expect to start construction on another 3 to 4 projects in 2025. As the transaction market begins to open later this year, we'll continue to opportunistically deploy capital into acquisitions that are in their initial lease up. During the fourth quarter, we closed on a 386 unit property early in its initial lease up in [indiscernible] market. This property was 44% occupied at the end of the fourth quarter and is expected to stabilize in early 2026. This brings our total acquisitions in 2024 to 3 properties, which were on average, 65% occupied at closing and projected to deliver NOI yields of 5.9% upon reaching stabilization in 2025 and 2026. During the fourth quarter, we sold 2 properties with an average age of 29 years, 216-unit property in Charlotte, North Carolina and the 272-unit property in Richmond, Virginia, delivering a combined investment period IRR of approximately 19%.\nWe have two additional properties in Columbia, South Carolina under contract and expect those to close in the first quarter of 2025. We will continue our focus on strengthening our overall earnings quality by recycling capital out of some of our older, higher CapEx properties and redeploying that capital into newer acquisitions with a higher earnings growth profile, particularly on an after-CapEx basis. We expect to execute on the balance of our $325 million disposition plan late in the year. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had 8 communities in lease-up, 4 acquisitions and 4 developments with an end of the year occupancy of 69.7%. We expect the acquisitions to average NOI yield at stabilization of 59% and the developments to average NOI yields of around 6.4%.\nDue to the high level of competition in many of our markets and our intent to hold firm on our rent pricing expectations, we pushed the expected stabilization dates back slightly on a few of our lease-up properties by 1 quarter. However, rents continue to exceed our pro forma expectations and the stabilized NOI yields on our new developments and lease-up are significantly above our original expectations. Our existing portfolio is well positioned to benefit from the improving demand and supply trends with our various growth initiatives, providing additional earnings over the recovery cycle to all of our associates at the properties in our corporate and regional offices. Thank you for your commitment, hard work and dedication that you show every day to our prospects, residents and fellow associates.\nBefore turning the call over to Tim, I do want to take a moment to say a few words and recognition of Eric ahead of his transition to the Executive Chairman role. Over his 30 years of service to MAA with 23 years as our Chief Executive Officer; Eric has been instrumental in so many ways to this company. His dedication to serving our various stakeholders is second to none. We are grateful for his vision and wisdom, his courage and his discipline in leading this company to unmatched performance. His mentorship and counsel over the years to so many in the industry and especially to MA's executive leadership team and to me, exemplify the tremendous leader that he is.\nEric, for all you've given to our company and to the industry, we thank you. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tim.\n\nTimothy P. Argo\n\nExecutive VP, Chief Strategy & Analysis Officer, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. As noted by Brad, in the fourth quarter, we prioritized achieving portfolio occupancy that positions us well for the improving demand dynamic in 2025. We particularly focus on the higher exposure markets, which came at the expense of slightly weaker new lease pricing performance, but achieve the occupancy goals for which we were striving. The moderation of new lease pricing showed less seasonal deceleration than we saw in 2023, the less than we typically see from the third and fourth quarter.\nAs a result of this strategy, new lease pricing on a lease-over-lease basis for the fourth quarter was down 8% and a 260 basis point decline from the third quarter but favorably comparable to a 470 basis point decline over the same period in 2023. Renewal rates for the quarter stayed strong. growing 4.2% on a lease-over-lease basis, which was a 10 basis point increase sequentially over the third quarter. The resulting lease over lease pricing on a blended basis was down 2% and which represented a 140 basis point improvement in sequential moderation as compared to the same period in 2023. Average physical occupancy was 95.6%, up 10 basis points from the third quarter and collections continued to outperform expectations with net delinquency representing just 0.3% of billed rents.\nAll these factors drove the resulting same-store revenue down 0.2% for the quarter and up 0.5% for the full year 2024. As was true for most of 2024, several of our mid-tier markets continue to hold up better than the broader portfolio in the fourth quarter from a blended lease and release pricing standpoint. Richmond Norfolk, Charleston, Greenville and our Fredericksburg and other Northern Virginia properties all stood out. Tampa and Orlando are two larger markets that started to show some relative pricing recovery. Also, as was true for most of 2024, Austin, Atlanta and Jacksonville markets that continue to be more negatively impacted by the absolute level of supply being delivered into those markets with Austin continuing to be the toughest challenge of all the markets.\nWe continued our various redevelopment and repositioning initiatives in the fourth quarter. And as Brad mentioned earlier, we expect to accelerate these programs over the course of 2025 and into 2026. For the fourth quarter of 2024, we completed 1,130 interior unit upgrades, bringing our year-to-date total to 5,665 units, achieving rent increases of $106 above non-upgraded units. Despite this more competitive supply environment, these units lease about 10 days quicker on average, but a nonrenovated unit when adjusted for the additional turn time. We expect to renovate closer to 6,000 units in 2025 with an even larger increase expected in 2026.\nFor our repositioning program, we have two active projects that are most of the way through the repricing phase with NOI yields approaching 10%. We have an additional 6 projects underway with the plan to complete construction between April and June and begin repricing in what we believe will be a strengthening lease environment. We are also now live on the 4 property-wide WiFi retrofit projects we begin in 2024 and expect to begin an additional 23 projects in 2025. With January wrapped up, we are seeing encouraging trends that are aligned with our outlook for 2025. New lease and blended pricing in January improved as compared to both December and the full fourth quarter with stable occupancy of 95.6%.\nOur 60-day exposure at the end of January was 7%, 70 basis points lower than this time last year and should sort of keep occupancy stable through the remainder of the quarter that allow for more pricing power as seasonal demand starts to increase. The 95.6% January average daily physical occupancy was 25 basis points higher than January of 2024. As Brad noted, absorption remains strong in our markets, with the fourth quarter representing the second consecutive quarter that units absorbed exceeded units delevered. The excess absorption as compared to new supply in the fourth quarter was the largest gap since the third quarter of 2021. With new lease pricing improving, though remaining a challenge, we are also encouraged by the lease over lease rates achieved on excess of renewals through April with average increases in the 4.25% range.\nImproving new lease rates should help support continued strong renewal performance into the busier spring and summer leasing season. New supply deliveries continue to be a headwind in many of our markets, but the trends support expected improvement throughout 2025, and laying the groundwork for an even stronger 2026. Following on Eric's comments, with construction starts peaking in mid- to late 2022 in most of our markets, we believe we have passed the maximum pricing pressure period that tends to come 2 years or so after the peak of construction.\nThe slowly moderating supply pressure, increasing spring and summer lease traffic and our current occupancy exposure, portfolio position and have us excited about recovery to come. That's all the lab and prepared comments.\nWe'll now turn the call over to Clay.\n\nA. Clay Holder\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We reported core FFO for the quarter of $2.23 per share, which was in line with our fourth quarter guidance and contributed a core FFO for the full year of $8.88 per share in line with our original guidance for the year. Our same-store revenue results for the quarter were relatively in line with expectations. As Tim mentioned, same-store revenues benefited from strong occupancy and collections during the quarter. Our same-store expense performance was slightly unfavorable compared to our guidance due to personnel costs and other property expenses. Favorable interest expense and nonoperating income offset the increase in same-store expenses.\nDuring the quarter, we funded approximately $64 million of development costs of the current $852 million pipeline, leaving an expected $374 million to be funded on our current pipeline over the next 2 to 3 years. We also invested approximately $18 million of capital through our redevelopment and repositioning programs during the quarter, which we expect to continue to enhance the quality of our portfolio and produce solid returns upon completion. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. We ended the quarter with over $1 billion in combined cash and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, providing significant opportunity to fund future investments.\nOur leverage remains low with net debt-to-EBITDA at 4x. And at quarter end, our outstanding debt was approximately 95% fixed with an average maturity of 7.3 years at an effective rate of 3.8%. During December, we issued $350 million of 10-year public bonds at an effective rate of just over 5% using proceeds to pay down our outstanding commercial paper. These proceeds provide an accretive use of capital given the expected stabilized NOI yields approaching 6% or greater on our recent acquisitions and current developments that Brad previously mentioned.\nFinally, we provided initial earnings guidance for 2025 with our release, which is detailed in the supplemental information package. Core FFO for 2025 is projected to be at $8.61 to $8.93 and or $8.77 at the midpoint. As has been outlined in the prior comments, we expect the momentum in rental pricing to grow over the course of the year and to drive improving year-over-year performance in core FFO over the back half of the year. The proposed 2025 same-store revenue growth midpoint of 0.4% and results from a rental pricing earn-in of negative 0.4% combined with the blended rental pricing expectation of 1.7% for the year.\nWe expect blended rental pricing to be comprised of new lease pricing that will continue to be impacted by elevated supply levels and renewal pricing in line with historical levels. We expect the impact of these elevated supply levels to improve over the course of the year. For the same-store portfolio, we expect effective written growth for the year to be approximately 0.2% at the midpoint of our range. occupancy to average between 95.3% and 95.9% for the year or 95.6% at the midpoint and other revenue items, primarily reimbursement and fee income to grow at 2.5%. Same-store operating expenses are projected to grow at a midpoint of 3.2% for the year. Personnel and repair and maintenance costs are expected to grow just over 3%, while I expect some continued pressure from marketing costs and insurance expense.\nThese expense projections, combined with a revenue growth of 0.4%, results in a projected decline in same-store NOI of 1.5% at the midpoint. We currently have noncommunity actively leasing and an additional community that stabilized in late 2024. Given the interest carry and leasing velocity of these recently acquired and completed developments, we anticipate our lease-up pipeline being slightly dilutive to core FFO in the first half of the year before turning accretive later in the year as more projects stabilize, contributing about $0.03 to core FFO for the year net of the interest carry.\nWe expect continued external growth in 2025, both through acquisitions and developments. We anticipate a range of $350 million to $450 million in acquisitions, all likely to be in lease-up and not yet stabilized and a range of $250 million to $350 million in development investments for the year. This growth will be partially funded by asset sales, which we expect dispositions of approximately $325 million, with the remainder to be funded by debt financing and internal cash flow. This external growth is expected to be slightly dilutive to core FFO in 2025 and then turn accretive to core FFO after stabilization.\nWe project total overhead expenses, a combination of property management expenses and G&A expenses to be $134.5 million at the midpoint, a 4.5% increase over 2024 results. We also expect to refinance $400 million of bonds maturing in November 2025. These bonds had an effective rate of 4.2%, and we are forecasting to refinance that 5%. This anticipated refinancing, coupled with our 2024 refinancing activities, will result in $0.03 of dilution to core FFO as compared to prior year. Combined with financing to support our expected growth for 2025, we project interest expense to increase by approximately 13% for the year. That is all that we have in the way of prepared comments.\nSo Ian, we will now turn the call back to you for any questions."

Eric Bolton\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThanks, Andrew, and good day. Core FFO results for the second quarter were ahead of expectations as the strong demand for apartment housing across our markets is steadily absorbing the new supply being delivered. This strong demand continues to support steady occupancy performance from our portfolio as well as blended lease-over-lease pricing that has consistently increased since Q4 of last year.\nThese positive trends are continuing into Q1. MAA's strategy has long focused on positioning our portfolio to capture higher full cycle demand to drive superior long-term value growth. To best mitigate the occasional periods of supply pressure, we have a unique portfolio of diversification strategy involving both large and mid-tier markets.\nFurther by appealing to a broad segment of the rental market with a more affordable price point as evidenced by our strong rent income ratios and sector-leading low delinquency performance, we believe we are able to drive higher demand and absorption across our portfolio.\nWe continue to believe that new supply deliveries across our markets are currently peaking and we expect to see the volume of new deliveries decline over the back half of this year with 2025 ushering in a multiyear period where the growing demand for apartment housing will exceed the level of new competing supply.\nAs detailed in yesterday's earnings release, we continue to find compelling opportunities to deploy capital in new acquisitions and development that will, we believe, deliver meaningful earnings accretion over the next few years. Our balance sheet remains strong and well positioned to deliver on this future value pipeline that we are building.\nWe believe that with the combination of the evolving market conditions, poised to decline with the level of new supply delivering across our markets, the redevelopment and repositioning opportunities available to harvest within our existing portfolio and the new growth pipeline that we are building through in-house development, our prepurchase program with third-party developers and the acquisition of newly constructed properties, MAA is positioned for meaningful growth and value over the next few years.\nBefore turning the call over to Brad, Taylor, Clay for more details, I'd like to send my thanks and appreciation to our MAA associates for their dedication and tremendous service to our residents. MAA is capturing record levels of rather the retention, high resident satisfaction ratings and strong lease renewal performance, thanks in large part to your hard work. I'll now turn the call over to Brad.\n\nAdrian Bradley Hill\n\nExecutive VP & CIO, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. We continue to see solid demand in our markets, supported by strong household formation and positive wage and job growth, leading to continued blended pricing momentum in July with stable occupancy.\nMAA's long-term strategy positions our portfolio as an attractive lower cost alternative to the higher-priced new multifamily supply being delivered as well as the available single-family housing options within our markets. Our renewal accept rates are at a record high and our Google scores continue to lead the sector, evidence of the value our residents find and living with MAA.\nWith the back door controlled, we're very focused on the front door and encouraged by the improving traffic trends. Our property tours are higher than this time last year and our conversion of leads into leases is also up. With increased traffic, strong conversion, stable occupancy and lower exposure, our properties are well positioned as we enter the back half of the year.\nAs indicated in our release, we have made progress using our balance sheet capacity to support future earnings growth. In addition to the 2 second quarter construction starts that bring our under-construction pipeline at the end of the second quarter to 2,617 units at a cost of $866 million.\nIn July, we provided financing to take out the equity partner on a 239 unit under construction development in the South Park area of Charlotte. The project suffered an early delay that put the project investment horizon outside of the equities funds horizon. Our previous relationship with the developer and the equity partner provided us the unique opportunity to invest in an under-construction project no entitlement risk and a materially shortened construction schedule with first units scheduled to deliver in the second quarter of '25.\nThe second quarter development starts -- the 2 second quarter development starts were expected to deliver first units in mid-2026, and all 3 projects are expected to deliver average initial stabilized NOI yields around 6.4%, similar to what we are achieving on our current developments that are leasing.\nWhile new lease rates are facing slightly more pressure at the moment, rents achieved that our developments are well above our original expectations, driving higher than originally projected NOIs that should deliver stabilized NOI yields that exceed our original expectations by approximately 70 basis points.\nPredevelopment work continues on a number of projects in our pipeline, which has increased to 11 projects, representing additional growth of over 3,100 units. We maintain optionality on when we start these projects, but we expect to start construction on 1 to 2 more projects later this year, bringing our development starts for the year to 4 to 5 at or slightly above our original guidance for the year and leading to a slight increase in our development spend for the year at $350 million.\nConstruction costs have yet to decline broadly. But we are hopeful that as the current under construction pipeline winds down, we could see more improvement in construction costs and schedules as we progress through the year, supporting our ability to start construction on additional opportunities at compelling yields.\nTransaction. Our transaction market volume remains low with cap rates generally in the low 5% range, with a number of transactions occurring well below 5%. Our team continues to find select but compelling acquisition opportunities generally in lease-up and on an aftermarket -- on an off-market basis.\nIn the second quarter, we closed on a 306-unit suburban property in Raleigh for approximately $81 million, which is 15% to 20% below replacement costs. This newly constructed property is currently in its initial lease-up and finished the quarter at 62% occupied. We have 2 additional acquisition opportunities in due diligence and upon successfully concluding our inspections we expect the closings to occur over the next few months.\nThe 3 acquisitions are expected to deliver stabilized NOI yields on average just under 6%. Based on the activity our team is seeing in the market, we believe our forecasted acquisition volume of $400 million is achievable. We have 2 dispositions in the market, 1 in Charlotte and 1 in Richmond that we hope to execute on by the end of the year, but we are early in the process.\nBefore I turn the call over to Tim, to all of our associates at the properties in our corporate and regional offices, I want to say thank you for your hard work and dedication that you show on a daily basis to our prospects, residents and fellow associates. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tim.\n\nTimothy P. Argo\n\nExecutive VP, Chief Strategy & Analysis Officer, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. As previously referenced, demand in our markets continue to be strong as evidenced by steadily improving lease over lease rates on new move-in residents and stable lease of release rates on renewal residents. Pricing growth does continue to be impacted by elevated new supply deliveries, but showed improvement over the first quarter as traffic patterns increased.\nThese factors contributed to new lease pricing on a lease-over-lease basis of minus 5.1%, with renewal rates for the quarter staying strong, growing 4.6% on a lease-over-lease basis. These 2 components resulted in lease have released pricing on a blended basis, that was an improvement of 70 basis points from the first quarter. Average physical occupancy was 95.5%, up 20 basis points from the first quarter and collections continue to outperform expectations with net delinquency representing just 0.3% of billed rents.\nAll these factors drove the resulting same-store revenue growth of 0.7%. Our unique market diversification strategy that Eric mentioned continues to benefit overall portfolio results. While some of our larger markets are being more heavily impacted by new supply deliveries, many of our mid-tier metros remain steady.\nSimilar to last quarter, Savannah, Richmond, Charleston and Greenville are all outperforming the broader portfolio from a blended lease on release pricing standpoint. Our portfolio balance between large and mid-tier markets and diversification of submarkets within the market and help strengthen performance through the cycle.\nAustin, Atlanta and Jacksonville are markets that continue to be more negatively impacted by the absolute level of supply being delivered into those markets. While we have slowed some of our various product upgrade and redevelopment initiatives, in this elevated supply environment, we do continue to execute where it makes sense with the expectation of reaccelerating next year.\nFor the second quarter of 2024, we completed nearly 1,700 interior unit upgrades, achieving rent increases more than 8% above non-upgraded units. For our repositioning program, we have 3 active projects that are in the repricing phase. We will begin construction on an additional 6 projects in the third quarter with a plan to complete construction and begin repricing in 2025 in what we believe will be an improving leasing environment.\nWith July now wrapped up, we're encouraged by the early third quarter trends. Average physical occupancy for the month of July of 95.5% is in line with second quarter and current occupancy is 95.8%. This stability in occupancy, combined with the lower 60-day exposure that Brad noted sets us up for more pricing power for the remainder of the summer as we also start to lap weaker new lease pricing that became evident beginning in August of last year.\nAccordingly, July, blended pricing of positive 0.3% is up from the first and second quarters and the month of June. And new lease pricing has improved each month since March. Furthermore, the year-over-year change in asking rents for August is expected to be positive for the first time since February of 2023, 18 months ago.\nAs we have discussed over the last few quarters, new supply being delivered continues to be a headwind in many of our markets, and it is resulting in prospects shopping longer and being more selective. However, we still believe the long-term outlook is similar to what we discussed last quarter. That is, we expect this new supply will continue to pressure pricing for much of 2024, but we believe we have likely already seen the maximum impact to new lease or release pricing growth and that the supply-demand balance continues to improve from here subject to normal seasonality. It varies by market, but on average, new construction starts in our portfolio footprint peaked in mid-2022 and and we have seen historically that the maximum pressure on leasing is typically about 2 years after construction start.\nWhile supply remains elevated, the strength of demand is evident as well. Absorption in the second quarter in our markets was the highest of any quarter since the third quarter of 2021. Wage growth remained strong with our rent to income ratio in the second quarter, dropping a bit to 21%, the lowest level in 3 years.\nAdditionally, we saw resident turnover continued to decline in the second quarter, and we expect it to remain low with fewer residents moving out to buy a home. The 12.4% of move-outs in the second quarter that were due to resident buying a home was the lowest ever for MA, slightly lower than what we saw in the first quarter. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to Clay.\n\nClay Holder\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We reported core FFO for the quarter of $2.22 per share, which was $0.03 per share above the midpoint of our second quarter guidance just under $0.02 of the favorability was related to favorable same-store expenses and $0.015 was driven by a combination of favorable overhead cost, interest expense and nonoperating income partially offset by about $0.01 in storm cost.\nOur same-store revenue results for the quarter were essentially in line with expectations. As Tim mentioned, we saw sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement in both blended pricing and occupancy while same-store revenues again benefited from strong risk collections. Our same-store expense performance, particularly in repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and personnel costs was favorable compared to our expectations for the quarter.\nRepair and maintenance costs continue to show moderation growing at 1.8% compared to second quarter last year. At this point in the year, we have better visibility into our real estate real estate tax expense for 2024, which we will discuss more with our revised guidance in a moment.\nDuring the quarter, we funded nearly $80 million of development cost of the current expected $866 million pipeline leaving an expected $328 million to be funded on this pipeline over the next 2 years. Considering the Charlotte opportunity and the additional development starts that Brad mentioned and adjusting for those properties we will complete over the remainder of 2024, and we expect our development pipeline to grow to just under $1 billion, which our balance sheet is well positioned to support.\nDuring the quarter, we invested approximately $12 million of capital through our redevelopment, repositioning and smart rent installation programs, which we expect to produce solid returns and continue to enhance the quality of our portfolio. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. We ended the quarter with nearly $1 billion in combined cash and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, providing significant opportunity to fund future investments.\nOur leverage remains low with net debt-to-EBITDA at 3.7x. And at quarter end, our outstanding debt was approximately 93% fixed with an average maturity of 7.4 years at an effective rate of 3.8%.\nDuring May, we issued $400 million of 7-year public bonds at an effective rate just below 5.4%, using the proceeds to effectively pay off a $400 million bond maturity in June that had an effective rate of 4%. While our next scheduled bond maturity isn't until the fourth quarter of 2025, we expect to be in the market prior to that date to support ongoing investment opportunities.\nFinally, we are reaffirming the midpoint of our same-store NOI and core FFO guidance for the year while revising other areas of our detailed guidance that we've previously provided. Given our operating results achieved through the second quarter, we are making slight adjustments to our guidance associated with rent growth and occupancy.\nWe are lowering the midpoint of effective rent growth guidance by 35 basis points to 0.5% and and average physical occupancy guidance by 20 basis points to 95.5% for the year. Total same-store revenue guidance for the year was revised to 0.65%, which also reflects stronger expected rent collection performance over the back half of the year.\nWe are lowering our property operating expense growth projections for the year to 4.25% at the midpoint. As previously mentioned, we have better insight into our real estate tax expense for 2024 and have lowered the midpoint of our guidance of 4%. The lower guidance is primarily due to favorable Texas property valuations as compared to our original expectations.\nAlso, we renewed our property and casualty insurance program on July 1 and has achieved a combined premium decrease of around 1%. The changes to our property operating expense projections, combined with our updated same-store revenue expectations, results and reaffirming our original expectation for same-store NOI at negative 1.3%.\nIn addition to updating our same-store operating projections, we were revising our 2024 guidance to reflect favorable trends in G&A and interest expense. As Brad previously mentioned, we also increased the midpoint of our development spend to $350 million.\nThe impact of these adjustments combined with the $0.03 of expected storm costs associated with Hurricane Barrel in the third quarter resulted in us maintaining the midpoint of our full year core FFO guidance at $8.88 per share on narrowing the range of $8.74 to $9.02 per share. That is all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So Julian we will now turn the call back to you for questions."

Afterwards, the company will conduct a question-and-answer session.\n[Operator Instructions]\nThis conference call is being recorded today. I will now turn the call over to Andrew Schaeffer, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets of MAA for opening comments.\n\nAndrew Schaeffer\n\nSenior VP, Treasurer & Director of Capital Markets, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThank you, [ Regina ], and good morning, everyone. This is Andrew Schaeffer, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets for MAA. Members of the management team participating on the call this morning with prepared comments are Eric Bolton, Brad Hill, Tim Argo and Clay Holder. DelPriore and [ Joe Fraki ] are also participating and available for questions as well.\nBefore we begin with prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of this discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results.\nDuring this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial debt.\nOur earnings release and supplement are currently available on the for Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. A copy of our prepared comments and an audio recording of this call will also be available on our website later today. After some brief prepared comments, the management team will be available to answer questions.\nI will now turn the call over to Eric.\n\nH. Eric Bolton\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThanks, Andrew, and performance trends in the first quarter were in line with our expectations, and we enter the summer leasing season well positioned. Pricing trends for new resident move-ins continue to reflect the impact from new supply delivering in several of our markets.\nOur renewal pricing remained strong. Encouragingly, blended lease-over-lease pricing in the first quarter captured 100 basis points improvement as compared to the prior quarter, followed by April pricing that was ahead of the first quarter performance. While the bulk of the leasing year is still in front of us, we do like our early positioning as we head into the summer leasing season.\nWe continue to believe that our high-growth markets are producing solid demand sufficient to absorb the new supply in a steady manner that will enable continued stable occupancy, strong renewal pricing, strong collections and overall revenue results that are aligned with the outlook that we provided in our prior guidance.\nOur leasing traffic remains strong and record low resident turnover, favorable net migration trends and stable employment conditions across our diversified portfolio and markets continue to drive solid demand. While we expect leasing conditions will remain pressured by new supply deliveries through the year, our on-site teams actively supported by our asset management group are doing a terrific job.\nSuperior Resident Services as reflected by our sector-leading Google ratings and record-high resident retention rates, along with several new technology capabilities introduced over the past couple of years are making a meaningful difference in this competitive environment. With new supply deliveries poised to begin tapering later this year, demand trends remaining stable and occupancy remaining strong, we remain optimistic that leasing conditions should recover quickly and begin improving in early 2025.\nWhile the transaction market remains slow, we are seeing more acquisition opportunities for new lease-up projects, which Brad will touch on in his comments, and we remain comfortable with our transaction expectation for the year.\nI continue to be optimistic about our ability to work through the current supply cycle with in our high-growth markets ability to absorb new supply. With a 30-year performance record focused on these high-growth markets, we've operated through prior supply cycles.\nToday, we believe our diversified and higher-quality portfolio, our stronger operating platform our stronger balance sheet have us positioned to compete at an even higher level. We're excited about the outlook over the next few years.\nOur high-growth markets continue to offer attractive long-term appeal for employers, households and real estate investors. We have a meaningful future growth on the horizon as new supply deliveries decline and leasing conditions strengthen. Several new technology initiatives will drive further efficiencies and higher operating margins from our existing portfolio and a pipeline of redevelopment opportunities will also drive higher rent growth from our existing properties.\nAnd finally, our external growth pipeline continues to expand, setting the stage for a meaningful additional NOI growth. I'd like to send my appreciation to our MAA team for a solid start to 2024.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Brad.\n\nAdrian Bradley Hill\n\nExecutive VP & CIO, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. In preparation for what we believe will be a stronger leasing environment in 2025 through at least 2028, we continue to make progress in putting our balance sheet capacity to work to deliver future earnings growth.\nSubsequent to quarter end, we started construction on a 302-unit prepurchase development in Charlotte, North Carolina, and we expect to start construction this quarter on a 345-unit project under our prepurchase development platform in the Phoenix, Arizona MSA.\nBoth projects are expected to deliver first units by mid-2026, and deliver stabilized NOI yields in the mid-6% range. consistent with what we are achieving on our current developments that are leasing.\nWith the addition of these two projects, our active development pipeline represents 2,617 units at a total cost of approximately $866 million. With continued interest rate volatility and tight credit conditions, transaction volume remains low. But we have seen cap rates firm up a bit from fourth quarter with market cap rates on deals we track that closed in the first quarter, averaging approximately 5.1%, 30 basis points lower than the previous quarter.\nDespite the low transaction volume, our team continues to find compelling select acquisition opportunities. We currently have an off-market 306-unit suburban property in [ Raleigh ] under contract to acquire for approximately $81 million that we expect to close this month. This newly constructed property is currently in its initial lease up at 49% occupancy and is expected to stabilize in mid- to late 2025.\nAt this point, we believe our forecasted acquisition volume of $400 million is achievable. Despite the increased pressure from new supply, our 4 developments that are actively leasing 3 of which are under construction and 1 that has completed and is in lease-up continue to deliver good performance.\nWhile new lease rates are facing slightly more pressure at the moment with concessions on select units, up from 4 weeks to 6 weeks, we continue to achieve rents on average approximately 18% above our original expectations, driving higher than originally projected NOI and earnings and creating additional long-term shareholder value.\nFor these 4 projects, we expect to achieve an average stabilized NOI yield of 6.5%, exceeding our original expectations by 70 basis points. We continue to make progress on the predevelopment work for a number of projects. In addition to the two 2nd quarter development starts I mentioned a moment ago, we expect to start construction on one to two more projects later this year.\nWhile we have not seen a broad reduction in construction costs, encouragingly, we have achieved some level of reduction on our recent pricing supporting our ability to start construction on these projects. We have seen better subcontractor bid participation, which we expect to lead to better execution with stronger subs throughout the construction process for our new starts.\nWe are hopeful that the significant drop in construction starts that we've seen in our region will lead to more substantial construction cost declines. As we progress through the year, allowing us to start construction on additional opportunities in our development pipeline, which today consists of 10 well-located sites that we either own or control, representing additional growth of nearly 2,800 units.\nWe maintain optionality on when we start these projects, allowing us to remain patient and disciplined in our execution timing. Any project we start this year will deliver first units in 2026 and 2027 and aligning with what is likely to be a strong leasing environment, supported by significantly lower supply.\nOur development team continues to evaluate land sites as well as additional prepurchase development opportunities. In this liquidity-constrained environment, it's possible we could add additional in-house and prepurchase development opportunities to our current and future pipeline.\nWhile we continue to pursue numerous external growth opportunities, our existing portfolio remains in a good position heading into the busier leasing season. Our broad diversification provides support during times of higher supply with a number of our mid-tier markets currently outperforming.\nAs Tim will outline further, despite the high level of new supply, we continue to see solid demand and absorption, leading to improved current occupancy with future exposure better than this time last year.\nOur collections are strong and near pre-covid levels at 99.6% of billed rents. Our resident base is stable with more residents choosing to live with us longer, supported by our focus on customer service, coupled with high single-family housing costs.\nBefore I turn the call over to Tim to all of our associates at the properties in our corporate and regional offices. I want to say thank you for all you do to improve our business and serve our residents and those around you while exceeding expectations of those that depend on us.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Tim.\n\nTimothy P. Argo\n\nExecutive VP, Chief Strategy & Analysis Officer, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. As Eric mentioned, new lease pricing in the first quarter continued to be impacted by elevated new supply deliveries in several of our markets. This, combined with typically slower traffic patterns that are evident this time of the year attributed to new lease pricing on a lease-over-lease basis of negative 6.2%.\nRenewal rates for the quarter stayed strong, growing 5%. Because traffic tends to be relatively low as compared to the second and third quarters, we intentionally repriced less than 20% of our leases in the first quarter. The new lease to renewal pricing resulted in blended lease-over-lease pricing of negative 0.6% for the quarter, an improvement of 100 basis points from the fourth quarter.\nAverage physical occupancy was 95.3%, and collections outperformed expectations with net delinquency representing less than 0.4% of build rents. All these factors drove the resulting revenue growth of 1.4%. From a market perspective, in the first quarter, larger markets such as the Washington, D.C. metro area and Houston continue to hold up well and Nashville showed improvement.\nMany of our mid-tier metros also continue to be steady with Savannah, Richmond, Charleston and Greenville, all outperforming the broader portfolio from a blended lease-over-lease pricing standpoint.\nOur diversification between larger and mid-tier markets helps balance performance through the cycle. The improving performance of a market like Nashville, which is getting a lot of new supply, demonstrates the benefit of submarket diversification along with the market diversification. Austin and Jacksonville are two markets that continue to be more negatively impacted by the absolute level of supply being delivered into those markets.\nTouching on some other highlights during the quarter. We continued our various product upgrade and redevelopment initiatives. For the first quarter of 2024, we completed nearly 1,100 interior unit upgrades. Given the number of units and lease up across our portfolio currently, we expect to renovate fewer units in 2024 than we would in a typical year, but would expect to reaccelerate the program in 2025.\nWe have now completed over 94,000 smart home upgrades since the inception of the program, and we expect to complete the remaining few properties this year. For our repositioning program, we have 4 active projects that are in the repricing phase, and we have targeted an additional 6 projects to begin later in 2024 with a plan to complete construction and begin repricing in 2025.\nRegarding April metrics, we are encouraged by the accelerating trends from both the first quarter and March in both pricing and occupancy. April blended pricing is negative 0.4%, a 20 basis point improvement from the first quarter and a 70 basis point improvement from March. This is comprised of new lease pricing of negative 6.1%, a 10 basis point improvement from the first quarter and notably a 70 basis point improvement from March. And renewal pricing of 5.1%, slightly ahead of the first quarter and an improvement of 50 basis points from March.\nAverage physical occupancy for April was 95.5%, also up from both the first quarter and March. And as Brad noted, 60-day exposure also remained lower than this time last year at 8.5% versus the prior year of 8.8%. As we've discussed, new supply being delivered continues to be a headwind in many of our markets, but we still believe the outlook is similar to what we discussed last quarter.\nWhile we do expect this new supply will continue to pressure pricing for much of 2024, with demand and leasing traffic expected to increase in the spring and summer, we believe we have likely already seen the maximum impact to new lease pricing and that the outlook is better for late 2024 and into 2025. It varies by market, but on average, new construction starts in our portfolio footprint peaked in early to mid-2022. And we've seen historically that the maximum pressure on leasing is typically about 2 years after construction store.\nWhile supply remains elevated, the strength of demand is evident as well. Absorption in the first quarter in our markets was the highest for any first quarter in the last 2 decades and the highest of any quarter since the third quarter of 2021. Job growth is still expected to moderate some in 2024 as compared to 2023, but has recently been revised upwards and growth still expected to be strongest in the Sunbelt region in the country.\nJob growth combined with continued in-migration accelerate the key demand factor of household formation. Additionally, we saw a resident turnover continued to decline in the first quarter, and we expect it to remain low with fewer residents moving out to buy a home. In fact, the 12.9% of move-outs in the first quarter that were due to a resident buying a home with the lowest ever for MAA.\nThat's all I have in the way of prepared comments. I'll turn the call over to Clay.\n\nClay Holder\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We reported core FFO for the quarter of $2.22 per share, which was $0.02 per share above the midpoint of our first quarter guidance. About half of the favorability was related to the timing of real estate taxes, while the remaining outperformance is related to the collective timing of overhead cost, interest expense and nonoperating income.\nOur same-store operating performance for the quarter was essentially in line with expectations. Same-store revenues were slightly ahead of our expectations for the quarter, driven by strong rent collections. Excluding the favorable timing of real estate tax expenses, Same-store operating expenses were slightly higher than our first quarter guidance, primarily due to onetime property costs.\nDuring the quarter, we funded approximately $44 million of development cost of the current expected $647 million pipeline, leaving nearly $202 million to be funded on this pipeline over the next 2 years. Although we expect to complete three projects in the second half of 2024 with the additional starts that Brad mentioned earlier, we expect to continue to grow our development pipeline over the remainder of the year, which our balance sheet is well positioned to support.\nDuring the quarter, we invested a total of $9.4 million of capital through our redevelopment, repositioning and smart rent installation programs, which we expect to produce solid returns and continue to enhance the quality of our portfolio.\nOur balance sheet remains in great shape. We ended the quarter with nearly $1.1 billion in combined cash and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, providing significant opportunity to fund future investments.\nOur leverage remains low with net debt-to-EBITDA at 3.6x. And at quarter end, our outstanding debt was approximately 95% fixed with an average maturity of 7.2 years at an effective rate of 3.6%. During January, we issued $350 million of 10-year public bonds at an effective rate of 5.1%, using the proceeds to pay down our outstanding commercial paper.\nWe have an upcoming $400 million maturity in June that has an effective rate of 4%. Following this maturity, the next scheduled bond maturity is in the fourth quarter of 2025. Finally, with the bulk of leasing season ahead of us, we are reaffirming the midpoint of our core FFO guidance for the year while slightly tightening the full year range to $8.70 to $9.06 per share. We are also maintaining our same store as well as other key guidance ranges for the year.\nThat is all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So [ Regina ], we will now turn the call back to you for questions."

Eric Bolton\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThanks, Andrew, and good morning. Core FFO results for the fourth quarter were ahead of our expectations. Higher non-same-store NOI performance and lower interest expense drove the outperformance. As expected, during the fourth quarter, a combination of higher new supply and a seasonal slowdown in leasing traffic increasingly weighed on new resident lease pricing during the quarter. Encouragingly, we did see some of this pressure moderate in January with blended pricing improving 130 basis points from the fourth quarter performance led by improvement in new lease pricing, stable employment conditions, continued positive migration trends, a higher propensity of new households to rent apartments and continued low resident turnover are all combining to support steady demand for apartment housing.\nWe continue to believe that late this year, new lease pricing performance will improve, and we will begin to capture recovery in that component of our revenue performance. In addition, with the approach of surrounding higher new supply deliveries likely to moderate later this year, we continue to believe -- the conditions are coming together for overall pricing recovery to begin late this year and into 2025. As you may have seen, last week, MAA crossed a significant milestone marking the 30-year anniversary since our IPO. Over the past 30 years, MAA has delivered an annual compounded investment return to shareholders of 12.6%, with about half of that return comprised of the cash dividends paid. Through numerous new supply cycles and various stresses associated with the broader economy, MAA has never suspended or reduced our quarterly dividend over the past 30 years, which of course, is a key component of delivering superior long-term investment returns to REIT shareholders.\nToday, I'm more positive about our outlook than I was at this time last year. Today, as compared to a year ago, we have more clarity about the outlook for interest rates with downward movement likely later in the year. Worries associated with material economic slowdown or recession are dissipating, inflation pressures on operating expenses are declining. The demand for apartment housing and absorption remains steady and with clearly declining permits and new construction starts, we have increasing visibility that competing new supply is poised to moderate with a 30-year track record of focus on high-growth markets, successfully working through several economic cycles, an experienced team and proven operating platform, a strong balance sheet and long-term shareholder performance among the top tier of all REITs, we're confident about our ability to execute on the growing opportunities in the coming year and beyond.\nBefore turning the call over to Brad, I do want to take them on and just say a big thank you to Al Campbell, who will be officially retiring effective March 31. Al has been with our team for the past 26 years and has served as our Chief Financial Officer for the past 14 years. Al has been instrumental in the growth of our company, transitioning us to the investment-grade debt capital markets and has built a strong finance, accounting, tax and internal audit platform for MAA. Al leads our company and finance operation in strong hands with Clay and his team, and we're all grateful for Al's service and tremendous accomplishments. So thank you, Al, for all you've done for MAA. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Brad.\n\nAdrian Bradley Hill\n\nExecutive VP & CIO, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone.\nAs mentioned in our earnings release, we successfully closed on 2 compelling acquisitions during the fourth quarter at pricing 15% below current replacement costs. Both properties fit the profile of the type of properties we expect to continue to emerge throughout 2024. Properties in their initial lease-up with sellers focused on certainty of execution with the need to transact prior to a definitive deadline. Our relationships with the sellers and our ability to move quickly and execute on the transactions utilizing the available on our line of credit without a financing contingency were key components of MAA being chosen as the buyer for these properties. In May, Central Avenue, a 323 unit mid-rise property in the Midtown area of Phoenix, an MAA Optimus Park, a 352 unit mid-rise property in the Optimus Park area of Charlotte are expected to deliver initial stabilized NOI yields of 5.5% and 5.9%, respectively.\nWe expect both properties to achieve further yield and margin expansion as a result of adopting MAA's more sophisticated revenue management, marketing and lead generation practices as well as our technology platform. Additionally, we expect to achieve operational synergies by combining certain functions with other area MAA properties as part of our new Property Pod initiative.\nDue to continued interest rate volatility and tight credit conditions, transaction volume remains tepid, down 50% year-over-year and 16% from the third quarter's pace. We continue to believe that transaction volumes will pick up later in 2024, providing visibility into cap rates and market values. For deals we tracked in the fourth quarter, we saw cap rates move up by roughly 35 basis points from the third quarter. Our transaction team is very active in evaluating additional acquisition opportunities across our footprint with our balance sheet in great position to be able to take advantage of more compelling opportunities as they continue to materialize later this year.\nOur forecast for the year includes $400 million of new acquisitions likely in lease-up and therefore, dilutive until stabilization is reached. Despite pressure from elevated new supply, our 2 stabilized new developments as well as our development projects currently leasing continue to deliver good performance, producing higher NOIs and earnings than forecasted in our original pro formas, creating additional long-term value.\nNew lease rates are facing more pressure at the moment, but these properties have captured asking rents on average approximately 20% above our original expectations. Our forward developments that are currently leasing are estimated to produce an average stabilized NOI yield of 6.5%. We continue to advance predevelopment work on several projects, but due to permitting and approval delays as well as an expectation that construction costs are likely to come down. We have pushed the 3 projects that we plan to start in 2023 into 2024.\nWe now expect to start between 3 to 4 projects this year with 2 starts in the first half of the year and 2 starts late in the year. Encouragingly, we have seen some recent success in getting our construction costs down on new projects that we're currently repricing. As we have seen a meaningful decline in construction starts in our region, we're hopeful to see continued decline in construction costs as we progress through the year. Our team has done a tremendous job building out our future development pipeline. And today, we own or control 13 well-located sites, representing a growth opportunity of nearly 3,700 units. We have optionality on when we start these projects, allowing us to remain patient and disciplined. Any project we start this year, we'll deliver first units in 2026, aligning with the likely stronger leasing environment supported by significantly lower supply.\nOur development team continues to evaluate land sites as well as additional prepurchase development opportunities. In this constrained liquidity environment, it's possible we could add additional development opportunities to our future pipeline. The team has our portfolio in good position. Our broad diversification provides support during times of higher supply with a number of our mid-tier markets outperforming.\nAs we ramp up activities in 2024, we're excited about the coming year. Beyond the new external growth opportunities just covered, and as Tim will outline further, we continue to see solid demand and steady absorption of the new supply delivering across our markets and remain convinced that pricing trends will begin to improve late this year and into 2025. In addition, we continue to make progress on several new initiatives aimed at further enhancing our leasing platform to further position us to outperform local market leasing metrics during the supply cycle.\nBefore I turn the call over to Tim to all of our associates at the properties and our corporate and regional offices. I want to say thank you for coming to work every day. focused on improving our business, serving our residents and exceeding the expectations of those that depend on us.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Tim.\n\nTimothy P. Argo\n\nExecutive VP, Chief Strategy & Analysis Officer, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone.\nSame-store NOI growth for the quarter was right in line with our expectations with slightly lower operating expenses offsetting slightly lower blended lease over lease pricing growth. Expanding on Eric's earlier comment on new lease pricing, developers looking to gain occupancy ahead of the holiday season and the end of the year did put further pressure on new lease pricing, particularly in November and December. However, because traffic tends to decline in the fourth quarter, again, particularly in November and December, we intentionally repriced only 16% of our leases in the fourth quarter and only about 9% in November and December. This resulted in blended lease-over-lease pricing of minus 1.6% for the quarter, comprised of new lease rates declining 7% and renewal rates increasing 4.8%.\nAverage physical occupancy was 95.5% and collections remained strong, with delinquency representing less than 0.5% of bill grants. These key components drove the resulting revenue growth of 2.1%. From a market perspective, in the fourth quarter, many of our mid-tier metros performed well. Being invested in a broad number of markets, submarkets, asset types and price points is a key part of our strategy to capture growth throughout the cycle. Savannah, Richmond, Charleston and Greenville are examples of markets that led the portfolio and lease-over-lease pricing performance. The Washington, D.C. metro area, Houston and to a lesser extent, Dallas/Fort Worth for larger metros that held up well. Austin and Jacksonville are 2 markets that continue to be more negatively impacted by the level of supply being delivered into those markets.\nTouching on some other highlights during the quarter. We continued our various product upgrade and redevelopment initiatives in the fourth quarter. For the quarter, we completed nearly 1,400 interior unit upgrades, bringing our full year total to just under 6,900 units. We completed over 21,000 smart home upgrades in 2023 and now have over 93,000 units with this technology and we expect to complete the remaining few properties in 2024.\nFor our repositioning program, we have 5 active projects that are in the repricing phase with expected yields in the 8% range. We have targeted an additional 6 projects began in 2024 with a plan to complete construction and begin repricing in 2025.\nNow looking forward to 2024, we're encouraged by the relative pricing trends we are seeing thus far. As noted by Eric, blended pricing in January, it was 130 basis points better than the fourth quarter. This is comprised of new lease pricing of negative 6.2%, an 80 basis point improvement for the fourth quarter and notably a 150 basis point improvement from December and renewal pricing of 5.1%, an improvement of 30 basis points from the fourth quarter, while maintaining stable occupancy of 95.4%.\nSimilarly, renewal increases achieved thus far in February and March average around 5%. As noted, new supply being delivered continues to be a headwind in many of our markets. While we do expect this new supply will continue to pressure pricing for much of 2024, we believe we have likely already seen the maximum impact to new lease pricing and that the outlook is better for late 2024 and into 2025. It varies by market, but on average, new construction starts in our portfolio footprint peaked in the second quarter of 2022. Based on typical delivery time lines, this suggests peak deliveries likely in the middle of this year with some positive impact of pricing power soon thereafter. While increasing supply is impactful, strength of demand is more indicative of the pricing power in a particular market. Job growth is expected to moderate some in 2024 as compared to 2023, but growth is still expected to be strongest in the Sunbelt markets.\nJob growth combined with continued in-migration accelerates the key demand factor of household formation. Separately, the cost gap between owning and renting gapped out considerably in the back half of 2023 even before considering the impact of higher mortgage rates.\nMove out to buy a home dropped 20% in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis, and we expect a continued low number of move-outs due to home buying to contribute to low turnover overall in 2024. That's all I have in the way from better comments.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Clay.\n\nClay Holder\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone.\nReported core FFO for the quarter of $2.32 per share was $0.03 per share above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance and contributed core FFO for the full year of $9.17 per share, representing an approximate 8% increase over the prior year. The outperformance for the quarter was primarily driven by favorable interest and the performance of our recent acquisitions and lease-up during the quarter. Overall, same-store operating performance for the quarter was essentially in line with expectations. Same-store revenues were slightly below our expectations for the quarter as effective rent growth was impacted by lower new lease pricing that Tim mentioned. Same-store operating expenses were slightly favorable to our fourth quarter guidance primarily from lower-than-expected personnel costs and property taxes. During the quarter, we invested a total of $20.7 million of capital through our redevelopment, repositioning and smart brand installation programs, producing solid returns and adding to the quality of our portfolio.\nWe also funded $48 million of development costs during the quarter toward the completion of the current $647 million pipeline leaving nearly $256 million remaining to be funded on this pipeline over the next 2 years. As Brad mentioned, we also expect to start to 3 to 4 projects over the course of 2024, which would keep our development pipeline at a level consistent with where we ended 2023, in which our balance sheet remains well positioned to support.\nWe ended the year with nearly $792 million in combined cash and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, providing significant opportunity to fund potential investment opportunities. Our leverage remains low with debt to EBITDA at 3.6x. And at year-end, our outstanding debt was approximately 90% fixed with an average of 6.8 years at an effective rate of 3.6%. Shortly after year-end, we issued $350 million of 10-year public bonds at an effective rate of 5.1%, using the proceeds to pay down our outstanding commercial paper. Finally, we did provide initial earnings guidance for 2024 with our release, which is detailed in the supplemental information package. Core FFO for the year is projected to be $8.68 to $9.08 or $8.88 at the midpoint.\nThe projected 2024 same-store revenue growth midpoint of 0.9% results from rental pricing earn-in of 0.5% combined with blended rental pricing expectation of 1% for the year. We expect blended rental pricing as to be comprised of lower new lease processing impacted by elevated supply levels and renewal pricing in line with historical levels. Effective rent growth for the year is projected to be approximately 0.9% at the midpoint of our range.\nWe expect occupancy to average between 95.4% and 96% for the year and other revenue items, primarily reimbursement and fee income to grow in line with effective rent. Same-store operating expenses are projected to grow at a midpoint of 4.85% for the year with real estate taxes and insurance producing most of the growth pressure.\nCombined, these 2 items are expected to grow almost 6% for 2024 with the remaining controllable operating items expected to grow just over 4%. These expense projections, combined with the revenue growth of 0.9% results in a projected decline in same-store NOI of 1.3% at the midpoint. We have a recently completed development community in lease-up, along with an additional 3 development communities actively leasing. As these 4 communities are not fully leased up and stabilized and given the interest carry associated with these projects, we anticipate our development pipeline being diluted to core FFO by about $0.05 in 2024 and turning accretive to core FFO on later stabilization.\nWe are expecting continued external growth in 2024 both through acquisitions and development opportunities. We anticipate a range of $350 million to $450 million in acquisitions, all likely to be in lease-up and not yet stabilized and a range of $250 million to $350 million in development investments for the year. This growth will be partially funded by asset sales, which we expect dispositions of approximately $100 million, with the remainder to be funded by debt financing and internal cash flow. This external growth is expected to be slightly dilutive to core FFO in 2024 and then again, turning to accretive to core FFO after stabilizing.\nWe project total overhead expenses, a combination of property management expenses and G&A expenses to be $132.5 million at the midpoint, a 4.9% increase over 2023 results. We expect to refinance $400 million of bonds maturing in June 2024. These bonds currently have a rate of 4% and we forecast to refinance north of 5%. This expected refinance, coupled with the recently completed refinancing activities mentioned previously, results of $0.04 of dilution to core FFO as compared to prior year. That is all that we have in the later prepared comments. So Carey, we will now turn the call back to you for questions."

Eric Bolton\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThanks, Andrew, and good morning. MAA's third quarter FFO performance was ahead of our expectations as the demand side of our business continues to capture good leasing traffic, low resident turnover, positive migration trends and strong collections performance. During the quarter, we did see a higher impact from new supply deliveries across several of our larger markets with the resulting impact showing up in pricing associated with new move-in residents while we continue to believe that MAA's unique market diversification, a more affordable rent structure and an experienced and capable operating platform will enable us to push back against some of the supply pressure. The high volume of new deliveries in several markets will continue to weigh on rent growth associated with new resident move-ins for the next few quarters. .\nEncouragingly, there is now clear evidence emerging that new supply deliveries are poised to meaningfully drop late next year into 2025. We have certainly worked through these supply cycles before and continue to believe that MAA's more extensive market and submarket diversification, new AI and technology tools and an experienced operating team has us in a position to outperform our markets. As we have discussed previously, one of the benefits that typically emerges from a heavy supply cycle particularly one that is characterized by higher interest rates is an increasing volume of acquisition and external growth opportunities. We have seen a shift take place with seller and developer pricing expectations. The more challenging lease-up conditions, coupled with higher interest rates that are likely to be with us for a while, are generating more buying opportunities.\nAs Brad will recap in his comments, the property acquisition we completed after quarter end is a good example of where we expect more opportunities to emerge specifically, a recently completed new development that is still in initial lease-up with seller requirements to close within a short time frame. Before turning the call over to the team to provide details surrounding our performance and market conditions, let me summarize what I believe are the 4 key takeaways in our report.\nFirst, demand across our markets remain solid and supportive of steady absorption of the new supply. Secondly, current high levels of new supply, coupled with developer pressures related to the higher interest rate environment will cause the leasing environment to remain competitive for the next few quarters with new supply pressures expected to then decline. We expect to see an increasing number of compelling external growth opportunities in 2024. And fourth, MAA's long track record of performance and experience in working with markets with higher demand and supply dynamics now further supported by a stronger technology platform. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Brad.\n\nAdrian Bradley Hill\n\nExecutive VP & CIO, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. As anticipated, we saw an increase in for-sale marketing activity emerge early in the third quarter. And while closed transactions are limited in number, we continue to see some upward pressure on cap rates on projects we track with cap rates up by roughly 15 basis points from 2Q. As indicated in our earnings release, we recently closed -- the Phoenix market that we began pursuing early in 3Q. MAA Central Avenue is a 323 unit mid-rise property that fits the profile of the type of opportunities we expected to emerge. The property is in its initial lease-up and the seller was under some pressure to close on the sale by a specific date. So counterparty risk considerations were paramount to the seller. Our familiarity with the market, speed of execution and balance sheet strength that supports an ability to close all cash with no financing contingencies were all aspects of our offer that were very important to the sellers. Our pricing of approximately $317,000 per unit is substantially below current replacement costs and is expected to provide an initial stabilized NOI yield of 5.5%. With the property nearing stabilization, we expect over the following year or so to capture further margin and yield expansion opportunities as a result of adopting MAA's more sophisticated revenue management practices and technology platform, coupled with our future ability to achieve operational synergies with another MAA property that is only half a mile away. .\nOur transaction team is very active in evaluating other acquisition opportunities across our footprint. And Al and Clay have our balance sheet in great position to be able to take advantage of additional compelling opportunities as they continue to materialize later this year and into 2024. Despite pressure from elevated supply, our new properties in their initial lease-up continued to deliver strong performance, producing higher NOIs and earnings than forecasted, creating additional long-term value for the company. These properties on average have captured in-place rents 15% above our original expectations. For the 5 properties that are either leasing or will start leasing by the end of the year, this rent outperformance, which is partially offset by higher expenses, including taxes and insurance is estimated to produce an average stabilized NOI yield of 6.7%, significantly higher than our original expectations.\nLeasing has progressed well at MA Windmill Hill in Austin, and we expect this community to stabilize this quarter. We continue to advance predevelopment work on several projects, but due to some permitting and approval delays 3 projects that we plan to start this year will likely instead start in early 2024. In a number of markets -- in a number of our markets, construction costs have been slower to adjust than we expected, but we continue to see signs that a broader reduction in cost is likely to come. Numerous consultants that we work with, including architects and engineers, have indicated their volume of work has significantly decreased in the last few months, providing further evidence of a decline in new construction activity.\nAdditionally, general contractors are indicating they have more capacity to start new projects and in many cases, with a larger pool of subcontractors available. In addition to the 3 projects mentioned that we expect to start over the next 6 months, we have 5 more projects representing approximately 1,320 units that could be ready for construction start by the end of 2024. Our team has done a tremendous job building out our future development pipeline. And today, we own or control 13 well-located sites, representing a growth opportunity of nearly 3,700 units. We have optionality on when we start these projects, allowing us to maintain our patience and discipline when making capital deployment decisions. Any project we start in 2024 will deliver units into a stronger leasing environment with lower competitive supply in late 2025 and 2026.\nOur development team continues to evaluate land sites as well as additional prepurchase development opportunities. In this more constrained liquidity environment, we are hopeful that we may find additional development opportunities to add to our future pipeline. In addition to continuously monitoring the construction market and evaluating costs at our projects in predevelopment, our construction management team is focused on completing and delivering our remaining 5 under construction projects. During the third quarter, the team successfully wrapped up construction on novel West Midtown in Atlanta completing the delivery of all 340 units. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Tim.\n\nTimothy P. Argo\n\nExecutive VP, Chief Strategy & Analysis Officer, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brad, and good morning. Same-store revenue growth for the quarter was essentially in line with our expectations with sequentially higher occupancy offsetting sequentially declining new lease pricing. Increasing supply pressure did impact pricing in some of our markets, resulting in a blended lease over lease pricing of 1.6% comprised of new lease rates declining 2.2% and renewal rates increasing 5%. Average physical occupancy was 95.7%, resulting in revenue growth of 4.1%. The various metrics we measure related to demand remained strong. Employment markets remained stable with continued job growth across our Sunbelt markets. Net positive migration trends to our markets continue with move into our footprint well ahead of move-outs outside of our footprint and remain consistent with what we have seen in the last several quarters. .\nResident turnover was down once again in the third quarter, a 4% decrease from prior year. Collections remained strong and consistent with prior quarters. Our new resident rent-to-income ratio remained low and in line with prior quarters and our lead volume is consistent with what we would expect and in line with pre-pandemic levels. But as mentioned, we did feel the impact of new supply in the third quarter, which manifested itself in lower new lease pricing, particularly beginning in August and September. This pressure was driven by higher concession uses by developers in many of our markets with the resulting reduction in net pricing in a number of our direct market comps. This peer pricing movement obviously does impact market pricing, it impacts our asking rents. We believe the lingering higher interest rate environment with the 10-year treasury moving up quickly in the third quarter is driving merchant developers to get more aggressive on pricing and is creating some pockets of pricing pressure.\nHistorically, with typical seasonality, pricing tends to moderate some in Q3 as compared to Q2 and then moderating quite a bit more from Q3 to Q4, typically in the 200 basis point range. While we did see a greater degree of moderation in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter, with the solid demand factors mentioned previously, we expect less moderation than normal from Q3 to Q4. We October to date, Blend and lease-over-lease pricing is 0, which is within 10 basis points of what was achieved in September and a lower rate of decline than the more typical 60 basis points. Average physical occupancy for October month to date remains strong at 95.6%, with exposure, which is a combination of current vacancy and units on notice to vacate up 6.9% and in line with October of last year.\nIn addition to the demand factors mentioned, increased absorption through the third quarter in the Sunbelt markets provides further evidence of continued solid demand to help mitigate the impact of the continuing new deliveries. The amount of new supply that was absorbed in the third quarter in our markets was the highest it has been since the beginning of 2022. Despite the new supply pressure in some markets, our unique portfolio strategy to maintain a broad diversity of markets, submarkets, asset types and price points is serving us well with many of our mid-tier markets leading the portfolio and pricing performance both in the third quarter and into October. Savannah, Charleston, Richmond, Greenville and Raleigh are examples of markets outperforming larger metros with more new supply pressures such as Austin and Phoenix. We expect this market diversification, combined with the continued strong demand fundamentals noted earlier, will help continue to mitigate some of the impact of new supply as compared to a less diversified portfolio.\nRegarding redevelopment, we continued our various product upgrade initiatives in the third quarter. For the third quarter of 2023, we completed nearly 2,300 interior unit upgrades and are nearing completion on the Smart Home initiative with over 92,000 units now with this technology. For our repositioning program, we have 5 active projects that have either begun repricing or will begin repricing in the fourth quarter with expected yields in the 8% range. Additionally, we are evaluating an additional group of properties to potentially begin construction later in 2023 or early in 2024 with the target to complete by early 2025. That's all I had in the way of prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to Clay.\n\nClay Holder\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning. Reported core FFO for the quarter of $2.29 per share was $0.03 per share above the midpoint of our guidance. The outperformance was primarily driven by favorable interest and overhead costs during the quarter. Overall, same-store operating performance for the quarter was in line with our expectations. Same-store revenues were slightly ahead of expectations as average occupancy was better than forecasted. The increase in occupancy was offset by the moderation of effective rent growth on new move-in leases as Tim mentioned. As expected, we began to see some moderation in same-store operating expense growth during the third quarter. However, this moderation was less than what we had forecasted. Personnel costs came in higher than expected, primarily due to higher contract labor costs and higher leasing commission, which helped drive the improvements in occupancy. The personnel costs were partially offset by real estate taxes that were favorable to our forecast for the quarter. We received more information related to the Texas state legislation that was passed in the quarter that reduced property tax rates in the state. Our projection for real estate taxes for the full year remains unchanged. During the quarter, we invested a total of $19.7 million of capital through our redevelopment, repositioning and smart rent installation programs. Those investments continue to produce strong returns and add to the quality of our portfolio. We also funded just over $47 million of development costs during the quarter toward the completion of the current $643 million pipeline, leaving $296 million remaining to be funded on this pipeline over the next 2 years. .\nAs Brad mentioned, we also expect to start several new projects over the next 12 to 18 months, which our balance sheet remains well positioned to support. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in combined cash and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, providing significant opportunity to fund potential investment opportunities. Our leverage remains historically low, with the debt-to-EBITDA ratio at 3.4x and at quarter end, our debt was 100% fixed for an average of just over 7 years at a low average interest rate of 3.4%. In October, we refinanced $350 million of maturing debt utilizing cash on our balance sheet and our commercial paper program. Our current plan is to continue to be patient and allow interest rates and financing markets to stabilize before refinancing. That's all I have for my prepared comments, and I'll turn it over to Al to discuss Q4 guidance.\n\nAlbert M. Campbell\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Clay, and good morning, everyone. Given the third quarter performance outlined by Clay as well as expectations for the remainder of the year, we have updated and narrowed our guidance ranges for the year, which is detailed in the supplement to our release. Overall, the third quarter core FFO favorability primarily related to overhead and interest costs is expected to be essentially offset by higher-than-projected same-store operating expenses for the remainder of the year, which I'll discuss a bit more in just a moment. Thus, we're maintaining the midpoint of our core FFO projection for the full year of $9.14 per share, which reflects a 7.5% growth over the prior year. The midpoint of our total revenue growth projection for the year remains unchanged as the expected impact of pricing moderation, which is reflected in effective rent growth is largely offset by the increase in projected average occupancy for the year. However, we have increased our guidance for same-store operating expense growth for the full year by 45 basis points to 6.5% at the midpoint, primarily reflecting the continued pressure in labor costs, partially related to building higher occupancy. Both personnel and repair and maintenance costs are expected to moderate more as we move into 2024. While we maintained our full year guidance range for real estate taxes, we are impacted by some timing-related pressure during the fourth quarter as some of the initial favorability related to the Texas rate reduction is essentially offset by delays in litigation related to high valuations, which is being pushed into next year. We do expect real estate taxes overall to continue moderating over the next couple of years as we work through the changing cap rate environment.\nWe also reduced our total overhead cost projection for the year by $2 million to $126.5 million at the midpoint, and we removed our disposition expectations for the current year to reflect the current market conditions. So that's all that we have in the way of prepared comments. Brittany will now turn the call back to you for questions."

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, July 27, 2023.\nI will now turn the call over to Andrew Schaeffer, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets of MAA for opening comments.\n\nAndrew Schaeffer\n\nSenior VP, Treasurer & Director of Capital Markets, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. This is Andrew Schaeffer, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets for MAA. Members of the management team also participating on the call with me this morning are Eric Bolton, Tim Argo, Al Campbell, Rob DelPriore, Joe Fracchia, and Brad Hill. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of this discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our '34 Act filings with the SEC which describe risk factors that may impact future results.\nDuring this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. Our earnings release and supplement are currently available on the for Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. A copy of our prepared comments and an audio recording of this call will also be available on our website later today. After some brief prepared comments, the management team will be available to answer questions.\nI will now turn the call over to Eric.\n\nH. Eric Bolton\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Leasing conditions across the MAA portfolio continued to reflect our steady employment markets, strong positive migration trends and continued low resident turnover. As a result, we are seeing good demand for apartment housing and are absorbing the new supply deliveries while supporting solid rent growth. In line with normal seasonal patterns, new lease pricing improved in the second quarter and the spread between new lease pricing and renewal pricing narrowed. Rents for new move-in residents jumped 100 basis points higher on a sequential basis as compared to the preceding first quarter. Renewal lease pricing in the second quarter remained strong, growing by 6.8%, driving overall blended pricing performance in Q2 to 3.8%, which is ahead of the original projections we had for the year.\nOccupancy remains steady with average physical occupancy in the second quarter at 95.5%, which is consistent with the preceding first quarter this despite a higher number of lease expirations during the second quarter. While we are working through a higher level of new supply deliveries across our markets for the next few quarters, with the demand trends holding up as they are, we expect to continue to drive top line results that will exceed our long-term historical averages as has been the case in prior cycles of higher supply, we see the demand supply dynamic holding up slightly better in our mid-tier markets and this component of our strategy continues to bring support to overall portfolio performance during this part of the cycle.\nAs described in our first quarter report, we do expect to see moderation in year-over-year growth in operating expenses as inflation pressures ease a bit and some of the efficiencies we expect to capture from new tech initiatives increasingly make an impact. As Al will cover in his comments, we do now also expect to see some relief on property taxes coming out of [ Texas, ] which further supports our ability to reduce our outlook for expense growth over the back half of the year.\nThe transaction market remains quiet. We continue to underwrite a few deals, but the limited number of properties coming to market, combined with strong investor interest continues to support low cap rates and strong pricing. We continue to expect that more compelling opportunities will emerge later this year and into 2024 and believe it's important to remain patient with our balance sheet capacity. Our new lease-up, new development and redevelopment pipelines will all continue to make solid progress and will provide attractive incremental additional earnings over the next few years. I did want to take a moment and express my deep appreciation to our on-site property teams for all their hard work and great service to our residents during these busy summer months.\nAnd with that, I'll now turn the call over to Brad.\n\nAdrian Bradley Hill\n\nExecutive VP & CIO, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. As we've seen each quarter over the past year or so, second quarter transaction activity remains muted versus normal levels. Volatility and uncertainty in the debt market continued to cause the majority of sellers to postpone their sales processes, leading to a drop of more sale inventory on the market. For high-quality, well-located properties in our region of the country, there continues to be strong investor demand, causing cap rates to adjust slower than interest rate movements alone would indicate.\nHaving said that, we have seen an average buyer cap rates move up to 4.9% in the second quarter from 4.7% in the first quarter, with most cap rates ranging between 4.75% and 5.25%. We continue to believe we're likely to see more compelling acquisition opportunities later this year and into next. So we remain patient as we wait for the market to continue to adjust. We are actively reviewing a number of acquisition opportunities, but with no potential acquisitions under contract at the moment. We've lowered our acquisition forecast for the year to $200 million at the midpoint. Our acquisition team remains active in the market and now and the team have our balance sheet in great shape and ready to quickly support any transaction opportunity should it materialize.\nDue to the lower funds needed for expected acquisitions, we've also lowered our disposition forecast for the year to $100 million at the midpoint. Our properties in their initial lease up continue to outperform our original expectations, producing higher NOIs and higher earnings and creating additional long-term value for the company. These properties are navigating the increased supply pressure well and on average, have captured in-place rents 22% above our original expectations. For the 4 properties that are either leasing or we'll start leasing in the third quarter, this retinol performance, which is partially offset by higher taxes and insurance is estimated to produce an average stabilized NOI yield of 7.2%, which is significantly higher than our original expectations for these properties. Early leasing is going well at Novel Daybreak in Salt Lake City and Novel West Midtown in Atlanta, and we expect to start leasing at Novel [indiscernible] in Phoenix in the third quarter.\nDuring the second quarter, we also reached stabilization at MAA [ LoSo ] in Charlotte. Despite permitting and approval processes that are taking a bit longer than we anticipated, predevelopment work continues to progress on a number of projects. we expect 3 projects will be ready to start construction in the back half of 2023, if we see sufficient adjustments to construction costs and rents to support our NOI yield expectations. These projects include 2 in-house developments, 1 in Orlando and 1 in Denver and 1 prepurchased joint venture development in Charlotte. We've pushed back the start of the Phase 2 to our West Midtown prepurchased development in Atlanta to the 2024 due to the approval process taking longer than anticipated.\nThe team continues to work through the increased prepurchase development opportunities that have been presented to us, and we're hopeful we will be able to add additional currently unidentified development opportunities to our pipeline. Any project we start over the next 12 to 18 months would likely deliver in 2026 or 2027, and should be well positioned to capitalize on what we believe is likely to be a much stronger leasing environment, reflecting the significant slowdown in new starts expected over the balance of 2023 and 2024. Our construction management team remains focused on completing and delivering our 6 under-construction projects, and we're doing a tremendous managing these projects and working with our contractors to minimize the impact of inflationary and supply chain pressures as well as labor constraints on our development costs and schedules. During the quarter, the team successfully completed and accepted delivery of the combined 249 units and Novel Daybreak in Salt Lake City and Novel West Midtown in Atlanta. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call over to Tim.\n\nTimothy P. Argo\n\nExecutive VP, Chief Strategy & Analysis Officer, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Same-store revenue growth for the quarter was essentially in line with our expectations with stable occupancy low resident turnover and better blended rent performance than what we previously projected. Despite increasing supply pressure in some of our markets, blended lease-over-lease pricing of 3.8% comprised of new lease growth of 0.5% and renewal growth of 6.8% was better than our forecasted expectations. While occupancy was slightly below our expected range for the quarter, the resulting higher blended lease growth performance is a favorable trade-off providing a greater future compounding growth effect.\nAs discussed last quarter, we expected new lease pricing to show a typical seasonality that is to accelerate from the first quarter and renewal pricing, which lagged new lease pricing for much of 2022 to moderate some, but still provide the catalyst to strong second quarter pricing performance. As Eric mentioned, this played out as expected with new lease pricing accelerating 100 basis points as compared to the first quarter and renewal pricing remaining strong. Alongside the pricing performance, average daily occupancy remained consistent with the first quarter at 95.5%, contributing to overall same-store revenue growth of 8.1%. The various demand factors we monitor remained strong in the second quarter with 60-day exposure, which represents all current vacant units plus those units would notice to vacate over the next 60 days, largely consistent with prior year at 8.5% versus 8.4% in the second quarter of last year.\nFurthermore, Quarterly resident turnover was down almost 2% from the prior year. Move-ins from markets outside of our footprint ticked up slightly from Q1 to 13% and rent to income ticked down slightly from Q1 to 22%. The employment market remains relatively strong also, particularly in the Sunbelt markets. While lead volume trailed the record demand scenarios we saw in 2021 and 2022, it is up from 2018 and 2019. And last years where we experienced a more normal demand curve. Our prospect engagement platform that combines AI, marketing automation and scheduled human engagement has enabled us to engage with prospects more effectively. July to date, pricing remains ahead of our original expectations with blended pricing of 3.2%. This is comprised of new lease pricing of 0.3% and renewal pricing of 5.5%. The new lease pricing is relatively consistent with the 0.5% for the second quarter and within 5 basis points of June new lease pricing.\nAs expected, renewal pricing is moderating to a more normal range as leases are beginning to expire that were signed in the period last year when renewal rents had caught [ up ] to new lease rents. Physical occupancy is currently 95.6% with average daily occupancy for July month to date of 95.3%. The current July occupancy [ and ] July exposure, which is even with the prior year, 7.5%, puts us in a good position for the remainder of the quarter. A key part of our portfolio strategy is to maintain a broad diversity of markets, submarkets, asset types and price points. As we compete with elevated supply deliveries, particularly in some of our larger markets, many of our mid-tier markets are performing well and leading the portfolio and pricing performance, both in the second quarter and into July. Savannah, Charleston, Richmond, Kansas City, Greenville and Raleigh are all outperforming the overall portfolio. We expect that this market diversification, combined with continued strong demand fundamentals will help mitigate the impact of new supply that we expect to be elevated over the next several quarters.\nRegarding redevelopment, we continued our various product upgrade initiatives in the second quarter. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program, our installation of Smart Home technology and our broader amenity-based property repositioning program. For the second quarter of 2023, we completed nearly 1,900 interior unit upgrades and installed nearly 2,300 Smart Home packages. We are nearing completion on the Smart Home initiative and now have over 92,000 units with this technology and we expect to finish out the remainder of the portfolio in 2023. For our repositioning program, leases have been fully or partially repriced at the first 15 properties in the program and the results have exceeded our expectations with yields on cost in the upper teens. We have another 5 projects that will begin repricing in the third quarter and are evaluating an additional group of properties to potentially begin construction later in 2023. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Al.\n\nAlbert M. Campbell\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nOkay. Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Reported core FFO for the quarter, $2.28 per share was $0.02 per share above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance. The outperformance was primarily driven by favorable interest in overhead costs during the quarter, and a large portion of the overhead cost favorability is timing related with the cost now expected to be incurred in the back half of the year. Overall, same-store operating performance for the quarter was essentially in line with expectations. As Tim mentioned, blended lease pricing continues to outperform original expectations for the year and build stronger-than-expected longer-term revenue but was primarily offset in the second quarter by average occupancy slightly below forecast.\nAlso, as expected, we began to see moderation in same-store operating expense growth during the second quarter with the growth of personnel, repair and maintenance and real estate expenses, tax expenses, excuse me, which combined represents 70% of total operating costs, all reflecting moderation from the prior quarter. We expect moderation for these items to continue through the remainder of the year, particularly for real estate taxes, which we'll discuss more with guidance in just a moment. As mentioned in the release, our annual property and casualty insurance programs renewed on July 1, and with combined premium increase of approximately 20%, which is in line with our prior guidance. During the quarter, we invested a total of $26.3 million of capital through our redevelopment, repositioning and smart reinstallation programs producing strong returns and adding to the quality of our portfolio. We also funded just over $51 million of development costs during the quarter toward the completion of the current $735 million pipeline, leaving $344 million remaining to be funded. As Brad mentioned, we also expect to start several new deals over the next 12 to 18 months, likely expanding our development pipeline to be closer to $1 billion, which our balance sheet remains well positioned to support.\nWe ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in combined cash and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, providing significant safety and future opportunity. Our leverage remains historically low, the debt-to-EBITDA at 3.4x, and our debt is currently 100% fixed for an average of 7.5 years at a record low 3.4%. We do have $350 million of debt maturing in the fourth quarter but our current plan is to remain patient and allow interest rates and financing markets to continue stabilizing over the next few quarters before refinancing with long-term debt. And finally, given the second quarter's earnings performance and expectations for the remainder of the year, we are revising our core FFO and several other areas of our guidance previously provided. With the blended pricing outperformance achieved through the second quarter, we are increasing the midpoint of our effective rent growth guidance to [ 7.25%, ] a 25 basis points increase. This is offset by a decrease in our physical occupancy guidance, which is now projected to average 95.5% for the full year, a 30 basis points decrease. Though this trade-off support slightly higher rental earning going forward, our total revenue growth guidance for this year remains unchanged at the midpoint of [ 6.25%. ] In early July, the [ Texas ] state legislature passed the tax overhaul which significantly rolled back property tax rates across the state to effectively redistribute a budget surplus. Given aggressive property valuations, we had previously anticipated rate rollbacks in Texas, where we have now added a specific reduction for this legislation, which [ lowers ] our overall same-store real estate tax growth rate for the year by 50 basis points to 5.5% at the midpoint and that's $0.02 per share to core FFO for the year. There's still limited information regarding exactly how individual counties and municipalities will push this change through but our guidance now includes our early estimate of this overall impact, which is expected to be ongoing.\nIn summary, we are increasing our core FFO projections for the full year to a midpoint of $9.14 per share, which is an increase of $0.03 per share. This increase is primarily comprised of a carry-through of $0.01 per share from the second quarter performance -- outperformance as well as the $0.02 per share addition related to the Texas legislation. As Brad mentioned, we also revised our transaction volume expectations for the current year to reflect current market conditions. So that's all we have in the way of prepared comments.\nSo Aaron, we will now turn the call back to you for any questions."

Eric Bolton\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThanks, Andrew, and good morning. As detailed in our earnings release, first quarter results were ahead of expectations as solid demand for apartment housing continues across our portfolio. Consistent with the trends that we've seen for the past couple of years, solid employment conditions, positive net migration trends and the high cost of single-family ownership are supporting continued demand for apartment housing across our portfolio. And while new supply deliveries are expected to run higher over the next few quarters, we continue to see net positive absorption across our portfolio. We believe that MAA's more affordable price point, coupled with the unique diversification strategy, including both large and secondary markets, further supported by an active redevelopment program, will help mitigate some of the pressure from higher new supply in several of our markets.\nAs outlined in our earnings release, our team is capturing steady progress and strong results from our various redevelopment and unit interior upgrade programs. We are on target to complete over 5,000 additional unit interior upgrades this year in addition to completing installation of new smart home technology for the entire portfolio. We're also making great progress with our more extensive property repositioning projects, with the projects completed to date capturing NOI yields in the high teens on incremental capital investment. These projects, coupled with a number of new technology initiatives, should provide additional performance upside from our existing portfolio. Our new development and lease-up pipeline is performing well, and we remain on track to start 4 new development projects later this year.\nOur various lease-up projects have achieved rents that are close to 11% ahead of pro forma. We did not close on any acquisitions or dispositions during the quarter, but continue to believe that transaction activity will pick up over the summer and have kept our assumptions for the year in place. The portfolio is well positioned for the important summer leasing season. Total occupancy exposure at the end of the quarter, which is a combination of current vacancy plus notices to move out, is consistent with where we stood at the same point last year.\nIn addition, leasing traffic remains solid, with on-site visits in comparison to the number of exposed units that we have is actually running slightly ahead of prior year. A number of new leasing tools that we implemented over the course of last year should continue to support stronger execution, and our teams are well prepared for the upcoming summer leasing season.\nI want to thank our associates for their hard work over the last few months to position us for continued solid performance over the balance of the year. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments, and I'll now turn the call over to Tim.\n\nTimothy P. Argo\n\nExecutive VP, Chief Strategy & Analysis Officer, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Same-store growth for the quarter was ahead of our expectations with stable occupancy, low resident turnover and rent performance slightly ahead of what we expected. Blended lease-over-lease pricing of 3.9% reflects the normal seasonality pattern that we expected. And while we did return to a more typical seasonal pattern in Q1, it is worth noting that the blended lease-over-lease pricing captured was higher than our typical Q1 performance. As discussed last quarter, we expected new lease pricing to show typical seasonality, and that the renewal pricing, which lagged new lease pricing for much of 2022, would provide a catalyst to first quarter pricing performance. This played out as expected, with new lease pricing down slightly at negative 0.5%, and renewal pricing increasing positive 8.6%.\nAlongside the strong pricing performance, average daily occupancy remained steady at 95.5% for the first quarter, contributing to overall same-store revenue growth of 11%. The various demand factors we monitor were strong in the first quarter and continued that way into April. 60-day exposure, which represents all current vacant units plus those units with notices to vacate over the next 60 days, at the end of Q1 was largely consistent with prior year at 7.7% versus 7.9% in the first quarter of last year. Furthermore, in the first quarter, lead volume was higher than last year and quarterly resident turnover was down, driving the 12-month rolling turnover rate down 30 basis points from 2022.\nApril to-date trends remain consistent as exposure remains in line with the prior year, and occupancy has remained steady at 95.5%. Blended lease-over-lease pricing effective in April is 4.1% with new lease pricing beginning to accelerate, up 110 basis points from March at plus 0.2%, and renewal pricing remaining strong at 7.9%. We expect renewal pricing to moderate some against tougher comps as we move into the late spring and summer, but simultaneously expect some seasonal acceleration in new lease-over-lease rates. We expect new supply in several of our markets to remain elevated in 2023, putting some pressure on rent growth. But as mentioned, the various demand indicators remain strong, and we expect our portfolio to continue to benefit from population growth, new household formations and steady job growth.\nIn addition, we expect resident turnover to remain low as single-family affordability challenges support fewer move-outs.\nMAA's unique market diversification of portfolio strategy, coupled with a more affordable price point as compared to the new product being delivered, also helps lessen some of the pressures surrounding higher new supply deliveries.\nDuring the quarter, we continued our various product upgrade initiatives. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program, our installation of smart home technology and our broader amenity-based property repositioning program. For the first quarter of '23, we completed over 1,300 interior unit upgrades and installed over 18,000 smart home packages. We now have about 90,000 units with smart home technology, and we expect to finish out the remainder of the portfolio in 2023.\nFor our repositioning program, leases have been fully or partially repriced at the first 13 properties in the program, and the results have exceeded our expectations with yields on cost in the upper teens. We have another 7 projects that will begin repricing in the second and third quarters and are evaluating an additional group of properties to potentially begin construction later in 2023.\nThose are all of my prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to Brad.\n\nAdrian Bradley Hill\n\nExecutive VP & CIO, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. While operating fundamentals across our platform have remained consistent, as Tim just outlined, transaction volume remains muted due to a lack of for-sale inventory on the market. For high-quality, well-located properties, bidding is strong and available capital is aggressively competing in order to win the bid and put capital to work. This strong relative investor demand, coupled with often favorable in-place financing, continues to support stronger-than-expected cap rates on closed transactions.\nHaving said that, we believe the need to sell increases as the year progresses, and it's likely that more compelling acquisition opportunities will materialize later in the year.\nTherefore, we have maintained our acquisition forecast for the year, but have pushed the timing back a couple of months. Our acquisition team remains active in the market, and Al and his team have our balance sheet in great shape and ready to support our transaction needs. The properties managed by our lease-up team continue to outperform our original expectations, generating higher earnings and creating additional long-term value. To date, our new lease-up properties' performance does not appear to be impacted by increased supply pressures. As Eric mentioned, these properties have achieved rents nearly 11% above our original expectations. During the first quarter, we began pre-leasing at our Novel Daybreak community in Salt Lake City, and early leasing demand is extremely strong, with the property currently 11.5% pre-leased at rents well ahead of our expectations.\nPredevelopment work continues to progress on a number of projects, 4 of which should start construction in the back half of 2023: 2 in-house developments, 1 located in Orlando and 1 in Denver, and 2 prepurchased joint venture developments, 1 located in Charlotte and the other a Phase 2 to our West Midtown development in Atlanta. During the first quarter, we purchased a Phase 2 land site to our Packing District project in Orlando, Florida, bringing our future development projects owned or under construction to 12, representing over 3,300 units.\nOver the past few months, we have seen an increase in inbound prepurchase development opportunities due to a substantial decline in the availability of both debt and equity capital for new developments. We remain disciplined and selective in our review process, but we are hopeful these calls will lead to additional currently unidentified development opportunities. Any project we start over the next 12 to 18 months would likely deliver in 2026 or 2027, and should be well positioned to capitalize on what we believe is likely to be a much stronger leasing environment, reflective of the significant slowdown in new starts that we expect to continue to see over the balance of 2023 and 2024.\nOur construction management team remains focused on completing and delivering our 6 under construction projects and are doing a tremendous job managing these projects and working with our contractors to minimize inflationary and supply chain pressures on our development costs and our schedules. We have 2 projects that we'll be delivering units during the second quarter, Novel Daybreak in Salt Lake City, which delivered 6 units late in the first quarter, and Novel West Midtown in Atlanta.\nThat's all I have in the way of prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn it over to Al.\n\nAlbert M. Campbell\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Reported core FFO per share of $2.28 for the quarter was $0.06 above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance. About half of this favorability was related to the timing of certain expenses, which are now expected to be incurred over the remainder of the year, primarily related to real estate taxes. Operating fundamentals overall were slightly favorable to expectations for the quarter, producing about $0.01 per share of favorability. And the remaining outperformance is related to overhead and net interest costs for the quarter.\nOur balance sheet remains in great shape, providing both protection from market volatility and capacity for strong future growth. We received an upgrade from Moody's during the quarter, bringing our investment-grade rating to the A3 or A- level with all 3 agencies. We expect the favorable ratings to have a growing positive impact on our cost of capital as we work through future debt maturities.\nDuring the quarter, we also closed on the settlement of our forward equity agreement, providing approximately $204 million net proceeds towards funding our development and other capital needs. We funded $38 million of redevelopment, repositioning and smart home installation costs during the quarter, producing solid yields. We also funded just over $65 million of development costs during the quarter toward the projected $300 million for the full year.\nAs Brad mentioned, we expect to start several new deals later this year and early next year, likely expanding our development pipeline to over $1 billion, for which our balance sheet is -- remains well positioned to support.\nWe ended the quarter with record low leverage, our debt to EBITDA of 3.5x, with over $1.4 billion of combined cash and available capacity under our credit facility, with 100% of our debt fixed against rising interest rates for an average of 7.7 years and with minimal near-term debt maturities.\nAnd finally, in order to reflect the first quarter earnings performance, we are increasing our core FFO guidance for the full year to a midpoint of $9.11 per share, which is a $0.03 per share increase. We're also slightly narrowing the full year range to $8.93 and $9.29 per share. Given that the majority of the Q1 same-store outperformance was timing related and the bulk of the leasing season is ahead of us, we are maintaining our same-store guidance ranges as well as all of the key ranges for the year.\nSo that's all we have in the way of prepared comments. Of course, we will now turn the call back over to you for questions.\nCourse, we'll now turn the call back over to you for questions."

Eric Bolton\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. MAA wrapped up calendar year of 2022 with fourth quarter results for core FFO that were ahead of expectations as higher fee income along with continued growth in average rent per unit and strong occupancy more than offset pressure from higher real estate taxes. Looking ahead to the coming year, there's clearly some uncertainty surrounding the outlook for the employment markets, the pace of inflation and the broader economy.\nIn addition, while we do know that new supply deliveries in 2023 broadly will be higher than in 2022. We continue to believe that MAA is well positioned for the coming year as the leasing market returns to more normalized conditions. Our expectations for the coming year are built on a lease-over-lease pricing environment of 3%. This performance assumption, coupled with the earn-in from 2022's rent growth should drive growth in effective rent per unit of around 7% over the coming year. We will, of course, see conditions vary some by market and submarket location, but we believe that our portfolio is in a uniquely solid position to whether expected moderation from the historically high rate growth of last year. This view is really supported by 3 key variables: first, we continue to believe that our Sun Belt footprint maintains an advantageous position for capturing demand, given the stronger and more stable employment markets in the Sun Belt states. We continue to see job growth, positive migration trends, affordable rent-to-income ratios and low resident turnover.\nSecondly, MAA's unique diversification across the Sun Belt region, including both large and high-growth secondary markets, provides exposure to a good range of employment sectors and works to helps often some of the pressures surrounding new supply levels in a number of our larger markets.\nAnd thirdly, with a rent price point average for our portfolio that appeals to our broad segment of the rental market, and it is around 20% below the price point of the mostly high-end new product being delivered, we believe we will capture more stability and top line performance as leasing conditions normalize in 2023.\nIn the event that we do find ourselves later in the year headed towards a more severe contraction in the economy or a recession, as MAA has consistently demonstrated over the past 20 years, we expect to perform with a lower level of volatility than what generally is seen with more concentrated portfolios and/or those costs traded in large coastal markets. The transaction market remains very quiet, and we are likewise remaining patient with what opportunities we do see. I expect it will be the second half of the year before pricing data becomes more readily available. We do have plans to initiate development on 4 new projects in 2023 associated with sites that we already own or that are under our control. These projects will, of course, not actually start delivering units for another couple of years.\nIn conclusion, I want to give a big thank you to our MAA associates for their tremendous service and record performance in 2022. We have the company well positioned for the next cycle, as a number of new tech initiatives will positively impact performance over the coming years. Our external growth pipeline continues to expand and the balance sheet provides a good, strong foundation for supporting our current portfolio operations as well as active pursuit of new growth opportunities.\nThat's all I have in the way of prepared comments, and I'll turn the call over to Tim.\n\nTimothy P. Argo\n\nExecutive VP, Chief Strategy & Analysis Officer, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Same Store performance for the quarter was once again strong and ahead of our expectations. While pricing performance moderated during the fourth quarter from the record growth we had achieved September year-to-date, blended lease-over-lease pricing was up 5.7%. As a result, effective rent growth or the growth on all in-place leases for the fourth quarter was 14.9%, versus the prior year and 2.0% sequentially from the prior quarter.\nFull year 2022 blended lease-over-lease pricing was 13.9%, helping to drive full year effective rent growth of 14.6%. Alongside the strong pricing performance, average daily occupancy remained steady at 95.6% for the fourth quarter and 95.7% for the full year of 2022. In line with normal seasonality, our January new lease rate of negative 0.3% improved from December's new lease rate of negative 0.9%, and other than 2022 represents a higher new lease rate than any year since we have been tracking the data.\nCombined with renewal pricing of 8.6%, January blended lease-over-lease pricing was 4.2% and average daily occupancy was 95.7%. With new lease pricing moderating as expected, renewal pricing, which lagged new lease pricing for much of 2022, is providing a catalyst for the strong January pricing and is expected to be strong for the next few months before moderating to a more typical range. We are achieving growth rates on signed renewals of around 8% to 9% for the first quarter. We do expect new supply in several of our markets remain elevated in 2023, putting some pressure on rent growth, but the various demand indicators remain strong, and we expect our portfolio to continue to benefit from population, household and job growth.\nAs Eric mentioned, should we see a more dramatic downturn in the economy from here, we expect our market's diversification and price point will help mitigate some of the impact to performance. During the quarter, we continued our various product upgrade initiatives. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program, our installation of Smart Home technology and our broader amenity-based property repositioning program. For the full year 2022, we completed more than 6,500 interior unit upgrades and installed over 24,000 Smart Home packages.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the total number of Smart units is over 71,000, and we expect to finish out the remainder of the portfolio in 2023. For our repositioning program, leases have been fully or partially repriced that the first 11 properties in the program and the results have exceeded our expectations with yields on costs averaging approximately 17%. We have another 4 projects that will begin repricing this quarter and 5 additional projects currently under construction.\nThose are all of my prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to Brad.\n\nAdrian Bradley Hill\n\nExecutive VP & CIO, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning. Despite execution challenges in the transaction market, our team successfully completed our disposition plan for 2022 by closing our last 2 dispositions in the fourth quarter. Our total disposition proceeds for the year were approximately $325 million, representing a stabilized NOI yield of 4.3% and an investment IRR of 17.7% for assets with an average age of 25 years old.\nIn 2023, we will continue the discipline of steadily recycling capital out of older, higher CapEx properties, with the intent to redeploy the capital into newer, lower CapEx, higher rent growth properties to drive higher long-term earnings growth within our portfolio. While transaction volume continues to be muted, we believe it's likely that the transaction market will provide more opportunities towards the back half of the year. Currently, the number of marketed properties is down substantially from 2022, with the majority of sellers waiting until at least the spring leasing season before reevaluating their planned sale timing.\nIn the face of this lower volume, we have seen some upward pressure on cap rates, with the degree of the movement varying based on property characteristics, embedded rent growth as well as market and submarket location. However, until closed transactions materially increased transparency around cap rates will be difficult. When marketed deal volume does increase, we expect buyer financial strength and speed of execution to be attractive key differentiators and our balance sheet strength and capacity will support our ability to transact despite a more difficult credit environment.\nOn our new developments, our team has done a tremendous job working through the challenges of elevated construction costs and permitting delays, leading to steady growth in our development pipeline. During 2022, we started construction on 1,253 units at a cost of $468 million, a record level of starts for MAA. During the fourth quarter, we started construction on 2 projects that have been in predevelopment for some time. These 2 projects will begin delivering units in 2 years and should finish construction in 3 years, lining up well with what we believe is likely to be a strong leasing environment.\nWhile the timing of planned construction starts can change as we work through the local approval and construction bidding processes, we expect to start 4 new developments during the back half of 2023. This includes 2 in-house developments, 1 located in Orlando and 1 in Denver; and 2 prepurchased joint venture developments, 1 located in Charlotte and the other a Phase 2 to our West Midtown development in Atlanta.\nOur construction management team continues to do a tremendous job actively managing our projects and working with our contractors to keep the inflationary and supply chain pressures from causing a meaningful increase to our overall development costs over our schedules. Despite these headwinds, the team delivered 3 projects on time in 2022 and under budget by approximately $4.5 million. During the fourth quarter, construction wrapped up on MAA Windmill Hill, and we reached stabilization at MAA Robinson, MAA Westglenn and MAA Park Point with operating results well ahead of our pro forma expectations, delivering stabilized NOI yields on average of 6.6%.\nLeasing demand at our new properties remains high, and the competition from other new supply has, to date, not had a significant impact on our lease-up performance with rents being achieved well ahead of pro formas.\nThat's all I have in the way of prepared comments. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Al.\n\nAlbert M. Campbell\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nOkay. Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Reported core FFO per share of $2.32 for the quarter was $0.05 above the midpoint of our guidance and contributed to core FFO for the full year of $8.50 per share, representing a 21% increase over the prior year.\nSame-store rental pricing and occupancy levels were in line with expectations for the quarter, while higher fee and reimbursement revenues combined with strong lease-up and commercial revenues make to produce about 2/3 of this earnings outperformance for the quarter. This favorability was partially offset by real estate tax expenses, as final millage rates came in higher than expected during the quarter for several markets, primarily in Texas.\nOur real estate tax estimates were based on strong valuations supported by the very strong revenue trends over the last year, offset by expected millage rate rollbacks as counties managed overall tax needs, and rollbacks occurred but were less than expected in Texas, particularly in Dallas and Austin. Our internal guidance for -- our initial guidance, excuse me, for '23, which we'll discuss more in a moment, anticipate some continued pressure in this area given its backward-looking nature.\nOur balance sheet remains very strong, as we ended the year with historically low leverage debt-to-EBITDAre of 3.71x with 95.5% of our debt fixed at an average interest rate of 3.4% and with $1.3 billion in available capacity to support growth and manage our debt maturities late in 2023.\nAlso at the end of January, we settled our outstanding forward equity contracts, providing an additional $204 million of capacity at an attractive cost of capital. We currently expect to fund our near-term acquisition, development and refinancing needs with short-term debt capacity, allowing the financing markets to continue to stabilize before locking in long-term financing. Finally, we did provide initial earnings guidance for 2023 with our release, which is detailed in the supplemental information package.\nCore FFO for the year is projected to be $8.88 to $9.28 per share or $9.08 at the midpoint, which represents a 6.8% increase over the prior year. The foundation for the projected 2023 performance at Same Store revenue growth produced by historically higher rental pricing earn-in of about 5.5% combined with the more normalized blended rental pricing performance of 3% for the year as well as a continued strong occupancy remaining between 95.6% and 96% for the year.\nBased on this, effective rent growth for the year is projected to be a solid 7% at the midpoint of our range, with total Same Store revenues expected to grow 6.25%, slightly diluted from the other revenue items, primarily reimbursement in fee income, which grew at a more modest pace.\nSame Store operating expenses are projected to grow at 6.15% at the midpoint for the year, with real estate taxes and insurance producing the most significant growth pressure. Combined these 2 items alone are expected to grow just over 7% for 2023 with the remaining controllable operating items expected to grow around 5.5%. These expense pressures are offset by the continued strong revenue growth with NOI for the year projected to grow 6.3% at the midpoint.\nWe're also expecting continued external growth, both through the acquisitions and development opportunities during the year with a combined $700 million full year planned investment. This growth will be partially funded by asset sales, providing around $300 million of expected proceeds. We expect to fund the remaining capital needs for the year from internal cash flow and short-term variable rate borrowings, as we anticipate the financing markets to continue stabilizing over the next year, eventually providing better opportunities to lock in long-term debt rates.\nThis does produce some slight pressure on current year FFO performance, given high short-term rates, but is expected to be rewarded with lower long-term financing costs when markets stabilize further. So that's all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So Nikki, we'll now turn the call back to you for any questions."

This is Andrew Schaeffer, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets for MAA. Members of the management team also participating on the call with me this morning are Eric Bolton, Tim Argo, Al Campbell, Rob DelPriore, Joe Fracchia, Tom Grimes and Brad Hill.\nBefore we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of this discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements.

Eric Bolton\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThanks, Andrew, and good morning. MAA posted solid results for the third quarter as strong demand for apartment housing across our portfolio drove a 16% increase in leasing traffic volume as compared to last year's third quarter. Higher leasing traffic supported continued solid occupancy and rent growth as was detailed in our earnings release. While as expected, we are seeing a return to more normal seasonal leasing patterns with slower leasing velocity that is typical during the coming holiday season, it's clear that leasing conditions have held up stronger than expected over the back half of this year, and we are carrying solid momentum into calendar year 2023.\nWe will have more details to share about our expectations for next year when we provide earnings guidance for 2023 as part of our fourth quarter earnings release. But absent a severe recession taking place with the resulting weakness in the employment markets, we expect the demand for apartment housing across our portfolio to continue to be strong. At this point, we've not seen any evidence of weakness in the drivers of demand for apartment housing as it applies to our Sunbelt portfolio. Of the leases written in the third quarter, 15% of our new residents were relocating to the Sunbelt from coastal markets. This is comparable to the trends we saw last year. It's also worth noting that the move-outs we had in the third quarter, only 5% were moving out of the Sunbelt. This is also consistent with last year's trends.\nAs noted earlier, leasing traffic is high and resident turnover or move-outs remain well below long-term trends. And importantly, we are seeing no signs of stress in terms of affordability with rent-to-income ratios on the leases completed in Q3, remaining consistent to Q3 of last year in the 22% range and resident payment practices remaining very strong with over 99% of bills rent being collected.\nAs detailed in the earnings release, we are nearing full completion on several of our new development projects, and we have recently started construction on a new property located in Tampa, Florida. In addition, we expect to start construction during the fourth quarter on a new property located in the Research Triangle Park in Raleigh, North Carolina.\nDuring the third quarter, we also closed on 2 acquisitions where we had initiated negotiations and due diligence earlier in the year. The transaction market has become increasingly choppy as rising interest rates and economic uncertainty have presented more challenges. And as a result, seller activity has slowed. We are actively monitoring conditions, but are not currently under contract at the moment with any additional acquisitions.\nBefore turning the call over to Tim to recap more details associated with our property operations, I did want to acknowledge the retirement that -- the announcement that we made last week concerning the planned retirement of Tom Grimes, who has been with our company for the past 28 years. Tom has been a large part -- played a large part of supporting MAA as long and established record of strong performance and steady growth. I'm grateful for Tom's contributions to our company, and we all wish him well.\nAs outlined in last week's release, we have a strong team of leaders at our company with extensive experience, expertise and a record of strong performance we are well positioned for continued progress as we move forward into 2023.\nThat's all I have in the way of prepared comments, and I will now turn the call over to Tim.\n\nTimothy P. Argo\n\nExecutive VP, Chief Strategy & Analysis Officer, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Same-store performance for the quarter was once again strong and ahead of our expectations. We saw broad-based strength and pricing performance across the portfolio. During the third quarter, with blended lease-over-lease pricing achieved up 13.9%. As a result, effective rent growth or the growth on all in-place leases for the third quarter was 16.7% versus the prior year and 5.6% sequentially from the prior quarter. Based on our forecast for in-place rents at the end of 2022, we expect our earned in or baked in rent growth for 2023 to be in the 6% range before considering any new rent growth that may occur in 2023.\nAlongside the robust pricing performance, average daily occupancy for the quarter remained strong at 95.8%. We have continued to achieve pricing better than our previous expectations in the early part of the fourth quarter with blended lease-over-lease pricing for October to date at a very seasonally strong 8.3%. Average physical occupancy for October to date is in line with expectations at 95.7%. Additionally, on average, we are achieving growth rates on signed renewals of around 10% for the fourth quarter.\nDespite projections that supply will likely remain elevated in 2023, that we think at similar levels to 2022, various demand indicators remain strong and we expect our region of the country to continue to benefit from population, household and job growth.\nDuring the quarter, we continued our various product upgrade initiatives. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program and our installation of smart home technology that includes mobile control of lights, thermostat and door locks as well as leak detection monitoring. In addition, our broader amenity based and more extensive property repositioning program continues to make great progress. The value to residents provided by these programs can be particularly impactful when new supply is being delivered into the market. On average, we are seeing new development being delivered in our markets with monthly rents that are $350 or about 22% higher than the average rent of our current portfolio. This helps drive the value opportunity associated with our repositioning programs.\nFor the third quarter, we completed 2,305 interior unit upgrades and installed 652 smart home packages. In 2022, we plan to complete over 6,000 interior unit upgrades and approximately 23,000 smart home packages. By the end of the year, we expect our total number of smart units to approach 70,000. For our repositioning program, leases have been repriced at the first 8 properties in the program that are now complete, and the results have exceeded our expectations. We have another 8 projects that are currently in various stages of construction and unit repricing.\nThose are all in my prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to Brad.\n\nAdrian Bradley Hill\n\nExecutive VP & CIO, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Despite the challenges in the transaction market, the team continues to make good progress in executing our disposition plan for the year. In addition to the 2 Fort Worth properties we sold in the second quarter, we closed on the sale of a 396 unit community in Maryland earlier this month. We have one more disposition property located in the Austin market that we expect to close in the fourth quarter.\nTotal expected proceeds for all 4 disposition remains at the midpoint of our guidance of $325 million with an NOI yield of 4.3%, generating a total expected IRR for these 25-year-old assets of 17.8%. The slowdown in transaction volume that started in the second quarter continued in the third quarter as dislocation in the capital markets increased over the quarter. Most buyers remain on the sidelines and with only a limited number of properties coming to market, price discovery will take some time. However, as we've seen in previous cycles, when deals begin to come to market, the evaluation of counter-party risks will drive decisions, with buyer financial strength and speed of execution being attractive key differentiators.\nDuring the third quarter, we were able to opportunistically use those strengths to close on 2 compelling newly constructed properties for a total of $213 million, generating an initial stabilized NOI yield of 4.7%, which we expect to increase further through our operating platform capabilities. These investments not only provide a higher immediate NOI yield than what we are selling, but they also give us more scale and higher demand, higher growth markets, where we expect to generate higher organic growth over the long term, especially on an after-CapEx basis. Due to their locations near other MAA communities, both investments also provide additional margin expansion opportunities that we will fully harvest over the next few years.\nWe continue to make progress in building out our development pipeline, while our under-construction pipeline remained at $444 million at the end of the third quarter. Earlier this month, we started construction on a $197 million, 495-unit project in Tampa, bringing our total active under-construction projects today to $641 million, representing 2,254 units.\nPredevelopment work is nearly complete on our Raleigh project, and we expect to start construction this quarter. With the scheduled completion of our Windmill Hill property in Austin, during the fourth quarter, we expect to end 2022 with approximately [2,310] units under construction at a total cost of $723 million.\nAlso during the third quarter, we purchased a land parcel for a potential late 2023 start of a 500-unit development in the Denver, MSA. We now own 7 and control 5 development sites with total entitlements in place for approximately 3,700 units. As we've indicated in previous quarters, the timing of planned construction starts can change as we work through the local approval and the construction bidding processes, but we are hopeful we can start a number of these projects over the next 18 months.\nHaving said that, our balance sheet strength gives us the option to be patient and our construction timing, if it's warrant. Our disciplined approach to asset allocation, including site selection and land valuation will continue to be an integral part of our capital deployment decision process. Our construction management team continues to do a tremendous job actively managing our projects and working with our contractors to keep the inflationary pressure surrounding labor and material costs from causing a meaningful increase to our overall development costs or our schedules to help mitigate some of the potential cost escalation and schedule expansion that is prevalent in the market today, we are working with our contractors to make commitments to purchase materials much earlier in the process.\nToday, our biggest challenges involve securing labor, obtaining cabinets and electrical components and securing building permits. Our team has been able to work around these issues on the majority of our projects to stay on schedule.\nIn line with the performance of our overall portfolio, operating performance at our development communities in their initial lease-up is strong, with results at each community well ahead of our pro forma expectations. Demand remains strong and the competition from other new supply is not impacting our lease-up performance. During the third quarter, our Jefferson Sand Lake Community in Orlando reached stabilization and due predominantly to the strong rent performance, we expect our stabilized NOI yield to be between 7.8% and 8%, exceeding our original expectation by over 25%.\nThat's all I have in the way of prepared comments. So I'll turn it over to Al.\n\nAlbert M. Campbell\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Reported core FFO per share of $2.19 was $0.12 above the midpoint of our guidance for the quarter. About [$0.75] or $0.9 of the outperformance came from revenues, stronger-than-expected rental pricing trends continued into the quarter, producing 14.6% same-store revenue growth, which was over 200 basis points above our expectation.\nRemaining core FFO per share outperformance primarily came from overhead and other nonoperating items during the quarter, which were slightly favorable to expectations.\nSame-store operating expense growth for the third quarter was impacted by continued inflationary pressures as well as a challenging prior year comparison. If you recall, operating expenses grew only 1.5% during the third quarter of last year. Real estate taxes made up the biggest portion of the variance from our expectations for the third quarter this year. We received a significant amount of information during the quarter, particularly in Florida, reflecting some pressure in both values and millers rates as compared to our expectations. We will continue to aggressively challenge values where we can, but we now expect our real estate tax expense to be at the higher end of our previous range.\nRevised guidance for the year discussed more in a moment, reflects these expense pressures, but they continue to be more than offset by the strong revenue performance.\nOur balance sheet remains stronger than ever, providing both protection and opportunity as we move through this volatile market environment. In August, we received an upgrade from S&P to an A- credit rating. We're now rated A- by both S&P and Fitch and continue to have positive discussions with Moody's, which we believe will eventually lead to an upgrade.\nWe also completed the early renewal of our unsecured credit facility at very attractive pricing levels during the quarter, and upside facility from $1 billion to $1.25 billion despite a challenging financing market. In addition, we expanded the size of our commercial paper program from $500 million to $625 million to reflect the increase in our credit facility. These 2 programs provide significant low-cost and flexible capital development program and our future capital needs.\nAt the end of the quarter, we had over $1.2 billion of combined cash and borrowing capacity available. Our leverage remains historically low. Net debt adjusted EBITDA rate of only 3.97x. Our debt balances also have significant protection from rising interest rates, as over 97% of our debt is fixed at an average interest rate of 3.4% and with an average maturity of 8 years.\nFinally, given the third quarter outperformance and expectations for the remainder of the year, we are increasing both our core FFO and same-store guidance for the full year. We increased our full year range for core FFO by $0.20 per share at the midpoint to a range of $8.37 and $8.53 per share or $8.45 at the midpoint, which now represents a 21% growth over the prior year. This increase is primarily a result of higher revenue growth as the strong pricing trends continued into the third quarter with the projected impact of prior year comparisons and seasonal trends coming later than originally projected.\nWe now expect same-store revenue growth for the year to be 13.5% at the midpoint, primarily driven by 125 basis points increase and our effective rent growth expectation for the year over our previous guidance. Our revenue projection for the year continues to be built on strong pricing performance and stable occupancy were growing impact from prior year comps and normal seasonal trends during the fourth quarter. We're now seeing the beginning of this impact, albeit a few months later than originally projected. We expect average blended lease pricing to be in the 7% to 8% range for the fourth quarter, which for context is on top of a record high 16% growth captured in the fourth quarter of last year.\nWe also narrowed the expected range for same-store operating expenses for the full year, effectively increasing the midpoint by 25 basis points from last year's guidance -- from last quarter's guidance, excuse me, primarily reflecting the pressure from real estate taxes that I mentioned earlier. The overall impact of these changes is an increase to our same-store NOI growth guidance for the year by 200 basis points to a midpoint of 17%.\nSo that's all we have in the way of prepared comments, Reza. We'll now turn the call back over to you for questions."

I will now turn the call over to Andrew Schaeffer, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets of MAA for opening comments.\n\nAndrew Schaeffer\n\nSenior VP, Treasurer & Director of Capital Markets, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gretchen, and good morning, everyone. This is Andrew Schaeffer, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets for MAA. Members of the management team also participating on the call with me this morning are Eric Bolton, Tim Argo, Al Campbell, Rob DelPriore, Joe Fracchia, Tom Grimes and Brad Hill.\nBefore we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of this discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34x filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results.\nDuring this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data.\nOur earnings release and supplement are currently available on the -- 4 Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. A copy of our prepared comments and an audio recording of this call will also be available on our website later today. After some brief prepared comments, the management team will be available to answer questions.\nI will now turn the call over to Eric.\n\nH. Eric Bolton\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThanks, Andrew, and good morning. Leasing conditions remained strong across our Sunbelt portfolio, job growth, positive migration trends and the higher cost of single-family home ownership continue to fuel strong demand roughly halfway through the busy leasing season, we do not see any indication that demand is slowing. Leasing traffic or leads were up 11% in the second quarter as compared to prior year generating a 7% jump in lease applications, new move-ins during the quarter from households migrating into our Sunbelt footprint increased slightly from last year and drove 15% of our new move-ins.\nFurther supporting the strength of the leasing market and the prospects for continued rent growth, it's worth noting that the rent-to-income ratio of the new leases executed in the second quarter was 22%, it remains in a very affordable range. Collections also remained strong with 99.5% of the rent build in the second quarter collected, which is actually up slightly from 99.4% collected in the preceding first quarter.\nAl will touch on this and while we see no near-term indications that leasing conditions are poised to change and we expect the strong occupancy and rent growth trends to continue, we do anticipate that we'll see some year-over-year moderation in rent growth over the back half of the year as the prior year performance comparisons become more difficult.\nBut current rent levels continue to hold up well and are increasingly fueling solid revenue momentum for the start of the next calendar year. Pressure on operating expenses from the competitive labor market, inflationary and supply chain pressures and real estate taxes continued in the second quarter. We expect these pressures will likely persist over the balance of the year with some relief beginning in 2023 as we begin to harvest increasing benefits from our new tech and margin expansion initiatives.\nOn balance, given the strong top line performance, our NOI margin continues to expand. And as noted in our earnings release, we, once again, increased our expectations for growth in same-store net operating income for the year. We are seeing increasing opportunity within the transaction market and are very pleased with our Tampa property acquisition completed earlier this month. This new property acquisition is actually located directly adjacent to 1 of our existing properties providing an opportunity to consolidate on-site operations to drive a very attractive investment return.\nOur new development pipeline continues to expand as we continue to find attractive opportunities to drive value and yields well above our overall cost of capital. Our pipeline of existing construction projects remains on budget, and our lease-up projects are outperforming our pro formas. We remain very encouraged by the current leasing conditions and the early momentum in key variables that will define calendar year 2023's initial performance.\nThere are, of course, growing concerns surrounding the broader economy and concerns surrounding a potential recession. Should we find ourselves facing a weaker economic backdrop later this year or in 2023, we believe that MAA is very well positioned for such an environment. First, we believe that the well diversified and more affordable nature of our markets will continue to enable our Sunbelt portfolio to better weather an economic slowdown as compared to other regions.\nMAA's balance sheet and coverage ratios are very strong and better than at any point in our company's history. We continue to introduce new technology and changes to our operating practices that will drive more efficiency and higher margins over the next couple of years. MAA has had a established performance record of responding well to down cycles, and I'm confident that we will again demonstrate that resilience, should we find ourselves in such an environment. Meanwhile, our outlook remains positive, and current leasing conditions are very strong. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments, and I'll now turn the call over to Brad.\n\nAdrian Bradley Hill\n\nExecutive VP & CIO, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Transaction activity in the second quarter slowed meaningfully from the first quarter of the year as the increase in interest rates coupled with a higher degree of economic uncertainty have combined Ascend Buyers with shorter investment time horizons as well as buyers using higher leverage to the sidelines. Unlike previous quarters, we saw a number of properties fall out of contract in the second quarter.\nFor the properties that did close, generally, they closed with stronger institutional quality investors at cap rates that were 40 basis points higher than where deals traded in the first quarter. As the uncertainty in the market has risen, our ability to move quickly and close all cash has led to a significant increase in inbound calls to our transaction team.\nAs Eric mentioned, in July, we successfully acquired a newly constructed property in the Tampa MSA. This 196-unit property is adjacent to an existing MAA property and will be fully integrated into our existing property, creating operational efficiencies and margin expansion opportunities that we will fully harvest over the next few years.\nOur under construction and in lease-up pipeline remains at $740 million. While we had no construction starts in the second quarter, we did purchase a land parcel for a planned 2023 start of a 300-unit development in Orlando. Also, subsequent to quarter end, we purchased a 500-unit development site in the Denver MSA that we also expect to start construction on in 2023. These land purchases bring our owned land sites for development to 8 sites with entitlements for approximately 2,677 units.\nWe previously expected to start construction on our sites in Raleigh, Tampa and Denver this year, but we've pushed the start of our Denver project to 2023. Predevelopment work on our Raleigh and Tampa projects are progressing and subject to receiving acceptable construction costs and the appropriate building permits, we still expect to start construction on these projects this year. We continue predevelopment work on several additional in-house and prepurchase developments located in Atlanta, Charlotte, Denver, Orlando and Salt Lake City that we hope to start over the next 18 months.\nThe timing of planned construction starts can change as we work through the local approval and the construction bidding processes but at this time, we expect to start construction on approximately 1,250 units this year, and we expect to end the year with a pipeline of under construction projects over $700 million and pipeline of projects both under construction and in lease-up between $925 million and $975 million. Our construction management team continues to actively manage all our projects and has done a tremendous job working with our contractors to keep the inflationary pressures surrounding labor and material costs from causing a meaningful increase to our overall job cost.\nTo avoid the cost escalation that is so prevalent in the market today, we are making commitments to purchase materials much earlier in the process than we've had to in the past. Nevertheless, delivery delays, material shortages and securing building permits remain our biggest challenges. In our supplemental, we did push back by 1 quarter, our expected delivery dates on Novel Val Vista in Phoenix and Central Park in Denver.\nOperating performance at communities in their initial lease-up continues to strengthen, traffic and leads remain elevated, leading to rents well ahead of our pro forma expectations at all of our lease-up communities. Due to the strong leasing performance achieved by our property team at MAA Westland, we moved up our expected stabilization date by 1 quarter to third quarter of '22.\nAs mentioned in our release, we successfully sold our 2 disposition properties in the Fort Worth market for $167 million. We have 2 more planned disposition properties in the market that we hope to close late this year. One is in Suburban Maryland, and one is in the Austin market. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom.\n\nThomas L. Grimes\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Same-store performance for the quarter was once again robust, and our busy summer season is going well. We saw strong pricing performance across the portfolio during the second quarter blended lease-over-lease pricing achieved during the quarter was up 17.2%. As a result, all in-place rents or effective rent growth increased by 14.3% on a year-over-year basis and 4% from the prior quarter.\nAverage effective rent growth is our primary revenue driver and with the current blended pricing momentum, we expect it to continue to strengthen. In addition, average daily occupancy for the quarter was a strong [95.7]. The strong demand environment continues to create new opportunities for our product upgrade initiatives. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program as well as installation of our smart home technology package that includes mobile control of lights, thermostat and security as well as leak detection.\nDuring the quarter, we completed 1,844 interior unit upgrades and installed 9,438 smart home packages. In 2022, we plan to complete over 6,000 interior unit upgrades and approximately 23,000 smart home packages. By the end of the year, we expect our total number of smart units to approach 70,000. For our repositioning program, we're in the final stages of repricing leases at the first 8 properties in the program that are now complete, and the results have exceeded our expectations. We have another 8 projects that are underway this year.\nStrong leasing activity continues for July. Same-store lease-over-lease pricing on new move-ins as of July 25, is 17.9% ahead of the rent of the prior lease. Renewal lease pricing in July is running 15.4% of the prior lease and as a result, blended lease pricing for the portfolio is up approximately 16.6% thus far in July.\nSame-store physical occupancy as of July 25 was 95.9. Exposure, which is all vacant units plus notices through a 60-day period, is just 7.4%. Both numbers are in line with our expectations. Our teams have performed well during our busy summer season and have the portfolio well positioned for the slower fall and winter seasons. I'm grateful for their time and commitment to serving all our stakeholders.\nI'll now turn the call over to Al.\n\nAlbert M. Campbell\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Reported core FFO per share of $2.02 was $0.05 above the midpoint of our guidance for the quarter. The outperformance virtually all came from property revenues and stronger than projected rental pricing trends continued through the quarter, which produced a strong 17.2% increase in blended lease pricing for the quarter even as more challenging prior year comparisons began to grow late in the quarter.\nWe do continue to expect a growing impact from prior comps as we move through the back half of the year as well as a return of a more normal seasonal pattern during the fourth quarter, which we'll discuss just a bit more (inaudible) guidance in a moment. Same-store operating expenses for the quarter were slightly higher than projected as we saw some inflationary pressures and repair maintenance costs as well as revised expectations for real estate tax expenses for the year as more valuation information came in during the quarter.\nOur revised guidance for the year reflects these expense pressures, but these are more than offset by growing revenues as reflected by our revised NOI guidance. Our balance sheet is stronger than ever as reflected by the upgrade to an A- credit rating by Fitch during the quarter. We continue to have discussions with the other agencies and are confident the strength will eventually be reflected in our other ratings as well.\nJust after the end of the quarter, we completed a renewal of our unsecured credit facility, which is our primary tool for liquidity and short-term funding of development, debt maturities and short-term operating needs. As part of the renewal, we increased the facility size to $1.25 billion from $1 billion and capture improvements in pricing and terms despite the growing volatility of the financing markets.\nAt the end of the quarter, we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility, and our leverage was historically low with debt to EBITDA at a low 3.97x and 100% of our debt had fixed interest rates with an average maturity of 8.2 years, providing potential in a rising interest rate environment. And finally, given the second quarter performance and expectations for the remainder of the year, we are increasing both our core FFO and same-store guidance for the full year.\nWe increased our full year range for core FFO by $0.17 per share or 2% at the midpoint to a range of $8.13 to $8.37 per share or $8.25 at the midpoint. This now represents a 17.5% growth over the prior year. This increase is essentially all the result of higher revenue growth, strong price intends continued through the second quarter, as we mentioned, we're now projecting a 125 basis points increase in our effective rent growth expectation for the year to 13.25% at the midpoint.\nOur revenue projection for the year continues to be built on strong pricing performance and stable occupancy for the year with some growing impact from prior year comps for the second half and normal seasonal trends during the fourth quarter, as we mentioned. We expect blended lease pricing to be approximately 8% for the second half of the year, which for context is on top of a record high 15% growth in blended pricing captured in the back half of last year.\nSo I think this reflects our expectation for continued strong demand in our markets. As mentioned, we also increased the expected growth rate for same-store operating expenses for the full year by 100 basis points at the midpoint of our range, now 6.5% to 7.5% for the full year, primarily reflecting the pressure in repair and maintenance costs as well as real estate taxes.\nProperty valuations received during the quarter, mainly in Texas, reflected aggressive assessments, and we do expect these valuation increases to be partially offset by millage rate rollbacks finalized late in the year, but we increased our expectation for taxes by 100 basis points for the full year to reflect the net impact. The overall impact of these changes is an increase to our expectations for same-store NOI growth for the year to a midpoint of 15%, up from the 13.5% provided at the end of the first quarter.\nAnd this represents a 170 basis point expansion in our margin in 2022 from the prior year. So other changes to guidance of note were a $50 million reduction in our expected development spending for the year, reflecting really revised timing of funding as well as a $25 million reduction in our gross disposition proceeds as we finalized the sale of the 2 remaining properties in Maryland in Austin. So that's all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So Gretchen we'll now turn the call back over to you for any questions."

Eric Bolton\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThanks, Andrew, and we appreciate everyone joining us this morning. MAA continues to capture robust leasing conditions across our portfolio, and we are carrying strong momentum in rent growth into the summer leasing season. Leasing traffic remains high, solid job growth, accelerating migration trends to our Sunbelt markets and the higher pricing hurdles for single-family ownership continue to fuel strong demand for apartment housing.\nAlmost 14% of the new leases we wrote in the first quarter came from move-ins relocating to the Sunbelt. This is an increase of 190 basis points from the first quarter of last year. Resident turnover continues to remain low with move-outs further declining by close to 6% as compared to Q1 of last year. These trends continue to support our ability to capture strong rent growth. The rents in place at quarter end within the same-store portfolio were on average 12.4% higher on a comparable basis to the prior year. And encouragingly, the new leases that went into effect in the first quarter were 16.8% higher than the expiring leases.\nPricing momentum remains strong heading into the important summer leasing period. Our largest pressures on property operating expenses were with personnel costs and repair and maintenance expenses as the tight labor market, inflationary pressures and supply chain issues make an impact. But with the strong top line performance, we continue to see strong NOI growth. And as detailed in our earnings release, we have increased our performance expectations for the full year.\nOur new development pipeline continues to perform very well with 5 of the projects now actively leasing and capturing rents that are higher than assumed in our projections. As detailed in the earnings release, we have 3 other developments under construction that we expect to start leasing late this year.\nIn addition to the development detailed in the earnings release, we are also expecting to break ground on another 3 projects later this year located in Raleigh, Tampa and Denver. We're excited with the strong start to the year. Leasing conditions clearly remain very favorable. We have a number of initiatives underway with new technologies and redevelopment that will further fuel margin expansion and higher earnings growth from our existing portfolio and expanding new development pipeline will add -- will also fuel additional FFO growth over the next 2 to 3 years and the balance sheet is in a strong position to support our growth plans.\nMAA strategy has consistently demonstrated more resilient performance during weaker parts of the economic cycle. But as a consequence of the many enhancements we've made over the past few years to the portfolio mix, to the operating platform, to the balance sheet and to our external growth capabilities, we're excited to now also see MAA's ability to post strong relative performance during recovery and the up parts of the market cycle.\nIn closing, I'd like to extend my appreciation to our team of MAA associates for their continued hard work and consistently strong performance. I thought I have in the way of prepared comments, and I'll now turn the call over to Brad.\n\nAdrian Bradley Hill\n\nExecutive VP & CIO, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. During the first quarter, we continued to make progress towards growing our new development pipeline. We finished the first quarter with $444 million under construction and $740 million combined under construction and in lease-up at an average expected stabilized NOI yield of 5.9%.\nThe size of our total pipeline is up from $700 million at the end of 2021. During the first quarter, we started construction on a 352-unit project in Denver called MAA Park Central. This is the first phase of a 3-phase 1,000-unit project on land we purchased in late 2020.\nPredevelopment work at our 3 young sites in Raleigh, Tampa and Denver is progressing. And subject to receiving acceptable construction costs, we expect to start construction on these projects this year. Additionally, we continue predevelopment work on several in-house and prepurchase developments that we hope to start over the next 18 months in Atlanta, Charlotte, Denver, Orlando, Phoenix and Salt Lake City. This pool of future development opportunities includes an entitled site in Denver that we purchased in the first quarter of this year.\nThe timing of planned construction starts can change as we work through the local approval and the construction bidding processes. But at this time, we expect to start construction on 1,600 to 1,800 units in 2022 and end the year with a pipeline of under-construction projects between $800 million and $900 million and a pipeline of total projects both under construction and in lease-up over $1 billion.\nOur operating performance at communities and their initial lease-up is strong, and we're achieving rents substantially above our pro forma expectations. Reflective of the strong leasing demand in our markets, we reached stabilization at our MAA Midtown Phoenix community 2 quarters earlier than our original expectation, while also achieving stabilized effective rents more than 7.5% above our original pro forma expectations.\nOur construction management team continues to actively manage all our projects and has done a tremendous job keeping labor and material cost increases from having an impact on our overall budgets. Material shortages and shipping delays are prevalent in the market today. And in many instances, necessitate us placing orders and making deposits much earlier in the process than we had to in the past to secure materials as well as our place in the delivery queue.\nDespite these challenges, we delivered our last units at both MAA [Westland] and MAA Park Point on time during the first quarter. Our 2022 disposition plan is underway with 2 properties in the Fort Worth market currently under contract with an expected closing date later in the second quarter. Buyer interest was strong for these 30-year-old properties with one buyer winning the opportunity to purchase both. We plan to sell 2 additional properties later in the year.\nOur transaction team also remains engaged in the transaction market, and we're actively evaluating several acquisition opportunities, and we continue to believe that as we get later in the year, more compelling opportunities for acquiring stabilized and lease-up properties are likely to materialize.\nThat's all I have in the way of prepared comments. So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom.\n\nThomas L. Grimes\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Performance for the quarter was once again robust, and we're off to a good start in 2022. We saw strong pricing performance across the portfolio during the first quarter. Blended lease-over-lease pricing achieved during the quarter was up 16.8% as a result, all in-place rents or effective rent growth increased 12.4% on a year-over-year basis and 2.6% from the prior quarter. Average effective rent growth is our primary revenue driver. And with the current blended pricing momentum, we expect it to continue to strengthen. In addition, average daily occupancy for the quarter was a strong 95.9%.\nThe strong demand environment continues to create new opportunities for our product upgrade initiatives. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program as well as installation of our smart home technology package that includes mobile control of lights, thermostat and security as well as leak detection.\nAt quarter end, we have completed 1,098 interior unit upgrades and installed 11,018 Smart Home packages. In 2022, we plan to complete over 6,000 interior unit upgrades and approximately 23,000 Smart Home packages. By the end of the year, we expect our total number of smart units to approach 71,000. For our repositioning program, we're in the final stages of repricing leases at the first of 8 properties in the program that are now complete, results have exceeded our expectations of another 8 projects that are underway this year.\nThe strong leasing activity continues into April. Lease-over-lease pricing on new rent leases for April is currently at 16.5% ahead of the rent on the prior lease. Renewal lease pricing in April is running 16.7% ahead of the prior lease. And as a result, blended lease pricing for the portfolio is up 16.6% thus far in April.\nAverage daily occupancy for the month of April is currently strong at 95.7%. And exposure, which is all vacant units plus notices through a 60-day period, is just 8.5%. Both numbers are in line with our expectations and support our ability to continue to prioritize rent growth headed into the busy summer season. Our teams are well prepared and looking forward to the busier summer season. I'm grateful for their time and commitment to serving all of our stakeholders. Al?\n\nAlbert M. Campbell\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nOkay. Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Reported core FFO per share of $1.97 was $0.06 above the midpoint of our guidance for the quarter. And virtually all of the outperformance came from revenue growth as rental pricing, occupancy and collections all combined to produce 150 basis points of outperformance to our revenue expectation for the quarter.\nAs Tom outlined, pricing trends continue to be strong through the first quarter and into April, as both new leases and renewals becoming effective during the quarter through solid double-digit growth over the prior lease. We continue to expect stable occupancy and strong rent growth through this year and with some impact from prior year comps and returned to more normal seasonal patterns during the fourth quarter leasing season, which did not occur last year.\nOverall, same-store operating expenses were in line with expectations for the quarter, but we do expect continued inflationary pressure over the remainder of the year and particularly in personnel and maintenance costs, which I'll discuss just a bit more in a moment.\nOur balance sheet remains in great shape, providing both protection for market volatility and capacity for strong future growth. We funded approximately $43 million of development costs during the quarter towards trajected $250 million funding for the full year.\nAs Brad mentioned earlier, we expect to start several new deals this year and early next year, likely expanding our total construction pipeline to between $800 million to $1 billion by year-end, which remains well within our risk tolerance limits. We ended the quarter with low leverage.\nOur debt to EBITDA had a record low 4.27x, with virtually all of our debt fixed and well laddered over an average of 8.4 years and with $1 billion of combined cash and borrowing capacity remaining under our line of credit.\nAlso during the quarter, Moody's affirmed our debt rating of Baa1 and revised their outlook from stable to positive, bringing all 3 rating agencies now to a positive outlook. And this certainly reflects the strength of our balance sheet and the potential for upgraded ratings over the next several quarters.\nAnd finally, given the first quarter performance and expectations for the remainder of the year, we are updating both our core FFO and same-store guidance for the full year. We increased our full year range for core FFO by $0.16 per share at the midpoint to $7.92 to $8.24 per share or $8.08 at the midpoint. This represents a 13% growth over the prior year. This increase is essentially all produced by higher revenue growth expectations as projected to continued strong pricing trends produce a 200 basis points increase in our effective rent growth, our expectation for the year to 12% at the midpoint compared to 10% in our prior guidance and 5.2% for the prior year performance.\nAs mentioned, our revenue projection for the full year is built on continued solid pricing performance and stable occupancy for the year with some impact from prior year comps of the second half and normal seasonal trends during the fourth quarter.\nThe trends with our property operating expenses remained largely in line with our original projections with some increased pressure expected from both from personnel and maintenance costs. The strong labor market, a robust development environment. And the continued supply chain issues are expected to continue to pressure our maintenance service salaries and materials costs.\nWe increased our guidance for total operating expenses for this by 50 basis points at the midpoint to 6%, reflecting the continued pressure. However, it's worth to note, this increase is more than offset by the revenue growth trends, which produced a revised same-store NOI expectation of 13.5% for the full year, which is (inaudible) above our prior guidance.\nThe forecast for our largest property operating expense line on the real estate taxes remains at 4% to 5%. I'll add also as a result of the continued labor market inflation assumed higher performance-based incentives, given the strong projected performance, we have also raised the midpoint of our total overhead assumptions for the full year. And the only other change to our guidance was an increase in the dollar value of our disposition volume, which was increased $25 million to a midpoint of $350 million, reflecting higher pricing expectations on assets being sold.\nSo that's all we have in the way of prepared comments. So Ashley, we will now turn the call back over to you for questions."

Eric Bolton\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. MAA wrapped up calendar year 2021 with strong momentum in rent growth, driving fourth quarter results that were ahead of expectations. The demand for apartment housing across our markets continues to grow. Comparing the pricing achieved on all the leases that went into effect during the fourth quarter on a lease-over-lease basis, rents jumped 16% as compared to the rents on expiring leases. This is 100 basis points ahead of the performance in the preceding third quarter.\nWe are clearly carrying good momentum for continued strong rent growth in the coming year. As outlined in our earnings guidance for 2022, we plan to take further advantage of the strong leasing environment and drive additional rent growth through unit interior upgrades and more extensive full repositioning projects at several communities. Additionally, we continue a steady rollout of a number of new technology initiatives aimed at further expanding our operating margins. We are just beginning to harvest some of the benefits of our new tech initiatives with 30 leasing positions eliminated through attrition in 2021 and another 50 leasing positions targeted to be eliminated by the end of this year.\nOur new development and lease-up portfolios continue to make solid progress with leasing velocity and rents running ahead of our pro forma expectations. As Brad will outline in his comments, we have several additional new projects that we are expected to start in 2022. The balance sheet remains in a very strong position and during the fourth quarter, Standard & Poor's moved their credit rating outlook on MAA to a positive status. Given the strong earnings performance and robust pricing being captured on property dispositions, we expect to see the balance sheet metrics improve further in 2022.\nOur initial earnings guidance for 2022 outlines in more detail our expectations for continued strong performance from our existing portfolio, the expansion of our new development pipeline and our commitment to maintain a strong balance sheet following a 9% growth in Core FFO per share in calendar year 2021, we're forecasting a 13% growth in Core FFO in 2022 at the midpoint of our guidance range. Our team of MAA associates had a terrific year of performance in 2021, and I very much appreciate their service to our residents and support to each other.\nAnd that's all I have in the way of prepared comments, and I'll turn the call over to Tom to update on property operations. Tom?\n\nThomas L. Grimes\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Performance for the quarter was once again robust, and those trends carried into 2022. We saw strong pricing performance across the portfolio during the fourth quarter blended lease-over-lease pricing achieved during the quarter was up 16%. As a result, all in-place rents or effective rent growth increased 10.1% on a year-over-year basis. Average Effective Rent growth is our primary revenue driver and with current blended pricing momentum, we expect it to continue to strengthen. In addition, average daily occupancy for the quarter was a strong 96%. As outlined in the release, we saw steady progress from our product upgrade initiatives. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program as well as installation of our Smart Home technology package that includes mobile control of lights, thermostat in security, as well as leak detection. For the full year 2021, we completed 6,360 interior unit upgrades and installed 23,579 Smart Home packages. This brings a total number of smart units to 48,000.\nIn 2022, we plan to complete a similar level of interior unit upgrades and Smart Home packages for our repositioning programs, we're in the final stages of completing work on our first 8 properties in the program and have another 8 that are underway this year. The strong leasing activity continued into 2022. Lease-over-lease pricing on new move-in leases for January was 15.4% ahead of the rent on the prior lease, renewal lease pricing for January was running 17.1% ahead of the prior lease. As a result, blended lease pricing for the portfolio was up approximately 16.3% in January.\nAverage daily occupancy for the month of January is currently 95.9%, which is 50 basis points better than January of last year, exposure which is all vacant units plus notices through a 60-day period, is just 7.4%. This is 60 basis points better than prior year. This supports our ability to continue to prioritize rent growth. We're well positioned as we move into 2022.\nI'm grateful for our team's continued resilience and strong performance. I'm excited to see what they accomplished in 2022.\nI'll now turn the call over to Brad.\n\nAdrian Bradley Hill\n\nExecutive VP & CIO, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. 2021 was a record year for multifamily transactions in the fourth quarter was no exception. We continue to see very strong asset pricing trends across our footprint with an acceleration in pricing in the fourth quarter. Operational performance across our markets is strong, driving continued high investor demand. Bid sheets are deep with winners surviving multiple best and final rounds, and offering aggressive all around deal terms. To date, we've seen no negative impact on asset values from expected rising interest rates, and we believe the tremendous amount of liquidity, coupled with continued strong rent growth expectations will drive values higher.\nWe remain active in the transaction market and are constantly evaluating several acquisition opportunities, and believe that as we move further into the recovery part of the cycle, particularly in a rising rate environment, more compelling opportunities for acquiring stabilized and lease-up properties could materialize.\nNew development continues to provide a more attractive investment basis, higher stabilized NOI yield and higher long-term returns to capital as compared to acquisitions. So we will continue to focus on growing our development pipeline. Our pipeline ended 2021 at $460 million under construction and $242 million in lease-up. As we've indicated in the past, the size of our development pipeline will fluctuate due to the timing differences of starts and completions but we remain focused on expanding our opportunity.\nLater in 2022, the growth in our pipeline will be more evident as we expect to end the year with $900 million to $1 billion under construction, and $300 million in lease-up. Therefore, we expect our total under construction, and in lease-up to grow from approximately $700 million at the end of 2021 to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion by the end of 2022. This ramp-up will include in-house developments at 2 owned sites in Denver, 1 of which is a 3-phased site, an owned site in Tampa, and 2 controlled sites in Denver and Raleigh.\nOn the prepurchase side of our development operation, we are in predevelopment on the Salt Lake City site that we hope to start in late 2022. Performance at communities and their initial lease-up is going well. Absorption is stronger than we expected and rents on average are 5% to 13% above pro forma. Reflective of the strong absorption, we've moved up the expected stabilization date of our NOVEL Midtown community to first quarter of '22.\nAll of our under construction projects remain at or below our budgeted construction costs, but we continue to see increased and broad-based material shortages and delivery delays. In addition, we've begun to see some level of labor shortages in the market. Our construction team has done a great job navigating these challenges and minimizing the impact to schedules and the economics of our projects, but this is an area we'll need to actively monitor throughout the year. We expect these challenges to add 60 days or so to any new starts this year, and we expect a 30-day delay at our Valdosta and Westmont projects. We've adjusted our construction schedules, as noted in the supplemental to reflect the delay these 2 properties. We had tremendous execution on our property dispositions in 2021, selling 7 assets and achieving pricing well ahead of our expectations.\nOur fourth quarter dispositions were sold above our guidance range, generating a leveraged investment IRR of 26% for these 29-year-old assets. In 2022, we will continue our disciplined pruning of the portfolio and expect to sell another 4 properties over the coming year.\nThat's all out of the way of prepared comments. I'll turn it over to Al.\n\nAlbert M. Campbell\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Core FFO performance of $1.90 per share for the fourth quarter was $0.07 per share above the midpoint of our guidance, producing core FFO of $7.01 per share for the full year, which, as Eric mentioned, is 9% above the prior year. The outperformance for the quarter is virtually all from revenue growth. As Tom outlined, strong pricing trends continued through the fourth quarter showing no seasonal slowdown, which not only benefited the fourth quarter, but provide additional strength for 2022 expectations, which I'll talk about more in just a moment.\nIn total, Same Store operating expenses for the fourth quarter were essentially in line with our expectations as has some inflationary pressures impacted repair and maintenance costs. Real estate taxes were lower than expected due to favorable appeals and rate rollbacks finalized during the quarter. We expect some continued inflationary pressures in our operating expenses during 2022, but we expect the impact to be more than absorbed through the continued strong revenue growth for the year. We did provide initial earnings guidance for 2022 with the release, which is detailed in the submental package with the release.\nCore FFO for the full year is projected to be $7.92 per share at the midpoint of the range, which represents a 13% growth over the prior year. The overall backdrop for our projected 2022 performance is continued strong occupancy levels remaining between 95.6% and 96% for the full year, providing a foundation supporting continued strong growth and effective rent per unit, as the strong blended lease-up lease rent rates continue to work through our portfolio. Effective growth -- effective rent growth, excuse me, is projected to be 10% for the year at the midpoint, which is nearly twice the total of effective rent growth posted for 2021.\nThis result is based on continued strong blended lease rate growth for the first few quarters with some normal seasonal trends and challenging comparisons beginning to be felt late in the year, particularly during the fourth quarter. This produces projected total Same Store revenue growth of 8% to 10% for the full year. As mentioned, we expect to see some inflationary pressures impacting our Same Store operating expenses for the year, with personnel costs, repair and maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance costs, all trending above long-term growth rates, producing 5% to 6% growth overall for 2022. However, this pressure is expected to be more than offset by the strong revenue trends producing an NOI growth expectation of 10% to 12% for the year.\nOur forecast also assumes an active transaction year with projected development funding of $200 million to $300 million for the year, and acquisitions of $75 million to $125 million. We expect the majority of this to be funded by disposition proceeds of between $300 million and $350 million. Our forecast anticipates starting 6 new development projects during the year, a combination of in-house and prepurchase deals, as outlined by Brad, which will increase our total pipeline and funding commitment as we enter 2023.\nWe currently have no plans to raise additional equity during the year as our forecast projects our leverage to end the year slightly below the current level with debt-to-EBITDA ranging 4x to 4.5x, Also virtually all of our debt is currently fixed with maturities well laddered over 8.7 years on average, providing some protection against rising interest rates.\nSo that's all we have in the way of prepared comments. So Chris, we'll now turn the call back over you for any questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please also note today's event is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Zach Freedman. Sir, please go ahead.\n\nZachary Freedman\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Enphase Energy's Third Quarter 2025 Results. On today's call are Badri Kothandaraman, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Mandy Yang, our Chief Financial Officer; and Raghu Belur Officer.\nAfter the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results of its third quarter ended September 30, 2025. During this conference call, Enphase management will make forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements related to our expected future financial performance, market trends, the capabilities of our technology and products and the benefits to homeowners and installers, our operations, including manufacturing, customer service and supply and demand, anticipated growth in existing and new markets, including the TPO market, the timing of new product introductions and enhancements to existing products and regulatory tax tariffs and supply chain matters. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties and our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from these expectations.\nFor a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please see our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Qs filed with the SEC. We caution you not to place any undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertake no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes in expectations.\nAlso, please note that financial measures used on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted and adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial matters to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release furnished with the SEC on Form 8-K, which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nNow I'd like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Badri?\n\nBadrinarayanan Kothandaraman\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nGood afternoon, and thanks for joining us today to discuss our third quarter 2025 financial results. We had a good quarter. We reported quarterly revenue of $410.4 million, our highest revenue level in 2 years. We shipped 1.77 million microinverters and the record 195-megawatt hours of batteries. We generated free cash flow of $5.9 million. Our Q3 revenue also included $70.9 million of safe harbor revenue. As we exited Q3, our microinverter channel inventory returned to normal while our battery channel inventory was slightly elevated due to sell-in of our new food generation battery.\nFor the third quarter, we delivered 49% gross margin, above the higher end of our guidance range, 19% operating expense and 30% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis and including the net IRA benefit. Mandy will go into our financial retain the call.\nOur customer service NPS was 77% in Q3 compared to 79% in Q2. The average call wait time was 2 minutes. To further enhance the customer experience, we are preparing to launch our AI-powered assistant in the NPS app, which will help customers find answers quickly, troubleshoot issues and manage their systems more intuitively. Our data engineering team continues to strengthen the intelligence behind our support systems and leveraging analytics and machine learning to identify common issues, predict service needs and reduce response time across our regions.\nLet's cover operations. In Q3, we shipped approximately 1.53 million microinverters from our U.S. facilities, booking [ 45x ] production tax credits. Our domestically made micro inverters help residential lease PPA providers and commercial asset owners to qualify for the 10% domestic content ITC error. We grew our U.S. battery production in Q3, shipping 67.5 megawatt hours compared to 46.9 megawatt hours in Q2. We are now building our fourth generation battery, the IQ Battery 10C in the U.S. using domestically made microinverters, domestically made thermal and battery management systems as well as packaging while only sourcing cell pack from China. These batteries have greater than 45% domestic content and help our lease PPA customers qualify for ITC bonuses. We remain on track to source non-China sell packs by the end of this year, scaling into battery builds in the first half of '26. Therefore, we expect limited exposure to the recent China-related tariffs as our supply chain transitions away from China.\nIn summary, our U.S. made microinverters and batteries can help customers qualify for domestic content ITC bonuses as well as meet Fia compliance even as the criteria becomes increasingly stringent each year, a big differentiator for Enphase.\nLet's now cover the regions. Our U.S. and international revenue mix for Q3 was 85% and 15%, respectively. In the U.S., our revenue increased 29% in Q3 compared to Q2, primarily due to increased demand as well as higher safe harbor revenue of $70.9 million compared to $40.4 million in Q2. The overall sell-through of our products was up 9% in Q3 as compared to Q2. In Europe, our revenue decreased by 38% in Q3 compared to Q2, while overall sell-through decreased by 27%. Europe negatively impacted our Q3 revenue by approximately $25 million compared to Q2, a larger sequential decline than expected. The overall business environment across the region is still challenging, but we are maintaining our discipline on the channel as well as targeting specific growth areas that could drive higher 2026 revenues.\nI will now provide some color on key markets in Europe. In Netherlands, the solar demand remained soft in Q3. We are making steady progress towards the sizable battery retrofit opportunity we see in 2026 and beyond, rising solar export penalties and the planned sunset of net metering at the end of 2026 are creating a compelling use case for storage with an Enphase installed base of about 475,000 residential solar systems in Netherlands, we estimate a $2 billion total opportunity for batteries.\nWe recently announced a collaboration with Essent, one of Netherlands' largest residential energy providers or REPs, enabling customers to add IQ Batteries and participate in essence, smart steering VPP program. This program is designed to boost self-consumption and lower utility bills. Through the smart steering, participating customers may receive fixed monthly compensation of up to EUR 122 depending on the battery size. Essent intelligently controls, charging and discharging to optimize value for the home and the grid supporting a more reliable energy system. Building on this momentum, we are advancing additional partnerships and expect battery sales in Netherlands to be a growth driver in 2026 and beyond.\nIn France, the residential demand remained muted in Q3. Many households waited for the October 1 VAT cut of 5.5% for sub-9 kilowatts, but its limited scope and dependence on low carbon panels reduce the impact. Meanwhile, 2025 policy changes have extended the payback period, creating a tougher market for installers. We are focusing on self-consumption where low export incentives strengthen the value proposition for solar plus battery solutions.\nIn Germany, the residential market remained weak in Q3. lower export value and stop-start incentives have kept many households on the sidelines, softening demand for both solar and batteries, even though our performance was relatively stable, supported by our partnership with leading installers and the strong uptake of the flex space battery, which provides both self-consumption as well as 3-phase backup.\nIn the U.K., the residential solar and storage adoption is stable, driven by time of use tariffs, low export rates and a growing focus on resilience and self-consumption. We are deepening ties with our REPs and supporting them with a robust API platform. In Q3, we also added backup capability for our batteries in U.K., which was long overdue and further expanded our resilience offering.\nIn Australia, the residential storage demand is accelerating following the July 2025 Battery Rebate Program with installers bundling, PV and batteries and average battery size is increasing as low export rates per cell consumption. Distribution operators are rolling out dynamic export limits and interoperability standards favoring systems with fast controls and 3-phase backup. Against this backdrop, we launched the Flex phase battery in Q3, delivering 3-phase backup as well as flexible power to meet evolving DSO requirements. We also launched IQ8P high-power microinverters for higher power modules as well as our newest IQ EV chargers strengthening our position in the strategic market.\nLet's discuss our outlook for Q4. We are seeing a further ramp in the U.S. demand in Q4, primarily due to homeowners moving to capture the expiring 25D tax credit before the end of this year. In the first 3 weeks of October, our U.S. sell-through was up over 20% compared to the Q3 average. We anticipate this elevated activity will continue for much of Q4. We also anticipate that our overall sell-through for the company to be between $350 million into $400 million in Q4. However, our revenue guidance is in the range of $310 million to $350 million. And for IQ batteries, we expect to ship between 140 and 160-megawatt hours. There are 2 reasons contributing to this lower revenue guidance. First, we had $70.9 million of safe harbor revenue pulled in from Q4 to Q3 as customers wanted the product before the U.S. Treasury guidance in Q3. And second, we are reducing shipments of product to the channel in order to destock the channels as we head into 2026. This positions us to enter 2026 with a healthy channel, setting us up for a clean Q1 and beyond.\nCurrently, we have approximately 75% booked to the midpoint of our Q4 revenue guidance. Safe harbor opportunities are not yet included in our Q4 guidance, but similar to Q3, they present upside opportunity. We are working closely with several TPO partners on safe harbor planning and are well positioned to support both methods of safe harbor. The 5% method as well as the physical work test method based on each partner's preference.\nLet's look ahead to 2026. While we don't typically guide beyond the next quarter, we are sharing our preliminary views to frame expectations. For Q1 '26, we anticipate a larger than normal seasonal decline, following the expiration of '25 tax credit and estimate a company revenue of $250 million. We view Q1 as the cycle trough with conditions improving through the rest of the year. While are we constructive on the balance of the year, there are 3 external drivers that could support recovery. First, the U.S. power prices are rising. About 5% this winter with additional increases expected in 2026. Second, interest rates are declining, using affordability. Third, new and attractive financing solutions are entering the market to help offset the loss of 25D. Taken together, these drivers could enable a second half of 2026 rebound and set the stage for growth.\nIn addition, we see several Enphase specific revenue drivers that are expected to fuel growth through 2026. Our fourth generation battery, the IQ Battery 10C is positioned to capture share through lower installation costs for backup. We are now entering the 480-volt commercial solar market with our IQ 9 and GaN microinverter, which we expect to ship this December and ramp in 2026. We are also leveraging strategic partnerships to capture the battery retrofit opportunity in Netherlands.\nOur newest IQ EV chargers and upcoming IQ bidirectional EV chargers are poised to expand our market and our fifth generation battery system paired with IQ 9 residential microinverters will drive a step change reduction in system costs in both the U.S. and Europe. While there is uncertainty around 2026, we remain confident in our ability to execute and deliver growth across these vectors.\nNow let's talk about financing. The industry is moving towards the TPO model in 2026. Enphase supports all the major TPOs today. We are further strengthening these relationships through safe harbor and tax equity support, providing domestic content as well as VOC-compliant products offering O&M services solar graph integration and helping to implement innovative financing solutions.\nLooking ahead, we see a strong trend developing in the market towards prepaid lease offerings, which can provide homeowners with the option of ownership after 5 years. In this model, the TPO captures the 48E tax credit and in turn, offers the homeowner and attractive lease prepayment or a lower monthly payment when paired with the loan. This structure makes the economics similar to today's solar loan economics with the 30% '25 detax credit. Furthermore, financing providers like the Enphase system value proposition, which includes not only the Enphase equipment but support for operations and maintenance as well as solar graph integration to offer an overall attractive package to consumers. We believe the TPO market is poised to growth in '26 and see multiple ways for Enphase to support their growth.\nLet's talk about products, starting with IQ Batteries. In August, we began shipping our IQ Battery 10C supplied by our manufacturing facilities in the U.S., delivering domestic content, which is significant value in the growing TPO market. As a reminder, we introduced our fourth-generation battery towards the end of June. The fourth generation battery stands out for its smaller footprint enhanced features, easy installation and reliability. It delivers 30% more energy density, occupy 62% lesser wall space and reduces installation cost of backup compared to our prior products.\nIn addition, our fourth-generation battery system also includes the IQ meter color which simplifies backup and IQ combined 6, which seamlessly integrates solar, batteries, EV chargers and load control. The IQ meter collar is now approved by 39 U.S. utilities, and that list is growing every week.\nWe are making strong progress in building partnership with REPs as well as BPP operators around the world that are looking for flexible distributed energy capacity. Homeowners can receive attractive compensation for installing Enphase batteries as part of these programs. In addition to the asset program I mentioned earlier, we signed multiple new contracts with the utilities, including one recently with San Diego community pulp with advanced APIs, our battery seamlessly integrate into VPPs, in regulated markets like the U.S. and participate in wholesale energy markets in deregulated regions such as Europe and Australia.\nWe are actively engaged currently and over 53 VPP programs worldwide, and this is growing at a strong pace. Let's talk about micro inverters. In September, we opened U.S. preorders for the IQ 9N commercial microinverter, our first microinverter powered by gallium nitride organ. We expect to begin shipping the product in December. As I said earlier, we believe IQ 9 marks a major leap in performance and platform flexibility. And most importantly, unlocks a 2 gigawatt market opportunity by enabling us to service 480 volt 3-phase commercial systems in the U.S.A. for the first time. This represents an approximately $400 million total addressable market for Enphase, which we believe will help drive additional revenue in 2026 and beyond. IQ microinverters are expected to meet SEC compliance as well as domestic content right off the back, offering a powerful and reliable alternative in a market still dominated by Chinese equipment.\nWide GaN matter, GaN replaces legacy silicon power devices to deliver faster switching, better thermal performance and higher reliability we have invested over 5 years in the conductor technology, and this rollout sets a new trajectory for cost and performance across our next-generation micro inverters, batteries, bidirectional EV chargers and move.\nLet's talk about EV charging. We are now shipping our latest and greatest IQ EV charger 2 across 18 European countries as well as Australia and New Zealand. The charger supports up to 22 kilowatts 3-phase charging and works as a stand-alone unit are fully integrated with Enphase solar and better. We have opened U.S. preorders and expect Q4 shipments into the U.S. with further expansion planned in additional European markets and India.\nLet me share an update of our IQ bidirectional EV charge are expected to launch in mid-2026. We showcased this 11-kilowatt solution powered by 3 high-performance GaN-based microinverters of 3.84 kilowatts each at the recent REs trade show. The IQ Bidi EV charger only needs to be paired with the IQ meter color for a simple, powerful configuration that enables home backup and grid services together. These 2 components offer one of the lowest cost and simplest ways to provide whole home backup even without rooftop solar or home batteries. Homeowners can just start with this configuration and expand over time by adding Enphase solar and batteries to build a full energy system. Let's now switch to solar graph, our all-in-one platform, purpose built for installers. We have been rolling out major enhancements, including seamless integration with TPO partners, an express editor that allows installers to quickly adjust proposals on the spot, a powerful custom tariff builder, advanced installer management tools and a simplified AI-driven design experience. We believe these updates make it easier for installers to service more homeowners at the kitchen table with greater flexibility, speed and financial transparency. We plan to expand the solar draft platform into additional markets and countries and introduce new features to support productivity, sales velocity and customization for solar installers.\nLet me conclude. There is a significant change occurring in our markets. The loss of the 25% tax credit is a near-term headwind that will impact our results in early 2026. But we believe there is also reminds positive change that is bolstering the long-term outlook for our business. We are entering an interest rate reduction cycle, which historically has been the catalyst for residential solar sector.\nPower price outlooks are surging on the back of AI power demand as well as overall electrification growth. Utilities are struggling to keep up with this demand, creating bottlenecks and price inflation across the grid that are poised to accelerate. We provide homeowners and commercial businesses with an easy off-ramp from this price inflation with a solution that can be interconnected in 90 days. The U.S. residential and commercial rooftop solar industry brings on nearly 2 gigawatts of new power interconnected to the grid every quarter with the 48 tax credit expanding to more customers in 2026 through innovative financing solutions like the prepaid leases we see an attractive value proposition for solar driving recovery in the second half of 2026 and beyond.\nWe are laser-focused on the revenue drivers we can control, growing battery sales with our fourth generation battery, expanding into the 480-volt commercial market with GaN microinverters, capitalizing on battery retrofits to our solar installed base in Netherlands. Ramping our new EV chargers now and the Bidi EV chargers, which will launch later in 2026.\nAnd last, launching our fifth generation residential batteries, along with IQ 9 residential microinverters to reduce system costs significantly for residential solar for both U.S. as well as Europe. As always, we remain focused on operational excellence, product reliability and quality and customer service, delivering best-in-class solutions for our long-term growth markets.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Mandy for her review of our financial results. Mandy?\n\nMandy Yang\n\nVP & CFO\n\nThanks, Badri, and good afternoon, everyone. I will provide more details related to our third quarter of 2025 financial results as well as our business outlook for the fourth quarter of 2025. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the IR section of our website.\nTotal revenue for Q3 was $410.4 million. We shipped approximately 784.6 megawatts DC of microinverters. And a record 195-megawatt hours of IQ Batteries in the quarter. Q3 revenue included $70.9 million of safe harbor revenue. As a reminder, we define safe harbor revenue as any sales made to customers who plan to install the inventory over more than a year.\nNon-GAAP gross margin for Q3 was 49.2%, compared to 48.6% in Q2. GAAP gross margin was 47.8% for Q3 compared to 46.9% in Q2. Non-GAAP gross margin without the net II benefit for Q3 was 38.9% compared to 37.2% in Q2. Receivable tariffs impacted our gross margin by 4.9% in Q3. Given non-GAAP gross margin for Q3 also included $42.5 million of net II benefit.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses were $78.5 million for Q3 compared to $77.8 million for Q2. Ship operating expenses were $130.1 million for Q3 compared to $133.5 million for Q2. Ship operating expenses for Q3 included $47.4 million of stock-based compensation expenses, $2.9 million of acquisition-related amortization and $1.3 million of restructuring asset impairment charges.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, income from operations for Q3 was $123.4 million compared to $98.6 million for Q2. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $66.2 million for Q3 compared to $37 million for Q2. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q3 was $117.3 million compared to $89.9 million for Q2. This resulted in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.90 for Q3, compared to $0.69 for Q2.\nGAAP net income for Q3 was $66.6 million compared to $37.1 million for Q2. This resulted in GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.50 for Q3 compared to $0.28 for Q2. We exited Q3 with a total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of $1.48 billion compared to $1.53 billion at the end of Q2. The 5-year convertible notes we raised in 2021 are coming due on March 1 next year, and we expect to sell the principal amount of $632.5 million at maturity with our cash on hand.\nAs of September 30, 2025, we have approximately $280 million of production tax credit, or PTC, receivable on our balance sheet net of income taxes payable. $108 million is related to U.S. in microinverters shipped to customers in 2024 and $172 million is for shipments made in the first 9 months of 2025. As we elected Direct Pay, the net PTC will be refunded by the IRS through our annual tax return filing. Due to extended IRS processing time lines, we expect to receive 2024s $108 million payment from the IRS in Q2 next year. We expect to receive our 2025 test refund sometime in the first half of 2027, based on the current estimated IRS processing time.\nAs part of our anti-dilution plan, we spent approximately $1.7 million by withholding shares to cover taxes for employees start vesting in Q3. That reduced the diluted shares by 49,023 shares. There were no repurchases of our common stock in Q3 due to our limited free cash flow generation in the quarter. We are evaluating opportunities to accelerate the monetization of our PTC. Our remaining buyback authorization is approximately $269 million, and we remain confident in our overall business outlook over the long term.\nIn Q3, we generated $13.9 million in cash flow from operations and $5.9 million in free cash flow. Capital expenditure was $8 million for Q3 compared to $8.2 million for Q2.\nNow let's discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2025. We expect our revenue for Q4 to be within a range of $310 million to $350 million, which includes shipments of 140- to 160-megawatt hours of IQ Batteries.\nThe revenue guidance doesn't include any safe harbor transaction. We expect gross margin to be within a range of 40% to 43%, including approximately 5 percentage points of reciprocal tariff impact. We spent non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 42% to 45%, including the receivable tariff impact. Non-GAAP gross margin excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related amortization.\nGiven the vast majority of our manufacturing occurs in the U.S. and due to fluctuating tariff impact to our international manufacturing cost baseline. We will no longer be guiding and reporting gross margin without the net IRA credit. As always, gross production tax credit earned will be reported in our 10-Q quarterly statement and 10-K annual financial report filed with the SEC.\nWe expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $130 million to $134 million, including approximately $53 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related amortization and restructuring and asset impairment charges. We our non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $77 million to $81 million. For 2025, we our GAAP tax rate of 18% to 20%, and a non-GAAP tax rate of 14% to 16%.\nWith that, I'll open the line for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Zach Freedman. Please go ahead.\n\nZachary Freedman\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Enphase Energy's Second Quarter 2025 Results. On today's call are Badri Kothandaraman, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Mandy Yang, our Chief Financial Officer; and Raghu Belur, Chief Products Officer.\nAfter the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2025. During this conference call, Enphase management will make forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements related to our expected future financial performance, market trends, the capabilities of our technology and products and the benefits to homeowners and installers, our operations, including manufacturing, customer service and supply and demand, anticipated growth in existing and new markets, the timing of new product introductions and regulatory tax tariffs and supply chain matters. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties and our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from these expectations.\nFor a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please see our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Qs filed with the SEC.

Badri?\n\nBadrinarayanan Kothandaraman\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nGood afternoon, and thanks for joining us today to discuss our second quarter 2025 financial results. We reported quarterly revenue of $363.2 million, shipped 1.53 million microinverters and 190.9 megawatt hours of batteries and generated free cash flow of $18.4 million. Our Q2 revenue included $40.4 million of safe harbor revenue.\nAs we exited Q2, our battery channel inventory was normal, while our microinverter channel inventory was slightly elevated. For the second quarter, we delivered 49% gross margin, 21% operating expenses and 27% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis and including the net IRA benefit. Mandy will go into our financials later in the call. Our global customer service NPS was 79% in Q2 compared to 77% in Q1. The average call wait time decreased to 1.8 minutes, largely due to staffing and continued investment in automation.\nLet's cover operations. Our global capacity is around 7 million microinverters per quarter with $5 million in the U.S. In Q2, we shipped approximately 1.41 million microinverters from our U.S. contract manufacturers booking 45x production tax credits. Our domestically produced microinverters helped residential lease PPA providers and commercial asset owners to qualify for the 10% domestic content ITC added. We expect to ship approximately 1.2 million microinverters from the U.S. in Q3.\nWe grew our domestic battery production in Q2, shipping 46.9 megawatt hours compared to 44.1 megawatt hours in Q1. We are building the IQ Battery 5P in the U.S. using domestically manufactured microinverters, thermal and battery management systems as well as packaging, while sourcing cell packs from China. These batteries with greater than 45% domestic content once again, can help our leads and PPA customers qualify for ITC bonuses.\nWe remain on track to have non-China cells by the end of this year, scaling into battery builds during the first half of 2026. Our U.S.-made batteries with non-China cells can help customers qualify for domestic content ITC bonuses and meet foreign entity of concern or compliance as the criteria become increasingly stringent every year.\nLet's cover tariffs. In Q2, we observed a 2% gross margin impact due to tariffs. The originally proposed 145% tariff on Chinese products was ultimately reduced to 30% in May. As a result, our expected 6% to 8% margin headwind in Q3 has improved to an estimated 3% to 5% even after accounting for new tariff increases on several non-China countries which are going to be effective August 1. This progress is a direct result of our team's relentless execution in diversifying our supply chain. We are not only mitigating tariff risks, we are future-proofing our operations and positioning Enphase to lead under tightening SIOC-compliant rules.\nLet's cover the regions. Our U.S. and international revenue mix for Q2 was 75% and 25%, respectively. In the U.S., our revenue increased 3% in Q2 compared to Q1, primarily due to higher seasonal demand, partially offset by lower safe harbor revenue of $40.4 million compared to $54 million in Q1. The overall sell-through of our products was up 17% in Q2 as compared to Q1.\nLet me make some brief comments on the market. The U.S. solar market is showing signs of improvement with rising battery attach rates and seasonal demand contributing to increased momentum. While we haven't yet seen a material rush related to the expiring 25D homeowner tax credit, we expect our genes to build later in the year as more consumers move to secure the credit.\nAs we head into 2026, the U.S. solar industry must evolve rapidly in response to the recent tax reconciliation bill. First, we expect an accelerated shift towards leases and PPA anchored by the 48 e-tax credit through 2027. Second, batteries will become central to every solar sale propelled by declining installation cost, long-term credit tax credit support through 2033 and growing hormonal demand for energy resilience and participation in VPPs.\nThird, the industry must drive down customer acquisition and selling costs to remain competitive in a maturing market. We believe these structural shifts coupled with the escalating utility rates and increasing grid instability creates a tailwind for sustained demand in the residential solar plus storage. Enphase is executing a multi-pronged strategy to lead the industry through these transitions. We are partnering closely with third-party owners or PPOs to design innovative financing structures that maximize tax credit capture under the new rules. Our goal is to expand lease financing availability across a much wider installer base, including smaller and midsized players.\nBy removing friction in financing and by broadening access, we aim to accelerate residential solar adoption and ensure that more homeowners can participate in the clean energy transition.\nOur battery technology road map has been advancing rapidly with the laser focus on driving down installation costs and unlocking scale. In June, we began shipping our fourth-generation battery systems in the U.S., cutting back up costs by several thousand dollars. Our fifth generation battery is already under development and is expected to deliver a 50% increase in energy density and a major cost reduction, pushing the boundaries of performance and affordability.\nWhen paired with our next-generation IQ9 microinverters, which are launching later this year, we expect to deliver one of the most compelling and integrated solar plus battery solutions in the industry designed to meet the needs of both homeowners and installers at scale.\nFinally, we are doubling down on our installer services platform to aggressively reduce soft costs across the industry. With solar graph, our all-in-one design and proposal platform solar lead factory, a performance-driven lead generation engine, an Enphase care, our 24/7 expert-backed homeowner support program, we offer a unique integrated tool kit to streamline operations, cut acquisition costs and boost installer productivity. We believe these assets position Enphase not just as a technology provider, but as a full stack partner to help the industry scale more efficiently. We are executing with urgency and look forward to sharing the progress in quarters ahead.\nIn Europe, our revenue increased 11% in Q2 compared to Q1, while our overall sell-through increased by 5%. The overall business environment across the region is still challenging, but we are maintaining our discipline on controlling the channels as well as expanding our served available market by introducing new products.\nI'll now provide some additional color on our key markets in Europe, the Netherlands, France, Germany and U.K. In the Netherlands, demand remained soft in Q2, as the market transitions from a solar -- from solar-only systems to integrated solar plus battery solutions. This shift is accelerating due to rising export penalties and the planned sunset of net metering at the end of 2026. We are uniquely positioned to lead in this evolving landscape with an installed base of approximately 500,000 residential solar system -- solar systems.\nAs net metering phases out in the Netherlands, we believe homeowners will increasingly turn into batteries, not only to maximize self-consumption and backup power, but also to participate in VPP programs that offer new value streams in retail energy markets. This transition can unlock a compelling $2 billion market and represents a strategic opportunity for us to deepen our utility partnerships, scale battery deployments and drive growth across the region.\nIn France, the market remained subdued in Q2, as expected, with the industry anticipating a significant reduction in VAT on solar systems, which is set to take effect in October. This policy change is expected to reignite demand. Despite the current slowdown, France remains very critical for us, driven by our strong brand, technology leadership and the country's relatively low solar penetration. We are seeing a very meaningful uptick in battery demand spurred by low feed-in tariffs that makes self-consumption far more valuable. Our IQ Battery 5P with full backup capability has been well received by both homeowners and installers.\nIn May, we introduced intelligent hot water heater steering to further boost self-consumption and savings. This feature is expected to become a key driver in the French market, where heating water represents a substantial portion of household energy use. With these building blocks in place, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the next wave of growth in solar plus battery adoption in France.\nIn Germany, we are ramping sales of our IQ battery 5P with Flex pace and IQEV chargers 2, both of which are gaining strong momentum with homeowners seeking all-in-one solutions. We also launched our IQ Balcony solar systems in Q2, unlocking a fast-growing market segment for renters and apartment dwellers. These innovations, combined with our deep partnership with some of the top installers are helping us return to growth and expand our presence in a strategically important market.\nThe U.K. market continues to perform well for us. as we strengthen our relationships with retail energy providers in the region and our robust API platform is proving invaluable and supporting them. We are shipping our IQEV charger to into the market and plan to also introduce backup capability for our batteries in Q3 of this year, further expanding our energy resilience offering in the region.\nIn Australia, momentum is building with the July 1 rebate from the government fueling strong interest in battery. We are gearing up to launch our IQ Battery 5P with flex space in the country, imminently, delivering powerful 3-phase backup and flexible power in order to meet dynamic DSO requirements.\nOur IQ8P microinverters are also set to launch soon, supporting the latest high-power solar modules in both residential and commercial markets. We have also introduced our next-generation IQEV chargers expanding our electrification offering. To simplify retrofit installations, we are enabling compatibility between IQ 7 and IQ8 microinverters on the same branch circuit, improving installer productivity and accelerating adoption.\nLet's turn to our Q3 guidance. We expect revenue to be in the range of $330 million to $370 million. We anticipate continued growth in the U.S. and seasonal softness in Europe. We had approximately 75% booked to the midpoint of our revenue guidance. For IQ batteries, we expect to ship between 190- and 210-megawatt hours during the quarter. We are actively engaged with several KPO partners who are awaiting further clarity on safe harbor rules following the recent executive order, and we remain well positioned to support them once they finalize their plans.\nLet's talk about new products, starting with IQ Batteries. In June, we began shipping our fourth-generation battery systems to the U.S. The new battery delivers 30% more energy density, occupies 62% lesser wall space and reduces installation costs. Our IQ Meter Collar simplifies whole home backup by integrating MID functionality, while the new combiner unifies the connection of solar, batteries, EV charging and load control into a single enclosure. Together, these innovations simplify backup installation, improve reliability and deliver superior homeowner value. The meter color is now approved by 29 U.S. utilities and growing. And as I noted earlier, we believe our aggressive battery road map beyond the fourth generation will continue to push boundaries on performance, integration and cost.\nOur IQ batteries are built for more than just backup, they are designed to earn. With advanced APIs, our batteries can seamlessly integrate into BPPs in regulated markets like the U.S. and participate in wholesale energy markets in deregulated regions such as Europe and Australia. Together, we are actively engaged in over 50 VPP programs worldwide, with 210-megawatt hours of Enphase batteries in role, unlocking new revenue streams for homeowners and accelerating the transition to a more flexible, resilient grid.\nLet's talk about microinverters. Our IQ8 microinverter family is now deployed in 58 countries and growing. Building on the global momentum, we are preparing to launch IQ9, our most advanced microinverter yet. Powered by cutting-edge gallium nitride technology, IQ9 is built for the future, supporting higher DC input currents, higher ACE voltages and 3-phase compatibility. With 427-watt peak output, IQ9 is optimized for bearing with the most powerful residential and commercial panels on the market.\nInternal pilots are already running at Enphase facilities, and we remain on track for full scale production in Q4. We believe IQ9 marks a major leap in performance and platform flexibility and importantly, unlocks a 2 gigawatt market opportunity by enabling us to serve 480-volt 3-phase commercial systems in the U.S. for the first time.\nOur commercial IQ 8P, 3P microinverters is building momentum with over 850 commercial sites deployed across the U.S. averaging 35-kilowatt per system and earning consistent positive feedback from the field. These 2 8 3-phase microinverters now ship with U.S. domestic content, enabling the customers to benefit from the 10% ITC bonus at a significant edge for commercial asset owners.\nBoth IQ8P, 3P and IQ9 microinverters are expected to meet FIA compliance, offering a powerful alternative in a market still dominated by Chinese equipment. The timing of IQ9 launch is strategic delivering a high-quality, reliable and policy aligned solution as the industry pivots towards a domestically compliant infrastructure.\nLet me come to balcony solar. Our IQ balcony solar product is now shipping into Germany and Belgium with additional launches planned across Europe, Japan, India and Utah in the next few quarters. Built on Enphase is AC architecture, it enables homeowners to plug in anywhere between 1 and 4 panels directly into a standard wall outlet. No permits, no reboring and no complexity. A standout feature, a sunlight backup, which allows critical appliances to stay powered during daytime outages, even without a battery, an industry first that sets us apart.\nOn the portable power front, the IQ Powerpack 1500 marks our entry into the direct-to-consumer energy We expect to scale -- significantly scaled e-commerce sales as the category opens a new channel for customer engagement and brand growth. In parallel, we plan to expand the IQ Powerpack family into new regions, including Europe, India and Japan, while broadening use cases to address a wide spectrum of mobile energy needs.\nLet's talk about EV charging. We are now shipping our next-generation IQEV chargers to into 18 countries across Europe as well as Australia and New Zealand. This charger is designed to integrate seamlessly with Enphase solar and battery systems while also performing as a high-quality stand-alone solution. We recently earned EV Ready certification in France, one of the countries most rigorous standards, demonstrating our commitment to safety and performance. Over the coming months, we plan to expand availability into more European countries as well as Brazil, India and introducing it back in the U.S., supporting the global shift to electrification with a trusted proven solution.\nLet me now share an update on our IQ bidirectional EV charger, which is expected to launch in middle of 2026. This 11-kilowatt solution is powered by 3 high-performance microinverters built on a full GaN architecture, delivering exceptional efficiency and compact designs. Held with the IQ meter color in the U.S., it enables seamless vehicle to home and vehicle to grid functionality with automatic black start. Together, they offer one of the lowest cost and simplest ways to provide whole home backup even without solar or stationary batteries. Homeowners can just start with an EV, our bidirectional charger and the meter caller and then later can add solar or Enphase batteries depending on their preferences and energy goals.\nBuilt to ISO-15118-20 standard and currently undergoing testing with multiple global OEMs, we believe this platform has the potential to redefine energy resilience by turning the EV into a flexible grid aware energy asset for the home.\nLet's talk about solar graph. Our all-in-one platform purpose-built for installers. We are rolling out major enhancements, including seamless integration with our top TPO partners, powercell custom tariff builder, advanced dealer management tools and a dramatically simplified AI-driven design experience. Every upgrade is designed to make solar graft more intuitive, intelligent and more indispensable. As it continues to evolve, solar graft is becoming a strategic growth engine for us, empowering installers to sell faster, design smarter and scale with confidence.\nThe signing of the tax reconciliation build marks a turning point for the U.S. solar industry, but adapting to change is core to Enphase's BMA. Over the past several years, we have evolved from a single microinverter product company into a global energy technology leader. Today, we offer a full portfolio of micro inverters, batteries, EV chargers and intelligent home energy management software. Our systems are deployed in more than 160 countries with over 4.9 million Enphase powered homes worldwide.\nWe are entering new consumer markets with products like balcony solar and portable energy systems. And with our upcoming IQ9 microinverters, we expect to unlock the 480-volt commercial solar market in the U.S. which is a major expansion of our addressable market and a key step into larger scale energy applications. We believe we are strongly positioned to lead through the next phase of industry transformation. Our product road map is accelerating with next-generation microinverters and batteries focusing on lowering installation costs and simplifying installations. We are doubling down on our installer services platform to help drive soft costs and expand lease financing access across the industry. The long-term fundamentals are distributed energy remain powerful, rising demand higher utility rates and growing homeowner interest in resilience and energy independence. As the market shifts, we will keep doing what we do best, innovating with purpose, moving fast and staying relentlessly focused on our customers.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Mandy for her review of our financial results.

We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release furnished with the SEC on Form 8-K which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nNow I'd like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Badri?\n\nBadrinarayanan Kothandaraman\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nGood afternoon, and thanks for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter 2024 financial results. We reported quarterly revenue of $382.7 million, shipped approximately 2 million microinverters and 152-megawatt hours of batteries and generated free cash flow of $159 million. Our overall channel inventory remained normal as we exited the fourth quarter. For Q4, we delivered 53% gross margin, 22% operating expenses and 31% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis, including the net IRA benefit. Mandy will cover the financials later in the call.\nLet's cover customer service. Our worldwide Net Promoter Score was 78% in Q4, the same compared to Q3. Our average call wait time decreased to 2.8 minutes from 4.4 minutes. We are working to further reduce wait times by leveraging AI and rolling out software fixes.\nLet's talk about operations. Our global capacity is around 7.25 million microinverters per quarter with $5 million in the U.S. In Q4, we shipped approximately 1.7 million microinverters from our U.S. contract manufacturing facilities, booking 45x production tax credits. We also introduced a higher domestic content skew for two of our products, the IQ8X microinverter and the IQ8P commercial microinverters in Q4 to help the commercial asset owners qualify for a 10% domestic content IT [ fee error ]. We now offer higher domestic content microinverters that cover both residential and commercial solar applications and continue to see good demand for these products from lease, PPA and commercial markets. We expect to ship 1.2 million units, microinverters from our U.S. contract manufacturing facilities in Q1. We also began shipping the IQ Battery 5B, our third-generation battery system from our U.S. contract manufacturing facilities during Q4, utilizing domestically made micro inverters, battery management systems and enclosures while sourcing cell packs from China. We shipped 6.7 megawatt hours of batteries from our Texas contract manufacturing facility in Q4. We continue to evolve our sourcing strategy to maximize domestic content opportunities and diversify our geographic exposure.\nLet's cover the regions. Our U.S. and international revenue mix for Q4 was 79% and 21%, respectively. In the U.S., our revenue increased 6% in Q4 compared to Q3, driven by 11% increase in microinverter sales. This increase was due to strong demand for our higher domestic content microinverters. Our battery [ fields ] were down 8% in Q4 compared to Q3 due to lesser channel restocking as we had previously anticipated. Our overall sell-through of -- products was flat in Q4 compared to Q3.\nWe are generally seeing stable demand in the U.S., both in California as well as outside of California. NEM 3.0 currently represents 66% of our installs in California with a 45% attach rate for our own bat. The adoption of batteries is steadily increasing across the U.S. due to new tariff structures like [ Mentry, VPP ] programs and the need for resilience.\nIn Europe, our revenue was down 25% in Q4 compared to Q3, while our overall sell-through declined by 13%. The overall business environment across the region is still challenging, but we are maintaining discipline on controlling the channel and expanding our served available market by introducing new products. I'll provide some additional color on key markets in Europe, the Netherlands, followed by France, Germany and the U.K.\nIn the Netherlands, demand remains weak but has stabilized. The market is transitioning away from solar-only systems to solar plus batteries, which avoids export penalties and allows participation of residential solar plus battery systems in energy markets. We announced new collaborations with two retail energy providers during Q4 that enabled homeowner access to dynamic tariffs and participation in the imbalanced markets, both of which can improve payback to better than 6 years even without net metering. We expect to announce more partnerships with Dutch energy providers in the future. and see gradual improvement in this market as we progress through 2025. We also started shipping our new IQ EV chargers into Netherlands in the fourth quarter.\nIn France, the market is slowing down due to the recent utility rate cuts. France remains a key long-term growth market for us, given our leadership and low solar penetration. We started shipping our IQ EV chargers into France in the fourth quarter. We plan to introduce hot water heater compatibility in Q2, enabling homeowners to do heating with excess solar car green heating. We also plan to introduce backup capability for our batteries, further enhancing resilience for homeowners. As the feed-in tariffs in France gradually reduce the value of solar plus batteries along with home energy management continues to rise.\nIn Germany, we are excited about a few new products that will expand our reach. In early January, we started shipping the IQ Battery 5P with FlexPhase, a new product to customers in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The early feedback has been very positive, and we see an opportunity to increase share in the region now that we have 3 phase backup capability. We also recently started shipping our new IQ EV chargers into Germany. In addition, we expect to introduce our IQ balcony solar solution in Q2. We believe Enphase microinverters are ideal for small systems, and this product is expected to increase our served available market in Germany by approximately 400 megawatts per year.\nA bright spot for us is the U.K., where we are growing steadily. We recently announced that our systems are integrated into Octopus Energy smart import and export tariffs, such as the Intelligent Octopus Flux that is designed to optimize the charging and discharging of solar plus battery systems aiming to provide customers the best rates for buying and selling electricity. We expect to start shipping our new IQ EV chargers into the U.K. shortly in Q1.\nWe are still underpenetrated in many countries in Europe, including the U.K., Italy, Spain, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Austria and Poland. While each country faces its own unique challenges and opportunities. homeowners are prioritizing safety, reliability, quality, savings and an all-in-one app experience for their home energy system, which aligns well with our core strengths. We plan to introduce our entire suite of products, the IQ8 microinverters, both single and 3-phase batteries with backup, the new IQ EV chargers and the AI-powered home energy management software, along with the solar graph installer platform across a lot more European countries throughout 2025.\nWe continue to make incremental progress in other regions. In India, our IQ8P and IQ8HC. These are the high-powered microinverters. Those sales continue to ramp, and we began shipping the IQ Battery 5P in December. We also recently started shipping the high-powered IQ microinverters into Vietnam and Malaysia, further expanding into Southeast Asia. Additionally, we are building momentum in Thailand and Philippines, steadily ramping up businesses in these growing markets as demand for high-quality, reliable energy solution continues to rise.\nLet's cover Japan. We are especially excited about Japan's 1.3 gigawatt solar market, where we recently began piloting installations and plan to ship IQ microinverters in Q2. The Tokyo metropolitan government subsidies for [ MLPE ] make the market even more attractive for consumers. Japan solar landscape aligns well with small systems, 2 to 3 kilowatts complex roofs, strong demand for quality. These are all well aligned with our strengths.\nLet's come to Q1 guidance. We are guiding revenue in the range of $340 million to $380 million. We anticipate recognizing approximately $50 million in safe harbor revenue in Q1, partially offsetting seasonality. We define safe harbor revenues any sales made to customers who plan to install the inventory over more than one year. We are approximately 85% booked to the midpoint of our overall revenue guidance. We expect to ship between 150 and 170-megawatt hours of IQ batteries, slightly higher than Q4.\nBefore we talk about new products, let's discuss the growing importance of energy market participation in many markets worldwide. REPs are regional energy providers and VPP programs are offering homeowners attractive ROI by utilizing their solar plus battery systems to buy and sell energy. We believe Enphase Energy Systems offer best-in-class reliability, customer support and API integration, which are important for REPs and VPP programs. We look forward to sharing with you our progress in these markets as we go through 2025.\nLet's cover new products starting with IQ batteries. As I said before, our third-generation battery continues to gain traction in the U.S. as well as worldwide. In the U.S., we introduced two key system enhancements to improve flexibility and reduce costs. The first is Busbar power control software which allows homeowners to install larger solar and battery systems without costly main panel upgrades. The second is power control software for NEM expansion, enabling homeowners in California to expand legacy NEM systems without any penalty. These advancements provide homeowners with increasing flexibility and cost savings and are being well received by installers.\nWe are making excellent progress with our fourth generation IQ battery, which offers 60% less wall space. thanks to its integrated battery management and power conversion architecture. The battery pairs with our IQ Meter Collar and new enhanced combiner reducing installed costs by approximately $300 per kilowatt hour for a typical backup system, making us highly competitive across all use cases. We have achieved [ UL ] compliance for the Meter Collar, and we are now working on getting approval from the California utilities. We expect to pilot our fourth-generation battery in the U.S. in the first quarter.\nIQ8P-3P commercial microinverter with its new 3-phase cabling system is ideal for [ 208 word ], small commercial solar installs between 20 and 200 kilowatts. We have over 516 sites in the U.S. with an average size of 40 kilowatts and the feedback so far has been positive. These 3-phase microinverters are now shipping from the U.S. with increased domestic content, offering a 10% ITC added for commercial asset owners, which should drive up demand even further. One more positive thing to note is that our IQ8 residential and commercial microinverters are now in compliance with the Build America Buy America act, BABA.\nLet me provide an update on IQ9, covered by gallium nitride technology. The IQ9 family is built for higher DC input current handling up to 18 amps versus IQ8, which handles up to 14 amps. IQ9 also supports a wide range of AC grid voltages, including 240-volts, 208-volts and 480-volts for both residential and commercial markets, leveraging GaN high-voltage transistors. These microinverters deliver high AC output power of 427 watts and 548 watts at a lower cost. We remain on track to launch IQ9 in the second half of this year for both residential and commercial markets with a significant [ SAM ] expansion driven by compatibility with 480-volts AC commercial systems.\nLet's dive into EV charging. We started shipping our new IQ EV charger across several countries in Europe tapping into a $1.4 billion annual market. The next-generation smart charger is designed to work seamlessly as part of our Enphase Energy system or as a powerful stand-alone charger. Key features of this new IQ EV chargers include dynamic face switching and fine grained current control for efficient green charging, dynamic load balancing, ISO 15118, support for AC bidirectional vehicle expansion and compatibility with MID meter for Germany as well as compatibility with OCPP cloud software 2.01, making it a very comprehensive and future-ready solutions.\nIn Q4, we began shipping the IQ PowerPack 1500 products to customers in the U.S. and Canada. This 1.5 kilowatt hour smart portable energy system incorporates all of Enphase's core technologies of power conversion, battery management and software, you should think about it as Enphase in a box. During the recent LA fires, Enphase donated PowerPack 1500, along with an organization card empowered by [ light ] to support relief efforts with some firefighters who are using them to power their communications gear. We are excited to enter this growing consumer market and plan to expand the PowerPack globally in 2025.\nLet's talk briefly about solar graph, our installer platform. We added a lot of new features to solar graph in 2024 with the ease of doing design as a goal. Solar graph is now available to installers in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Germany, Austria, Netherlands, France with plans to expand into more countries in the coming quarters. Looking ahead, we are working on key enhancements to solar graphs, including auto route detection, ultrafast proposals, UI/UX overhaul and expanded C&I features making solar graph even more powerful and in Q2.\nLet me conclude. We successfully navigated a challenging 2024, generating strong free cash flow and profitable and profitability while bringing down channel inventory to normalized levels. We entered 2025 with a continued focus on operational efficiency product reliability, customer service, product breadth and geographic expansion. We have also doubled down on U.S. manufacturing for micro inverters and batteries, which we believe is good for our customers, economy and for Enphase. There is some uncertainty around government policies for our industry, both in the U.S. and abroad.\nBut one trend is very clear. Centralized grids need more support to keep up with the increased electricity demand. Unsubsidized free markets are increasingly turning to distributed energy systems to help balance the grids through our [ ET ] and VPP programs. We see this trend increasing and getting stronger as we look ahead and believe we are well positioned there. We believe our new products will help drive gradual revenue growth throughout 2025, with safe harbor ordering in the U.S. having the potential to accelerate growth as we progress into the second half of 2025. We remain committed to delivering best-in-class solutions and are energized by the road ahead.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Mandy for her review of our financials. Mandy?\n\nMandy Yang\n\nVP & CFO\n\nThanks, Badri, and good afternoon, everyone. I will provide more details related to our fourth quarter of 2024 financial results as well as our business outlook for the first quarter of 2025. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the IR section of our website.\nTotal revenue for Q4 was $382.7 million. We ship approximately 878-megawatt DCO microinverter and 152.4 megawatt hours of IQ batteries in the quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin for Q4 was 53.2% compared to 48.1% in Q3. [ Gross ] margin was 51.8% for Q4 compared to 46.8% in Q3. [indiscernible] of gross margin without net IRA benefit for Q4 was 39.7% compared to 38.9% in Q3. Data non-GAAP gross margin for Q4 included $51.9 million of net [indiscernible] benefit.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses were $83.3 million for Q4 compared to $81.6 million for Q3. The increase was driven by higher R&D expense related to the launch of multiple new products in the first half of 2025. We continue to invest in new products, customer service and geographic expansion. We implemented a restructuring plan in November 2024 to reduce our operating costs and align our workforce and cost structure with current market conditions. We expect to reduce our non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $75 million to $80 million a quarter by the second quarter of 2025.\nSales operating expenses were $143.5 million for Q4 compared to $128.4 million for Q3. Operating expenses for Q4 included $47.9 million of stock-based compensation expenses, $2.9 million of amortization for acquired intangible assets, and $9.4 million of restructuring and asset impairment charges. On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations for Q4 was $125.9 million, compared to $101.4 million for Q3. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $54.8 million for Q4 compared to $49.8 million for Q3. Our non-GAAP basis net income for Q4 was $125.9 million compared to $88.4 million for Q3. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $0.94 for Q4 compared to $0.65 for Q3.\nG&A income for Q4 was $62.2 million compared to $45.8 million for Q3. This resulted in GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.45 for Q4 compared to $0.33 for Q3. We exited Q4 with a total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities balance of $1.72 billion compared to $1.77 billion at the end of Q3. As our 2025 convert is coming due in March this quarter. We plan to use our existing cash to pay off the entire principal balance of approximately $102 million.\nAs part of our $1 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in July 2023, we repurchased 2,883,438 shares of our common stock in Q4 at an average price of $69.25 per share or a total of approximately $199.7 million. We have a remaining $398 million authorized for further share repurchases. In addition, we spent approximately $5 million by withholding [ shares ] to cover taxes or employees start vesting in options in Q4 that reduced the diluted shares by 68,532 shares. Respect to continuing this anti-dilution point.\nIn Q4, we generated $167.3 million in cash flow from operations and $159.2 million in free cash flow including approximately $110 million of customer prepayments. CEO expenditure was $8.1 million for Q4 compared to $8.5 million for Q3. We expected our capital expenditure to stay within $50 million in 2025.\nNow let's discuss our outlook for the first quarter of 2025. We expect our revenue for Q1 to be within a range of $340 million to $380 million, which includes shipments of 150 to 170-megawatt hour of IQ batteries. In December 2024, we signed a safe harbor sales agreement for a total amount of approximately $95 million to ship in the first half of 2025. As Badri mentioned, we defined safe harbor revenue as any sales made to customers who plan to install the inventory over more than a year.\nThe first quarter of 2025 revenue outlook includes approximately $50 million from the safe harbor sales agreement. Although we received a lump sum of $95 million due to safe harbor for expected shipments in the first half of 2025. Under normal circumstances, this would have been recognized organically over 8 quarters at an average of approximately $12 million per quarter. Going forward, the $12 million should be considered as part of the baseline each quarter to reflect the true run rate of our business. Coming back to Q1 guidance. We expected gross margin to be within a range of 46% to 49%. We spent non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 48% to 51%, with net IRA benefit and 38% to 41% before net IRA benefit. Non-GAAP gross margin excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related amortization. We expect the net IRA benefit to be between $36 million and $39 million, an estimated shipment of 1.2 million units of U.S.-made microinverters in Q1. We spend our GAAP operating expenses to be within the range of $143 million to $147 million, including approximately $52 million estimated for stock-based compensation expense acquisition-related expenses and amortization and restructuring and asset impairment charges. We spent our non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $81 million to $85 million. [indiscernible] our GAAP and non-GAAP annualized effective tax rate, excluding discrete items for 2025 to be at 18%, plus or minus 1% with IRA benefit.\nIn closing, we managed well with our financial discipline through a difficult global environment in 2024. We maintained profitability and strong gross margins. In addition, we generated approximately $480.1 million of free cash flow in 2024 and exited the year with $1.72 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities while repurchasing 4.5 million shares of our common stock for approximately $391.4 million.\nWith that, I will open the line for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Zach Freedman. Please go ahead.\n\nZachary Freedman\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Enphase Energy's second quarter 2024 results. On today's call are Badri Kothandaraman, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Mandy Yang, our Chief Financial Officer; and Raghu Belur, our Chief Products Officer. After the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its second quarter ended June 3, 2024.\nDuring this conference call, Enphase management will make forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, statements related to our expected future financial performance, market trends, the capabilities of our technology and products and the benefits to homeowners and installers; our operations, including manufacturing, customer service and supply and demand; anticipated growth in existing and new markets; the timing of new product introductions; and regulatory and tax matters. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties and our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from these expectations. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please see our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Qs filed with the SEC.\nWe caution you not to place any undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertakes no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes in expectations. Also, please note that financial measures used on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release furnished with the SEC on Form 8-K, which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nNow I'd like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Badri?\n\nBadrinarayanan Kothandaraman\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nGood afternoon, and thanks for joining us today to discuss our second quarter 2024 results. We reported quarterly revenue of $303.5 million, shipped approximately 1.4 million microinverters and 120-megawatt hours of batteries and generated free cash flow of $117.4 million. The end market demand for our products was approximately $396 million in Q2, and we reduced our channel inventory by approximately $92 million. Our overall channel inventory returned to normal levels as we exited Q2.\nFor the second quarter, we delivered 47% gross margin, 27% operating expenses and 20% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis and including the net IRA benefit. Mandy will go into our financials later in the call. Let's discuss how we are servicing customers. Our worldwide NPS was 79% in Q2, up from 78% in Q1. Our average call wait time was 2.5 minutes in Q2 compared to 1.9 minutes in Q1. We have several AI and machine learning initiatives to drive automation and further reduce wait times.\nLet's talk about operations. Our global capacity is around 7.25 million microinverters per quarter, 5 million units of those are in the U.S. In Q2, we shipped approximately 574,000 microinverters from our U.S. contract manufacturing facilities that we booked for 45X production tax credits. We expect to ship approximately 1.1 million microinverters from our U.S. facilities in Q3. Our U.S.-made IQ8 microinverters can help lease PPA and commercial asset owners qualify for the 10% domestic content ITC adder. I'll discuss more on this later in the call. For batteries, our cell pack suppliers in China have sufficient capacity to support our ramp-up in 2024. We also plan to manufacture batteries in the U.S. starting in Q4 with power conversion, battery management and enclosures made domestically while using cell packs from China.\nLet's go to the regions. Our U.S. and international revenue mix for Q2 was 65% and 35%, respectively. For more visibility into our business, we are providing regional breakdown and sell-through dollar metrics for Q2. With our channel normalized, we will not provide -- we will not be providing detailed sell-through statistics going forward. In the U.S., our revenue increased 32% compared to Q1. The overall sell-through of our products in the U.S. was up 8% in Q2 compared to Q1. Let's discuss the market trends in the U.S., split by non-California states and California. For non-California states, our overall sell-through was up 7% in Q2 compared to Q1. The sell-through for microinverters was up 6% and the sell-through for batteries was up 10%.\nIn California, our overall sell-through was up 7% in Q2 compared to Q1, indicating that our California business has stabilized. The sell-through of our microinverters was flat, and the sell-through of our batteries was up 14% in Q2 due to the high NEM 3.0 battery attach rates. I'll provide more statistics on NEM 3 later in the call. In Europe, our revenue was flat in Q2 compared to Q1. The overall sell-through of our products in Europe was up 3% in Q2 compared to Q1. The sell-through of our micro inverters was flat and the sell-through of our batteries was up 18% in Q2. I'll provide color on some key markets in Europe, the Netherlands, France and Germany.\nIn the Netherlands, our overall sell-through was down 15% in Q2 compared to Q1. The country's solar demand continues to be challenged by regulatory uncertainty. However, we are beginning to see battery demand pick up. This is a trend we expect to continue, especially as dynamic electricity rates become more prevalent in Netherlands. We launched our IQ Energy Management software in Netherlands during Q2, that will allow our installers to offer Enphase system that can deliver healthy payback even without NEM. The modularity of our batteries allows homeowners to start either with a 3.5 or a 5-kilowatt hour battery along with their solar systems, making the economics work well. In France, the overall sell-through in Q2 was flat compared to Q1. We recently launched our third-generation battery in France and expect that solar plus storage system will become increasingly important for this market as the spread between retail electricity rates and feed-in tariff wide. We expect to introduce IQ EV chargers and IQ Energy Management software in France later in the year. In Germany, our overall sell-through in Q2 was up 7% compared to Q1, building on the growth we reported in the previous earnings call.\nIn June, at Intersolar Munich, we unveiled some exciting products, our 3-phase battery backup solution for Germany, Austria and Switzerland that will increase our served available market. In addition, we showcased our IQ Balcony solar kit, which will also increase our served, available market in Germany by approximately 400 megawatts a year. We believe Enphase microinverters was our ideal for these small systems, and we plan to roll out the balcony solutions throughout Europe in the coming quarters.\nA general comment about Europe. We are still underpenetrated in markets like the U.K., Italy, Spain, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Austria, Sweden and more. Each country has its own challenges and opportunities, but homeowners increasingly seek safety, high quality, savings and an all-in 1 app experience from their home energy system, which aligns well with our strengths. We plan to introduce our entire product portfolio, IQ microinverters, batteries, IQ EV chargers, IQ Energy management software and the solar graph installer platform across more European countries and scale our sales and support accordingly.\nLet's come to Asia. we Are making incremental progress in Asia. Our revenue in India, although small, has doubled from a year ago with introduction of IQ8 family of microinverters. We are gaining solid traction in Thailand and Philippines, where quality and safety are highly valued. In Brazil, we have a good team in place. We work with approximately 600 long tail installers through the help of some good distribution partners. We are currently shipping our 480-watt IQ8P microinverters into these emerging residential markets to support newer, high-power panels.\nIn Australia, there is interest in our Enphase Energy system powered by IQ microinverters and the third-generation battery. We introduced this product approximately a year ago. Later this year, we will be introducing more products into Australia, including the IQ8X microinverters for higher DC input voltage panels and grid-type battery. Let me come to NEM 3 and provide some statistics there. As I said before, the end customer demand in California for us has stabilized in the second quarter. As of last week, 60% of our California installations were NEM 3.0. These systems have a high battery attach rate, over 90% compared to NIM 2.0 systems, which have an attach rate of 15%.\nOur data also shows that half of our NEM 3 systems are using Enphase batteries, consistent with what I have reported in the last few earnings calls. Taking this data into account our average revenue per NEM 3.0 system is approximately 1.5x the average NEM 2.0 system. We believe this will contribute to stabilizing our California revenue in the back half of the year. Let me say a few words about market share. In the U.S., our microinverters and batteries have stable market share according to both internal and third-party data. As batteries become more common in California, there is some interest in a centralized inverter sale. Our success continues to be driven by our unique AC-coupled architecture, which offers significant advantages over legacy string inverter systems in terms of performance, reliability and safety. We strongly believe in this value proposition.\nOur system will become even easier and faster to install for backup applications with further improvements we are making to our balancer system. They include our IQ Meter Collar, our fourth generation 10-kilowatt hour battery and the enhanced IQ combiner which are all expected to be available in early 2025. Additionally, we believe our AI-based software is essential for helping homeowners maximize savings with a complex tariff structure like NEM 3.0. Let's come to our Q3 guidance. We are guiding revenue in the range of $370 million to $410 million. We expect to ship between 160- and 180-megawatt hours of IQ batteries. We anticipate incremental improvement in our U.S. business and a seasonal slowdown in Europe.\nWe are over 85% booked to our -- to the midpoint of our overall revenue guidance. This is the healthiest backlog position we have had in the last year. Let's talk about new products. Starting with IQ batteries. Our third generation IQ batteries has been well received, and we have almost converted to the third-generation battery right now. It offers an industry-leading, 15-year warranty, differentiated quality, serviceability, modularity and power capability. We have expanded the IQ Battery 5P, our third-generation battery into more countries in North America and Europe. We recently started shipping to customers in Canada, Mexico, France, Netherlands and Luxembourg. We plan to pilot our full generation battery in the U.S. later in the year and begin production in early 2025.\nThis new battery will feature a better cost structure and a smaller form factor, thanks to its integrated battery management and power conversion architecture. Additionally, the meter collar and the enhanced IQ Combiner will be introduced along with the fourth generation battery to reduce our balancer system cost. As previously mentioned, we have expanded into many new markets with the IQ8 family of microinverters and are now present in 43 countries. We plan to enter many more new countries by the end of the year.\nWe aim to further increase our served available market by simplifying installations of small solar systems and social housing and rolling out balcony solar solutions to more European countries, starting with Germany. The other variant of IQ8P microinverter with a new 3-phase cabling system is well suited for small commercial solar installation ranging from 20 to 200 kilowatts. We launched this product in North America in December last year, and have installed over 200 sites with an average of 45 kilowatts of solar per site. The feedback of this product has been quite positive, and we expect the growth to accelerate in the coming quarters.\nWe recently began shipping IQ8P commercial microinverters from our contract manufacturing facility in Texas. We are now producing both residential and commercial microinverters from our U.S. manufacturing facility. Some of our U.S.-made microinverter SKUs, which when paired with select U.S. made solar racking equipment can allow lease PPA and commercial asset owners to qualify for the domestic content bonus credit. This credit is valuable for customers at 10% of the overall project cost. We think this will be a good opportunity for us on both microinverters and batteries. Let me provide an update on IQ9 microinverters with gallium nitride. The IQ9 family will support higher DC input currents up to 18 Amperes and higher AC grid voltages, including 480 volts for the small commercial market, which is a brand-new market for us. Using gallium nitride high-voltage transistors, these microinverters will deliver higher output power at lower cost.\nWe are on track to launch this product in 2025. Let's discuss EV charging. We showcased our upcoming EV chargers for Europe at Intersolar Munich in June. The charger offers a 22-kilowatt 3-phase option and 11-kilowatt single-phase option. It integrates seamlessly with Enphase solar and batteries allowing homeowners to optimize cost by using excess solar energy. Green charging or charging from solar is what is called. Other key features include dynamic phase switching from single Phase to three-phase and vice versa and a [indiscernible] meter for a few countries. ISO 15118, support to the top to the car, OCPP-cloud Software and 1 ampere fine-grained current control to maximize green charging. We plan to introduce this charger in many European countries later in the year. Additionally, we recently launched our most powerful CS-100 EV charger for commercial fleet electric vehicles in the U.S. Our team is developing a bidirectional EV charger that will enable lead V2H and V2G capabilities as part of the Enphase system. The charger will feature modular GaN-based bidirectional inverters providing up to 11 kilowatts for single phase applications and 22 kilowatts for three-phase applications. The charger will be compatible with both 400 volts and 800 volt electric vehicles. We are targeting to release this product in late 2025.\nLet's now cover our IQ Energy management software. Our software is rapidly evolving to handle the growing complexity of energy markets by using AI and ML for forecasting and optimization. We train our AI models with data from over 4 million systems. In Q2, we launched our latest software in Netherlands and Belgium to manage dynamic electricity rates, helping homeowners maximize ROI and reduce payback periods as electricity prices fluctuate hourly. We see AI as a crucial technology to scale and enhance our products and services.\nLet's discuss our installer platform. We recently introduced Solargraf, our design, proposal and permitting software platform to the Netherlands. With built-in support for dynamic electricity rates, Solargraf software delivers the financial calculations that address the complexities of energy markets in the Netherlands. Solargraf is also available to residential and commercial installers in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Germany and Austria, and we expect to release it to many countries in the coming quarters. Let me conclude. We remain dedicated to delivering best-in-class home energy systems with a strong focus on innovation, quality and customer experience.\nOver the last year, we have significantly expanded our global reach and have an exciting pipeline of new products set to launch worldwide in the coming years. We have successfully normalized our channel inventory by the end of Q2. Our customer demand has increased by 5% in Q2 as compared to Q1. Our battery business is also doing very well with growth from quarter to quarter. Our bookings in Q3 are the healthiest that they have been in a year. Our early commitment to U.S. manufacturing is positioning us well with leased PPA and commercial asset owners. We also expect the Fed to lower interest rates later in the year, improving solar economics for the U.S. consumers. Our efforts to capture market share in Europe and other international regions are also promising. Despite continued macroeconomic challenges, we are confident in our revenue recovery and remain bullish about our long-term growth prospects.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Mandy for the review of our finances. Mandy?\n\nMandy Yang\n\nVP & CFO\n\nThanks, Badri, and good afternoon, everyone. I will provide more details related to our second quarter of 2024 financial results as well as our business outlook for the third quarter of 2024. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the IR section of our slide. Total revenue for Q2 was $303.5 million, we shipped approximately 608.3 megawatts DC microinverters and 120.2 megawatt hours of IQ batteries in the quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin for Q2 was 47.1% compared to 46.2% in Q1. GAAP gross margin was 45.2% for Q2. Non-GAAP gross margin without net IRA benefit for Q2 was 41%, flat from Q1. Non-GAAP gross margin for Q2 included $18.4 million of net IRA benefit.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses were $81.7 million for Q2 compared to $82.6 million for Q1. We continue to invest in new products, customer service and sales. Operating expenses were $135.4 million for Q2 compared to $144.6 million for Q1. [ GAAP ] operating expenses for Q2 included $49 million of stock-based compensation expenses, $3.5 million of amortization for acquired intangible assets and $1.2 million of restructuring asset impairment charges. On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations for Q2 was $61.1 million compared to $39 million for Q1. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $1.8 million for Q2 compared to a loss of $29.1 million for Q1.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q2 was $58.8 million compared to $48 million for Q1. This resulted in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.43 for Q2 compared to $0.35 for Q1. GAAP net income for Q2 was $10.8 million compared to GAAP net loss of $16.1 million for Q1. This resulted in GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.08 for Q2 compared to GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.12 for Q1. We exited Q2 with a total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of $1.65 billion compared to $1.63 billion at the end of Q1.\nAs part of our [ $1 billion ] share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in July 2023, we repurchased 891,896 shares of our common stock at an average price of $112.02 per share or a total of approximately $100 million. We had $648.1 million remaining for further share repurchases. In addition, we spent approximately $7.5 million by withholding shares to cover taxes for employee stock vesting and options in Q2 that reduced the diluted shares by 66,126 shares. We expect to continue this anti-dilution plan. In Q2, we generated $127 million in cash flow from operations and $117.4 million in free cash flow due to our strong working capital management.\nCapital expenditure was $9.6 million for Q2 compared to $7.4 million for Q1. Capital expenditure increased due to an increase in our U.S. manufacturing spending. Now let's discuss our outlook for the third quarter of 2024. We expect our revenue for Q3 to be within the range of $370 million to $410 million, which includes shipments of 160 to 180-megawatt hours of IQ batteries. We expect GAAP gross margin to be within the range of 45% to 48%. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be within the range of 47% to 50% with net IRA benefit and 39% to 42% before net IRA benefit.\nNon-GAAP gross margin excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related amortization. We expect the net IRA benefit to be between $30 million and $33 million, on estimated shipment of 1.1 million units of U.S. made microinverters in Q3. We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $138 million to $142 million, including approximately $59 million estimated for stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related amortization and restructuring. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be within the range of $79 million to $83 million. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP annualized effective tax rate, excluding discrete items for 2024 to be at 18% plus or minus 1% with net IRA benefit. With that, I'll open the line for questions."

Now I would like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Badri?\n\nBadrinarayanan Kothandaraman\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter 2024 financial results. We reported quarterly revenue of $263.3 million, shipped approximately 1.4 million microinverters and 75.5 megawatt hours of batteries and generated free cash flow of $41.8 million. We reduced our channel inventory by approximately $113 million in Q1, slightly less than anticipated because of softer demand.\nFor the first quarter, we delivered 46% gross margin, 31% operating expenses and 15% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis, including the IRA benefit. Mandy will go into our financials later in the call. Let's now discuss how we are servicing customers. Our worldwide NPS was 78% in Q1 compared to 77% in Q4. Our average call wait time was 1.9 minutes in Q1 compared to 1 minute in Q4.\nWe are adding data scientists, enhancing our analytics to identify problems proactively and fixing them automatically through software. Our field engineers and technicians are assisting installers and complex installations, while bringing back learning to our development teams, enabling continuous improvement. Let's cover operations.\nWe shipped approximately 506,000 microinverters in Q1 from our U.S. contract manufacturing facilities that qualified for 45X production tax credits. Once fully ramped, we expect to have a global capacity of approximately 7.25 million microinverters per quarter, of which 5 million capacity will be in the U.S. We expect to ship approximately 0.5 million microinverters to customers from our U.S. manufacturing facilities in Q2.\nThe number is a little less than what we would like, but our top priority is to reduce our factory inventory. We anticipate resuming a higher level of shipments in the second half of the year. For IQ Batteries, we have 2 cell pack suppliers, both in China, which have sufficient manufacturing capacity to support our ramp in 2024. As previously discussed, we expect to add battery manufacturing capability in the U.S. during the third quarter of 2024.\nLet's now cover the regions. Our U.S. and international revenue mix for Q1 was 57% and 43%, respectively. For more visibility into our business, we are providing regional breakdowns and sell-through dollar metrics by region. In the U.S., our revenue decreased 34% sequentially as we undershipped to end customer demand. The overall sell-through of our microinverters and batteries in the U.S. was down 23% in Q1 compared to Q4.\nLet's discuss the market trends we are seeing in the U.S. split by non-California states and California. For non-California states, our overall sell-through was 21% down in Q1 compared to Q4. The sell-through was similarly down for both microinverters and batteries due to seasonality. In California, our overall sell-through was down 30% -- down by 30% in Q1 compared to Q4. The sell-through of our microinverters was down 37%, and sell-through of our batteries was down 18% in Q1 due to seasonality and the NEM 3.0 transition. I'll provide more statistics and color on NEM 3.0 3 later in the call.\nIn Europe, our revenue increased 70% sequentially as channel inventory improved and we introduced new products. The overall sell-through of our microinverters and batteries was up 7% in Q1 compared to Q4. The sell-through of our microinverters was up 3%, while the sell-through of our batteries was up 28% in Q1. I'll provide some color on key markets in Europe, particularly Netherlands, France and Germany.\nIn the Netherlands, our overall sell-through in Q1 was down 4% compared to Q4. The market stabilized during Q1, and we are encouraged by the demand signals we see after seeing the government's decision to support NEM for the foreseeable future. We expect to see the sell-through of microinverters pick up in Q2 as a result of this decision. We continue to believe solar plus batteries are going to become the norm as dynamic tariffs and grid services become more prevalent.\nIn France, our overall sell-through in Q1 was up 13% compared to Q4. We have been encouraged by the continued strength in this market, supported by higher utility rates. Solar penetration in France is still small, and we see potential for the country to grow and evolve into a significant solar plus battery market for Enphase.\nIn Germany, our overall sell-through in Q1 was up 28% compared to Q4. We are going from strength to strength in this market. We plan to launch our 3-phase battery solution in the country later this year, along with additional software. We are leveraging AI and ML to enhance our home energy management software and expand grid services participation.\nWe are continuing to launch our IQ8 Microinverters and IQ Batteries into many new countries across Europe. Notably, we started shipping IQ Batteries into Italy in the first quarter. Our sell-through in the new countries is beginning to ramp, and we anticipate steady growth throughout 2024. In Australia, our Enphase Energy Systems are powered by IQ8 Microinverters and IQ Battery 5P, a third-generation battery, which we introduced in June last year. We expect higher battery attachment rates in Australia during the second half of this year.\nIn Brazil, we are making good progress in building our installer base. In Mexico and India, we are shipping our highest powered microinverters, IQ8P, to support high-power panels. We just started shipping the same microinverters into Thailand and Philippines in Q1. As a reminder, IQ8P is a high-power microinverter at 480 watts AC for both residential and commercial applications.\nLet me say a few words about our market share. In the U.S., we see a stable share for our microinverters and batteries based on both internal and third-party data. There have been several changes in the market over the last year, including a shift away from loans and towards lease and PPAs. Our continued strong market share is a testament towards our installer relationships and the differentiated value proposition we provide them with our products. We are fully focused on enhancing our product portfolio, solving installer pain points and deepening our relationships. In Europe, we are using the same strategy to grow market share.\nLet me provide some color on NEM 3.0. In the last 3 to 4 weeks, I've been on the road, we have visited over 25 installers in California to really understand how their businesses are doing. Many reported that their businesses are down by 50% or more from last year's high and they have all adjusted by becoming much leaner. They are getting better at selling NEM 3.0. They can clearly articulate what works and what doesn't. They are hungry for high-quality leads.\nThey're also becoming adept at selling batteries, either a grid-type battery or a backup battery with every install. They are becoming flexible in the financing options they offer to the homeowners. If the loans don't work, they aren't to switch over to leases or PPAs, which are becoming increasingly available to the long date. Most of them reported stronger sales in March of this year compared to January and February.\nI came away feeling that we are beginning to climb out at the bottom, and we should get back to growth shortly. Let's cover some NEM 3.0 statistics, which haven't changed that much from our last call. In Q1, 50% of our California installs were NEM 3.0 systems. These systems have a very high battery attach rate over 90% compared to NEM 2.0 systems, which have an attach rate of 15%. Our data also shows that half of our NEM 3.0 systems are using Enphase batteries.\nTaking this data into account, our average revenue per NEM 3.0 system is approximately 1.5x our average NEM 2.0 system. We believe this will contribute to stabilizing and increasing our California revenue in the second half. Let's come to our Q2 guidance. We are guiding revenue in the range of $290 million to $330 million. We expect to ship 100- to 120-megawatt hours of IQ Batteries. We expect sell-through demand of our products to be approximately $400 million in Q2, up from $376 million in Q1 due to seasonal strength in Europe and non-California states, offset by some decline in California.\nWe plan to undership to the end market demand for our products by approximately $90 million in Q2. We expect the channel to normalize by the end of Q2 on microinverters as we previously forecasted. Our channel is almost normal on batteries already. Let's talk about products, starting with IQ Battery. Our third-generation battery calls IQ Battery 5P has been very well received. It delivers the best power specs and commissioning times of any Enphase battery till date as an industry-leading 15-year warranty.\nBattery adoption rates are on the rise globally, and we are well positioned to grow our sales in 2024. As we discussed last quarter, we expect our gross margins on batteries to continuously improve throughout the year. There are 3 factors: cell pack costs, which are coming down rapidly; battery microinverter costs, which are coming down due to IRA benefit from manufacturing in the U.S.; and costs coming down due to improved architecture on our fourth-generation battery.\nWe're already seeing the benefits of the first two factors, and we will benefit from the third factor early next year. We are working on entering more countries in Europe and Asia with our third-generation battery. We expect to also introduce our new 3-phase battery with backup for Germany during this year. We expect to launch several balance of system improvement initiatives for the U.S. that will improve the cost of installing batteries for backup.\nWe plan to pilot our fourth-generation battery later in the year. This battery will have a great cost structure and an elegant form factor due to the integrated battery management and power conversion architecture. As previously discussed, we have entered many new markets with the IQ8 family of microinverters and we are now in 24 countries. We plan to enter more new countries in Europe and Asia throughout 2024 with our microinverters. And we plan to increase our served available market further by introducing social housing and balcony solar solutions to European countries during the year.\nWe recently launched the IQ Combiner light in Netherlands to simplify the installation of small solar systems on social housing units. The other variant of the IQ8P Microinverter with the new 3-phase cabling system is well suited for small commercial solar installs ranging from 20 to 200 kilowatts. We launched this product in North America in December, and we are seeing good early adoption. We are excited about the product and look forward to manufacturing IQ8P Microinverters at our U.S. facilities starting this quarter, further reducing costs.\nLet's cover EV charging. We launched our IQ smart TV charges in the U.S. and Canada in Q4. We are developing smart TV chargers for European countries, and we expect to introduce them this year. The team is also working on bidirectional EV charger, which will unlock use cases like V2G and V2H as part of the Enphase System. This charge will have a GaN-based bidirectional inverter. We expect to release the product in 2025.\nLet's cover the latest upgrades to our energy management software. We recently did a press release where we launched Enphase Power Control, or PCS, software that can integrate with our systems in North America. PCS dynamically controls the power produced by the Enphase System, giving installers a lot of flexibility and system design to build larger systems and avoid costly main panel upgrades while meeting utility and national electric code requirements.\nOur software is evolving to manage the increased complexity in the energy markets by leveraging AI and ML for forecasting and optimization. Our next software offering will manage dynamic tariffs in countries like Netherlands and Germany. This new software is intended to help maximize ROI and reduce the payback period for solar homeowners throughout Europe, where electricity prices can change by the hour.\nLet me provide you with an update on IQ9 Microinverters with gallium nitride or we also call GaN. We expect IQ9 microinverters to deliver higher power at lower costs. Multiple vendors have been providing us with GaN parts, and we are increasingly confident in the reliability of our design. We expect to launch the product in the first half of 2025 to address the two markets: one is residential and the other is 3-phase small commercial markets, both the 208 watts as well as the 480 watts.\nLet's now discuss our installer platform. We announced some key features and improvements to Solargraf in Q1, including advanced 3D designed with smart design capability, California NEM 3.0 support and enhancements and verification of shading and support for small commercial projects. Solargraf is currently available to installers in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Germany and Austria, and we expect to release it to more countries in the coming quarters.\nLet me conclude. We have been managing through a period of slowdown in demand. We believe Q1 was the bottom quarter. Europe has already begun to recover, and we expect the non-California states to bounce back in Q2. California is becoming less of a wildcard, and we expect demand to stabilize and increase in the back half of 2024. We are bullish about NEM 3.0 in the long term. The payback is attractive for solar plus batteries. The utility rates are going up steeply and the sales teams are learning rapidly.\nI am pleased that we have executed well through the market downturn over the last year. We have maintained profitability and free cash flow throughout this period while correcting the channel. We have not sacrificed any new product development or geographic expansion plans and are now entering a growth cycle with a good product portfolio and a growing and there is still a lot more to come.\nWe expect to begin field testing our microinverters, IQ9 Microinverters and fourth-generation batteries later in the year. We are making balance of system improvements to enable faster and easier battery installation. We plan to roll out significant software upgrades like PCS and dynamic tariffs in both the U.S. and Europe. We remain laser focused on operational excellence, concentrating on sell-through and installer count, reducing operating expenses and product costs and maintaining healthy gross margin as our company returns to strong growth. With that, I will turn the call over to Mandy for a review of our financial results. Mandy?\n\nMandy Yang\n\nVP & CFO\n\nThanks, Badri, and good afternoon, everyone. I will provide more details related to our first quarter of 2024 financial results as well as our business outlook for the second quarter of 2024. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the IR section of our website.\nTotal revenue for Q1 was $263.3 million. We shipped approximately 603.6 megawatts DC of microinverters and 75.5 megawatt hours of IQ Batteries in the quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin for Q1 was 46.2% compared to 50.3% in Q4. The decrease was primarily driven by lower net IRA benefit. GAAP gross margin was 43.9% for Q1. Non-GAAP gross margin without net IRA benefit for Q1 was 41% compared to 41.8% in Q4, mainly driven by lower volume.\nGiven non-GAAP gross margin for Q1 included $13.7 million of net IRA benefit. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $82.6 million for Q1 compared to $86.6 million for Q4. The decrease was the result of the restructuring plan we implemented in December 2023. GAAP operating expenses were $144.6 million for Q1 compared to $156.9 million for Q4. GAAP operating expenses for Q1 included $56.7 million of stock-based compensation expenses, $3.5 million of amortization for acquired intangible assets and $1.9 million of restructuring and asset impairment charges.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, income from operations for Q1 was $39 million compared to $65.6 million for Q4. On a GAAP basis, loss from operations was $29.1 million for Q1 compared to a loss of $10.2 million for Q4. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q1 was $48 million compared to $73.5 million for Q4. This resulted in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.35 for Q1 compared to $0.54 for Q4.\nGAAP net loss for Q1 was $16.1 million compared to GAAP net income of $20.9 million for Q4. This resulted in GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.12 for Q1 compared to GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.15 for Q4. We exited Q1 with a total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of $1.63 billion compared to $1.7 billion at the end of Q4. As part of our $1 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in July 2023, we repurchased 332,735 shares of our common stock at an average price of $126.21 per share for a total of approximately $42 million in Q1.\nIn addition, we spent approximately $60 million by reporting shares to cover taxes for employees stock vesting and options in Q1. That reduced the diluted shares by 480,735 shares. We expected to continue this anti-dilution plan. In Q1, we generated $49.2 million in cash flow from operations and $41.8 million in free cash flow. Despite the macroeconomic challenges, we continue to generate free cash flow. Capital expenditure was $7.4 million for Q1 compared to $20.1 million for Q4. Capital expenditure requirements decreased due to a reduction in our U.S. manufacturing spending.\nNow let's discuss our outlook for the second quarter of 2024. We expect our revenue for Q2 to be within a range of $290 million to $330 million, which includes shipments of 100- to 120-megawatt hours of IQ Batteries. We expect GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 42% to 45%. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 44% to 47% with net IRA benefit and 39% to 42% before net IRA benefit. Non-GAAP gross margin excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related amortization. We expect the net IRA benefit to be between $14 million and $17 million on estimated shipments of 500,000 units of U.S. microinverters in Q2.\nWe expect to increase the U.S. main microinverter shipments to 2/3 of our overall microinverter shipments in the second half of this year. We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within the range of $134 million to $138 million, including approximately $56 million estimated for stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related amortization and restructuring and asset impairment charges. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be within the range of $78 million to $82 million. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP annualized effective tax rate, excluding discrete items for 2024, to be at 18%, plus or minus 1% with IRA benefit.\nWith that, I will open the line for questions."

[Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Zach Freedman. Please go ahead.\n\nZachary Freedman\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Enphase Energy's Fourth Quarter 2023 Results. On today's call are Badri Kothandaraman, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Mandy Yang, our Chief Financial Officer; and Raghu Belur, our Chief Products Officer.\nAfter the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023. During this conference call, Enphase management will make forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements related to our expected future financial performance, market trends, the capabilities of our technology and products and the benefits to homeowners and installers, our operations, including manufacturing, customer service and supply and demand. Anticipated growth in existing and new markets, the timing of new product introductions and regulatory and tax matters. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties and our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from these expectations.\nFor a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please see our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Qs filed with the SEC. We caution you not to place any undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertake no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes in expectations.\nAlso, please note that financial measures used on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release furnished with the SEC on Form 8-K can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nNow I'd like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Badri?\n\nBadrinarayanan Kothandaraman\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nGood afternoon, and thanks for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter 2023 financial results. We reported quarterly revenue of $302.6 million, shipped approximately 1.6 million microinverters and 80.7 megawatt hours of battery and generated free cash flow of $15.4 million. On our last earnings call, we said we would reduce channel inventory by approximately $150 million. We achieved a reduction of $147 million in Q4.\nFor the fourth quarter, we delivered 50% gross margin, 29% operating expenses and 22% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis and including the IRA benefit. Mandy will go into our financials later in the call.\nLet's now discuss how we are servicing customers. Our worldwide NPS was 77% in Q4, the same as Q3. Our average call wait time was 1 minute compared to 1.3 minutes in Q3. We have made good progress on solving customer issues by focusing on both automation as well as expanding our field service teams globally.\nLet's talk about operations. The overall supply environment for microinverters and batteries is quite stable. Let's come to microinverter. We shipped approximately 913,000 microinverters to customers in Q4 and from our contract manufacturing facilities in the U.S. We announced in December that we are seizing operations at our contract manufacturing locations in Romania and Wisconsin. We will manufacture microinverters in the U.S. with our 2 existing partners in South Carolina and Texas. The equipment currently located in Romania and Wisconsin will be redeployed for use at other facilities. Once our restructuring actions are complete in the first half of the year, we expect to have a global capacity of approximately 7.25 million microinverters per quarter, of which 5 million will be in the U.S.\nWe expect to ship approximately 500,000 microinverters to customers from our U.S. manufacturing facilities in Q1. We expect that our shipments from U.S. facilities will be lower in the first half of the year as we reduce both factory as well as channel inventory. We anticipate a higher level of shipments in the second half of the year. For IQ batteries, we have 2 cell pack suppliers, both in China which have sufficient manufacturing capacity to support our ramp in 2024. In addition, we will have the capability to manufacture IQ batteries in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2024.\nLet's now cover the regions. Our U.S. and international revenue mix for Q4 was 75% and 25%, respectively. For more visibility into our business, we are providing you regional breakdowns and sell-through dollar metrics by region until the channel is healthy. In the U.S., our revenue decreased 35% sequentially as we undershipped to the end customer demand. The overall sell-through of our micro inverters and batteries in the U.S. was down 9% in Q4 compared to Q3.\nLet's discuss market trends we are seeing in the U.S. split by non-California states and California. For non-California states, our overall sell-through was only down 1% in Q4 compared to Q3. The sell-through of our micro industry was flat and the sell-through of our batteries was down 8% in Q4.\nIn California, our overall sell-through was down by 7% in Q4 compared to Q3. The sell-through of our microinverters was down 27% in Q4 primarily due to the NEM [ 3.0 ] transition. However, the sell-through of our batteries increased by 58% in Q4 due to the high attach rate of NEM 3.0 systems as expected. As we discussed on our last earnings call, it will take a few quarters for our installers to fully transition on NEM 3.0and normalized sales. I'll provide more statistics on NEM 3.0 later in the call.\nIn Europe, our revenue decreased 70% sequentially as we undership to the end customer demand. The overall sell-through of our microinverters and batteries in Europe was down 20% in Q4 compared to Q3. The sell-through of our microinverters was down 23%, and sell-through of batteries was down 2% in Q4 compared to Q3. I'll provide some color on our key markets in Europe, Netherlands, France and Germany.\nIn Netherlands, our overall sell-through in Q4 was down 37% compared to Q3. Customers are fearing and export penalty for solar, and there is confusion about the ending of net metering. We kicked off the new year with the solar next event in Netherlands, where we hosted 800-plus installers across the country, promoting a comprehensive solution with solar plus batteries and energy management software that will unlock the full potential of the Dutch energy market. We believe solar plus batteries are going to become the norm as dynamic tariffs and grid services become more prevalent. We are already seeing a steady ramp in batteries in the region and expect the trend to accelerate in 2024.\nIn France, our overall sell-through in Q4 was only down 1% compared to Q3. We see a lot of potential for this market to grow and evolve into a solar plus battery market as utility rates have moved higher and are expected to [ move ] even more in 2024.\nIn Germany, our overall sell-through in Q4 was down 32% compared to Q3. However, we saw sequential growth in activations for both [ microinverters ] and batteries as we continue to gain traction in the region.\nWe are introducing products into more countries in Europe. In the last few months, we have entered U.K. Sweden, Denmark, Greece, Switzerland, Austria, Italy and Belgium markets with our IQ8 microinverters and IQ betters. In Australia, we are seeing growth for our Enphase Energy systems powered by IQ8, microinverters and IQ Battery 5P [ R ] or latest third-generation battery, which we introduced in June of 2023.\nIn Brazil, our sell-through is stabilizing nicely as we focus on building the installed base. In India, we are starting to ship our IQ8HC and IQ8P microinverters to support high-power panels. In Mexico, we just recently started shipping IQ8P microinverters for residential applications. As a reminder, IQ8P is our highest power microinverter at 480 watts AC for both residential and commercial applications.\nLet me say a few words about our U.S. market share. We see stable share for our microinverters and batteries based on both internal as well as third-party data. We have a large and diverse customer base. Our value proposition is to provide installers the easiest installation process with high quality and best-in-class service. We also have tools like solar graph, design, proposal and permitting software and lead generation through solar lead factory at our disposal to help our in-stores. As a result, our partnerships go even deeper during downturn.\nLet's cover some NEM 3.0 statistics in California. Third-party data shows that the battery attach rate for NEM 3.0 systems is over 80%. Based on our system activations in January last month, approximately have our solar installations in California where NEM 3.0. Of our NEM 3.0 solar in stations, about half of them use Enphase batteries. Our revenue per NEM 3.0 system is approximately 1.5x our average NEM 2.0 system.\nThe transition to NEM 3.0 has been a little slower than what we anticipated. Installers are still in NEM 2.0 systems, and this has caused a delay for some of them to sell NEM 3.0 systems. The ones who started or finding the sales process a little more difficult given the complexity of the tariff structure, the added cost of batteries upfront and high interest rates. One particular challenge we hear is their lack of confidence in the back of the systems they are selling. This is where solar graph software, our design and proposal software with NEM 3.0 support is critical because of its advanced modeling capability.\nIn addition, installers are still coming up the long curve on installing batteries. We are addressing this by making a lot of products improvement for ease of installation commissioning, serviceability and continue to offer in-person training and webinars on solar graph software.\nLet's now come to our Q1 guidance. We are guiding revenue in the range of $260 million to $300 million. We expect the sell-through of our [ props ] to be seasonally down in Q1. We plan to undership to the end market demand for our products by approximate [ $130 million ] in Q1. We are forecasting to undership in Q2 as well, although at a much reduced level, and expect the channel to be normalized by the end of Q2.\nLet's talk about new products, starting with IQ better. Our sell-through for batteries has been increasing steadily over the last few quarters. Our third-generation battery delivers the best power specs and commissioning times of Enphase battery today at a 15-year industry-leading warrant. The battery adoption rates are on the rise globally and we are well positioned to grow our battery sales in 2024. Also, we expect our margins on batteries to get better throughout 2024. There are 3 factors in play here. Sellback costs, which are coming down, microinverter costs, which are coming down for us due to U.S. manufacturing and other cost -- product costs coming down due to improved architecture on our fourth-generation batteries causing lower bill of material. We are working on entering more countries in Europe and Asia with our generation battery. We expect to introduce our new 3-phase battery with backup for Germany during the year. We plan to pilot our fourth-generation battery later in the year. This battery will have a great cost structure and elegant form factor due to the integrated battery management and power conversion architectures.\nAs previously discussed, we have entered many new markets with [ IQ8H ] family of microinverters and are in 21 countries. We plan to enter many more new countries in Europe and Asia throughout 2024 with our microinverters. And we plan to increase our served available market by introducing social housing and balmy solar solutions to European countries during the year.\nLet's also talk about our latest micro inverter for the residential segment. I already mentioned IQ8P, which delivers for 80 watts of AC power, supporting panels up to 650-watt DC. We are currently shipping that product into Brazil, India, South Africa, Mexico and Vietnam. We are on track to ship into France and Spain followed by emerging markets in 2024.\nThe other variant of the IQ8P microinverter with the new 3-phase cabling system is well suited for small commercial solar installations, ranging from 20 to 200 kilowatts. We launched this product in North America in December and are seeing strong early adoption. We are very excited about this product and look forward to manufacturing all the flavors of IQ8P microinverters at our U.S. facilities shortly, further reducing our cost structure.\nLet's discuss EV charging. We shipped over 3,700 chargers in Q4 compared to over 3,500 chargers in Q3. We launched our IQ smart EV chargers Western Canada in Q4. The WiFi-enabled charger is now integrated to the Enphase Energy system. This enables use cases such as self-consumption and green charging and allows homeowners complete visibility into the operation of their system through the app. We are developing IQ smart EV chargers for many countries in Europe as well and expect to introduce them in the year. The team is also working on bidirectional EV charger, which will unlock use cases such as V2G and V2H as part of the Enphase Energy system. The charger will have GaN-based bidirectional inverters, which will interface with EVs, which have high voltage, high DC voltages.\nI've so far discussed our hardware products. Let's cover our energy management software. The importance of this software to deliver a superior customer experience cannot be overstated. The Enphase Energy system is becoming more sophisticated with the addition of solar, batteries, EV chargers, heat pumps, et cetera. [ As the ] utility tariffs, which were once fixed rates are now becoming increasingly complex with [ time of use rates ], NEM 3.0, demand charges, dynamic tariffs and our software is evolving to manage this complexity by leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning for forecasting and optimization. We see this as an area of differentiation for us and are developing core IP work set objective. We expect to release this software beginning in Q2, adding several features throughout the year.\nLet's now discuss our installer platform. We released new features in solar draft during Q4. We introduced electrical design and single-line diagram features while continuing to offer NEM 3.0 functionality for solar and battery systems in California. The software platform is now current -- is now available to installers in U.S., Brazil, Germany and Austria, and we expect to release it to more countries in the coming quarters.\nLet me conclude, we have been managing through a period of slowdown in demand. We think Q1 could be the bottom quarter. Europe is already showing early signs of recovery, and we expect the non-California states to bounce back quickly. California is the exception as NEM 3.0 is having some hiccups in the near term. However, we remain very bullish about 103.0 in the long term. The payback is very attractive for solar plus storage. The utility rates are going up steeply on an annual basis, and Enphase teams are learning fast. We see that the demand is going to eventually bounce back up in California. I'll wrap up outlining our approach during these times. We are laser focused on ease of doing business on both high quality and great customer service. We are doubling down on operational excellence, correcting the channel and factory inventory concentrating on sell-through and installer count reducing our expenses and product costs and maintaining healthy gross margins. We are getting many new products out and diversifying our portfolio rapidly. We are expanding worldwide with full systems comprising of IQ8 microinverters, IQ batteries, EV chargers and energy management software. We are introducing products with the small commercial [ load ] markets worldwide and making continuous enhancements to our installer platform. In addition, we are innovating on GaN-based IQ9 and 10 microinverters, along with bidirectional EV chargers, our fourth and fifth generation IQ battery and AI-based energy management software to position us well for the long term.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Mandy for his review of our financial results. Mandy?\n\nMandy Yang\n\nVP & CFO\n\nThanks, Badri, and good afternoon, everyone. I will provide more details related to our fourth quarter of 2023 financial results as well as our business outlook for the first quarter of 2024. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the IR section of our website.\nTotal revenue for Q4 was $302.6 million. We shipped approximately 660.1-megawatts DC of microinverters and 80.7 megawatt hours of IQ batteries in the quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin for Q4 was 50.3%, a compared to 48.4% in Q3. The increase was driven by increased net IRA benefit. Gross margin was 48.5% for Q4. Non-GAAP gross margin [ without IRA benefit ] for Q4 was 41.8% compared to 45.8% in Q3, a decrease of 400 basis points due to microinverter and storage mix while our average selling prices remained stable.\n[ Our ] Non-GAAP gross margin for Q4 included $25.8 million of benefit for our microinverters made in the U.S. and shipped to customers in the quarter.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses were $86.6 million for Q4 compared to $99 million for Q3. We implemented a restructuring plan in December 2023 to reduce our operating costs and align our workforce and cost structure with current market conditions. As part of the plan, we are reducing our global workforce by approximately 10% and expect to reduce our non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $75 million to $80 million a quarter in 2024 when these restructuring actions are substantially complete within the first half of this year.\n[ GAAP ] operating expenses were $156.9 million for Q4 compared to $144 million for the Q3. [ GAAP ] operating expenses were -- for Q4 included $51.6 million of stock-based compensation expenses, $14.8 million of restructuring and asset impairment charges and $3.9 million of amortization for acquired intangible assets.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, Income from operations for Q4 was $65.6 million compared to $167.6 million for Q3. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was a loss of $10.2 million for Q4 compared to income from operations of $118 million for Q3. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q4 was $73.5 million compared to $141.8 million for Q3. This resulted in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.54 for Q4, compared to $1.02 for Q3.\nSales net income for Q4 was $20.9 million compared to [ the ] net income of $114 million for Q3. This resulted in GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.15 for Q4 compared to $0.80 for Q3. We exited Q4 with a total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities earning of $1.7 billion compared to $1.78 billion at the end of Q3.\nAs part of our $1 billion share repurchase program arrived by our Board of Directors in July 2023, we repurchased approximately 1,183,000 shares of Enphase common stock in Q4 at an average share price of $84.51 for approximately $100 million. In addition, we spent approximately $27.5 million by reporting shares to cover withholding taxes for employees start vesting and options in Q4. that reduced the diluted shares by approximately [ 260,700 ] shares with respect to continue this anti-dilution plant.\nIn Q4, we generated $35.5 million in cash flow from operations and $15.4 million in free cash flow, which included approximately $46 million of income-based payments, an increase of $38 million compared to Q3. Despite the macroeconomic challenges, we continued to generate free cash flow.\nCapital expenditures were $20.1 million for Q4. compared to $23.8 million for Q3. Capital expenditure requirements decreased due to a reduction in our U.S. manufacturing lending.\nNow let's discuss our outlook for the first quarter of 2024. We expect our revenue for Q1 to be within the range of $260 million to $300 million which includes shipments of 70 to 90-megawatt hours of IQ battery. We expect GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 42% to 45%. We said non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 34% to 47% with [ net IRA ] assets and 40% to 43% before net IRA benefit. Non-GAAP gross margin excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related amortization. We expect the net IRA benefit to be between $12 million and $14 million on estimated shipments of 500,000 units of U.S. [ met ] microinverters [ one ].\nWe expect lower microinverter shipments to customers from U.S. manufacturing in the first half of '24 as we continue to reduce inventory in the factory and the channel. We expect to increase the U.S. microinverter shipments to 2/3 of our overall microinverter shipments in the second half of 2024. We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $144 million to $148 million, including approximately $64 million estimated for stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense, amortization and restructuring and impairment charges.\nWe expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $80 million to $84 million. We are reducing our non-GAAP operating expenses by 5% in Q1 as compared to Q4 or we will not compromise on investing in customer service, product innovation and sales.\nMoving to tax. Since we have utilized most of our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards we are now a U.S. cash taxpayer. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP annualized effective tax rate, excluding discrete items for 2024 to be a 20% plus or minus 2% with IRA benefit.\nIn closing, we managed well with our financial discipline through a difficult global environment in 2023. Total revenue decreased year-over-year by 1.7%. Our non-GAAP gross margin expanded to 45.3%, excluding the IRA benefit as compared to 42.6% 2022. -- and our non-GAAP gross margin further increased to 47.1% with a net IRA benefit by manufacturing our microinverters in the U.S. In addition, we generated approximately $586 million of free cash flow in 2023 and exited the year with $1.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities up over $18 million year-over-year, while repurchasing [ 3 million ] shares of our common stock for approximately $410 million.\nWith that, I will open the line for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please also note that this event is being recorded today. I would now like to turn the conference over to Zach Freedman. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nZachary Freedman\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Enphase Energy's third quarter 2023 results. On today's call are Badri Kothandaraman, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Mandy Yang, our Chief Financial Officer; and Raghu Belur, our Chief Products Officer.\nAfter the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2023. During this conference call, Enphase management will make forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements related to our expected future financial performance, market trends, the capabilities of our technology and products and the benefits to homeowners and installers, our operations, including manufacturing, customer service and supply and demand, anticipated growth in existing and new markets, the timing of new product introductions and regulatory and tax matters.\nThese forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties and our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from these expectations. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please see our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Qs filed with the SEC. We caution you not to place any undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertake no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes in expectations.\nAlso, please note that financial measures used on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release furnished with the SEC on Form 8-K, which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Now I'd like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Badri?\n\nBadrinarayanan Kothandaraman\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nGood afternoon, and thanks for joining us today to discuss our third quarter 2023 financial results. We reported quarterly revenue of $551.1 million, shipped approximately 3.9 million microinverters and 86 megawatt hours of batteries and generated free cash flow of $122 million. Approximately 86% of our Q3 microinverter shipments were IQ8. We exited the third quarter at 48% gross margin, 18% operating expense and 30% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis and including the IRA benefit. Mandy will go into our financials later in the call.\nLet's now discuss how we are servicing customers. Our worldwide NPS was 77% in Q3 compared to 74% in Q2. Our NPS in North America was 78% compared to 77% in Q2. Our average call wait time was 1.3 minutes compared to 1.1 minutes in Q2. We made significant progress on root cost fixes of some customer issues and expanded our field service teams globally.\nLet's talk about operations. In general, the overall supply environment for microinverters and batteries is quite stable right now.\nLet's cover microinverters, specifically U.S. manufacturing. We began manufacturing at Salcomp facility in Arlington, Texas during the third quarter. We shipped approximately 531,000 microinverters to customers in Q3 from our 3 contract manufacturers in the U.S.: Flex in South Carolina, Foxconn in Wisconsin and Salcomp in Texas. We expect to ship approximately 1 million microinverters to customers from our U.S. manufacturing facilities in Q4.\nLet's talk about batteries. For IQ batteries, we have 2 cell pack suppliers, both of which are in China. We have a manufacturing capacity of 300-megawatt hours per quarter, positioning us well to ramp up in 2024. We are looking at bringing manufacturing of IQ batteries into the U.S. by the middle of 2024.\nLet's now cover the regions. Our U.S. and international revenue mix for Q3 was 64% and 36%, respectively. In the U.S., our revenue decreased 16% sequentially and 22% year-on-year. The overall sell-through of our microinverters was down 12% in Q3 compared to Q2. On the other hand, the sell-through of our IQ batteries in the U.S. was up by 34% in Q3 compared to Q2. In Europe, our revenue decreased 34% sequentially and increased 26% year-on-year at healthy gross margin. The sell-through of our microinverters in Europe was also down 35% in Q3 compared to Q2. The sell-through of our IQ batteries in Europe was down by 14% in Q3 compared to Q2.\nWe are now shipping IQ microinverters and batteries into many countries in Europe. We recently entered U.K., Sweden, Denmark and Greece markets with both IQ8 microinverters and IQ batteries. Combined, these new markets represent more than 1.5 gigawatts of residential solar opportunity with countries like the U.K. having a healthy battery attached rate of 30%.\nI'll provide some brief commentary on Australia. Our revenue in Australia more than doubled year-on-year. We are quite pleased with the launch of our Enphase Energy system, it is state-of-the-art powered by IQ8 microinverters plus a third-generation battery.\nLet me comment on rest of the world. In Brazil, we launched our IQ8 [ P ] microinverters, 480 watts DC, the highest power microinverters that we have. We also launched the Solargraf software platform and have good feedback from installers there. In addition, we started shipping both the 384-watt IQ8 [ HC ] and the 480 watts IQ8 [ P ] microinverters into India to support high-powered solar panels.\nLet's now talk about Q4 guidance. We are guiding revenue for Q4 in the range of $300 million to $350 million. This reflects approximately $150 million of channel inventory correction in the U.S. and Europe. In other words, we are undershipping to the end market demand for our products by approximately $150 million. We anticipate undershipment will continue in Q1 and expect our channel inventory to normalize in Q2. Of course, we are conservative and assuming the demand picture is unchanged from the current level.\nSo what has changed since 90 days ago when we told you that the inventory levels would normalize by the end of Q3. We have seen a substantial demand reduction in Europe. We've also seen the U.S. market continue to fall, driven by California. When the demand falls, we think more decisive inventory correction becomes necessary. We are being conservative in our assumptions of no demand recovery until Q2 in this framework. So that explains the guidance.\nDespite the large reduction in Q4 guidance, we are maintaining our non-GAAP gross margin above 40% in our guidance without the IRA benefit. We aren't making any broad-based pricing changes at this time on microinverters, and we have already made the necessary changes on batteries before. Our pricing and operations team are doing an excellent job of managing pricing and reducing costs.\nLet's discuss some market trends. I'll give you a little more than usual color on markets. Let's split the U.S. market by non-California states and California. For non-California states, the sell-through of our microinverters was 4% lesser in Q3 compared to Q2. We see this business starting to stabilize, given the weekly sell-through trends.\nIn California, the sell-through of our microinverters was 25% lesser in Q3 compared to Q2 due to the NEM 3.0 transition. It will take a few more quarters for our installers to fully transition to NEM 3.0 and normalized sales to NEM 2.0 levels. Utility rates are continuing to move higher in California with 1 California utility recently requesting a 22% rate hike. Assuming that even half of that rate hike is approved by the CPUC, the payback period for a NEM 3.0 solar plus a battery system will become close to a NEM 2.0 solar-only system. So that's good.\nLet me say a few words about U.S. market share before I give more color on Europe. We see stable share today for our microinverters based on both internal as well as third-party data. Competition is not new for us. We have always relied on our differentiated technology with our distributed AC architecture, product quality and customer service to win share, and we expect this to continue. We have many tools that are disposals such as the installer services that we have bought -- we made several acquisitions over time in the last couple of years such as the software tool for design and proposal, the permitting tools, lead management, et cetera, we have a lot of tools that are disposal to help our installers and our partnerships go a lot deeper in the downturn.\nLet's talk about Europe demand a little bit. We are facing 2 challenges in Europe, and the situation has dramatically changed from the last quarter from 90 days ago. We saw a much weaker demand recovery from summer. We also see a lot of distributors facing oversupply of solar equipment, particularly panels, leading to much more aggressive destocking. Despite this temporary weakness, we think that the pullback in Europe will be temporary as the fundamentals remain strong and we are relatively underpenetrated in the U.S. We are entering a lot of new geographies with our IQ8 microinverters and batteries. So we remain very bullish about Europe.\nLet me spend a few minutes discussing our 3 largest markets in Europe, the Netherlands, France and Germany in detail. In Netherlands, our largest European market, our Q3 sell-through was down 40% compared to Q2. This was our first sequentially down quarter in the last 2 years. Installers tell us that the customers fear of an export penalty and confusion around ending of the net metering has caused the market pull back. I was in Netherlands 2 weeks ago. I visited with our leading installers, I came away confident that this pullback will be short lived. We think that the plan for net metering will be clarified after the country's elections in November. The payback period are continuing to be attractive in Netherlands. In addition, total system solutions, which includes batteries, solar and EV chargers are going to become the norm as dynamic tariffs become more prevalent in Netherlands. We are well positioned to take advantage of these changes.\nIn France, our Q3 sell-through was down 34% compared to Q2, driven by seasonality. We see potential for this market to rebound very quickly. We are already seeing that as utility rates recently moved higher and are expected to increase even more in early 2024.\nIn Germany, our Q3 sell-through was down 32% compared to Q2. We saw strong sequential growth in installer count and activations, and we are continuing to gain traction there.\nLet's talk about our new products, IQ batteries. Our sell-through for batteries has been steadily increasing over the last couple of quarters. We are at an inflection point for our battery business. With our IQ Battery 5P, we can deliver the best power specs and the best commissioning times of any Enphase battery till date at an industry-leading 15-year warranty and at the right price point. The battery adoption rates are on the rise globally. We are well positioned to grow battery sales throughout 2024. And we are working on entering even more countries in Europe and Asia in the next few months with the IQ Battery 5P.\nIn addition, we expect to introduce our fourth generation battery in the middle of 2024. That will have a much reduced form factor and a reduced cost structure. As previously discussed, we have entered many new markets with the IQ 8 family of microinverters. We plan to enter many more new markets in Europe and Asia in the next several months.\nLet's talk about our latest microinverter for the residential segment in emerging markets. I did mention this before. This is the IQ8 [ P ] Microinverter, our highest power microinverter till date, 480 watts of AC power, that can support solar panels up to 650-watt DC for Brazil, India, South Africa, Mexico, Spain and other emerging markets. We have started shipping the product into Brazil, South Africa and India in Q3 and are on track to start shipping in Mexico and Spain in Q4.\nThe other variant of the IQ8 microinverter -- IQ8 [ P ] Microinverter with a new 3-phase cabling system is well suited for small commercial solar installations, ranging from 20 to 200 kilowatts. We are doing beta installations as we speak there, and we expect to release the product this quarter into the U.S. market. We are very bullish about the small commercial solar business where we believe we can add value to our business owners and installers with our quality and good customer experience.\nLet's cover EV charging. We shipped over 3,500 chargers in Q3 compared to over 6,600 chargers in Q2. We launched our IQ smart EV chargers in the U.S. just a few days ago, both U.S. and Canada, actually. The IQ EV charger is Wi-Fi-enabled. It includes smart control and smart monitoring capabilities. It seamlessly integrates into our solar and battery systems to help homeowners maximize savings. For example, by directly charging from solar energy only, that's called green charging.\nWe are also working on developing IQ EV chargers for many countries in Europe, and we expect to introduce them in the middle of 2024.\nLet's now discuss our installer platform briefly. Solargraf, our cloud-based design and proposal software platform now provides NEM 3.0 functionality for solar and battery systems in California. We are now offering 3D and shading features and continue to make progress on our new features and functions. The software platform is now available to installers in U.S., Germany, Austria and Brazil. We expect to make this software release as part of our standard offering to any country that we entered.\nLet me conclude. We are managing through a slowdown in our overall demand. In the U.S., it is due to high interest rates on NEM 3.0. In Europe, it is due to broad macroeconomic conditions. Despite this, we are very bullish about our business long term. We see several positive drivers that will accelerate adoption, such as the 30% ITC tax credit in the U.S., rising utility rates globally, increased grid instability, also globally, climate change and, of course, increasing EV adoption worldwide. We have no doubt that these will drive meaningful solar plus battery growth.\nOur strategy is very clear. We manage for the long term. We are doubling down on our relationships with our customers during these times. We are driving down installation times and investing in our customer service teams. We are also strongly investing in innovation. We are working on IQ9 and IQ10, our next 2 generations of microinverters as well as the next 2 generations of batteries. We are also rapidly expanding worldwide with systems comprising of IQ8 microinverters, IQ batteries, IQ EV chargers and home energy management software. We are introducing products for the small commercial and emerging residential solar markets, and we are making continuous enhancements to our installer platform in addition to driving towards world-class cost on our products.\nWe remain very positive about our future growth and profitability, and we'll continue to make best-in-class home energy systems with a laser focus on innovation, quality and customer experience. With that, I will turn the call over to Mandy for her review of our financial results. Mandy?\n\nMandy Yang\n\nVP & CFO\n\nThanks, Badri, and good afternoon, everyone. I will provide more details related to our third quarter of 2023 financial results as well as our business outlook for the fourth quarter of 2023. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the IR section of our website.\nTotal revenue for Q3 was $551.1 million. We ship approximately 1,585.6 megawatts DC of microinverters and 86.2 megawatt hours of IQ batteries in the quarter.\nNon-GAAP gross margin for Q3 was 48.4% compared to 46.2% in Q2. The increase was driven by increased net IRA benefit. GAAP gross margin was 47.5% for Q3, given non-GAAP gross margin for Q3 included $14.5 million of net IRA benefit for our microinverters made in the U.S. and shipped to customers in the quarter.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses were $99 million for Q3 compared to $98.2 million for Q2. We are diligently managing operating expenses and we'll continue to do so in the coming quarters. GAAP operating expenses were $144 million for Q3, compared to $153 million for Q2. GAAP operating expenses for Q3 included $41.1 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $3.9 million of amortization for acquired intangible assets.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, income from operations for Q3 was $167.6 million, compared to $230.5 million for Q2. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $118 million for Q3 compared to $170.3 million for Q2. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q3 was $141.8 million compared to $205.6 million for Q2. This resulted in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.02 for Q3 compared to $1.47 for Q2. GAAP net income for Q3 was $114 million compared to GAAP net income of $157.2 million for Q2. This resulted in GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.80 for Q3 compared to $1.09 for Q2.\nWe exited Q3 with a total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of $1.78 billion compared to $1.8 billion at the end of Q2. As part of our $1 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in July 2023, we repurchased approximately 847,000 shares of Enphase common stock in Q3 at an average share price of $129.92 for $110 million. In addition, we spent approximately $8.5 million by [ refolding ] shares to cover reporting taxes for employees [indiscernible] in Q3. That reduced the diluted shares by approximately [ 59,800 ] shares. We expect to continue this entire dilution plan.\nIn Q3, we generated $145.9 million in cash flow from operations and $122 million in free cash flow. Despite the macroeconomic challenges, we continue to generate healthy free cash flow as a result of our strong financial discipline. Capital expenditure was $23.8 million for Q3 compared to $44 million for Q2. Capital expenditure requirements decreased as we largely completed building out our U.S. manufacturing line.\nNow let's discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2023. We expected our revenue for Q4 to be within a range of $300 million to $350 million which includes shipments of 80 to 100-megawatt hours of IQ batteries. We expect GAAP gross margin to be within the range of 46% to 49% with net IRA benefit and 38% to 41% before net IRA benefit. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 48% to 51% with net IRA benefit and 40% to 43% before net IRA benefit. Non-GAAP gross margin excludes stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition-related amortization. We expect the net IRA benefit to be between $26 million and $28 million, an estimated shipment of 1 million units of U.S. manufactured microinverters.\nWe expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within the range of $142 million to $146 million, including approximately $57 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $85 million to $89 million. We are reducing our non-GAAP operating expenses by 12% in Q4 as compared to Q3, but we will not compromise our investing in customer service, innovation and sales.\nMoving to tax. Since we have utilized most of our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards, we are now a significant U.S. cash taxpayer. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP annualized effective tax rate for 2023 to be at 22% plus or minus 1% with IRA benefit. We expect the production credit net of any incremental costs for domestic manufacturing to be in the range of $26 to $28 per microinverter sold to customers in Q4. We expect to ship 1 million microinverters to customers this quarter. We now have all 3 of our U.S. manufacturing facilities operational.\nWith that, I will open the line for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Zach Freedman. Please go ahead.\n\nZachary Freedman\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Enphase Energy's second quarter 2023 results. On today's call are Badri Kothandaraman, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Mandy Yang, our Chief Financial Officer; and Raghu Belur, our Chief Products Officer. After the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its second quarter ended June 3, 2023. During this conference call, Enphase management will make forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements related to our expected future financial performance. The capabilities of our technology and products and the benefits to homeowners and installers, our operations, including manufacturing, customer service and supply and demand, anticipated growth in existing and new markets, the timing of new product introductions and regulatory and tax matters.\nThese forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from these expectations. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please see our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Qs filed with the SEC. We caution you not to place any undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertake no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes in expectations. Also, please note that financial measures used on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release furnished with the SEC on Form 8-K, which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nNow I'd like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Badri?\n\nBadrinarayanan Kothandaraman\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter 2023 financial results. We reported quarterly revenue of $711.1 million, shipped approximately 5.2 million microinverters and 82.3-megawatt hours of batteries and generated free cash flow of $225.2 million. Approximately 78% of our Q2 microinverter shipments were IQ8. We exited the second quarter at 46% gross margin, 14% operating expense and 32% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis. Mandy will go into the financials later in the call.\nLet's now discuss how we are servicing customers. Our worldwide NPS was 74% in Q2 compared to 75% in Q1. Our North American NPS was 77%, the same as Q1. Our average call wait time was 1.1 minutes, compared to 1.2 minutes in Q1. We continue to focus on root cost fixes of customer issues and expanded our customer service and field service teams global.\nLet's talk about microinverter manufacturing. Our overall supply environment remains quite stable, and there are no major shortages right now. Let's come to IRA. We expect the IRA to increase the overall solar demand in the U.S. and accelerate domestic production. We are pleased to be part of creating new jobs in the U.S. and advancing the country's clean energy economy. We shipped 50,000 microinverters to customers in Q2 from 2 of our contract manufacturers, Flex in South Carolina and Foxconn in Wisconsin. We are on track to begin with the third contract manufacturer in Q3. We expect to ship approximately 600,000 microinverters to customers in Q3 from our U.S. manufacturing facilities.\nLet's now cover the regions. Our U.S. and international revenue mix for Q2 was 59% and 41%, respectively. Q2 was a record quarter for our international revenue, primarily due to the growth in Europe and Australia. In the U.S., our revenue decreased 12% sequentially and decreased 1% year-on-year. The overall sell-through of our microinverters in the U.S. was up 2% in Q2 compared to Q1.\nIn Europe, our revenue increased 25% sequentially and more than tripled year-on-year at healthy gross margin. Our sell-through of microinverters in Europe was 13% higher in Q2 compared to Q1. We are now shipping IQ8 microinverters into Germany, France, Netherlands, Spain, Portugal and Poland. In addition, we are shipping IQ batteries into Germany, Belgium, France, Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Austria and Switzerland.\nI'll now provide some brief commentary on Australia, Latin America and Brazil. Our revenue in Australia more than doubled year-on-year. We started shipping our new IQ Battery 5P to Australia during the second quarter. In Latin America, we introduced a new battery in Q2, while in Brazil, we introduced our Solargraf software platform, which will help installers with design and proposal for their residential customers.\nLet me provide some additional color on the U.S., followed by Europe. We recognize revenue when we ship product to distributors and large installers. It is therefore relevant to talk about the sell-through trends of our products from our distributors to installers. Since we have a healthy share in the U.S., our statistics are a meaningful representation of business trends. The overall U.S. market is experiencing a broad-based slowdown due to high interest rates. As I said earlier, our Q2 sell-through of microinverters in the U.S. was only up 2% compared to Q1 and only up 2% year-on-year. The second quarter is typically stronger than the first quarter, but that did not happen this year due to the market environment.\nLet's now discuss the market trends we are seeing in the U.S., split by California and rest of the U.S. For non-California states, the Q2 sell-through of microinverters was 6% lesser as compared to Q1 and 11% lesser year-on-year. The sell-through was disproportionately worse in Texas, Florida and Arizona. In these states, the economics of loan financing has worsened due to the combination of rising interest rates and lower utility rates. In California, the Q2 sell-through of microinverters was 20% higher compared to Q1 and 34% higher year-on-year. The higher sell-through was driven by high backlog of NEM 2.0 installation, which is expected to last through this summer. We expect NEM 3.0 will have a greater impact on results beyond Q3, and I will speak more on what we are seeing there later.\nI'd like to provide some more context about our revenue guidance for Q3. Our microinverter sell-through in the U.S. peaked in the fourth quarter of 2022. The sell-through in the first half of 2023, in both Q1 and Q2, was approximately 20% below the fourth quarter due to the high interest rate environment in the U.S. Our sell-in to the channel was only 10% down in the first half of 2023 relative to the fourth quarter. We were expecting a seasonally up Q2 '23, but that didn't materialize. This has increased the inventory in the channel. Plus, we are assuming the same level of uncertainty continues going forward. Therefore, we are taking aggressive and prudent actions in the U.S. to manage down the channel inventory, and this is reflected in our light third quarter guidance.\nLet me say a few words about market share. We see stable high market share today for microinverters based on both internal and third-party data. Competition is not new for us, and we have always relied on our differentiated technology with distributed architecture, product quality and customer service to win share, and we expect to continue doing so. We have many tools at our disposal for installers. And our partnerships go even deeper during the downturn.\nFor storage, we have shipped approximately 1-gigawatt hour of battery systems cumulatively by the end of the second quarter. We continue to manage our storage channel inventory in Q2 and expect further improvement in Q3. As we introduced our third generation IQ Battery 5P to the U.S. market in Q2, we reduced pricing for our second-generation battery. We also expanded the warranty for both batteries to 15 years. We see the new price points and warranty for both batteries, as well as strong early customer adoption of the new battery driving increased sell-in and sell-through during Q3. We believe there will be a bigger inflection for Q4 and beyond as California battery attach rates increase with NEM 3.0.\nBefore moving to Europe, I'd like to speak a little bit about NEM 3.0. Early anecdotes on NEM 3.0 activity from our installers are encouraging. Since the crossover date in April, we have seen an increasing rate of NEM 3.0 California proposal activity with healthy storage attach rates. We offer a comprehensive NEM 3.0 solution, which includes a smart battery, power control system to avoid main panel upgrades and energy management system that maximizes ROI for homeowners. The smart battery can do both backup as well as utility rate arbitrage. Grid-tied batteries require less labor and fewer balance of system components, making them significantly easier and faster to install. Our solar graph design and proposal tool can model the complex interactions between solar, batteries, consumption and tariffs and provide a simple proposal.\nOur financial analysis show that for a [ cash ] system, homeowners can expect a bill offset between 70% and 90% and payback between 5 and 7 years. We think installers can effectively sell these economics to consumers.\nLet's now cover Europe. Our European business remained strong. Q3 is typically down due to summer vacation, but our year-on-year growth trend is very robust. We plan to introduce IQ8 microinverters and batteries into more countries in Europe, such as Sweden, Denmark, Greece, U.K. and Italy later this year. We saw strong broad-based growth across Europe in Q2. Netherlands and France continue to be very strong for us. We are starting to gain real traction in Germany in both residential solar and batteries. The residential solar market in Germany, the biggest in Europe, is roughly 3 gigawatts, and the attach rates for batteries is approximately 80%. We saw strong quarterly sequential growth in installer count, sell-through and activations of both solar and batteries in Germany during Q2.\nDuring Q2, we also launched our IQ Router family of devices, which is part of our Home Energy Management System, in Germany and Austria to enable the integration of select third-party EV chargers and heat pumps into Enphase solar and battery systems. There is a great push towards whole home electrification in Europe, and countries like Germany are leading the way in adopting renewable technologies to support heat pumps, EVs and other home [ nodes. ] Self-consumption is the norm, as consumers want energy independence.\nAs we think about our competitive positioning in Europe, we see increasingly complex power markets and home energy management needs playing right into our strengths. Our complete Home Energy Management System solution delivers use cases like self-consumption and green charging, along with newer software features which we plan to release this year, are key differentiators in addition to our quality and service that will help strengthen our market position.\nLet's cover more new products. We launched our third-generation IQ Battery 5P in Australia, U.S. and Puerto Rico in Q2, with plans to launch in Europe by the end of the year. As I've previously discussed, the battery has a modularity of 5-kilowatt hours and delivers double the continuous power and triple the peak power for the same kilowatt hour compared to our prior generation of batteries. The higher charging and discharging rate of our third-generation battery will be uniquely beneficial for NEM 3.0 systems in California through its ability to generate revenue by exporting into the grid at appropriate time.\nIn addition, our third-generation battery is easy to install and commission with a targeted sub-30 minutes commissioning times. We are excited about the positive feedback we have received from our Australian and U.S. customers. We have now certified over 3,500 installers worldwide to install our IQ batteries.\nLet's now talk about our latest new product for the residential segment in emerging markets. This product, the IQ8P microinverter, will deliver 480 watts of AC power, supporting panels up to 650-watt DC for Brazil, Mexico, India, Spain and other emerging markets. We are on track to release this IQ8P microinverter variant into production later this year. The other variant of the IQ8P microinverter with the new 3-phase cabling system is well suited for small commercial solar installation ranging from 20 kilowatts to 200 kilowatts. These microinverter systems offer the same grid compatibility, high-quality, rapid shutdown capability as our standard residential products. We expect to release this product into the U.S. small commercial solar market later this year.\nIn general, we see the global commercial opportunity as greater than 11 gigawatts. We are extremely bullish about this small commercial solar market, where we believe we can add tremendous value to business owners and installers in Europe and U.S. with our high-quality rapid shutdown capability and micro-grid forming capability of our microinverter systems.\nLet's discuss our U.S. EV chargers. We shipped over 6,600 EV chargers in Q2 compared to 8,600 in Q1. We expect to introduce IQ smart EV chargers in Q3. These smart chargers will have Wi-Fi connectivity, enabling use cases like green charging and allowing homeowners full visibility into operation of the Enphase solar, plus battery, plus EV charger system through the app.\nLet's now discuss the installer platform. We released updates to our Solargraf design and proposal software platform in Q2, including NEM 3.0 functionality. The updated Solargraf platform offers a simplified experience for designing NEM 3.0 systems by optimizing panel placements for both grid-tied as well as grid-agnostic systems, configuring battery sizing by leveraging modularity and enhancing system operations for time-of-use management and energy export to deliver the best possible electricity bill offset and payback.\nLet me conclude. We are managing through a correction in the U.S. solar market after 3 years of phenomenal growth, a period in which the residential solar market doubled and Enphase sales tripled. Even so, residential solar has only achieved 4% to 5% penetration in the U.S. We believe there are several positive long-term drivers which will accelerate adoption, such as the 30% ITC tax credit, the rising utility rates, increased grid instability, climate change and increasing EV adoption. There is no doubt that these will drive meaningful solar plus battery growth over the long term.\nOur strategy is clear and unchanged. We manage for the long term. We will make best-in-class home energy systems with a laser focus on innovation, quality and customer experience. We are doubling down on our relationships with customers. We are driving down installation times and investing in our service teams. We are investing even more on new product innovation. We are expanding our IQ microinverters and battery reach globally, accelerating our business in Europe, introducing IQ8P microinverters for the small commercial solar and emerging residential markets worldwide and making continuous enhancements to our installer platform.\nBefore I turn the call over to Mandy, I'm happy to announce that our Board of Directors has authorized a new share repurchase program. Given our confidence in Enphase's future growth, free cash flow generation and the value we see in our stock, our Board has authorized an additional $1 billion for share repurchases. With that, I will turn the call over to Mandy for her review of our finances. Mandy?\n\nMandy Yang\n\nVP & CFO\n\nThanks, Badri, and good afternoon, everyone. I will provide more details related to our second quarter of 2023 financial results, as well as our business outlook for the third quarter of 2023. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the IR section of our website.\nTotal revenue for Q2 was $711.1 million. We shipped approximately 2,121.3 megawatts DC of microinverters and 82.3 megawatt hours of IQ batteries in the quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin for Q2 was 46.2% compared to 45.7% in Q1. The increase was driven by increased IQ8 product mix and improved logistics. GAAP gross margin was 45.5% for Q2. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin for Q2 included $1.6 million of a net IRA benefit for our microinverters made in the U.S. and shipped to customers in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $98.2 million for Q2 compared to $98.4 million for Q1. GAAP operating expenses were $153 million for Q2 compared to $158.7 million for Q1. GAAP operating expenses for Q2 included $51 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $3.9 million of acquisition-related expenses and amortization for acquired intangible assets and $208,000 of restructuring and asset impairment charges.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, income from operations for Q2 was $230.5 million compared to $233.6 million for Q1. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $170.3 million for Q2 compared to $167.7 million for Q1. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q2 was $205.6 million compared to $192.3 million for Q1. This resulted in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.47 for Q2 compared to $1.37 for Q1. GAAP net income for Q2 was $157.2 million compared to GAAP net income of $146.9 million for Q1. This resulted in GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.09 for Q2 compared to $1.02 for Q1. We exited Q2 with a total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of $1.8 billion compared to $1.78 billion at the end of Q1.\nWe repurchased approximately 1.25 million shares of Enphase common stock in Q2 at an average price of $159.43, for a total of approximately $200 million. This completed our $500 million share repurchase authorization from our Board of Directors.\nAs Badri mentioned, our Board of Directors has authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program. In addition, we spent approximately $12.7 million by withholding shares to cover withholding taxes for employees divesting in Q2. That reduced the diluted shares by approximately 72,000 shares. We expect to continue this anti-dilution point throughout the year.\nIn Q2, we generated [ $269.2 million ] in cash flow from operations and $225.2 million in free cash flow. Capital expenditure was $44 million for Q2 compared to $22.5 million for Q1. The increase was primarily due to investment in U.S. manufacturing and R&D equipment.\nNow let's discuss our outlook for the third quarter of 2023. We expect our revenue for the third quarter of 2023 to be within a range of $550 million to $600 million, which includes shipment of 80- to 100-megawatt hours of IQ batteries. We expect GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 41% to 44% and non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 42% to 45%, which excludes stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition-related amortization. Our gross margin guidance numbers do not include any IRA benefit. We expect net [ IRA ] benefit to be between $14.5 million and $16.5 million on estimated shipments of 600,000 units of U.S.-manufactured microinverters.\nWe expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $159 million to $163 million, including approximately $58 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be within the range of $101 million to $105 million, as we will continue to invest in product innovation, customer service and international growth.\nMoving to tax. Since we have utilized most of our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforward, we are now a significant U.S. cash taxpayer. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP annualized effective tax rate for 2023 to be at 21%, plus or minus 1% with IRA benefit.\nNow I'd like to discuss how the advanced manufacturing production credit from the IRA is reported in our earnings. We had originally thought that the production credit will be reflected in income tax expenses. Based on the latest guidelines from the U.S. Treasury, we expect to claim the production credit by direct pay, and therefore, come for the production credit as a reduction in cost of goods sold. We expect the production credit, net of any incremental costs for domestic manufacturing, to be in the range of $24 to $28 per microinverter sold to customers in Q3. We expect to ship 600,000 microinverters to customers this quarter. We plan to have our U.S. contract manufacturing facilities fully operational by the end of 2023. We estimate shipments to reach our U.S. capacity of 4.5 million microinverters per quarter by the end of 2024, assuming robust demand.\nWith that, I will open the line for questions."

At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Karen Sagot. Ma'am, please go ahead.\n\nKaren Sagot\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's Conference Call to discuss Enphase Energy's First Quarter 2023 Results.\nOn today's call are Badri Kothandaraman, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Mandy Yang, our Chief Financial Officer; and Raghu Belur, our Chief Products Officer. After the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2023.\nDuring this conference call, Enphase management will make forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements related to our expected future financial performance, the capabilities of our technology and products and the benefits to homeowners and installers; our operations, including manufacturing, customer service and supply and demand; anticipated growth in existing and new markets; the timing of new product introductions and regulatory matters.\nThese forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from these expectations. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please see our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Qs filed with the SEC. We caution you not to place any undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertake no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes in expectations.\nAlso, please note that financial measures used on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release furnished with the SEC on Form 8-K and which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nNow I'd like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Badri?\n\nBadrinarayanan Kothandaraman\n\nExecutive Vice President, Data Communications Division, Cypress Semiconductor Corp.\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us today to discuss our Q1 2023 financial results. We had a decent quarter. We reported revenue of $726 million, shipped approximately 4.8 million microinverters and 102-megawatt hours of batteries and generated free cash flow of $223.8 million. Approximately 65% of our Q1 microinverter shipments were IQ8. We exited Q1 at 46% gross margin, 14% operating expense and 32% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis.\nMandy will go into our financials later in the call. Let's now discuss how we are servicing customers. Our Net Promoter Score, worldwide, was 75% in Q1 compared to 71% in Q4. Our North American NPS was 77% compared to 74% in Q4. Our average call wait time was 1.2 minutes compared to 1.6 minutes in Q4. We are focusing on route cost fixes of customer issues and improving our business processes rapidly to enhance customer experience.\nLet's talk about microinverter manufacturing. Our overall supply environment is quite stable. There are no major shortages right now. We began manufacturing at Flex Romania in the first quarter, bringing our quarterly capacity to approximately 6 million microinverters. Our European business is growing rapidly and many customers have asked us for local manufacturing, and we will be able to do that going forward.\nLet's come to U.S. manufacturing. As we discussed last quarter, the IRA, Inflation Reduction Act, will help bring back high-tech manufacturing to the U.S., and stimulate economy through creation of new jobs.\nWe are opening manufacturing lines with 3 different manufacturing partners, adding a capacity of 4.5 million microinverters per quarter, bringing our overall global capacity to 10 million microinverters per quarter as we exit 2023. We expect to begin U.S. manufacturing with one partner in Q2 and with the remaining 2 in Q3. Let's now cover the regions. Our U.S. and international revenue mix for Q1 was 65% and 35%, respectively.\nIn the U.S., our revenue decreased 9% sequentially due to seasonality and macroeconomic conditions and increased 28% year-on-year. The sell-through of our microinverters in Q1 decreased 21% sequentially compared to Q4, worse than the typical seasonality of 15%. Our microinverter channel inventory at the end of Q1 was relatively normal, while the storage channel inventory was a little elevated. I'll go into details later in the call.\nIn Europe, our revenue increased 25% sequentially and more than tripled year-on-year. Our Europe non-GAAP gross margin is quite healthy, over 45%. Another point to note is that the sell-through of our microinverters in Europe reached an all-time high in Q1. We are now shipping IQ microinverters into France, Netherlands, Spain and Portugal. In addition to Germany and Belgium, we just recently started shipping IQ batteries to Netherlands, France, Austria and Switzerland.\nLet me provide some brief comments on Latin America, Australia and Brazil. In Latin America, revenue decreased 2% quarter-on-quarter and increased more than 70% year-on-year. Our revenue in Australia increased 6% quarter-on-quarter, while our revenue in Brazil more than doubled. We are growing very rapidly in Brazil. And given the big market size, we are expanding the team and prioritizing new products.\nLet me provide some additional color on the U.S. followed by Europe. We usually recognize revenue when we ship product to distributors and large installers. Most of our installers buy our products from distributors. It is therefore relevant for us to talk about the sell-through of our products from distributors to installers. Since we have a healthy market share in the U.S., our statistics are a meaningful representation of the business trends.\nAs I said earlier on this call, our sell-through of microinverters in the U.S. was 21% lesser in Q1 compared to Q4. Our sell-through in California was only 9% lesser than Q4. There was some impact due to the weather in early Q1, but the NEM 2.0 rush in Q1 more than compensated for it.\nCalifornia installers took advantage of the NEM 2.0 rush and have built up a solar backlog for the next 3 to 4 months. We believe the installers aren't expanding their crews to accelerate installation, they're laser focused on their cash flow due to the high interest rate environment and are looking clarity -- for -- yes, clarity on the NEM 3.0 demand.\nSell-through of our batteries in California was 23% lesser in Q1 compared to Q4 as installers focused mainly on solar. We expect this trend to continue for the next 3 to 4 months. After that, we see NEM 3.0 as a net positive for California and expect strong demand to resume for solar plus storage. Let's cover the rest of the U.S. The sell-through of microinverters in non-California states was 25% lesser in Q1 compared to Q4.\nWe observed that the sell-through was even lower in states with low utility rates, such as Texas, Florida and Arizona. In these states, the economics of loan financing has worsened due to rising interest rates. The sell-through performance in the Northeast U.S. was a little better. Coming to IQ batteries, the sell-through in non-California states was 28% lesser in Q1 compared to Q4.\nLet's briefly discuss the health of our U.S. customer base and some trends in financing. Our Q1 data shows higher sell-through rates for long tail installers compared to Tier 1 and 2 installers. Our installers, in general, are navigating 3 key challenges: first, the rapid increase in interest rates over last year; second is switch from selling low APR with high dealer fees, the selling market rate loans with low dealer fees; and third, the delayed payment from the loan originators or as the industry calls it reduction of M1 payments.\nLet's discuss about the second and third challenges. We see the move to high APR and low dealer fee loans as a positive for the industry. The demand for market rate loans remained strong. New capital providers who were not able to buy below market rate loans are now offering solar financing. Installers are adjusting their sales practices for a higher interest rate environment.\nWe are also seeing new lease providers entering the market with focus on servicing the long tail. We think capital will be available for both long-tail -- for long-tail installers regardless of the mix of loan and lease. On the reduced M1 payments, loan originators are providing less cash to installers at the time of contract signing and a greater percentage after installation.\nThis creates a working capital challenge for the installers and is forcing them to become more efficient. As the installers adjust to this new reality, we expect the sell-through of microinverters and batteries to incrementally improve in Q2 compared to Q1. Q2 is seasonally stronger and should help the situation even more. Let's come to Europe. Our European business is doing very well. We expect healthy revenue growth in Q2 compared to Q1.\nOur business is growing much faster than the market. We plan to introduce IQ8 microinverters and IQ batteries into many more countries in Europe throughout the year. Our value proposition is our differentiated home energy management systems combined with high quality and great customer experience. We are integrating the products from our latest acquisition, GreenCom Networks into our Enphase Home Energy System, starting in Germany this quarter.\nThis will help network third-party EV chargers and heat pumps with Enphase solar plus storage systems. The benefit to homeowners is reduced electricity bills due to increased self-consumption in addition to having control via the Enphase app. Let's talk about new products. I say internally in the company that 2023 is the year of new products, and it's coming in good time. We are getting ready to launch our third-generation IQ battery in North America and Australia this quarter.\nIn Australia, we will also launch the IQ8 microinverters. As I previously discussed, the IQ Battery has a modularity of 5-kilowatt hours and delivers double the continuous and triple the peak power compared to our prior generation of batteries. The higher charging and discharging rate of our third-generation battery will be uniquely beneficial for NEM 3.0 systems in California through its ability to generate revenue by exporting into the grid at the appropriate time.\nIn addition, our third-generation battery is very easy to install and commission. We are currently piloting these third-generation batteries in Australia and in the U.S. with select installers and are very excited about the experience we are about to deliver to our customers.\nNext, let's talk about our latest new product for the residential segment in emerging markets. This product, the IQ8P microinverter, will deliver 480 watts of AC power, supporting panels up to 650 watts DC for Brazil, Mexico, Spain, India and emerging markets.\nWe are on track to release IQ8P into production in the second half of the year. The other variant of IQ8P microinverter with the new 3-phase cabling system is well suited for small commercial solar installation, ranging from 20 to 200 kilowatts, such as gas stations, schools, hospitals, churches and small business. These microinverter systems offer the same grid compatibility, high quality and rapid shutdown capability as our standard residential products.\nWe expect to release this product into the U.S. small commercial solar market in the second half of 2023. Let's discuss EV chargers. We shipped over 8,600 chargers in Q1 compared to 7,600 charges in Q4. We are now shipping Enphase-branded EV chargers from Flex Mexico, helping us increase capacity and reduce costs. We are on track to introduce IQ smart EV chargers in Q2. These charges will have WiFi connectivity, enabling use cases like green charging and allowing the homeowners visibility into operation of their Enphase solar plus storage plus EV charger system through their app.\nLet's now discuss the installer platforms. We released several updates to our solar graph design and proposal software, including basic NEM 3.0 functionality, battery design, document management and other improvements are requested by installers. We have more than 1,000 installers using this software. NEM 3.0 incentivizes homeowners to use solar and battery systems for avoiding energy imports, while compensating homeowners for exporting energy when the grid needs it.\nThe updated solar graph platform offers a simplified experience for designing a NEM 3.0 system by optimizing panel placements, configuring battery sizing, leveraging its modularity and enhancing system operations for self-consumption and energy export to deliver the best possible payback. We see that solar plus storage under NEM 3.0 can achieve a payback period between 6 and 8 years depending on the utility.\nAs we said before, the higher power of our third-generation battery helps us to export more energy to the grid and maximize savings. Let me conclude. With the residential solar and storage markets growing rapidly in Europe, we are in a great position to significantly accelerate our business. The situation in the U.S. is a little different with NEM 3.0 in California and the macroeconomic challenges in rest of the U.S.\nOur strategy doesn't change. We are focused on working closely with our installers to address their issues, making new products and entering new markets and countries. The fundamentals are intact for our industry. 30% ITC for the next decade, the rising utility rates, the focus on climate change and the desire for resilience are all going to push the need for solar plus storage more than ever before. With our differentiated products, high quality and exceptional customer experience, we are in a strong position to capitalize on this trend.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Mandy for her review of our finances. Mandy?\n\nMandy Yang\n\nVP & CFO, Enphase Energy, Inc.\n\nThanks, Badri, and good afternoon, everyone. I will provide more details related to our first quarter of 2023 financial results as well as our business outlook for the second quarter of 2023. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the IR section of our website.\nTotal revenue for Q1 was $726 million, slightly up from the fourth quarter of 2022. We shipped approximately 1,957 megawatts DC of microinverters and 102-megawatt hours of IQ batteries in the quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin for Q1 was 45.7% compared to 43.8% in Q4. The increase was driven by increased IQ8 product mix and improved logistics. GAAP gross margin was 45% for Q1. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $98.4 million for Q1 compared to $87.7 million for Q4.\nThe increase was driven by international growth and R&D. GAAP operating expenses were $158.7 million for Q1 compared to $153.7 million for Q4. GAAP operating expenses for Q1 included $56 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $3.7 million of acquisition-related expenses and amortization for acquired intangible assets, and $700,000 of restructuring and asset impairment charges. On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations for Q1 was $233.6 million compared to $229.4 million for Q4.\nOn GAAP basis, income from operations was $167.7 million for Q1 compared to $157 million for Q4. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q1 was $192.3 million compared to $212.4 million for Q4. This resulted in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.37 for Q1 compared to $1.51 for Q4. GAAP net income for Q1 was $146.9 million compared to GAAP net income of $153.8 million for Q4. This resulted in GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.02 for Q1 compared to $1.06 for Q4.\nThe decline for both non-GAAP and GAAP net income and earnings per share was driven by our higher effective tax rate as we are now a significant U.S. cash taxpayer. We exited Q1 with a total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of $1.78 billion compared to $1.61 billion at the end of Q4. We did not make any open market share repurchases against our $200 million share repurchase authorization.\nInstead, we spent approximately $72 million to cover withholding taxes for the employees, divesting in Q1, now received the dilutive shares by 338,000 shares. We expect to continue this anti-dilution program throughout the year. In Q1, we generated $246.2 million in cash flow from operations and $223.8 million in free cash flow. Capital expenditure was $22.5 million for Q1 compared to $16.4 million for Q4. The increase was primarily due to investment in R&D equipment and U.S. manufacturing.\nNow let's discuss our outlook for the second quarter of 2023. We expect our revenue for the second quarter of 2023 to be within a range of $700 million to $750 million, which includes shipments of 80 to 100-megawatt hours of IQ batteries. We expect GAAP gross margin to be within the range of 41% to 44% and non-GAAP gross margin to be within the range of 42% to 45%, which includes -- which excludes stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition-related amortization.\nOur guidance numbers do not include any IRA benefit. We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within the range of $155 million to $159 million, including approximately $57 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related expenses and amortization and restructuring charges for site consolidation. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be within the range of $98 million to $102 million. We intend to keep the non-GAAP operating expenses flat in Q2. We will continue investing in product innovation and international growth, while making other areas of the company more efficient.\nMoving to tax. Since we have utilized most of our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforward, we are now a significant U.S. cash taxpayer. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP annualized effective tax rate for 2023 to be at 22%, plus or minus 1%, before any IRA impact.\nNow I'd like to discuss how the advanced manufacturing production credits from the IRA will be reported in our earnings, while waiting on the implementation guidelines from the U.S. Treasury. Based on the current guidelines, the production credit can be claimed as direct pay or in the form of tax credit. Under direct pay, the production credit will be accounted for as a reduction in cost of goods sold. And in tax credit, you would be reported in the tax expense line.\nEither way that will provide us the same dollar impact to our earnings per share as the production credit is nontaxable. We expect the production credit, net of any incremental costs for domestic manufacturing, to be in the range of $20 to $30 per microinverter sold to customers. We expect to ship 50,000 net in USA microinverters to customers this quarter. We plan to have our U.S. contract manufacturing facility to be fully operational by the end of 2023. We estimate shipments to reach our U.S. capacity of 4.5 million microinverters per quarter by the end of 2024, assuming robust demand.\nWith that, I will open the line for questions."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Karen Sagot. Please go ahead.\n\nKaren Sagot\n\nHead Of IR, Enphase Energy, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Enphase Energy's Fourth Quarter 2022 results. On today's call are Badri Kothandaraman, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Mandy Yang, our Chief Financial Officer; and Raghu Belur, our Chief Products Officer.\nAfter the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022. During this conference call, Enphase's management will make forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements related to our expected future financial performance, the capabilities of our technology and products and the benefits to homeowners and installers our operations, including manufacturing, customer service and supply and demand, anticipated growth in existing and new markets, the timing of new product introductions and regulatory matters.\nThese forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties and our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from these expectations.\nFor a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please see our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Qs filed with the SEC. We caution you not to place any undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertakes no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes in expectations.\nAlso, please note that financial measures used on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release furnished with the SEC on Form 8-K and which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Now I'd like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enphase's Energy. Badri?\n\nBadrinarayanan Kothandaraman\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Enphase Energy, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter 2022 financial results. We had a good quarter. We reported record quarterly revenue of $724.7 million, shipped approximately 4.9 million microinverters and 122-megawatt hours of batteries and generated free cash flow of $237.3 million. Approximately 55% of our Q4 microinverter shipments were IQ8. We exited the fourth quarter at 44% gross margin, 12% operating expenses and 32% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis. Mandy will go into our financials later in the call.\nLet's now discuss how we are servicing customers. Our Q4 Net Promoter Score worldwide was 71% compared to 70% in Q3. Our North American Net Promoter Score was 74% compared to 71% in Q3. Our average call rate time was quite down to 1.6 minutes compared to 4.8 minutes in Q3. We started our teams well, focused on root cause, fixes of customer issues and improve our business processes.\nLet's talk about microinverter manufacturing. Our overall supply environment remains quite stable in general. There are issues that crop up from time to time. Our teams are staying on top of them. Our quarterly capacity was 5 million microinverters exiting Q4. We are on track to begin manufacturing at Flex Romania starting this quarter, enabling us to service Europe better. This will enable a total quarterly capacity of 6 million microinverters exiting Q1. We are going to increase this capacity even more with U.S. manufacturing.\nLet's cover that now. As we discussed last quarter, we are pleased that the IRA will help bring back high-tech manufacturing to the U.S. and stimulate the economy through the creation of jobs. We are excited to service the U.S. customers better with local manufacturing. We plan to begin U.S. manufacturing of our microinverters in the second quarter of 2023 with a new contract manufacturing partner and in the second half of 2023 with our 2 existing contract manufacturing partners. We plan to open 6 manufacturing lines by the end of this year adding a quarterly capacity of 4.5 million microinverters, bringing our total quarterly capacity to more than 10 million microinverters as we exit 2023. We continue to await the details of IRA implementation from the U.S. Department of Treasury.\nLet's cover the regions. Our U.S. and international revenue mix for Q4 was 71% and 29%, respectively. In the U.S., our revenue increased 15% sequentially and 59% year-on-year. We had record quarterly revenue, record quarterly sell-through for our microinverters and record quarterly installer count in the fourth quarter. Our microinverter channel inventory was quite healthy at the end of the fourth quarter, while our storage channel inventory was a little elevated.\nI'll go into more details about our batteries later in the call. In Europe, our revenue increased 21% sequentially and more than 130% year-on-year, led by strong demand in Netherlands, France, Germany, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, and the U.K. We had record sell-through and record installer count in Q4, as we continue to grow our business. We started shipping our IQ8 microinverters into Netherlands and France in Q4. We are working hard to introduce IQ8 into other European countries shortly. Also, we are currently shipping IQ batteries into Germany and Belgium. We expect to start shipping IQ batteries into Austria, France, Netherlands and Spain in the first half of this year.\nOur GreenCom Networks acquisition, which closed in the fourth quarter helps to integrate Enphase microinverters and batteries with third-party EV chargers and heat pumps, enabling homeowners to control their devices from one app, which is the Enphase app. We are integrating the GreenCom offering with the Enphase ecosystem and expect to make it available to our European installers shortly.\nNow I'll provide some color on Latin America, Australia and Brazil. In Latin America, our revenue doubled year-on-year. We had steady growth in our solar plus storage business in Puerto Rico during 2022. In Australia, the solar market continued to recover in Q4 after a weak first half of the year. We expect to introduce IQ batteries in Australia, along with IQ8 microinverters in the second quarter of '23. As for Brazil, we experienced significant quarter-over-quarter revenue growth, as we saw increased deployment of our IQ7 family of microinverters. The residential solar market in Brazil continues to grow rapidly. We have a very strong team in place. and we are excited about our future growth in the country. The emerging residential markets in Brazil, Mexico, Spain and India are all moving to high-voltage panels. In order to service them better, we plan to introduce a high-power 480 watts AC microinverter in the second quarter.\nLet's discuss our overall company outlook for Q1. We expect our Q1 revenue for the company to be within the range of $700 million to $740 million. We are fully booked for Q1 right now. Let me provide some additional information on the key regions. First about Europe then about the U.S. Our Europe business is doing very -- is very strong as I noted. Note that we also doubled our revenue from 2020 to 2021, and more than doubled the gain from '21 to '22.\nWe have a strong team in place and are quite bullish about 2023. We expect to introduce IQ batteries and IQ8 microinverters into many more countries in Europe as we progress through the year. Our value proposition is our differentiated home energy management systems, combined with high quality and great customer experience.\nAs for Q1, we expect healthy growth compared to Q4, consistent with the overall growth in the European market. Let's now cover the U.S. We expect our U.S. business to be slightly down in Q1 compared to Q4, primarily driven by seasonality and the macroeconomic environment. We are seeing that our distributor and installer partners are a little more cautious in booking orders. We normally have a 6-month order visibility, and that has been somewhat reduced as our partners watch their spending closely. On the sell-through of our microinverters, while December was quite strong for us. We saw a more pronounced seasonality in January than normal.\nThere are a couple of interesting observations I thought I will share with you. Even with the pronounced seasonality and sell-through in January, we'd like to point out that our activations are holding up. The second point to also note is that in conversations with our installers and distributor partners, they have started to see originations pick up in January when compared to December. Although the data we have is limited, these 2 points make us cautiously optimistic about Q2. We've also seen some analyst reports about a possible shift from loans to PPA due to the high prevailing interest rates. We work with thousands of installers every quarter. Our installer base is very diverse, both small and large installers that offer cash, loans and PPA options to homeowners. Any shift from one type of financing to another only has a minor impact to our business, almost negligible. No matter what the conditions are, our approach at Enphase does not change.\nWe manage for the long term. The basic thesis ongoing solar and storage remains intact, aided by a few factors: first, the utility rates which are rising in many states across the U.S.; second, the 30% ITC tax credit, which has been extended for 10 years with the IRA; and third, the desire for energy independence and tackling climate change.\nAt Enphase, we will continue to make best-in-class home energy systems with a laser focus on product innovation, quality and customer experience. Let's switch to talking about battery. We shipped 122-megawatt hours of IQ batteries in Q4. We have now certified approximately 2,300 installers worldwide since the introduction of IQ batteries into North America, Germany and Belgium. Our installers in North America experienced a median commissioning time of 91 minutes exiting Q4 compared to 118 in Q3. We made significant software changes to improve communication, big transitions and commissioning time, and I'm quite happy with the performance of the team.\nAs a result, we saw slightly higher sell-through of our batteries in Q4 versus Q3. We've also got a number of feedback from the installers about the fact of improved performance in terms of commissioning. We plan to ship 100- to 120-megawatt hours of IQ batteries in Q1. We also expect to start ramping our third generation IQ battery in North America and Australia in the second quarter. This battery has got 5-kilowatt hour modularity, 2x the power compared to our existing battery and 30-minute commissioning time in addition to being easier to install and service. We expect the higher charge discharge rate as well as the 5-kilowatt hour modularity to be uniquely beneficial to the homeowners under the upcoming NEM 3.0 tariff in California.\nWith the significant changes we are making to our IQ batteries, we are confident that storage installations will become as efficient as microinverters. And as a result, the profitability for installers should get better. We expect our battery business to perform well in the second half of the year, both due to our third-generation battery as well as NEM 3 adoption in California.\nLet's now talk about our product for the small commercial solar market in the U.S. We are on track to pilot the IQ8P product and release it to production in the second half of the year. As our panel power continues to increase rapidly, we are increasing the power of the microinverter by 50% from 320 watts to 480 watts AC while sticking to the single panel architecture. This product as well as the 480-watt residential microinverter for emerging markets share the same design.\nLet's discuss EV chargers. We shipped approximately 7,600 EV chargers in Q4 as compared to 6,370 chargers in Q3. We began manufacturing Enphase branded EV chargers at our contract manufacturing facility in Mexico this quarter, helping us to increase capacity and reduce costs. We expect to introduce IQ smart EV chargers to customers in the U.S. in the second quarter. These chargers will provide connectivity and control, enabling use cases like green charging and allow homeowners visibility into the operation of their Enphase solar plus storage plus EV chargers system through the app.\nWe recently demonstrated our bidirectional EV charger technology combining vehicle-to-home, vehicle-to-grid and green charging functionality. This new bidirectional EV charger along with Enphase's solar and battery storage can all be controlled from the Enphase app, empowering homeowners to make use, safe and sell their own power. We are working with standards organization, EV manufacturers and regulators to bring this technology to market in 2024.\nLet me give you a quick update on our Enphase installer network, or EIN. We have now onboarded more than 1,300 installers to our EIN worldwide through a highly selective process focused on installed quality and exceptional experience to homeowners across the globe. Let's discuss the installer platform. We made several updates to the Solargraf design and proposal software during the fourth quarter, incorporating battery design and proposal document management, consumption modeling and several other improvements as requested by our installer partners. In addition, we made significant strides in automating the creation of permit plan sets with Solargraf software. We now have over 1,000 installers using Solargraf software.\nNext, I'd like to comment on NEM 3.0 in California. The CPUC has finalized its decision on NEM 3.0 in Q4. While we wish the export rates had been stepped down a little more gradually, the policy is generally in the right direction for incentivizing homeowners to adopt storage. The next step is for installers to educate homeowners to increase adoption of NEM 3 and companies like Enphase need to help in making this transition possible. That's where Solargraf design and proposal engine comes in. Installers will be able to use Solargraf to provide homeowners with a proposal that optimizes their bills under NEM 3 tariff to minimize payback and maximize ROI. The advantage with Solargraf is that the underlying algorithm used by [engine] will be the same as what is used in the actual operation of the Enphase Home energy system. As the system complexity increases with solar, batteries, EV chargers and dynamic rate structures such as NEM 3.0, the tight coupling of Solargraf and actual product operation will maximize value to homeowners.\nIn summary, we are quite pleased with our performance. As a reminder, our strategy is to build best-in-class home energy systems and deliver them to homeowners through our installer and distributor partners, enabled by the installer platform. We have many new products that are coming out in 2023, that will increase our served available market and positively contribute to the top line.\nWe look forward to introducing IQ8 microinverters worldwide, introducing IQ batteries into more countries in Europe, launching our third-generation battery in North America and Australia as well as introducing our highest power 480-watt IQ8P microinverter for both the U.S. small commercial and emerging residential markets. We're also excited about the upcoming Solargraf functionality, especially the NEM 3.0 functionality. And finally, the work we are doing to bring both smart EV chargers as well as bidirectional EV charging capabilities to the market.\nWith that, I will now turn the call to Mandy for a review of our financials. Mandy?\n\nMandy Yang\n\nVP & CFO, Enphase Energy, Inc.\n\nThanks, Badri, and good afternoon, everyone.\nI will provide more details related to our fourth quarter of 2022 financial results as well as our business outlook for the first quarter of 2023. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the IR section of our website. Total revenue for Q4 was $724.7 million, representing an increase of 14% sequentially and a quarterly record. We ship approximately 1,952.4 megawatts DC of microinverters and 122.1 megawatt hours of IQ batteries in the quarter. Non-debt gross margin for Q4 was 43.8% compared to 42.9% in Q3.\nThe increase was driven by a favorable I8 product mix. The gross margin was 42.9% for Q4. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $87.7 million for Q4 compared to $78.6 million for Q3. The increase was driven by international growth, customer service and R&D. Same operating expenses were $153.7 million for Q4 compared to $132.5 million for Q3. GAAP operating expenses for Q4 included $59.4 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $4.9 million of acquisition-related expenses and amortization for acquired intangible assets and $1.8 million of restructuring and asset impairment charges.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, income from operations for Q4 was $229.4 million compared to $194 million for Q3. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $157 million for Q4 compared to $135.4 million for Q3. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q4 was $212.4 million compared to $175.5 million for Q3. This resulted in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.51 for Q4 compared to $1.25 for Q3.\nSales net income for Q4 was $153.8 million compared to a net income of $114.8 million for Q3. This resulted in GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.06 for Q4 compared to $0.80 for Q3. We exited Q4 with a total cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balance of $1.61 billion compared to $1.42 billion at the end of Q3.\nIn Q4, we generated $253.7 million in cash flow from operations and $237.3 million in free cash flow. Capital expenditure was $16.4 million for Q4 compared to $8.9 million for Q3. The increase was primarily due to investment in additional content manufacturing sites and R&D equipment. Capital expenditure for the full year of 2022 was $46.4 million.\nNow let's discuss our outlook for the first quarter of 2023. We spent our revenue for the first quarter of 2023 to be within a range of $700 million to $740 million, which includes shipments of 100- to 120-megawatt hours of IQ batteries. We expect GAAP gross margin to be within the range of 40% to 43% and non-debt gross margin to be within the range of 41% to 44%, which excludes stock based compensation expenses and acquisition-related amortization. We assume a conservative euro FX rate in our Q1 guidance, and we don't expect significant impact to our financials from fluctuations in FX rates. We set up our debt operating expenses to be within a range of $177 million to $181 million, including approximately $77 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses, restructuring charges for site consolidation, acquisition-related expenses and amortization. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $100 million to $104 million.\nMoving to tax. Since we have utilized most of our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards in 2022. We announced a significant U.S. cash taxpayer. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP annualized effective tax rate for 2023 to be at 22% plus or minus 2% before any IRA impact.\nIn closing, we are pleased with our 2022 financial performance. We grew our revenue by 59% year-over-year, while spending on non-GAAP gross margin to 42.6% in 2022. We increased non-debt diluted earnings per share by 92% to $4.62 per share in 2022 and generated record free cash flow of $698.4 million more than double from 2021.\nWith that, I will now open the line for questions."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Karen Sagot. Please go ahead.\n\nKaren Sagot\n\nHead Of IR, Enphase Energy, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Enphase Energy's Third Quarter 2022 Results.\nOn today's call are Badri Kothandaraman, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Mandy Yang, our Chief Financial Officer; and Raghu Belur, our Chief Product Officer.\nAfter the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2022. During this conference call, Enphase's management will make forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements related to our expected future financial performance, the capabilities of our technology and products and the benefits to homeowners and installers, our operations, including manufacturing, customer service and supply and demand, anticipated growth in existing and new markets, the timing of new product introductions and regulatory matters. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties and our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from these expectations.\nFor a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please see our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Qs filed with the SEC. We caution you not to place any undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertakes no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes in expectations.\nAlso, please note that financial measures used on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release furnished with the SEC on Form 8-K and which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nNow I'd like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Badri?\n\nBadrinarayanan Kothandaraman\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Enphase Energy, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter 2022 financial results.\nWe had a good quarter. We reported record quarterly revenue of $634.7 million, achieved quarterly non-GAAP gross margin of 42.9% and generated free cash flow of $179.1 million. Approximately 47% of our Q3 microinverter shipments were ITV.\nWe exited the third quarter at approximately 43, 12, 31. This means 43% gross margin, 12% operating expenses and 31% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis. We will go into our financials later in the call.\nLet's now discuss how we are servicing customers. Our Q3 NPS worldwide was 70% compared to 68% in Q2. Our North American NPS score was 71%, the same as Q2. Our average call wait time was 4.8 minutes compared to 4.7 minutes in Q2. The elevated call wait times over the past few quarters are related to the rapid growth in our business. We're not happy with the call wait time and we are targeting to get our call wait times under a minute by more aggressive staffing of our teams in U.S., Europe and Australia.\nWe remain laser focused on customer service. The emphasis on superior customer experience has further increased due to severe weather events. During the recent storm in Puerto Rico and Florida, our customer service team, field service technicians and engineers were able to help customers with the issues they faced. While our systems performed well in general, there is some more room for improvement. Our focus is to ensure seamless installer and homeowner experience through such events. Our teams have shared many stories with us of their efforts to help customers and customers have also expressed their deep gratitude for the help. I'm quite proud of our teams.\nLet's talk about microinverter manufacturing. Our situation remains quite stable right now due to diligent supplier management as well as qualification of multiple sources. Our quarterly capacity is around 5 million microinverters today. We are on track to begin manufacturing at Flex Romania starting in Q1 '23, enabling the global capacity of 6 million micros per quarter.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act or IRA has extended the investment tax credit, ITC, for residential solar to 30% for another 10 years and also implemented a stand-alone storage ITC with the same terms. Both are very good for the industry at large. In addition, the IRA has a provision for $0.11 per AC watt, production-based tax credit for domestic manufacturing of microinverters. Therefore, we have been actively looking at manufacturing in the U.S.\nWe are working with 3 contract manufacturing partners, 1 new and 2 we have today already. We plan to open 4 to 6 manufacturing lines in the U.S. by the second half of 2023. Our thought process is that we will need the additional capacity anyway considering our fast-paced growth globally.\nThere are still a lot of questions to be answered regarding the actual implementation of the IRA for domestic manufacturing. U.S. Department of Treasury is seeking comments from stakeholders in early November for clarification of these questions, and we're working with industry partners, the stakeholders to provide comments. Once the IRA details have been finalized and the implementation is clear, U.S. manufacturing could provide a substantial benefit in terms of the production-based tax credit.\nLet's talk about IQ Batteries. We are on track to add an additional cell pack supplier from China early next year for a third-generation battery. Our lead times for batteries are 10 to 12 weeks, allowing us to respond a little more quickly than we sold to customers.\nLet's move on to the regions. Our U.S. and international revenue mix for Q3 was 71% and 29%, respectively. We experienced strong growth in Q3, both in North America as well as in Europe. In U.S., our revenue increased 7% sequentially and 69% year-on-year. We had record quarterly revenue and record sell-through for microinverters in Q3. Our microinverter channel inventory in the U.S. was at a very healthy level at the end of Q3, while our storage channel inventory was a little elevated due to longer installed times. I'll go into more details about our IQ Batteries later in the call.\nIn Europe, our revenue increased approximately 70% sequentially and 136% year-on-year, led by strong demand for our microinverters in Netherlands, France, Germany, Belgium, Spain and Portugal and for our IQ Batteries in Germany and Belgium. Microinverter supply continues to be tight and channel inventory continues to be below normal.\nWe continue to invest heavily in Europe. We are expanding engineering, sales and customer service teams along with opening a manufacturing line in Romania in Q1 '23. In addition, we expect to begin shipments of IQ8 microinverters into the Netherlands and France in the fourth quarter and rest of Europe in the first half of '23. We also plan to introduce IQ Batteries into Austria in the fourth quarter.\nWe recently acquired GreenCom Networks, a home energy management software company with headquarters in Germany. The acquisition allows us to add a local engineering team to service the accelerating clean energy transition in Europe, provide installers with a complete home energy management system integrating Enphase microinverters and Enphase batteries with third-party EV chargers and heat pumps and enable homeowner to monitor and control all of these devices from the Enphase app.\nIn summary, we are quite pleased with our growth in Europe and look forward to the continued momentum.\nIn Latin America, revenue increased 100% sequentially and 129% year-on-year. We had steady growth in our solar plus storage business in Puerto Rico during Q3 and expect continued growth in the region as demand for solar and storage has increased since the recent hurricane. The storage attaches nearly 100% in Puerto Rico. Our IQ8 microinverters as well as IQ Batteries provide a differentiated solution invaluable to customers during the storm.\nNow I'll provide some general color on Australia, Brazil and India. In Australia, the solar market continued to recover in Q3, and we believe the forecasted increase in electricity prices will drive demand. We expect to introduce IQ Batteries in the first half of '23 in Australia.\nFor Brazil, we had sequential revenue growth in Q3 due to a steady increase in demand for IQ 7A microinverters. In India, we made progress on adding more installers in the Enphase installer network. The module power is substantially increasing in these emerging markets. We plan to introduce a 480-watt AC high-power residential microinverter in the first half of '23 to match the increase in module power.\nLet's discuss the company's overall bookings for Q4. Our demand for Q4 is quite robust and easily exceeds the higher end of our guidance range. As for Q1, it's a little bit early to comment, but we see that the bookings are quite healthy right now.\nOn supply, the component availability is getting better. There are still some spots of tightness that keep coming up from time to time, and our operations team is doing a nice job closely managing the situation. The logistics situation has also improved a little bit with reduced shipping times.\nLet's talk about batteries. We have now certified approximately 2,100 installed worldwide since the introduction of IQ Batteries into North America, Germany and Belgium. We shipped 133.6 megawatt hours of IQ Batteries in Q3. We are working hard to improve our customer experience as it is not yet up to our standard. We continue to host weekly installer round table to deeply understand their pain points. Our installers in North America experienced a median commissioning time of 118 minutes exiting Q3. We have made substantial improvements in our software, which was just released a few days ago to reduce commissioning times further and make grid transitions more robust. With these changes, we expect the median commissioning time to improve to 80 minutes exiting Q4.\nThe third generation of our IQ Battery product will have additional features, which further addresses the installer pain points. Our installers are extremely busy given the strong demand. Any inefficiency in the installation process impacts their profitability. This means that battery installer -- the battery installation experience must be as good as the microinverter experience, which is what we are working to improve.\nWith the significant changes we are making in the product, we are confident that storage installations will become as efficient as microinverter installations, and as a result, installer profitability will improve and storage deployment will accelerate. We expect to ship 120 to 135-megawatt hours of IQ Batteries in Q4, and we expect steady progress throughout '23.\nOn the new product front, we expect to generate our third generation IQ Battery, starting in North America and Australia in the first half of '23. We then plan to introduce it into Europe and emerging markets in the second half.\nThe battery will have wired connectivity to the IQ Gateway and system controller via a CANbus. The modularity of the battery is 5 kilowatt hour. The battery will have double the continuous and peak power compared to the second generation, enabling heavier loads, such as air conditioners to start more easily. We are targeting commissioning times to be sub-30 minutes with this battery. With every generation of batteries, we expect to make steady improvement in the customer experience just like what we did with microinverters.\nWe're already working on our fourth generation IQ Battery to be introduced in 2024, which will result in a substantial energy density improvement compared to the third generation.\nLet's talk about our product for small commercial solar in the U.S. Based on customer feedback from pilot runs on IQ8D, which was our previous product, we are increasing the power of the microinverter by 50% from 320 watts to 480 watts AC, and we are reverting back to a single panel architecture. We understand this is a few more months of delay, but we think it is the right long-term decision as panel power continues to increase rapidly in the small commercial space. We expect to pilot this product in the first half of '23. This product is very closely aligned with the 480-watt residential microinverter for emerging markets, except for the 3-phase cabling. We are bullish about penetrating the small commercial solar business shortly with this powerful new product.\nLet's discuss EV chargers. We shipped more than 6,370 chargers in Q3 compared to 8,250 in Q2. We are on track to manufacture Enphase branded EV chargers that our contract manufacturing facility in Mexico by the end of this year, helping us to increase capacity and cut down costs. As for new products, we expect to introduce smart EV chargers to U.S. customers in the first half of '23, followed by Europe. We are excited about this product as it will provide connectivity and control, enabling use cases like green charging and allowing homeowners visibility into operation of their Enphase solar plus storage plus EV system through the Enphase app. We are very bullish about our EV charging business and continue to invest in it significantly.\nLet me give you a quick update on our Enphase Installer Network or EIN. We have now onboarded more than 1,200 installers to our EIN worldwide through a highly selective process focused on installation quality and an exceptional experience to homeowners across the globe. We have talked about our installer platform on previous calls from lead management to design and proposal to fintech connectivity, to automated permitting installation and commissioning and operations and maintenance. We recently added battery design and document management features to our Solargraf software. We are also making enhancements to our Solargraf software to cut down permit planted creation cycle time significantly.\nNext, I'd like to comment on NEM 3 in California. As of now, there is still no decision from the California Public Utilities Commission, CPUC. We hope the CPUC eliminates the grid participation charge, while providing a glide path for the solar-only market as well as incentivizing the solar plus storage market.\nIn summary, we are happy with our performance and strong demand for our products. We are working on several important initiatives to grow our business, fully ramping IQ8 microinverter across the world, fixing customer experience on our IQ Batteries, accelerating our business in Europe further and introducing high-power IQ8 microinverter variants for residential and small commercial solar markets.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Mandy for a review of our finances. Mandy?\n\nMandy Yang\n\nVP & CFO, Enphase Energy, Inc.\n\nThanks, Badri, and good afternoon, everyone.\nI will provide more details related to our third quarter of 2022 financial results as well as our business outlook for the fourth quarter of 2022. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the IR section of our website. Total revenue for Q3 was $634.7 million, representing an increase of 20% sequentially and a quarterly record. We ship approximately 1,709 megawatt DC microinverters and 133.6 megawatt hours of IQ Batteries in the quarter.\nNon-GAAP gross margin for Q3 was 42.9% compared to 42.2% in Q2. The increase was driven by a favorable IQ8 mix, partially offset by the further strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro.\nOur Q3 gross margin was negatively affected by 70 basis points from the euro to USD FX rate decline from Q2. GAAP gross margin was 42.2% for Q3.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses were $78.6 million for Q3 compared to $71.2 million for Q2. The increase was driven by investment in R&D, customer service and sales.\nSales operating expenses were $132.5 million for Q3 compared to $125 million for Q2. GAAP operating expenses for Q3 included $49.1 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $4.8 million of acquisition-related expenses and amortization for acquired intangible assets and restructuring charges for site consolidation.\nOn a non-debt basis, income from operations for Q3 was $193.9 million compared to $162.4 million for Q2. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $135.4 million for Q3 compared to $94 million for Q2. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q3 was $175.5 million compared to $149.9 million for Q2. This resulted in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.25 for Q3 compared to $1.07 for Q2. GAAP net income for Q3 was $114.8 million compared to GAAP net income of $77 million for Q2. This resulted in GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.80 for Q3 compared to $0.54 for Q2.\nWe exited Q3 with a total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of approximately $1.42 billion compared to approximately $1.25 billion at the end of Q2.\nIn Q3, we generated $188 million in cash flow from operations and $179.1 million in free cash flow. Capital expenditure was $8.9 million for Q3 compared to $8.7 million for Q2.\nNow let's discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2022. We expect our revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022 to be within a range of $680 million to $720 million, which includes shipments of 120- to 135-megawatt hours of IQ Batteries. We expect GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 39% to 42% and non-GAAP gross margin to be within the range of 40% to 43%, which excludes stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition-related amortization.\nWe assume a conservative euro FX rate in our Q4 guidance, and we don't expect significant impact to our financials from the USD strengthening given most of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars. We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $152 million to $156 million, including approximately $65 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses, restructuring charges for stock consolidation, acquisition-related expenses and amortization. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $87 million to $91 million.\nAs we discussed last quarter, with the year-to-date profit reported, we expect to utilize all of our net operating loss and research tax credit carry forwards in 2022 and become a U.S. cash taxpayer. As our non-GAAP tax expense reflects cash tax expense and reserves, we expect our non-GAAP tax expense for the fourth quarter of 2022 to be approximately 15% of our non-GAAP profit before tax. We expect GAAP tax expense to be approximately 22% of profit before tax for the fourth quarter of 2022.\nMoving forward to 2023, we expect to have our non-GAAP and GAAP tax rate at 22%, plus or minus 2%, before any IRA impact. If IRA is implemented with favorable terms to us for domestic manufacturing, our tax rate may be reduced from 22%.\nIn closing, we are pleased with our financial performance and the midpoint of our Q4 guidance plus the first 3 quarters of 2022 actuals. We estimate 2022 year-over-year revenue growth of 67% while expanding our non-GAAP gross margin to 42% and non-GAAP operating income to 29% of our estimated 2022 revenue.\nWith that, I will now open the line for questions."

(Operator Instructions) Please note that this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Karen Sagot. Please go ahead.\n\nKaren Sagot\n\nHead Of IR, Enphase Energy, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Enphase Energy's second quarter 2022 results. On today's call are Badri Kothandaraman, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Mandy Yang, our Chief Financial Officer; and Raghu Belur, our Chief Products Officer. After the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2022.\nDuring this conference call, Enphase management will make forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements related to our expected future financial performance; the capabilities of our technology and products and the benefits to homeowners and installers; our operations, including manufacturing, customer service and supply and demand; the anticipated growth in sales in the market, new product introductions and regulatory matters. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from these expectations. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please see our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Qs filed with the SEC. We caution you not to play any undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertake no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes in expectations.\nAlso, please note that financial measures used on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today furnished with the SEC and which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nNow I'd like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Badri?\n\nBadrinarayanan Kothandaraman\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Enphase Energy, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter 2022 financial results.\nWe had a good quarter. We reported record revenue of $530.2 million, achieved non-GAAP gross margin of 42.2%, and generated free cash flow of $192 million. And 37% of our Q2 microinverter shipments were IQ 8.\nWe exited Q2 at approximately 42%, 13%, 29%. This means 42% gross margin, 13% operating expenses and 29% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis. As a reminder, our baseline financial model is 35%, 15% 20%. Mandy will go into our financials later in the call.\nLet's now discuss how we are servicing customers. Our Q2 Net Promoter Score or NPS worldwide was 68%, the same as in Q1, and our North American NPS was 71% compared to 74% in Q1. Our average call wait time increased to 4.7 minutes in Q2 compared to 3.2 minutes in Q1, primarily due to an increase in call volume related to the growth in the business. During Q2, we added customer service agents and field service technicians in U.S., Europe and Australia. We remain focused on customer service and ensuring that we are easy to do business with.\nLet's talk about our microinverter manufacturing. Our supply chain situation is quite stable due to diligent supplier management as well as qualification of alternate suppliers. With the growing demand for our products, we remain vigilant regarding the global supply chain and logistics challenges. Our quarterly capacity across all contract manufacturing facilities is around 5 million microinverters today. We are on track to begin manufacturing in Flexes factory in Romania starting in Q1 '23. This will enable a capacity of 6 million microinverters per quarter for us globally. We are also working on reducing manufacturing costs by adding more fully automated lines instead of semi-automated lines.\nLet's talk about IQ batteries. We are on track to add an additional cell pack supplier early next year for our third-generation battery. Our lead times or batteries are still around 14 to 16 weeks due to global logistics challenges.\nLet's move on to the regions. Our U.S. and international revenue mix for Q2 was 80% and 20%, respectively. We experienced strong growth in the U.S. and even stronger growth in Europe. In the U.S., revenue increased 15% sequentially and 66% year-on-year. We are pleased to report record quarterly revenue in the U.S. and record sell-through for our microinverters in Q2. We continued to win both large and small solar and storage installers.\nOur microinverter channel inventory was at a healthy level at the end of Q2, while our storage channel inventory was a little elevated due to longer installed times.\nIn Europe, the revenue increased 69% sequentially and 89% year-on-year, led by strong demand for our microinverters in Netherlands, France, Germany, Belgium, Spain and Portugal. We are starting to see good demand for our IQ batteries in Germany. Homeowners want self-consumption as the region not only faces energy prices that are rising, but also a growing demand for home electrification driven both by electric vehicles proliferation as well as natural gas shortages. We plan to introduce IQ batteries into a few more European countries later in the year. We also expect to ship our IQ 8 family of microinverters into Netherlands and France later this year.\nSector coupling is the latest buzzword in Germany, and it denotes the integration of 3 sectors: the heating and cooling sector, the transport and mobility sector, along with the power producing renewable sector. All 3 of them are required to achieve full home electrification. We are working towards sector coupling by making our solar plus battery systems seamlessly work with third-party EV chargers and heat pumps, and providing a single interface for homeowners to monitor and control their energy through the Enphase act.\nBottom line, we are quite happy with our progress in Europe. We are aggressively expanding the team. We expect this momentum to continue. Supply is tight. The channel inventory continues to be below normal levels. We are working hard to get supply into the region. In Q3, we expect to grow revenue more than 40% compared to Q2.\nIn Latin America, revenue increased 22% sequentially and 61% year-on-year. We had steady growth in our solar plus storage business in Puerto Rico during Q2.\nNow I'll provide some color on Australia, Brazil and India. In Australia, we are starting to see the market beginning to recover from COVID interruptions as well as federal election. We remain optimistic about our growth in the country and expect to introduce IQ batteries in early 2023. As for Brazil and India, we continue to ramp IQ 7A microinverters in Q2 and are starting to see a steady increase in demand quarter-on-quarter.\nLet's discuss the overall bookings for Q3. Our customer demand for Q3 is very robust and exceeds the higher end of our guidance range. The component availability is certainly better than what we have experienced in the last 18 months. This has enabled us to meet the growing demand, but there are still global logistics challenges that are not unique to Enphase.\nLet's discuss batteries. We introduced IQ batteries into North America 2 years ago in the third quarter of 2020. Since their introduction, we have grown battery shipments by an average of 28% per quarter over the last 2 years. We have certified more than 1,600 installers worldwide until date, and we are continuing to win around 15 new installers a week in the U.S. In the second quarter of 2022, we shipped 132.4 megawatt hours of IQ batteries, a 10% increase from the first quarter of 2022. In addition to North America, we are also ramping up batteries in Germany and Belgium.\nWe have learned a lot in the last 2 years. We have made several improvements to both the installer and the homeowner experience. Currently, our installers in North America are experiencing 2-plus hours of commissioning time, which we would like to cut down by half. We are also updating the device firmware at both our distribution centers as well as in the channel to avoid updates by installers on site. We expect the commissioning time of 90 minutes as we exit Q3 and 60 minutes as we exit Q4. We also plan to release several software improvements for homeowners during Q3 for enhanced outage performance. For Q3, we expect to ship between 130 and 145-megawatt hour of IQ metals.\nI recently visited the top installers in Puerto Rico in May. In Puerto Rico, the storage attached is 100%. I came away extremely excited about how our IQ batteries as well as IQ 8 microinverters can provide a very highly differentiated solution compared to the competition. Both the Sunlight Jump Start feature and the unlimited solar-to-battery ratio are really valuable to our installers, particularly in Puerto Rico, where outages are quite frequent. Our focus is to make the installer and homeowner experience seamless throughout these outages.\nWhile we are focused on providing a great experience with our current IQ batteries, we expect to introduce our third generation IQ battery starting in North America in early 2023. We expect this battery to deliver double the power, enabling homeowners to start heavy loads. The product will also use the robust wired cam protocol for seamless connectivity. We expect this third-generation battery to have simple installation leading to an improved customer experience.\nLet's now talk about our small commercial product. As previously discussed, we piloted IQ 8D with a few installers in the second quarter in order to receive feedback. The product has been working well, and the feedback that we got was quite useful. The installers have told us that the module power for the small commercial business significantly higher as manufacturers are moving rapidly to the larger format cells. Given this, we are going to increase the AC power of the microinverter in order to avoid potential flipping. We think it is prudent to do this now and introduce the product in early 2023. We understand this is a few more months of delay, but we are confident it's the right long-term decision. We are extremely bullish about the small commercial market where we can add tremendous value to business owners and installers with our high-quality, rapid shutdown-capable and micro grid forming capability of our microinverter systems.\nLet's discuss EV chargers. We acquired ClipperCreek in December of 2021, and the team is now fully integrated. We shipped more than 8,250 chargers in Q2 at a healthy gross margin, and the business is quite profitable as well. We introduced EV chargers to our solar distributors and installers in Q2, and we also strengthened our digital marketing efforts to consumers. We are on track to manufacture Enphase branded EV chargers at our contract manufacturing facility in Mexico this quarter. This will help us scale capacity and drop costs.\nAs for new products, we expect to introduce smart TV charges to customers in U.S. and Europe in the first half of '23. This will provide connectivity to the cloud through WiFi as well as local connectivity to the home energy management system, allowing homeowners full visibility into monitoring and control of their Enphase solar plus storage plus EV system. As I have stated before, our strategy is to build a best-in-class home energy systems and deliver them to homeowners through our network of distributors and installers, enabled by our installer platform.\nSo far, we talked about the key products on this call, microinverters, IQ batteries, EV chargers. Let's now talk about the installer platform. Before that, some background.\nWe acquired a total of 5 companies in the last 6 quarters. 4 of those companies are geared to help installers become efficient. The companies we acquired provide lead generation services, solar design software, proposal and permitting services, and an O&M software platform for our installers.\nOur latest acquisition we did in March is solar lead factory, which provides lead generation services for installers. We want to provide high-quality leads to our network of installers in a cost-effective manner. Currently, the quality of the leads in general in the solar industry is not very good. We, therefore, think we have a tremendous opportunity to improve the situation as it is a big pain point for the U.S. installers.\nWe acquired a company called Softdesk in January of 2021, 18 months ago, which provided us with solar design software capability. Our software business now has the record customer count in Q2 with approximately 950 installers using the Solar Grab software. We are making improvements to the software based on installer feedback and are implementing new features, including shading and 3D modeling for better accuracy, adding batteries and EV chargers into proposals, and integrating electronics signature capabilities for contracts.\nWe acquired a business in Noida in April of last year. This gave us the capability to provide proposal and permitting services to installers. Today, we service large installers, and most of the work here is highly manual. We'd like to change that and are working on automation to scale the business and provide these services to our entire network of installers.\nThe next one, in December 2021, we acquired a company in Arizona called 365 Pronto. The company's software platform enables a 2-sided marketplace. The buyers are customers consisting of installers, asset owners or original equipment manufacturers. The sellers are service providers consisting of technicians and third-party installers providing services for residential and commercial solar storage and EVs. Our vision is to simplify maintenance for our installer network by using the software platform and getting them access to a labor marketplace.\nWith these acquisitions now in-house, we have the right tools that we are combining into 1 platform to offer our installer network. We recognize the problems that the installers face such as soft costs, disparate tools and manual processes and are committed to building the platform to help minimize those.\nLet me now give you a quick update on our Enphase installer network, or EIN. We have onboarded approximately 1,200 installers to our EIN worldwide through a highly selective process focused on installed quality and an exceptional experience to homeowners across the globe.\nNext, let's talk about policy. I'd like to comment on a recent policy issue that is impacting the solar industry. As it pertains to NAM 3.2 in California, we submitted our comments to the proceeding in late June. We hope the CPUC will review the feedback from all stakeholders and eliminate the grid participation charge while providing a glide path for the solar-only market and incentivizing the solar plus storage market.\nWith regarding the federal reconciliation package, despite the recent setback, we will be actively engaged over the next couple of months to continue pushing for a climate deal that includes a solar ITC extension and the new storage ITC.\nIn summary, we are happy with our performance for the first half of 2022 and the strong demand for our microinverters and batteries. Our markets in North America and Europe are growing at a tremendous rate as reflected in our numbers. We remain focused on our products and platform to deliver a superior customer experience for our installers, distributors and homeowners.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Mandy for her review of our finances. Mandy?\n\nMandy Yang\n\nVP & CFO, Enphase Energy, Inc.\n\nThanks, Badri, and good afternoon, everyone. I will provide more details related to our second quarter of 2022 financial results as well as our business outlook for the third quarter of 2022. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the IR section of our website.\nTotal revenue for Q2 was $530.2 million, representing an increase of 20% sequentially, and a quarterly record. We shipped approximately 1,213 megawatts DC of microinverters and 132.4 megawatt hours of actuators in the quarter.\nNon-GAAP gross margin for Q2 was 42.2% compared to 41% in Q1. The increase was driven by favorable product mix. GAAP gross margin was 41.3% for Q2.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses were $71.2 million for Q2 compared to $66.3 million for Q1. The increase was driven by increased investment in R&D, customer service, sales and IT infrastructure. Group operating expenses were $125 million for Q2 compared to $115.1 million for Q1. Ship operating expenses for Q2 included $49.9 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $3.9 million of acquisition-related expenses and amortization for acquired intangible assets.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, income from operations for Q2 was $152.4 million compared to $114.5 million for Q1. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $94 million for Q2 compared to $61.8 million for Q1. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q2 was $149.9 million compared to $109.7 million for Q1. This resulted in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.07 for Q2 compared to $0.79 for Q1.\nGAAP net income for Q2 was $77 million, compared to GAAP net income of $51.8 million for Q1. This resulted in GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.54 for Q2 compared to $0.37 for Q1. We exited Q2 with a total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of approximately $1.25 billion compared to approximately $1.06 billion at the end of Q1.\nIn Q2, we generated $200.7 million in cash flow from operations and $192 million in free cash flow, which is more than double from Q1 as a result of our record revenue and improved cash conversion cycle in Q2. Capital expenditure was $8.7 million for Q2 compared to $12.4 million for Q1.\nNow let's discuss our outlook for the third quarter of 2022. We expect our revenue for the third quarter of 2022 to be within a range of $590 million to $630 million, which includes shipments of 130 to 145 megawatt hours of IQ batteries. We expect GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 38% to 41%, and non-GAAP gross margin to be within the range of 39% to 42%, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related amortization. We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $137 million to $141 million, including a total of approximately $60 million, estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition-related expenses and amortization.\nThe estimated stock-based compensation expenses include approximately $4.9 million accrued for the earnouts that are tied to certain performance targets to be paid in the company's stock for the acquisition. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be within the range of $77 million to $81 million.\nWith the year-to-date profit reported, we expect to utilize all of our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards in 2022 and become a U.S. cash taxpayer. As our non-GAAP tax expense reflects cash tax expense and reserves, we expect our non-GAAP tax expense for the third quarter of 2022 to be approximately 10% of our non-GAAP profit before tax and approximately 15% for Q4 '22. We expect GAAP tax expense to be approximately 24% of profit before tax for both third and fourth quarters of 2022.\nWith that, I will now open the line for questions."

We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nNow I'd like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Badri?\n\nBadrinarayanan Kothandaraman\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Enphase Energy, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter 2022 financial results. We had a good quarter. We reported record quarterly revenue of $441.3 million, achieved non-GAAP gross margin of 41% and generated free cash flow of $90.1 million. We ramped IQ 8 microinverters in the first quarter and started piloting IQ 8D microinverters to small commercial customers. We exited the first quarter at approximately 41%, 15%, 26%. This means 41% gross margin, 15% operating expenses and 26% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis. As a reminder, our baseline financial model is 35%, 15%, 20%. We will go into our financials later in the call.\nLet's now discuss how we are servicing customers. Our Q1 Net Promoter Score worldwide was 68% and compared to 69% in Q4, and our North American Net Promoter Score was 74% compared to 73% in Q4. Our average call wait time decreased to 3.2 minutes in Q1 compared to 8.9 minutes in Q4. We reduced call wait times through staffing and training. During Q1, we added field service technicians in the U.S. and Europe to provide on-site help to our installers, particularly for batteries.\nLet's talk about microinverter manufacturing. As we have discussed in the past calls, the global supply chain situation is still under stress, but our situation is stable due to supplier management and qualification of alternate suppliers. With the growing demand for our microinverters, we remain vigilant regarding the global supply chain and logistics challenges due to COVID disruptions. I'm very proud of our teams who have worked hard to manage this difficult situation.\nCurrently, our quarterly capacity across all contract manufacturing facilities is a little more than 5 million microinverters. Mexico has a quarterly capacity of 2.25 million microinverters, India with Cellcomp has 1.5 million and the rest is in China. To support the increased demand and to improve delivery times to customers in Europe, we are adding an automated line at Flex's factory in Romania. This line will have a quarterly capacity of approximately 750,000 microinverters starting in Q1 of 2023 and will enable a global capacity of nearly 6 million microinverters per quarter.\nLet's now talk about batteries. Our 2 sources for battery cell packs currently have a total capacity of 180-megawatt hours per quarter. Our existing cell pack suppliers can add more capacity if needed. We are also on track to add a third cell pack supplier in the second half of this year. Our lead times for batteries are still long at about 14 to 16 weeks, primarily due to global logistics challenges. The lead time should come down once shipping and port congestion conditions improve.\nLet's move on to the regions. U.S. and international revenue mix for Q1 was 84% and 16%, respectively. In the U.S., revenue increased 9% sequentially and 49% year-on-year. We are pleased to report record sell-through for microinverters and record revenue for batteries in Q1. The channel inventory for both microinverters and batteries were at a healthy level at the end of Q1.\nIn Europe, revenue decreased 6% sequentially while increasing 39% year-on-year. The sequential decrease was due to unforeseen shipment delays towards the end of Q1. Homeowners in Europe have a strong desire for energy independence. We recently teamed up with (inaudible), a German installer group to deliver microinverters and batteries to customers in Europe. We are currently shipping IQ batteries to Germany and Belgium and plan to introduce them in other European countries throughout 2022. Our batteries are now compatible with most brands of third-party PV inverters.\nWe continue to see a strong growth in our existing markets in Europe, including Netherlands, France and Belgium and are also pleased with our growth in newer markets, including Italy, Spain and Portugal. We expect our momentum in Europe to continue with more than 40% sequential revenue growth expected in Q2 versus Q1. We are continuing to expand the team and are very excited about our growth in the region. In Latin America, revenue increased 13% sequentially and more than doubled year-on-year. We had steady growth in our solar plus storage business in Puerto Rico during the first quarter.\nNow I'll provide some color on Australia, Brazil and India. In Australia, we expect to introduce IQ batteries in the second half of 2022. We think regulatory changes designed to improve solar installation practices will favor our safe AC approach, as grids and utilities require more intelligent and safer solutions. As for Brazil, we have started shipping IQ 7+ microinverters to installers in Q1 and expect to ramp continuously. We also expect to introduce an IQ 8D version into Brazil to optimize cost. In India, we are making steady progress in adding more installers into our network, ramping digital sales and planning to introduce IQ batteries in early 2023.\nLet's now discuss the overall bookings for Q2. Our overall customer demand for Q2 is quite robust for both microinverters and batteries and exceeds the higher end of our guidance range. The component availability is better than what we have experienced in the last 18 months, but there are still global challenges, which are not specific to Enphase. We remain optimistic that the lead times will come down by the end of this year.\nLet's talk about batteries. We shipped 120.4 megawatt hours of IQ batteries in the first quarter, a 20% increase from Q4 of 2021. We are working diligently on improving commissioning times for installers. While we have done various fixes to improve quality and homeowner experience or the batteries, we are still not where we would like to be on commissioning and installation experience. We are doubling down on this in this quarter and expect to make good progress. Our goal remains to get the commissioning time down to 1 hour and ensure installers have a seamless experience. We expect to shift between 130 and 140-megawatt hours of batteries in Q2. Due to the increase in logistics and component costs driven by inflation, we implemented a modest price increase on our batteries in March of 2022.\nLet's now discuss the installer training and certification on batteries. By the end of the first quarter, we have certified more than 1,300 installers in the U.S. on a cumulative basis. Our hands-on storage training in the U.S. uses mobile vans located in the East and West Coast along with regional training centers. We started with an Enphase YouTube channel in Q1 for training, where installers can access videos to learn installation tips and tricks.\nLet's talk about new products. In Q1, we ramped shipments on IQ 8 microinverters in North America and are receiving positive feedback about the product in general. As a reminder, IQ 8 solar microinverters can form a micro grid during a power outage using only sunlight, providing backup power even without a battery. IQ 8's grid-forming technology eliminates traditional ratio requirements between solar system size and battery size. And with our sunlight jump start feature, IQ 8 microinverters can start a home energy system using sunlight only after prolonged grid outages that may result in a fully depleted battery. We also expect to introduce IQ 8 microinverters internationally into Europe and Australia during the second half of this year.\nLet's talk about IQ 8D microinverters for small commercial applications. We started piloting IQ 8D 640-watt AC microinverters to select installers in North America during the first quarter, and we expect production shipments in late Q2. The value proposition of IQ 8D is the ease of installation, high-quality and rapid shutdown capability.\nOn batteries, we plan to introduce our next new product, IQ Battery 5P later this year. This battery will deliver twice the power of our current battery at a lower manufacturing cost, enabling homeowners to start heavier loads. Also going forward, we will enhance our communication using control area network, which is a robust wired protocol for connectivity between the battery, the gateway and the system controller. We expect this to further streamline installations and simplify commission.\nLet's now discuss ClipperCreek, an acquisition, which we completed in Q4 of 2021. The acquisition is performing in line with our expectations, with reasonable gross margins and profitability in Q1. We're doing a few things to ramp the business. We are introducing EV chargers to our solar distributors and installers this quarter. We are also on track to begin manufacturing EV chargers at our Flex facility in Mexico in the fourth quarter of this year. We believe this will help us scale better and drive down costs. As for new products, we expect to introduce a smart EV charger to customers in the U.S. and Europe in early 2023. This will provide connectivity to the cloud through Wi-Fi as well as local connectivity into the Enphase home energy system.\nThe increasing penetration of electric vehicles has significant implications for home energy management. The energy consumed by the home will significantly increase with an EV. This increase will drive adoption of more solar and storage, which will enable homeowners to save money and charge their vehicle in a green manner. The large EV battery could also be used for home backup called vehicle-to-home as well as helping the grid in the future called vehicle-to-grid. This acquisition plays extremely well to our strength in energy management ultimately helping the homeowner manage solar, storage, EV and other home loads. We are in discussions with a few EV makers to enable proof-of-concept for V2H and V2G features.\nLet me cover grid services. During the first quarter, we announced that Vermont-based utility, Green Mountain Power will offer Enphase Energy systems to its customers in a cutting-edge battery lease grid services pilot program. We have previously announced our participation in connected solutions covering 3 utilities in the Northeast U.S., Hawaiian Electric's Battery Bonus Grid Services Program and Arizona Public Services Residential Battery Grid Services Program. We also recently announced a partnership with Shell Energy to participate in VPP programs in California, New York and Hawaii. We also have many new grid services engagements in the pipeline and look forward to working with utilities and aggregators.\nLet's discuss the installer platform. We are working on Solargraf Pro, a design and proposal tool with shading analysis, ability to detect obstructions on the roof and 3D modeling of homes. Approximately 900 installers use the Solargraf tool today. We expect to launch the Solargraf Pro, a higher version -- an advanced version of the product in Q2 and already have a few installers piloting the software. In addition, we plan to expand the availability of Solargraf Pro internationally, starting with Germany.\nIn March of 2022, we acquired SolarLeadFactory, which provides high quality leads to solar installers in the U.S. Our objective is to substantially increase lead volumes and conversion rates to help drive down customer acquisition costs for installers. We plan to expand the team, optimize lead management and offer this service broadly to our installer network.\nWe have made 4 acquisitions in the last 15 months to strengthen our installer platform in the areas of lead generation, solar design software, permitting services and O&M software. In addition, we have robust and homegrown mobile apps for commissioning and monitoring of solar and storage systems. We plan to integrate all of these seamlessly onto one platform and offer them to our installation network simplifying their lives and reducing soft costs.\nLet me now give you a quick update on our Enphase installer network or EIN. We have now onboarded approximately 1,200 installers to our EIN worldwide through highly selective process focused on installation quality and an exceptional experience to homeowners across the globe.\nNext, I'd like to comment on some recent policy issues that are impacting the U.S. solar industry. As you're aware, the U.S. Department of Commerce is investigating the circumvention of antidumping and countervailing duties on some PV modules. This is a time of great change in the energy market. Utility costs are rising, climate change is happening, geopolitical issues are driving energy security and EVs are taking off. At a time like this, when there needs to be full support for renewables and AD/CVD investigation, creates massive uncertainty in the marketplace which we believe will impact U.S. jobs, raise electricity prices for homeowners and increase import from China, all of which are counter to the goals of the current administration.\nWe are hoping that the current administration takes this problem seriously and resolves it rapidly well before the proposed August time frame.\nAs it relates to Enphase, our products aren't directly impacted by AD/CVD as we don't make modules. But based on conversations with some of our partners, it is our opinion that the module supply for the residential segment will be less impacted than other segments. Many of our partners are currently working on securing module supply for the latter part of this year. Module pricing is expected to be higher in the interim, and we think the residential segment may be able to absorb higher prices.\nAll of this further underscores the importance of supporting domestic manufacturing through a production-based tax credit, or PTC, so we can proactively increase domestic manufacturing rather than reacting to such a market disruption.\nThe support of domestic manufacturing is well aligned with the administration's goals to promote renewables, increase U.S. jobs, reduce electricity pricing for homeowners and lessen the dependency on imports from China. We would like to see rapid resolution of both AD/CVD as well as implementation of PTC as soon as possible.\nI would also now like to comment on the California NEM 3.0 proposed decision RPD, which was announced in the December of 2021. We expect a modification to the current PD and an opportunity for stakeholders to participate and provide their feedback to the California PUC. We've been actively participating in the process and will continue to work diligently with various stakeholders to try and influence the best outcome.\nLet me wrap up. Full home electrification is slowly but surely coming. EVs are ramping up considerably for obvious reasons, so are heat pumps. Climate change, coupled with situations like the Ukraine, is forcing European countries and others to think hard about their reliance on oil, coal and natural gas. Countries like Germany are leading the way in adopting renewable technologies such as solar and batteries to support heat pumps, EVs and other home loads. Self-consumption is becoming the norm and consumers want energy independence. There is no doubt that other countries will follow suit. It is just a matter of time.\nOur strategy is pretty simple. We create best-in-class solar plus storage home energy systems. We sell them to homeowners through our installation and distribution partners, enabled by our installer platform. Our topmost core value is customer first, and we are focused on providing a great experience to installers and homeowners. We are well placed to capitalize on the trend towards full home electrification and look forward to ramping our presence in Europe in a significant manner over the coming months and years.\nWith that, I will hand the call over to Mandy for her review of our financial results. Mandy?\n\nMandy Yang\n\nVP & CFO, Enphase Energy, Inc.\n\nThanks, Badri, and good afternoon, everyone. I will provide more details related to our first quarter of 2022 financial results, as well as our business outlook for the second quarter of 2022. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial results in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the IR section of our website.\nTotal revenue for Q1 was $441.3 million, representing an increase of 7% sequentially and a quarterly record. We shipped approximately 1,029 megawatts DC of microinverters and 120.4 megawatt hours of IQ batteries in the quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin for Q1 was 41.0% compared to 40.2% in Q4. The increase was driven by favorable product mix and lower expedite costs. The gross margin was 40.1% for Q1.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses were $66.3 million for Q1 compared to $68.2 million for Q4. The decrease was driven by lower marketing expenses, offset by continuous investment in R&D and customer service. GAAP operating expenses were $115.1 million for Q1 compared to $105.6 million for Q4. GAAP operating expenses for Q1 included $45.3 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $3.6 million of acquisition-related expenses and amortization for acquired intangible assets.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, income from operations for Q1 was $114.5 million compared to $97.7 million for Q4. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $61.8 million for Q1 compared to $57.7 million for Q4. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q1 was $109.7 million compared to $102.8 million for Q4. This resulted in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.79 for Q1 compared to $0.73 for Q4. GAAP net income for Q1 was $51.8 million compared to GAAP net income of $52.6 million for Q4. This resulted in GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.37 for both Q1 and Q4.\nWe exited Q1 with a total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of approximately $1.1 billion compared to approximately $1.0 billion at the end of Q4. In Q1, we generated $102.4 million in cash flow from operations and $90.1 million in free cash flow. Capital expenditure was $12.4 million for Q1 to increase manufacturing capacity as well as costs related to IT infrastructure, R&D equipment and international facilities.\nNow let's discuss our outlook for the second quarter of 2022. We expect our revenue for the second quarter of 2022 to be within a range of $490 million to $520 million, which includes shipments of 130 to 140-megawatt hours of IQ batteries. We expect GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 37% to 40% and non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 38% to 41%, which excludes stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition-related amortization. We expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $127.5 million to $135 million, including a total of approximately $57 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition-related expenses and amortization.\nThe estimated stock-based compensation expenses include approximately $4.8 million accrual for the earn outs that are tied to certain performance targets to be paid in company stock for the acquisition. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $70.5 million to $73.5 million.\nWith that, I will now open the line for questions."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's program is being recorded.\nI would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Karen Sagot. Please go ahead.\n\nKaren Sagot\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Enphase Energy's fourth quarter 2021 results. On today's call are Badri Kothandaraman, Enphase's President and Chief Executive Officer; Eric Branderiz, Chief Financial Officer; Mandy Yang, Chief Accounting Officer and Corporate Treasurer; and Raghu Belur, Chief Products Officer.\nAfter the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2021.\nDuring this conference call, Enphase management will make forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements related to Enphase Energy's expected future financial performance; the capability of our technology and products, including features, performance in our operations, including manufacturing and customer service; the anticipated growth in our sales and in the markets in which we operate and target; the benefits to homeowners and installers and regulatory issues.

The company has provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in its earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of its website.\nNow I'd like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Badri?\n\nBadrinarayanan Kothandaraman\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Enphase Energy, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and thanks for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter 2021 financial results.\nWe had a good quarter. We reported revenue of $412.7 million, shipped approximately 3 million microinverters and 100.2 megawatt hours of IQ batteries, achieved non-GAAP gross margin of 40.2% and generated free cash flow of $84.1 million. We started production shipments of our IQ8 microinverters for customers in North America during Q4, and we have been very pleased with customer feedback so far.\nWe exited the fourth quarter at approximately 40, 17, 24. This means 40% gross margin, 17% operating expenses and 24% operating income, all as a percentage of revenue on a non-GAAP basis. As a reminder, our baseline financial model is 35, 15, 20. We will go into detail about our financials later in the call.\nLet's now discuss how we are servicing customers. Our Q4 NPS worldwide was 69% compared to 67% in Q3. Our North American NPS was 73% compared to 71% in Q3. Our average call wait time increased to 8.9 minutes in Q4 compared to 5.5 minutes in Q3 as we onboarded new installers and fielded more calls on our batteries. The ramp of our batteries has significantly increased call volumes as new installers learn how to commission the system and homeowners learn about the systems features. We're not happy about the higher wait time, and we are working on it to reduce it under a minute through staffing and training.\nDuring Q4, we also increased the number of field service technicians in the U.S. and Europe to provide on-site help to our installers particularly on batteries.\nLet's talk about manufacturing. Our operations team did a great job flexing manufacturing as 2021 played out. As we have discussed in the past earnings call, the global supply chain situation -- the global supply chain is still under a little bit of stress. But our situation has been stable primarily due to diligent supplier management and qualification of alternate suppliers during the past year. Our supply of AC FET drivers is at a very healthy level, and we have 5 sources for AC FET drivers.\nFor ASIC used in our microinverters, our supply was quite healthy in Q4, and we continue to manage it closely as we ramp IQ8, and we have 2 foundry sources for our ASIC.\nWith the growing demand for our microinverters, we remain vigilant regarding global supply chain and logistics. Given our strong demand, we added a fully automated line in Q4, bringing quarterly capacity to 2.25 million microinverters in Mexico. We had already added a second fully automated line earlier in 2021 at our contract manufacturer, Salcomp in India, bringing that quarterly capacity to about 1.5 million microinverters.\nAlong with our existing capacity in China, we can now do a little more than 5 million microinverters per quarter in total for all microinverters worldwide. We are also planning to add a contract manufacturing facility for microinverters in Europe by the end of this year. We see rapid growth in the region and would like to service customers better.\nLet's now talk about batteries. Our 2 sources for battery cell packs have increased their capacity to 180 megawatt hours per quarter from 120. Our existing cell pack suppliers are capable of adding even more capacity if needed. And we are continuing discussions with additional cell pack suppliers as well.\nAs always, there are a few components that we are managing to ensure we don't have a supply disruption. There is never dull day for our operations team in these times.\nOur lead times for batteries are still long today at approximately 14 to 16 weeks primarily due to logistics challenges, which are global. The lead time should come down once global shipping and port conditions improve.\nLet's move on to the regions. Our U.S. and international revenue mix for Q4 was 82% and 18%, respectively. For 2021, we achieved record revenue across all regions with more than 78% growth year-on-year. Our U.S. and international revenue mix for the full year was 80% and 20%, respectively.\nIn the U.S., the revenue increased 74% year-on-year. We reported record revenue and sell-through from our distribution partners to installers for both micro inverters and batteries in Q4. Our microinverter channel inventory was at a healthy level at the end of Q4, but our storage channel inventory remained tight due to strong demand and logistics challenges. We expect microinverter channel inventory to remain healthy in Q1 and storage channel inventory to improve.\nIn Europe, revenue more than doubled year-on-year. I am very pleased with our team's performance and excited about the growth in 2022. During 2021, we expanded into Italy with solar microinverters and introduced batteries in Germany and Belgium. We do plan to introduce batteries in other countries in Europe steadily throughout 2022.\nIn Asia Pacific region, revenue increased 80% year-on-year. Heading into 2022, we look to capitalize on the industry's recovery from COVID restrictions as well as recent regulatory changes that are favorable to our software-defined AC architecture.\nWe plan to introduce batteries in Australia in the second half of 2022.\nIn Latin America, revenue increased 77% year-on-year. We remain quite bullish about our solar plus storage business in Puerto Rico and expect steady growth there in the next few quarters. We're also very pleased with the progress we are making in Brazil as we started ramping IQ7+ microinverters installers in Q4.\nNow that we covered all the regions, let's discuss the overall bookings for Q1. Our overall customer demand for Q1 is quite robust for both microinverters and batteries and exceeds the higher end of our guidance range. The component availability is certainly better than what we experienced last year.\nWe are primarily left with logistics challenges, which are global in general and not very specific to Enphase. We are quite optimistic that our supply will catch up to demand during the year.\nLet's talk about our storage systems. We shipped 100.2 megawatt hours of IQ batteries, which was a significant 53% increase from Q3. As I mentioned, our lead times are a little long at around 14 to 16 weeks mainly due to logistics challenges. We expect to ship between 110 and 120 megawatt hours of batteries in Q1. This represents a 15% growth from Q4.\nDue to the increase in logistics costs, which are significant and increase in component costs driven by inflation, we are implementing a modest price increase on our batteries beginning March of 2022.\nLet's talk about installer training on battery. By the end of Q4, we trained approximately 4,845 installer personnel, representing approximately 2,000-plus installation companies. Our hands-on storage training continued through the use of mobile vans and regional training centers in the fourth quarter.\nWe are continuing to work on commissioning times for installers while adding features such as load control and generator compatibility to our batteries. We expect to introduce batteries in North America and Australia with the modularity of 5 kilowatt hour and double the continuous and peak power in the second half of 2022. We believe this will not only enhance the customer experience significantly, it will also bring down the cost.\nLet's talk about new products. We started production shipments of IQ8 microinverters for customers in North America in Q4 -- late Q4. The IQ8 fundamentally changes the paradigm for solar technology, which otherwise requires a great connection to operate. IQ8 can form a microgrid during a power outage, using only sunlight, providing backup power even without a battery.\nFor homeowners who want a battery, there are no sizing restrictions on pairing an Enphase battery with an IQ8 solar system. We also expect to introduce IQ8 microinverters internationally in the second half of 2022.\nLet's now talk about the IQ8 full system for small commercial solar applications. We have achieved compliance on the 640 watt AC microinverter for North America, and we are now focused on getting the full system and installer platform ready. We expect pilot shipments of the full system to select installers in this quarter, Q1, with volume shipments beginning in Q2.\nLet's go to ClipperCreek, an acquisition we completed in Q4. ClipperCreek offers EV charging solutions for residential and commercial customers in the U.S. They have been a pioneer in the EV charging market since 2006 and have sold more than 110,000 Level 2 charging stations -- AC charging stations since inception.\nThe business is very healthy, and the gross margins are in line with Enphase. The ClipperCreek brand has a reputation for quality -- high quality and great service which we like a lot.\nLet me outline our plans for ClipperCreek. We plan to transfer manufacturing to our contract manufacturing facility in Mexico by the end of this year so that we can rapidly scale the business and support demand. We're also looking forward to introducing the products imminently to distribution and installation partners in the U.S.\nIn addition, we plan to introduce connectivity in every charger we'll be shipping to enable smart EV charging with the Enphase app. This will enable charging on a schedule, tariff optimization and charging with green electrons from an Enphase solar plus storage home energy system. For the long term, we plan to work on bidirectional charging and great services integration for vehicle-to-home and vehicle-to-grid applications.\nLet me go to grid services. In December, we announced our participation in Arizona Public Service, APS, residential battery grid services program. The program offers homeowners who install Enphase batteries in APS' territory the chance to participate and earn money through onetime upfront incentives. We believe this new program from APS will help accelerate the adoption of Enphase systems in Arizona.\nWe have previously discussed our participation in the Connected Solutions Program and Hawaiian Electric Battery Bonus Bid Services programs. As a reminder, Connected Solutions an incentive program implemented by 3 utilities in Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island to reduce electrical demand during high-use periods.\nThe Hawaiian Electric Battery Bonus Grid Services Program offers incentives for homeowners on the island of Oahu who install a new home battery.\nWe also have about a dozen new grid services engagements in the pipeline, and we look forward to working with more utilities and aggregators in the months ahead.\nLet's talk about the installer digital platform. We are working to release Solargraf Pro later this quarter to improve the installer experience with an all-in-one solar and storage design and proposal tool that incorporates shading analysis, the ability to detect obstructions on the roof and 3D modeling of homes all driven by AI.\nThe product is currently being piloted by key installers -- some of our top installers and will be released later this quarter. The former solar business of DIN Engineering, now Enphase NIDA, provides proposal and permitting services. There, we have added significant resources to accelerate automation, and we expect to offer enhanced permitting services in the second half of the year.\nAs part of our efforts to further strengthen the installer digital platform, we acquired 365 Pronto in Q4. The company offers a predictive software platform dedicated to simplifying maintenance by matching cleantech asset owners to a local and on-demand workforce of service providers. The software platform will provide our installers the ability to service their own O&M contract.\nLet me now give you an update on our Enphase Installer Network or EIN. We have now onboarded approximately 1,130 installers to our EIN worldwide through a highly selective process focused on installation quality and an exceptional homeowner experience.\nNext, I would like to comment on the California NEM 3 proposed decision or PD, which was announced originally in December. In our opinion, the PD in its current form unfairly penalizes solar-only systems by imposing fixed charges, significantly reducing export compensation and retroactively changing the length of the original NEM contract. The PD was meant to encourage the transition from solar-only to solar-plus storage.\nWhile we believe this transition is a correct long-term goal to meet California's energy targets, storage is not yet fully mature or 100% attached in terms of cost, in terms of supply, in terms of permitting, warranty and training. We would like to see a modified PD where the fixed charges are removed, the original length of the existing NEM contracts are restored and a multiyear glide path is established to gradually reduce the export compensation. We are working diligently with various stakeholders to try and influence a better outcome in order to eliminate any market disruptions and create a win-win for all rate payers and utilities.\nIn summary, we are pleased with our overall performance. As a reminder, our strategy is to build best-in-class home energy systems and deliver them to homeowners through our installation and distribution partners enabled by an installer digital platform.\nWith our recent acquisitions, we are now able to offer more complete home energy systems to our partners, comprising of solar, batteries, grid services, load control, EV chargers and even compatibility with most third-party generators. We can also now offer design and proposal software, permitting services, installation and commissioning software, fleet management and monitoring software and, finally, O&M services for our installers through the digital platform.\nI would like to thank our employees for their hard work towards our strategy and continued dedication to advancing a sustainable future for all. Before I turn the call over to discuss our financials, I want to inform you that Eric is retiring from Enphase. His last day at Enphase will be February 14.\nHe has been a great partner to me over the last 3.5 years, and the financial leadership helped drive our sustained profitability and shareholder value. We would like to thank him for his service and wish him well as he takes time to spend with his family.\nI'm pleased to announce that Mandy Yang, our Chief Accounting Officer and Corporate Treasurer, has accepted the role of CFO effective February 15. And with Mandy as our CFO, we will have a seamless transition as we continue to deliver growth and operational excellence. Eric will be in an advisory capacity with Enphase through June 30 to assist with this transition.\nWith that, I will hand the call over to Eric for his review of our financial results. Eric?\n\nEric Branderiz\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Enphase Energy, Inc.\n\nThanks, Badri, and good afternoon, everyone. I would like to convey my deep gratitude for my experience at Enphase. I have had the pleasure to work with not only a very talented executive team but also a remarkable group of professionals who have shown such hard work and dedication to the company.\nI want to especially thank Badri for his partnership and leadership in driving Enphase success. I plan to remain a shareholder, and I wish the company continued success.\nI will provide more details related to our fourth quarter of 2021 financial results and hand over the call over to Mandy to provide our business outlook for the first quarter of 2022. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the IR section of our website.\nTotal revenue for Q4 was $412.7 million, representing an increase of 17% sequentially and a quarterly record. We shipped approximately 1,082 megawatts DC of microinverters and 100.2 megawatt hours of IQ batteries in the quarter.\nNon-GAAP gross margin for Q4 was 40.2% compared to 40.8% in Q3. Non-GAAP gross margin was impacted by product mix. GAAP gross margin was 39.6% for Q4.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses were $68.2 million for Q4 compared to $57.3 million for Q3. The sequential increase was primarily due to increased investment in product launches, R&D and IT infrastructure.\nGAAP operating expenses were $105.6 million for Q4 compared to $103 million for Q3. GAAP operating expenses for Q4 included $35 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $2.7 million of acquisition-related expenses and amortization for acquiring tangible assets.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, income from operations for Q4 was $97.7 million compared to $85.9 million for Q3. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $57.7 million for Q4 compared to $37.4 million for Q3. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q4 was $102.8 million compared to $84.2 million for Q3. This resulted in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.73 for Q4 compared to $0.60 per share for Q3.\nGAAP net income for Q4 was $52.6 million compared to GAAP net income of $21.8 million for Q3. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.37 for Q4 compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.15 for Q3.\nWe exited Q4 with a total of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of approximately $1 billion compared to approximately $1.4 billion at the end of Q3. We repurchased our common stock for a total amount of $300 million on the open market in December 2021 against our previously announced $500 million share repurchase authorization. Together with the $200 million of share buyback in May 2021, we repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares in 2021 for a total of $500 million with an average price of $55 per share. This represents approximately 2.4% of our outstanding shares.\nIn Q4, we generated $97.2 million in cash flow from operations and $84.1 million in free cash flow. For the year 2021, we generated a record $315.5 million of free cash flow. Capital expenditure was $13.2 million for Q4 to expand both microinverter and storage manufacturing capacity as well as costs related to new product development.\nI will now hand over the call to Mandy to discuss our Q1 outlook. There is no greater joy for me to see her accepting this role as the CFO of Enphase. I cannot think of anyone more capable or with higher integrity to take on the challenges of this function as the company continues to grow both organically and in complexity.\nMandy is a remarkable professional with the right combination of finance and accounting technical skills, coupled with a proven track record of building large global finance teams. Under her leadership, she will take this function to an even higher level of excellence. Mandy has been Chief Accounting Officer and Corporate Treasury at Enphase for the past 3.5 years and has done an outstanding job leading the controllership, finance operations, internal audit and controlled treasury and tax functions of Enphase. With this transition to her as the new CFO, we will not miss a beat. And I'm very pleased she has accepted this new role. Mandy?\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nThanks, Eric. It's been great for me to work with Eric at Enphase. Under his leadership, we have built an exceptional finance team, and I look forward to building on that foundation.\nWe expect our revenue for the first quarter of 2022 to be within a range of $420 million to $440 million, which includes shipments of 110 to 120 megawatt hours of IQ batteries. We expect GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 37% to 40% and non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 38% to 41%, which excludes stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition-related amortization.\nWe expect our GAAP operating expenses to be within the range of $130.5 million to $133.5 million, including a total of approximately $63 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. The estimated stock-based compensation expenses include approximately $12.3 million -- for the earn-outs and are tied to certain performance targets to be paid in the company's stock for the acquisitions of ClipperCreek and 365 Pronto. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $67.5 million to $70.5 million.\nWith that, I will now open the line for questions."

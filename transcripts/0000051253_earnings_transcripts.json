[Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to introduce Michael Bender, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nMichael Bender\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's Third Quarter 2025 Conference Call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay.\nDuring the call, we'll be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance and business outlook. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K and press release, both of which can be found on our website.\nToday's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures are set forth in the press release. Also, please note that all the sales and adjusted operating EBITDA growth numbers that we will be speaking to on the call are all on a comparable currency-neutral basis, unless otherwise noted.\nWith me on the call today is our CEO, Erik Fyrwald; and our CFO, Michael DeVeau. We will begin with the prepared remarks and then take questions at the end.\nWith that, I would now like to turn the call over to Erik.\n\nJon Erik Fyrwald\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. IFF's third quarter results demonstrate continued execution. Our performance this quarter shows that we continue to make progress towards our goals, operate with efficiency and discipline and further strengthen our financial position. In a more challenging environment, we are doing what we said we would do as we expect to deliver financial results in line with our full year guidance that we outlined in February. We will do this as we continue reinvesting in our business and advancing our growth strategy while driving productivity.\nI'll start today's call by briefly summarizing the third quarter, and then I'll talk about some of the key strategic progress we have made so far this year. And then I'll turn it over to Mike DeVeau, who will provide for a detailed look at our results and segment performance in the third quarter, in addition to our outlook for the remainder of 2025. We will then open the call to answer your questions.\nTurning to Slide 6. We are seeing encouraging results as we build a stronger IFF. Through the actions we've taken to strengthen our customer focus and enhance productivity, IFF is improving its position to compete effectively and deliver value for all our stakeholders. We're operating in a dynamic environment with ongoing macro headwinds, geopolitical challenges and market uncertainty, influencing our customers and end consumers, plus we had a strong 9% comparable from last year. We anticipated this and have been clear that the second half would likely be more challenging than the first, and even so, sales remained steady, holding flat for the quarter.\nOur Scent and Taste businesses both continued to deliver solid growth in the third quarter, which helped offset softness in Food Ingredients and short-term pressures in Health and Biosciences. As I spoke about last quarter, most of the H&B pressure was related to expected slowdowns in the Health business isolated to North America. To address this, we are investing to increase innovation and expand our commercial capabilities to ensure IFF is set up to address the needs of customers now and in the future.\nWe continue to remain focused on what we can control in the current environment. IFF delivered strong adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 7% this quarter with a margin that improved by 130 basis points. Our focus on profitability continues to bear fruit as our results demonstrated strong profitability even in this lower growth environment. I am particularly encouraged as we are also doing this while our teams are reinvesting into our core businesses to position the company for long-term success.\nOn Slide 7, I'd like to share some of the exciting strategic progress we've made in the first 9 months of 2025. Earlier this year, we opened a Scent Creative Center in Dubai, a Citrus Innovation Center in Florida and expanded our LMR Naturals site in Grasse, France. All are significant initiatives that will further advance our innovation offerings and strengthen our go-to-market capabilities. Our customers are at the heart of everything we do, and these strategic investments are increasing our commercial pipeline that will start to bear fruit in mid- to late 2026 and into 2027.\nWe also deepened our commitment to innovation through external collaborations. We recently announced an exciting strategic collaboration with BASF to drive next-generation enzyme and polymer innovation, including our Design Enzymatic Biomaterials, or DEB, technology. This partnership enables us to develop more market-driven solutions that create sustainable value for both industry and the environment.\nAlso, earlier this year, we announced a joint venture with Kemira to provide high-performance sustainable alternatives to fossil fuel-based ingredients, also utilizing our DEB technology. Applying this technology not only provides superior purity and consistency compared to traditional biopolymers but also enhances performance across various applications.\nWe are already seeing commercial applications of this technology as we also announced that a major multinational CPG company has launched a new laundry detergent formulation enhanced by DEB technology, which delivers improved fabric softness and cleaning performance while replacing nonbiodegradable ingredients with a readily biodegradable alternative.\nIn addition, during the year, we reduced our leverage significantly, reaching approximately 2.5x net debt to EBITDA. After strengthening our balance sheet, we announced on our second quarter call a $500 million share repurchase authorization, making an initial move toward a more balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation. Over the past few years, we have made significant progress streamlining our portfolio, which has allowed us to reinvest in our core business, achieve our deleveraging targets and strengthen our financial flexibility.\nDuring 2025, we made significant progress on this as we completed the divestitures of Pharma Solutions & Nitrocellulose and announced the divestiture of our Soy Crush, Concentrates & Lecithin business to Bunge, which is aligned with our margin enhancement strategy. We continue to evaluate potential strategic alternatives for our Food Ingredients business as we look to drive our portfolio optimization strategy. While we do not have any additional information to share today, we are making very good progress, generating significant interest, and we'll keep you updated as we make further progress.\nOn a year-to-date basis, we've delivered sales growth of 2% and achieved adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 7%. This is primarily due to the immense efforts of IFFers all around the globe, continuously striving to innovate, deliver results for their customers and communities and elevate everyday products used by millions of consumers worldwide.\nWith that, I'll pass the call over to Mike to offer a closer look at this quarter's consolidated results. Mike?\n\nMichael DeVeau\n\nSenior Vice President of Corporate Finance & Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Erik, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. In the third quarter, IFF delivered revenue of nearly $2.7 billion, led by mid-single-digit growth in Scent and low single-digit growth in Taste. Our sales were flat against a strong 9% comparable and were up approximately 4.5% on a 2-year average basis.\nWe continue to focus on driving EBITDA growth through disciplined execution and margin improvement initiatives. In the third quarter, we delivered adjusted operating EBITDA of $519 million, a strong 7% increase. Our adjusted EBITDA margin also increased 130 basis points to 19.3%. Also worth noting is that our operational improvement plan continues to yield results in our Food Ingredients business.\nIn the third quarter, Food Ingredients delivered a strong adjusted operating EBITDA margin improvement of 230 basis points compared to last year. The team has done an excellent job on improving the margin profile over the past 2 years, where they increased adjusted operating EBITDA margin by over 400 basis points and are on track to achieve their mid-teen EBITDA margin profile.\nOn Slide 9, I will share additional details about this quarter's performance in each of our business segments. In Taste, sales increased 2% to $635 million with strong growth in Latin America and Europe, Africa and the Middle East. On a 2-year average basis, growth remained strong at approximately 8.5%. The segment also delivered profitability gains of roughly 2%, driven by favorable net pricing and cost discipline.\nOur Food Ingredients segment achieved sales of $830 million, down 3% versus the year ago period with strong growth in inclusions that were more than offset by softness primarily in Protein Solutions. As I mentioned, Food Ingredients had an excellent quarter in terms of profitability, where the team delivered adjusted operating EBITDA of $106 million, a 24% increase year-over-year.\nOur Health & Biosciences segment achieved $577 million in sales, which was flat versus the prior year. On a 2-year average basis, growth remained solid at approximately 6%. Growth in Food Biosciences, Home & Personal Care and Animal Nutrition was offset primarily by expected softness in Health, specifically in North America.\nIn this market, we've improved our leadership team, placing a strong emphasis on commercial and marketing capabilities. Their objective is to leverage our strong R&D pipeline and win with a broader set of customers to capture strong growth potential in that market. And while the fourth quarter will remain a challenge, we expect trends to improve in 2026. In the third quarter, H&B adjusted operating EBITDA grew 3%, driven primarily by productivity.\nScent delivered a strong quarter of sales growth with net sales of $652 million, up 5% year-over-year. On a 2-year average basis, growth remained strong at approximately 7%. Third quarter performance was driven by 20% increase in Fine Fragrance and a low single-digit performance in Consumer Fragrance. As expected, Fragrance Ingredients was under pressure and declined low single digits as growth in Specialties were more than offset by declines in Commodities.\nAs a reminder, we are strategically shifting our Fragrance Ingredients portfolio towards higher growth and higher value-added specialties. We will do this by leveraging R&D and biotech for new molecule development. Our goal is to accelerate the pace of our captive releases to ensure we can differentiate ourselves and grow disproportionately in this margin-accretive business. Within Scent, volume growth drove the segment's $135 million in adjusted operating EBITDA, a 6% increase year-over-year.\nTurning to Slide 10. Our cash flow from operations totaled $532 million year-to-date, and CapEx was $406 million or roughly 5% of sales. Our free cash flow position in the third quarter totaled $126 million. This year, we have paid $306 million in dividends through the end of the third quarter, and our cash and cash equivalents was $621 million. As of quarter end, our gross debt was approximately $6 billion, a roughly $200 million decrease from last year and more than $3 billion decrease year-over-year.\nOur trailing 12-month credit-adjusted EBITDA totaled roughly $2.15 billion, in line with last quarter, while our net debt to credit-adjusted EBITDA remained constant at 2.5x. We will continue to be disciplined in our capital allocation priorities. Reaching our deleveraging goals was a strong achievement, and we are now focused on preserving this foundation through operational performance, specifically driving improvements in profitability and net working capital.\nLastly, on Slide 11, I will walk you through our outlook for the balance of the year. We have talked today and in prior quarters about the environment in which we are currently operating. Our touch points across our global business and with our customers have allowed us to forecast this year well as our teams are delivering results in line with the guidance ranges we communicated in February.\nBased on our year-to-date actuals and expected fourth quarter performance, we are reiterating our full year 2025 guidance. As a reminder, we are expecting sales to be in the range of $10.6 billion to $10.9 billion and adjusted operating EBITDA to be between $2 billion and $2.15 billion. On a comparable currency-neutral basis, we expect to finish the year at the low end of our 1% to 4% sales growth guidance range as shared last quarter and near the midpoint of our 5% to 10% EBITDA growth range.\nWe believe that this is the right call to maintain our full year guidance even with a wider range implied for the fourth quarter. It is consistent with the message we have shared all year, which is staying focused on what we said we would deliver even in a challenging environment. For the fourth quarter, we expect our typical seasonality resulting in a step down in absolute sales and margin. And as a reminder, we again face another strong comparable versus the prior year with 12% growth in Taste, 7% growth in Scent and 6% growth in H&B.\nWith that, I would now like to turn the call back to Erik for closing remarks.\n\nJon Erik Fyrwald\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks, Mike. Taking a look at the year so far, our global team has delivered in a difficult environment with revenue and profitability increasing year-over-year. I'm proud of what our team has accomplished, yet we continue to strive for more. We are continuing to serve our customers with excellence while investing in an exciting innovation pipeline and positioning IFF to deliver stronger profitable growth on a sustained basis.\nWe are focusing on what we can control. Our strategy is clear. Our team is executing, and we have confidence in our ability to deliver increasing value for our shareholders and all stakeholders. I know we are building a stronger IFF that will be well positioned for 2026 and beyond.\nThank you, and I'll now open the call for your questions."

Our second quarter results reflect continued progress with growth improved profitability and divestitures that have strengthened our financial position and our net debt-to-EBITDA is now down to 2.5x. This progress shows that the steps we are taking including creating and bringing leading innovation to customers and driving operational excellence is paying off.\nI will start with an executive summary of some accomplishments so far this year and then I'll turn the call over to Mike DeVeau, who will provide a more detailed look at our financial results for the second quarter and our current outlook for the rest of 2025. Then we'll open it up for your questions. On this next slide, I'd like to summarize our recent results and the progress we are making towards building a more competitive growth-oriented IFF. We achieved solid growth in profitability in the first half of 2025 and with 3% sales growth and 7% adjusted operating EBITDA growth.\nI'm also very pleased that during the quarter, we completed the divestitures of our Pharma Solutions and nitrocellulose businesses and successfully completed our debt tender offering. These actions enabled us to reduce our leverage to 2.5x ahead of our target of less than 3x further solidifying our financial position. This is the first time IFF has been below 3.0x net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA since 2018. And yesterday, we also announced the divestiture of our Soy Crush, Concentrates & Lecithin business to Bunge. These products better fit with Bunge and it's another step in our focus on products with differentiated innovation that enhances margins. And this will get us closer to our mid-teens EBITDA margin goal for our food ingredients business. And as we streamline our fruit ingredients portfolio, it also strengthens our ability to continue evaluating strategic alternatives for this business.\nWe also announced a new $500 million share repurchase authorization to return capital to our shareholders. This Board authorization shows the confidence we have in the future of IFF and marks an important step toward a balanced and disciplined capital allocation strategy prioritizes both business and reinvestment to drive sustained growth and return of capital to shareholders. Looking ahead, we remain on track to deliver our full year 2025 guidance that we outlined earlier this year despite an increasingly challenging operating environment, and the time it is taking for the increased investments in R&D and in Health and Biosciences capacity that we started to action through last year to show up in increased sales.\nWe continue to focus on the factors within our control. And as we said on the first quarter earnings call, have prepared for a more difficult second half, particularly given the strong prior year comparison in the third of last year. And while we expect to be at the lower end of our 1% to 4% currency-neutral sales growth in 2025, we are confident in our ability to navigate evolving conditions respond swiftly to emerging challenges and opportunities and maintain disciplined execution throughout the remainder of the year. We have strengthening commercial and R&D pipelines that I am confident will begin to show more impact in 2026 and build for full benefit in 2027.\nBefore I pass it over to Mike, I want to take a moment to thank our IFF efforts all around the world for driving our progress so far this year. They've started to build positive momentum, including developing leading innovations that will show increasing value in the coming years. And they are doing this while strengthening our productivity muscle to enable us to continue to invest in growth despite increasing market challenges. With that, I'll pass the call over to Mike to take a closer look at our consolidated results for the quarter. Mike?\n\nMichael DeVeau\n\nSenior Vice President of Corporate Finance & Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Erik, and good morning, everyone. IFF delivered second quarter sales of just greater than $2.75 billion, a 3% increase year-over-year. We achieved sales growth across all our businesses, primarily driven by volume gains including mid-single-digit growth in taste and health and Biosciences. In the second quarter, we delivered adjusted operating EBITDA of $552 million, a solid 6% increase with our adjusted operating EBITDA margin increasing 50 basis points year-over-year.\nTurning now to Slide 8. I will provide a closer look at our performance by segment. I'll begin with Pharma Solutions which had a strong month, delivering sales of $103 million, a 21% year-over-year increase while also recording 5% growth in profitability. As Erik mentioned, we successfully completed the divestiture of Pharma Solutions on May 1, and this will be the last time we report figures for that segment. In Taste, sales were $631 million, a 6% increase, driven by another strong quarter of commercial performance. Growth was strongest in Latin America and the Europe, Africa and Middle East region. This segment also recorded another quarter of profitability growth, with adjusted operating EBITDA totaling $125 million, a 3% increase from the prior year. Profitability gains were driven primarily by volume growth and favorable net pricing.\nIn the first half, taste finished with 6% sales growth and 12% adjusted operating EBITDA growth. include ingredients had sales of $850 million, a 1% increase from the prior year, driven by growth in inclusions and emulsifiers contactors. The segment also delivered an excellent quarter of profitability where adjusted operating EBITDA grew 21% with volume, favorable net pricing and productivity driving margin expansion. It is worth noting that we continue to execute our operational improvement plan to strengthen margins within our Food Ingredients business. We significantly improved profitability in the segment this quarter with a 170 basis point improvement in adjusted operating EBITDA margin finishing at 14.6%.\nWe will continue to drive improvement include ingredients as we move through 2025 and into 2026. Our Health & Bioscience segment grew 4% in the quarter as broad-based growth was led by strong gains in health, food Biosciences and Animal Nutrition. We also delivered adjusted operating EBITDA of $151 million, a 3% increase as volume growth and productivity gains more than offset reinvestment. Lastly, Sense also achieved sales growth with net sales of $603 million, up 1% year-over-year against a strong double-digit year ago comparison driven by double-digit growth in Fine Fragrance and low single-digit growth in consumer fragrances. Fragrance Ingredients was down as growth in Specialty Ingredients was more than offset by declines in commodities as a result of low-cost competition.\nTo counteract this and to build long-term competitive advantage, we are investing in new molecule development to overindex tort specialty ingredients. In the quarter, Sense delivered $130 million in adjusted operating EBITDA as profitability was impacted primarily by unfavorable net pricing due to a timing lag.\nTurning now to Slide 9. Cash flow from operations totaled $368 million year-to-date, while CapEx was $274 million or roughly 5% of sales. Our free cash flow position in Q2 totaled $94 million, a sequential increase of more than $140 million from last quarter. We paid $204 million in dividends through the end of the second quarter, and our cash and cash equivalents totaled $816 million. As of June 30, our gross debt was approximately $6.2 billion, a decrease of more than $3 billion compared to the year ago period. Our trailing 12-month credit adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $2.2 billion. I'm happy to report that we reached our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA target in the second quarter will be finished at 2.5x.\nNow that our leverage is within our target range, I would like to take a moment to talk about our focus on free cash flow generation and walk you through our revised capital allocation strategy. At IFF, we are committed to increasing our free cash flow conversion. This business is very cash generative, and we are aware of the responsibility to invest our free cash flow carefully on our shareholders' behalf. We view every investment decision through a lens of return on invested capital. This means we are focused on prioritizing capital deployment where it can generate the highest long-term returns for our shareholders.\nFirst, we prioritize reinvestment in the highest return areas of our portfolio. Our CapEx is being carefully directed towards businesses and initiatives that offer strong value creation potential, particularly in innovation, capacity expansion, productivity and digitalization. Second, we have made meaningful progress in strengthening our balance sheet. Maintaining this new level of financial flexibility is a priority as it enables us to navigate through macroeconomic uncertainty while preserving the capacity to reinvest in the business and return capital to shareholders. Third, we remain committed to delivering consistent returns to shareholders. Our dividend continues to be a central component of our investment proposition. We are focused on maintaining and over time, growing our dividend as we grow earnings.\nFourth, today, we've launched our dilution plus share repurchase program. At minimum, this program is designed to offset annual dilution from equity compensation, which equates to approximately $75 million to $100 million per year. We also retained the flexibility to increase our repurchases as we increase our free cash flow generation and when IFF shares are trading below intrinsic value. We plan to begin our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2025.\nFinally, we continue to evaluate highly selective value-accretive acquisitions and strategic partnerships. We are very mindful of our challenged track record in this area, and we are committed to being very disciplined going forward. These opportunities must meet clear financial and strategic criteria, including alignment of our core capabilities, potential to expand our addressable markets and have a clear path to synergies.\nIn summary, as we increase our free cash flow generation, we will execute a balanced and disciplined capital allocation strategy, one that enables us to reinvest in the business, return capital to shareholders and maintain financial flexibility and strength. Above all, we will be very disciplined with our decisions guided by a clear focus on generating long-term returns.\nNow turning to Slide 11, I'd like to walk you through our outlook for the remainder of 2025. As we've discussed in previous quarters, the macroeconomic environment continues to be dynamic and at times challenging. From a voluming trade policies to weakening consumer demands, we are seeing a broader set of external pressures. That said, we want to underscore that we remain confident in our ability to execute through this environment and importantly, remain on track to deliver our 2025 guidance we set out earlier this year. With solid first half of the year behind us, we are reiterating our full year 2025 guidance. We continue to expect sales to be in the range of $10.6 billion to $10.9 billion.\nWhile the dollar ranges remain consistent with our prior outlook, it is worth noting that this now reflects modestly softer volume expectations that has been partially offset by favorable movements in currency. As Erik shared, this translates into the lower end of our 1% to 4% currency-neutral growth sales guidance range. On the bottom line, we continue to target adjusted operating EBITDA of $2 billion to $2.15 billion, reflecting currency-neutral growth of 5% to 10%. As we look ahead to the second half, we expect growth will moderate, particularly in Q3 due to a very strong year-over-year comparison. In the third quarter of 2024, we saw double-digit growth across key segments, where taste was up 15%, H&B was up 12% and Scent was up 10%, creating a high bar for comparison.\nIn particular, our health business had an exceptionally strong Q3 last year. And this, combined with ongoing softness in both North America and Chinese markets will present some headwinds in the upcoming quarters. And while the business will be challenged, we have made solid progress improving our innovation pipeline, and we'll continue to reinvest in R&D and commercial to ensure we grow our business at or above market, recognizing that it will take some time. Additionally, beginning in the third quarter, Pharma Solutions will be fully excluded from our results following the completion of the divestiture on May 1. As a reminder, Q2 included 1 month contribution from pharma business. So we expect to see a step down in absolute EBITDA levels in Q3, reflecting the full absence of this business.\nWith that, I'd now like to turn the call back over to Erik for closing remarks.\n\nJon Erik Fyrwald\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks, Mike. We're just a little more than halfway through the year, and I am proud of what our IFF team has already achieved serving customers, strengthening our innovation pipeline for the coming years and strengthening our productivity efforts. And we have done this while successfully selling and separating pharma and nitrocellulose to fix our balance sheet. We know that market conditions are getting tougher and that the second half comparisons are difficult given our high growth in the second half of 2024, but we are clear on our strategy are getting stronger at commercial innovation, production and productivity execution and we'll get through this as we build strength for 2026 and beyond.\nThank you, and I'll now open up the call for your questions."

We are pleased to report.\n\nAt volume and productivity gains more than offset our investments with segment delivered adjusted operating EBITDA.\n\n$138 million, a 3% increase on a year over year comparable currency neutral basis.\n\nLastly, achieved another solid quarter, including double digit growth in fine fragrance and single digit growth in consumer fragrances net sales for the quarter totaled $614 million up 4% year over year on a comparable currency neutral basis.\n\nAnd we also achieved an adjusted operating EBITDA of $144 million up 4% on a comparable currency neutral basis as volume growth and productivity gains continue to drive performance.\n\nTurning now to slide nine to discuss our cash flow and leverage position.\n\nCash flow from operations totaled $127 million year to date, and Capex was $179 million or roughly 6% of sales as we stepped up reinvestment as shared earlier this year.\n\nQ1 is typically our lowest free cash flow quarter of the year due to our annual bonus payout and seasonality.\n\nWe also paid $102 million in dividends in the quarter and cash and cash equivalents totaled $650 million, including $37 million in assets held for sale.\n\nAs of March 31, our gross debt was approximately $9 3 billion, a decrease of more than $1 billion compared to the year ago period.\n\nOur trailing 12 month credit adjusted EBITDA totaled roughly $2 2 billion in line with last quarter, while our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA remained largely unchanged at three nine times.\n\nWith our successful divestiture of pharma solutions, we recently announced the commencement of a debt tender offer as part of our broader strategy to strengthen balance sheet and optimize our capital structure.\n\nThis allows us to deliver on our commitments and achieve our target net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA target of below three times.\n\nNow on slide 10, I want to take a moment to address the evolving macroeconomic environment and the recent developments surrounding global tariffs.\n\nAs you are aware the U S administration's new tariff measures, particularly those impacting China have introduced a renewed layer of complexity to global supply chains and cost structures.\n\nOur ISF global footprint with manufacturing and sourcing capabilities across many countries gives us the flexibility to adapt quickly.\n\nIn past cycles of trade disruptions, including prior rounds of tariffs, we've demonstrated our ability to pivot operationally, while continuing to successfully serve our customers.\n\nAs part of our mitigation strategy, we've taken actions to adjust our purchasing and redistribute our production in ways that minimize our exposure.\n\nBy shifting procurement to alternative supply sources and balancing production across our global network, we have been able to offset a significant portion of inflationary pressures.\n\nIn select cases, where cost impacts were unavoidable, we are implementing targeted price pricing surcharges to recover incremental cost.\n\nWe do recognize that sweeping changes in global trade policy could contribute to broader macroeconomic volatility, including the potential to kept certain regions into a recession.\n\nThis risk is not currently embedded in our guidance.\n\nHowever, we are fortunate that the majority of Iff's portfolio is grounded in resilient essential end markets, particularly food beverage household and personal care.\n\nWe view this environment not only as a challenge, but also as an opportunity.\n\nOur ability to serve our customers globally with localized innovation positions us as a resilient partner, particularly for customers looking to de risk their own supply chain.\n\nAlso amid the evolving environment, we want to reaffirm our commitment to Iff's long term strategy, we remain focused on strengthening our business through consistent reinvestment in core growth drivers R&D commercial digital and capacity.\n\nEven as we manage short term external pressures, we will not compromise our future. Instead, we are accelerating our efforts to drive structural productivity and operational efficiency.\n\nThis approach enables us to both navigate today's challenges and continue investing ensuring we deliver on our profitability commitments, while positioning for long term success.\n\nFrom a financial planning perspective, we are maintaining our guidance ranges for the full year 2025 inclusive of the current tariff situation.\n\nWe expect sales to be in the range of $10 6 billion to $10 9 billion, representing currency neutral growth of between 1% to 4%.\n\nWe are now expecting approximately 2% adverse impact on revenue from foreign exchange down from 4% previously.\n\nAnd approximately 7% adverse impact due to divestitures versus 5% previously given the earlier close of the pharma solutions divestiture.\n\nFrom a bottom line perspective, we continue to expect that we will deliver a 2025 adjusted operating EBITDA range of between two to two , one 5 billion representing currency neutral growth between five and 10%.\n\nWe are now expecting approximately 3% adverse impact to EBITDA from foreign exchange down from 6% previously and approximately 8% adverse impact due to divestitures versus 6% previously again due to the earlier close of pharma solutions.\n\nWith that I will now turn it back to Eric for closing remarks.\n\nThanks, Mike.\n\nresults, we were able to deliver in the first quarter continued to reflect the strength of our execution and our investments in our people and our portfolio.\n\nWith this growth we have been able to maintain our strong momentum from 2024.\n\nComplete key divestitures to strengthen our portfolio and meet our deleveraging targets.\n\nBut we still have a lot of work ahead of us and we are always focused on strengthening ISF. So we can help our customers win in any market environment.\n\nBuilding, a strong company means continuing to reinvest in catalysts for our growth include.\n\nIncluding research and development commercial capabilities and integral capital expenses.\n\nWill bolster our foundation and enable us to achieve sustainable profitable long term growth for our shareholders.\n\nAnd as we move forward, we will continue to focus on bringing innovative sustainable solutions to the market that meet customer needs.\n\nAnd delivering value that makes us the clear partner of choice for customers around the world.\n\nI am confident we are well on our way.\n\nThank you and I'll now open the floor for questions.\n\nThank you at this time, we will now begin today's Q&A portion.\n\nI'd like to ask a question.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the IFF Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would like like to introduce Michael [indiscernible], Head of Investor Relations. You may begin, Michael.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Conference Call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com.\nPlease note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay. During the call, we'll be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance and business outlook. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K and press release, both of which can be found on our website.\nToday's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in the press release that we issued yesterday.\nWith me on the call today is our CEO, Erik Fyrwald; and our CFO, Michael DeVeau. We will begin with prepared remarks and to take questions at the end.\nWith that, I would now like to turn the call over to Erik.\n\nJon Erik Fyrwald\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks, Mike, and hello, everyone. I'm excited to walk through our full year 2024 financial results and reflect on the progress we've made over the past year. I'll then turn the call over to Michael DeVeau, who will provide a more detailed look at our fourth quarter and our financial outlook for 2025. Then I'll come back to discuss our go-forward priorities in 2025 to maintain our momentum and continue to drive long-term profitable growth.\nWe'll then open the call for questions. Starting with Slide 6, I'd like to recap the significant improvement and progress achieved by IFF over the past year, supported by consistent execution across the businesses. One year ago, when I joined IFF, I found an exciting company that was not delivering on its full potential with a new perspective on our priorities and renewed focus on execution by our executive leadership team, we got back to basics in 2024. The renewed commitment to operational discipline by our global teams led to improved financial results, including strong growth in both revenue and profit.\nThe transition to our end-to-end business-led operating model, splitting nourish into focused taste and food ingredients business units and our new operating system, have better connected us to customer end markets and increased our line of sight into customer dynamics. These initiatives have driven greater accountability across the organization, while enabling our global teams to be faster, more efficient and more responsive to the evolving needs of our customers. As part of our updated strategy, we have increased emphasis on biotechnology as an important differentiator and capability across our core business segments.\nThis focus ensures that we are investing in the necessary resources to leverage this competitive advantage and serve our customers more effectively. Now alongside this effort, we also implemented a program to increase investments across research and development, commercial capabilities and CapEx, focused on our high-growth, high-margin Health & Biosciences, Taste and Scent businesses to enhance our infrastructure and drive innovation at scale. We are also continuing to strengthen our talent with several key hires and internal promotions that solidify the next generation of IFF leadership. I'm also pleased to share that our employee engagement levels improved significantly compared to 2023, demonstrating the success of our return to focus on bringing leading innovation to customers.\nLastly, we announced the next phase in the evolution of our Board of Directors, appointing 3 new Board members with the backgrounds, expertise and proven track records to support management to fulfill our long-term strategic vision and unlock greater value for our stakeholders. We are excited to welcome Cynthia Jamison, Dr. Mehmood Khan and Vincent Intrieri, to our Board. We also announced that Kevin O'Byrne will become our new Board Chair. He will succeed our current Chair, Roger Ferguson, who decided not to stand for reelection at the 2025 Annual Shareholder Meeting after 14 years of distinguished service. I thank Roger for all his support and guidance and look forward to working with Kevin in his new role.\nTaken together, all these efforts, focus on our people, customers, innovation and operational excellence form the foundation of our long-term profitable growth approach. On Slide 7, we'll take a closer look at our financial results in 2024. In 2024, IFF delivered $11.5 billion in sales, representing 6% comparable currency-neutral growth, our profitability also improved as IFF delivered over $2.2 billion in adjusted operating EBITDA, representing 16% comparable growth. broad-based volume improvement across our portfolio, strong execution by our commercial teams and the absence of destocking, drove growth across all our businesses.\nAt the beginning of 2024, we also adjusted our dividend policy to better support our deleveraging efforts and give us greater financial flexibility to invest in key growth areas across IFF. On the portfolio optimization front, we continue to progress towards completing the sale of pharma solutions, which we expect will occur in the first half of 2025. From a leverage standpoint, our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA ended 2024 at 3.8x, improving from 4.5x at the end of 2023. We continue to be committed to further deleveraging and the completed sale of Pharma Solutions will help achieve that goal. I'm very proud of our results and the growth we achieved in the past year and what has continued to be a dynamic market and geopolitical environment. Our businesses achieved solid financial performance and we've made very good progress delivering on our strategic and operational initiatives.\nWhile I'm pleased with the significant progress we've made over the last year, we still have a lot more work to do. In 2025, we plan to continue to strategically reinvest in R&D, commercial, capacity and technology as we aim to strengthen IFF and build a long-term sustainable platform that will deliver strong value creation for all our stakeholders. We are also focused on simplifying our business process and IT systems to improve efficiency and effectiveness. I want to also take a moment to thank our [ IFFers ] across the globe whose passion and relentless focus have been the reason for the value we've created and the innovation we've achieved. And as I mentioned on the previous slide, developing and promoting strong internal talent is a priority. Michael DeVeau is the kind of leader we elevate and I would like to congratulate him on his appointment to IFF's Chief Financial Officer.\nMike has been an integral part of IFF's global finance leadership over the last 15 years, he brings a deep understanding of the needs of our global finance operations and the value IFF delivers for the world's consumer product companies. I know Mike will continue to be an even more incredible asset to our team in this key role.\nI'll now pass it over to him to share a closer look at our fourth quarter results. Mike?\n\nMichael DeVeau\n\nSenior Vice President of Corporate Finance & Investor Relations\n\nThank you for the kind words, Erik, and hello, everyone. After more than 15 years at IFF, it is an honor to join my first call as CFO, and I look forward to working closely with all of you in my new role. Moving to Slide 8. As Erik noted, our strong performance and execution through 2024 continued in the fourth quarter and drove solid results. IFF generated revenue of $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter, an increase of 6% on a comparable currency-neutral basis, driven by broad-based growth across all our businesses and led by mid-single-digit volume improvement. We continue to realize the benefits from our ongoing productivity initiatives. Leading to the third consecutive quarter of margin expansion on a comparable basis. Adjusted operating EBITDA totaled $471 million in the quarter, a 5% increase on a comparable basis and their comparable adjusted operating EBITDA margin expanded by roughly 30 basis points.\nThis performance was led by volume growth and our ongoing productivity initiatives that were partly offset by increased incentive compensation expense and business reinvestment. On Slide 9, I'll provide a closer look at our performance by segment. In Nourish, sales were $1.4 billion, a 4% increase year-over-year on a comparable currency-neutral basis. Comparable adjusted operating EBITDA also increased by 4%. This was led by the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in flavors, a testament to that team's continued outperformance. In Functional Ingredients, mid-single-digit volume growth was mostly offset by our pricing actions. This was consistent with our previously announced price strategy for 2024.\nDouble-digit gains in home and personal care and grain processing alongside growth across nearly all our businesses resulted in another solid quarter for our Health & Biosciences segment. Sales came in at $553 million, a 6% year-over-year increase on a comparable currency-neutral basis. Comparable adjusted operating EBITDA decreased by 3% and largely due to strong year-ago comparable as well as business reinvestments that Erik mentioned earlier. In Scent, broad-based growth was led by double-digit increase in Fragrance Ingredients and high single-digit growth in Fine Fragrance. Net sales in the quarter totaled $579 million, up 7% year-over-year on a comparable currency-neutral basis, and we delivered adjusted operating EBITDA of $97 million, up 1% on a comparable basis, as volume growth and productivity gains were partially offset by higher reinvestment.\nFinally, Pharma Solutions delivered another strong quarter, achieving sales of $228 million a 12% year-over-year increase on a comparable basis while also recording excellent profitability growth of 81% to $47 million. Strong margin expansion was driven by volume and productivity gains and a favorable year ago comparable. Turning to Slide 10. Cash flow from operations totaled $1.1 billion for the full year and CapEx totaled $463 million or approximately 4% of sales. Our free cash flow position for the full year totaled $606 million, which is consistent to where we expected it to be at the beginning of the year.\nYear-to-date, we also distributed $514 million in dividends to our shareholders. Our cash and cash equivalents finished at $471 million at the end of the fourth quarter, including $2 million in assets held for sale. Our gross debt at the year-end was approximately $9 billion, a decrease of more than $1 billion compared to the year ago period following the completion of our divestiture of the cosmetic ingredients business. Our trailing 12-month credit adjusted EBITDA totaled $2.2 billion, in line with last quarter, and our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA improved to 3.8x.\nWe remain committed to achieving our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA target of below 3x following the completion of our Pharma Solutions divestiture, which we expect to be complete in the first half of 2025. On Slide 11, I'd like to share our outlook for 2025. While the current operating environment remains dynamic, we are cautiously optimistic about the year ahead as we look to build on our recent momentum. Coming off the strong year we had in 2024, we believe our 2025 plan strikes the right balance as we're targeting strong year-over-year improvements on a currency-neutral basis and investing for the future growth of our business.\nPlease note that our full year guidance includes 6 months of Pharma Solutions with the divestiture assumed to close June 30, 2025. For comparability purposes, we expect that divestitures will have approximately a 5 percentage point adverse impact to sales growth and approximately a 6 percentage point adverse impact to adjusted EBITDA growth in 2025. In the event that we enclosed the pharma transaction earlier, we will adjust our guidance accordingly and reflect the lower contribution of the business. For the full year 2025, we expect sales to be in the range of $10.6 billion to $10.9 billion representing comparable currency-neutral growth of 1% to 4%. We believe that this will be driven by continued volume growth against a strong year ago comparable with increases across all our divisions, led by H&B, Taste and Scent, it should be noted that we expect the 2025 operating environment to be more normalized relative to 2024, which did benefit from the absence of destocking. Pricing is expected to be modestly favorable inclusive of FX-related pricing as raw material costs remain elevated and, in some cases, increasing year-over-year. On the bottom line, we expect to deliver full year 2025 adjusted operating EBITDA between $2 billion to $2.15 billion.\nOn a comparable currency-neutral basis, this translates to 5% to 10% EBITDA growth, which will be driven by gross margin expansion as a result of volume leverage and strong COGS productivity. Following a year of strong margin expansion and double-digit profitability growth in 2024, we will continue to reinvest in long-term value creation opportunities while balancing our near-term profitability objectives. What this means is that we will continue to drive strong productivity to mitigate general inflationary pressures and, at the same time, reinvest a large portion of our incentive compensation reset in R&D, innovation and commercial capabilities across our businesses, similar to the actions we've taken in the second half of 2024.\nWe believe that by doing so, not only will we drive short-term performance, we will further enhance our competitive position and generate strong returns on these organic investments. Based on foreign exchange rates, we expect foreign exchange will have approximately 4% full year adverse impact to sales growth and a 6% full year adverse impact to adjusted operating EBITDA growth. This is primarily driven by the strength of the euro, where the current rate is down relative to the [ 109 ] average in 2024. In addition, there are several other emerging market currencies such as the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso, where we have sued a modest devaluation versus the USD over the course of 2025. As previously communicated, we plan to increase our CapEx investments targeting approximately 6% of sales in 2025.\nApproximately half of this investment is maintenance CapEx, while the rest is split evenly between deferred investment catch-up, specifically in food ingredients, growth investments, such as capacity expansion in H&B, in India creative center in Scent and a creative center in Mexico in both taste and Scent as well as digital transformation, specifically related to our SAP HANA upgrade. We believe these investments will yield strong returns providing us with incremental growth and efficiency opportunities. As a reminder, we have resegmented the business into 5 divisions: Taste, Food Ingredients, Scent, H&B and Pharma and have adjusted our corporate allocations starting in 2025.\nPrior to the first quarter of 2025 earnings release, we plan to provide historical information for comparable purposes so that when we report first quarter earnings, you will have the appropriate baseline. Let me close by sharing that we are pleased with the strong progress and foundation we built in 2024. Our recent success gives us confidence in our outlook as we continue to execute our strategic and financial priorities.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call back to Erik.\n\nJon Erik Fyrwald\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks, Mike. Our outlook for the year reflects our confidence in our businesses and our ability to navigate macro uncertainties, while continuing to deliver for our customers. I want to turn to the priorities that will guide our strategy for 2025 and help us reach the goals we've outlined for the year. In 2025, our focus will continue to be on creating sustainable growth and returns on capital. We will continue to improve our businesses while also ensuring we have competitive cost, best-in-class support functions. As we've discussed, this will require some investment. At the same time, we will continue to drive growth and returns by increasing our investment in R&D, value-enhancing capital projects, and commercial actions to deliver profitable market share growth over time.\nWe will also keep exploring ways for our teams to better innovate, providing greater visibility and transparency into our sales pipeline and formalizing our sales targets and expectations across teams. We will continue to deliver cost savings through productivity initiatives and improvements in execution and processes throughout our businesses as we strengthen our continuous improvement culture. In addition to completing our planned divestiture of Pharma Solutions in the first half of the year, we will continue our ongoing portfolio assessment, including exploring appropriate opportunities to bolster our portfolio through value-creating bolt-on acquisitions.\nBut I can assure you, we will not do anything like another [ Frutarom ]. Importantly, we remain committed to consistently delivering solid financial results and meeting the goals we've outlined for 2025. Lastly, our people are the core of our success. And we will continue to invest time in developing talent and strengthening employee engagement to drive greater innovation and productivity. This, in turn, will enable us to better serve our customers enhancing customer satisfaction, which will help us capture new growth and market share over time. I am confident that these priorities with the collective efforts of our world-class global teams will make it happen.\nNow to close us out on Slide 13. Our solid performance in 2024 speaks to the success of our reinvigorated strategy and our focus on operational execution. All of us at IFF are excited to build on this foundation to further strengthen the business and reinforce our market position in 2025. We are well on our way to unlocking our full potential and continuing to deliver innovative and sustainable solutions for our customers and communities all around the world.\nThank you. And I'll now open up the call to your questions."

Welcome to IFF's Second Quarter 2024 Conference Call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay.\nDuring the call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance and business outlook.

We will begin our prepared remarks and then take any questions you may have at the end.\nWith that, I would now like to turn the call over to Erik.\n\nJon Erik Fyrwald\n\nCEO & Director\n\nWell, thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. I'm excited to join you all today and share the positive progress we are making in our strategic refresh and a solid performance IFF delivered in the second quarter. Also, during today's call, we will provide a brief update on the business-led strategic framework we are implementing across our organization.\nNow over the last 7 months, I've had the great pleasure to travel to many of our facilities and have met with customers that together represent over 1/3 of our sales and several thousand of our IFF team members. I've been able to get great feedback on what makes IFF special and strategic and tactical moves our leadership team needs to make to strengthen our company to better serve customers and improve our performance. We have listened and are making the changes we need to unleash more of the potential for today and for the future. And I'm very pleased that the entire IFF team is rallying behind our resulting strategic refresh to make IFF better at bringing leading innovation to our customers.\nNow beginning with Slide 6. IFF is building on last quarter's momentum and delivered another solid quarter, and I'm pleased with our performance and our results through the first half of the year, led by Scent, Health & Biosciences and Nourish, we delivered volume growth in the high single digits in the second quarter.\nOn a comparable basis, adjusted operating EBITDA increased 22% and driven by volume growth and productivity initiatives. This is a significant improvement over last year, and it is great to have IFF on a better sales growth and margin expansion track.\nNow looking ahead, we are cautiously optimistic for the remainder of 2024. Given this outlook and our solid performance to date this year, we are raising both our sales and adjusted operating EBITDA guidance for the full year. Glenn will speak more about this in a few minutes.\nNow it's encouraging that the steps we have taken and continue to take to refocus IFF on bringing customers leading innovation, while driving healthy productivity are yielding encouraging results. We are making solid progress advancing the business-led refresh, I've spoken about before, but we are not satisfied. We've got a lot more work to do. But I've got confidence that we are on the right track toward achieving IFF full potential.\nMoving to Slide 7. As I did last quarter, I would like to give a brief update on our progress as we work across the organization to refresh our strategy and focus on a business-led operating model. IFF has had a challenging last 3 years, constraints on our balance sheet led the company to underinvest in our core businesses and focused on divestitures. The company was not structured to effectively navigate the complex and fast-moving environment, and we underperformed relative to our peers. We have now had several quarters of growth as we have taken decisive actions to get our businesses back on track.\nOur strategy moving forward will be driven by 4 key pillars: our people, our customer focus, our position as an innovation powerhouse and our operational excellence. We will engage and empower our people to deliver customer success, while we drive profitable market share growth over time. We will also continue to develop sustainable new products and applications that are aligned with our customers' needs now and in the future, all while being relentless in our commitment to safety, quality and the efficiency in our operations.\nWe have already taken several steps toward resetting and refocusing our operating model, including the announced divestiture of Pharma Solutions, which is still on track to close in the first half of 2025 and our pivot to an end-to-end business-led operating model that will promote greater accountability and better performance. We are also working hard to improve employee engagement and are seeing positive results.\nFurthermore, each of our business units are building a 5-year strategic plan to define and close gaps where they exist versus best-in-class companies. These plans include executing a refreshed turnaround strategy for functional Ingredients and leveraging Health and Biosciences biotech expertise and capabilities across our Scent and Flavors platforms to enhance innovation and product development.\nAlso, as mentioned last quarter, we are focusing on having lean corporate functions to support our business units with speed, agility and closer collaboration. Now as we prioritize growth investments to our highest value businesses such as Flavors, Scent and Health and Biosciences, we have already started to increase R&D and commercial investments.\nAt the same time, we plan to increase our CapEx investments, targeting about 6% of sales for the next several years to bolster capacity and accelerate our digital transformation, including ERP implementation. We believe these investments will generate strong returns providing us with incremental growth and efficiency opportunities that will lead us to continue to improve how we serve our customers profitably.\nLastly, we are committed to delivering significant value creation for our shareholders. And with that in mind, we are on track to achieve our raised guidance targets for the year as we continue to drive profitable growth across each of our businesses. I'll now pass it over to Glenn for a closer look at our quarterly results, which demonstrate the continued progress and growth we are achieving.\nGlenn?\n\nGlenn Robert Richter\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.\n\nThank you, Erik, and thank you all for joining us today. As Erik noted, IFF had a strong second quarter. Revenue of just below $2.9 billion increased 7% on a comparable currency-neutral basis with Scent, H&B and Nourish, each growing revenue in the quarter. Volumes grew by high single digits as our performance continued to improve sequentially across nearly every business.\nOur volume growth and strong gains from productivity initiatives together contributed to a 22% increase in comparable adjusted operating EBITDA in the quarter. Our adjusted operating EBITDA margin improved by 310 basis points to 20.4% on a comparable basis, building off a strong first quarter and the first time we were over 20% since the third quarter of 2022.\nTurning to Slide 9. I'll dive a bit deeper into each of our segments. Nourish comparable currency neutral sales increased 4%, and we delivered an adjusted operating EBITDA increase of 36% on a comparable basis. This was led by a second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in Flavors, with improvements in both volume and pricing. Functional Ingredients sales declined modestly in the quarter as high single-digit volume growth was offset by lower pricing, consistent with plan.\nBoth Flavors and Functional Ingredients demonstrated strong year-over-year gross margin expansion. The strong profitability in Nourish was driven by volume growth and productivity improvements as well as the comparison to the onetime Locus Beam Kernel inventory write-down in the year ago period.\nHealth & Biosciences achieved strong growth in all businesses with a noteworthy uptick in Health, led by a strong performance in probiotics. H&B comparable currency-neutral sales increased 9% and we delivered comparable adjusted operating EBITDA of $165 million, a 14% increase from a year ago.\nIn Scent, double-digit growth in consumer Fragrance and Fragrance Ingredients led to a strong quarter for both revenue and profit growth. Fine Fragrance also remained strong, growing mid-single digits, led by new wins and volume gains. Net sales in the quarter were $603 million, up 16% on a comparable currency-neutral basis, and we delivered adjusted operating EBITDA of $137 million, up 38% on a comparable basis.\nLastly, Pharma Solutions returned to volume growth with revenue of $250 million. Profitability in this segment declined in line with our plan as we manage through unfavorable mix and onetime items.\nTurning to Slide 10. Cash flow from operations totaled $336 million this quarter, while CapEx year-to-date was $200 million or roughly 3.5% of sales. For the year, we expect that CapEx will be approximately $575 million as we ramp up in the second half of the year. Our free cash flow position in Q2 totaled $136 million, an increase sequentially of approximately $150 million from last quarter and a significant increase from $85 million reported in the year ago period. We paid $309 million in dividends through the end of the second quarter, and our cash and cash equivalents totaled $674 million.\nIFF also continued to make progress toward achieving our deleveraging goals and reduced our gross debt by over $900 million from last quarter, yielding a net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA ratio of 4x at quarter end, compared with 4.4x at the end of the first quarter. This was driven by improved operational performance, including solid working capital management as well as the closure of our Cosmetic Ingredients divestiture, which occurred early in the second quarter.\nIt's important to note that we remain committed to achieving our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA target of 3x or less following the completion of the divestiture of Pharma Solutions, which we continue to expect to be completed in the first half of 2025.\nOn Slide 11, I'd like to turn to our consolidated outlook for '24, where we are raising both our sales and adjusted operating EBITDA guidance ranges, given our stronger-than-expected financial and operational performance in the first half of the year. We are now expecting net sales to be in the range of $11.1 billion to $11.3 billion, reflecting our expectation that volume growth will continue across the majority of our portfolio in the back half of the year albeit at lower growth rates than the first half. Given the recent economic indicators and mixed results by CPG companies of late, we remain cautious relative to the outlook for demand in the balance of the year.\nOperating under this assumption for the full year, we now expect to achieve a 3% to 5% volume growth, up from our previously announced range of 0% to 3%. On the bottom line, we also raised our adjusted operating EBITDA guidance range to $2.1 billion to $2.17 billion, up from our previously stated range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. This increase reflects our strong profitability performance in the first half of the year with a consistent view of the second half from our previously communicated guidance.\nIt should be noted that we are also factoring in a greater level of annual incentive compensation given the relative strength of our performance versus budget and incremental second half spending relates to business reinvestment, specifically as part of our strategy Refresh, the team has identified investments that will accelerate the execution of our strategy, focus in business development, R&D and innovation that will yield results in 2025 and '26.\nBased on current market exchange rates, we expect that FX will be closer to a 4% adverse impact to sales growth within our 3% to 4% range given. For the third quarter, we expect sales to be approximately $2.75 billion to $2.85 billion, with an adjusted operating EBITDA of approximately to $520 million to $540 million.\nNow I'll turn it back to Erik for closing remarks.\n\nJon Erik Fyrwald\n\nCEO & Director\n\nWell, thank you, Glenn. As I shared at the top of the call, I am pleased with the team's solid performance throughout the first half of the year, especially as it represents a significant improvement over our prior year lows. We are moving on the right track because our teams around the world continue to relentlessly focus on efficiently meeting the needs of our customers, resulting in driving profitable growth.\nAnd I'm energized by the progress we've made so far this year, yet I recognize that we have a lot more to do to achieve the full potential of this great company. Already, we are making progress to better meet our goals and by taking advantage of the market's tailwinds and increasing our investments in our high-growth businesses, we believe we will be positioned to deliver attractive shareholder returns over time.\nI want to especially thank the entire IFF team for delivering these results, including rallying behind our strategic refresh to advance our customer focus and innovation-led strategy. We want every IFF-er to share the same passion and desire to help our customers differentiate and win in the marketplace. We are making much progress towards this goal.\nAs I look ahead to the remainder of the year, we will remain steadfast in bringing new products and innovations to the market. while simultaneously executing a turnaround strategy across our Functional Ingredients business, including with strong productivity initiatives. And I'm confident the actions we're taking and the near-term operational priorities we are executing will create a stronger IFF.\nAnd with that, I would now like to open the call for questions."

[Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nMichael DeVeau\n\nSenior Vice President of Corporate Finance & Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay.\nDuring the call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance and outlook. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K and press release.\nToday's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the respective GAAP measures is set forth in the press release that we issued yesterday.\nWith me on the call today is our CEO, Erik Fyrwald; and our Executive Vice President, CFO and Business Transformation Officer, Glenn Richter. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take any questions you have at the end.\nWith that, I would now like to turn the call over to Erik.\n\nJon Erik Fyrwald\n\nCEO & Director\n\nWell, thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. I'm excited to join you all today to discuss our solid performance in the first quarter and what we are seeing across the business so far this year. Today, we'll focus on our financial results, our outlook for the balance of the year and our increased confidence in our reiterated guidance, where we now see us trending toward the upper end.\nNow before moving forward, I want to acknowledge Glenn, who today is announcing his plan to retire at the end of 2024 after 3 successful years with the company. During his tenure, Glenn has driven multiple actions to improve our balance sheet and position the company for financial success. We've benefited from his experience and commitment to transformation and his ongoing leadership to position IFF to drive long-term profitable market share growth. He's also been very helpful to me already as I've come on to the IFF team.\nNow with this announcement, we have started a succession plan to evaluate internal and external candidates to succeed Glenn. The Board and I are grateful for all Glenn has helped IFF accomplish and look forward to his continued leadership as we identify a successor and ensure a smooth transition.\nNow turning to Slide 6. We are off to a good start at IFF. We achieved volume growth for the first time since the first quarter of 2022 as volumes grew mid-single digit in the first quarter of 2024 with strong contributions from Scent, Nourish and Health & Biosciences. We are also encouraged by the double-digit comparable adjusted EBITDA growth as we not only benefited from volume growth but also from productivity gains across our businesses.\nAt the same time, we made important progress focusing our portfolio with closing the divestiture of the cosmetics ingredients business and the announced sale of our Pharma Solutions business. We expect to complete the pharma transaction in the first half of 2025. The proceeds from these divestitures will help further strengthen our capital structure, address our deleveraging goal of 3x net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA and refocus us on high-growth areas of our business.\nWith our solid performance in the first quarter and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are cautiously optimistic about the remainder of 2024 and now expect full year 2024 results to trend toward the higher end of our previously announced guidance ranges. It's still early in the year and there's a lot more work to be done, but we are focused on building on our momentum to energize our team and return to sustainable profitable growth.\nTurning to Slide 7. Let me take a step back for a moment and share what I've learned during my first 90 days here at IFF. Now I've spent time getting to know our teams all over the world and meeting with many of our customers. And I'm grateful for the productive discussions. And what I found is that IFF has lots of top talent and incredible innovation capabilities, but we're not yet realizing our full potential.\nWith a new leadership perspective on our priorities and a renewed focus on execution by our executive leadership team, we are getting back to basics, and I'm optimistic about what we will do from here. First, we are strengthening our balance sheet and capital structure to create the flexibility we need to achieve our long-term goals. My assessment is we have not consistently delivered on our financial commitments largely due to a need for more strategic and organization operating model clarity to enable us to better execute against our goals.\nI think we are now getting the clarity we need and have taken some decisive steps in the first quarter to help us start to realize more of our potential. We recently rightsized our quarterly dividend to align with the market and our long-term cash flow generation and have made divestiture moves, including cosmetics and Pharma Solutions, to focus our portfolio and drive debt reduction.\nWe also recently announced and are implementing our refocused IFF operating model, which is now business-led, supported by lean functions. This includes the appointment of Ana Paula Mendoza, who has dedicated her career to the advancement of fragrance at IFF as the President of Scent. This enables Simon Harriet to focus his full attention on driving profitable growth in our Health & Biosciences business unit. We will also put more focus on our Flavors and Functional Ingredients units within our Nourish division.\nWith this operating model change, we have also changed the reporting structure of several of our functions, including R&D, operations, finance and HR to go directly into our business unit presidents. So they have the full end-to-end responsibility and accountability for business execution. Their goals will include delivering growth above market with a margin structure that gets us in line with or better than leading peers.\nNow to make this work, we have also established an operating system which is a simple set of management processes that collectively define how IFF makes decisions and creates value, provides a framework for standardized processes, responsibilities and metrics, and defines the tools to help managers drive continuous improvement. We believe this will create greater visibility to track performance so we drive execution to deliver results in the current period in ways that strengthen us for the coming years.\nWe are also introducing an operating philosophy based on 4 main pillars: number one, customer focus to drive profitable market share growth; number two, innovation powerhouse to create sustainable new products and other innovations, customers value and do this faster; number three, operational excellence to lead our relentless focus on safety, quality, continuous improvement and competitive cost structures; and four, people, people who are engaged across the organization.\nWe expect that our business-empowered model and operating system will enhance collaboration to profitably win with customers and by doing so, deliver strong financial performance over time. And while it's still early, I am pleased and encouraged by the energy and commitment of our teams all around the world.\nWith that, I'll now pass it over to Glenn to dive deeper into our results for the first quarter. Glenn?\n\nGlenn Robert Richter\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.\n\nThank you, Erik, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. As Erik mentioned earlier, we're encouraged by the momentum across our business as we start the year, and we are excited to continue to build on these positive early signals throughout 2024 and beyond.\nIn the first quarter, IFF generated roughly $2.9 billion in sales. On a comparable currency-neutral basis, sales increased 5% year-over-year. Our strong quarterly revenue performance was led by mid-single-digit volume growth with sequential improvements across most of our businesses, including Scent, Health & Biosciences and Nourish. Pricing was modestly positive, inclusive of FX-related pricing in emerging markets, in particular the Argentine peso, where we, like the industry, have indexed pricing to U.S. and/or euro exchange rates that drive pricing changes. Absent of this benefit, pricing would have been negative in the quarter, largely in line with our plan.\nWe delivered strong profitability in the quarter with adjusted operating EBITDA of $578 million. This represents a 20% increase on a comparable year-over-year basis, led by volume growth and the contribution from productivity initiatives. As a result, margins improved by approximately 310 basis points to nearly 20% adjusted operating margin in the quarter.\nTurning now to Slide 9. I'll dive deeper into the business performance across our segments. In Nourish, sales increased by 3% on a comparable currency-neutral basis with strong double-digit growth in Flavors with improvements in both volume and price. And we saw very strong growth in our Flavors business across nearly all markets. Functional Ingredients volume was up low single digits, the first time since the fourth quarter of 2021. Overall, comparable currency-neutral sales declined year-over-year due to our planned pricing actions.\nIn terms of profitability, productivity gains and volume growth drove a 13% increase in comparable adjusted operating EBITDA with solid gross margin improvements in both Flavors and Functional Ingredients. Our Health & Biosciences segment had another strong quarter with both top and bottom line growth. Solid performance in our H&B portfolio, led by double-digit sales growth in Cultures & Food Enzymes, Animal Nutrition and Grain Processing and mid-single-digit growth in Home & Personal Care, drove a 6% increase in comparable currency-neutral sales. Improved volume and productivity gains led to a 21% increase in year-over-year comparable adjusted operating EBITDA.\nScent delivered another excellent quarter, including 16% growth in comparable currency-neutral sales driven by double-digit growth in Consumer Fragrance and Fragrance Ingredients and mid-single-digit growth in Fine Fragrances. The segment also excel in terms of profitability, primarily led by volume growth and productivity improvements, which delivered an outstanding adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 55% on a comparable basis.\nLastly, in Pharma Solutions, while we saw some improvements from productivity initiatives, these were offset by lower volumes driven as expected due to continued destocking trends, which began late last year. It's worth noting that part of the destocking trend in the first quarter was market-related, and the other is due to Pharma Solutions initiative to reduce reliance on distributors and convert more of its core excipients business into a direct distribution model. We believe the shift to a more direct approach will enhance our customer relationships, reduce supply chain complexity and provide greater access to technical resources while also improving margins.\nAlso, as mentioned, we agreed to divest the Pharma Solutions business as part of our portfolio optimization efforts and are confident the business will be positioned to thrive and succeed in partnership with Roquette.\nNow on Slide 10, I'd like to discuss our cash flow and leverage position. Cash flow from operations totaled $99 million this quarter, while CapEx was $180 million or roughly 4.1% of sales. In the first quarter, normal seasonality impacted our free cash flow results. As a reminder, Q1 is usually the lowest cash flow quarter of the year as we make annual cash bonus payments in March. Our free cash flow position totaled negative $19 million in the quarter versus negative $48 million in the year ago period. We also paid $207 million in dividends through the end of the first quarter.\nOur cash and cash equivalents totaled $764 million, including $32 million in assets held for sale. IFF continues to make progress in our deleveraging efforts and reduced our gross debt by almost $1 billion versus year ago for a net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA ratio of 4.4x at quarter end. Our trailing 12-month credit adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $2.2 billion. Please note that the proceeds from the sale of LMC of $810 million were received in April and consequently not reflected in the quarterly results.\nWith the announced Pharma Solutions transaction, we are confident that we will achieve our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA target of 3x following the transaction close, which we expect will be completed in the first half of 2025.\nOn Slide 11, I'd like to now turn to our outlook for 2024. Based on our improved financial and operational performance in the first quarter and our expectations for the balance of the year, we remain cautiously optimistic about the year ahead, and as Erik mentioned, now expect results to trend towards the higher end of our previously announced guidance ranges. This reflects our belief that volumes will also be towards the high end of our previously announced [ 0.3% ] with improving trends across the majority of our portfolio.\nWe also saw pricing increases due to FX-related pricing in emerging markets in the first quarter, and therefore, raised our previously announced pricing guidance to approximately 1% for the full year 2024, versus previous expectation of decline approximately 2.5%. With these foreign exchange rate changes, we now expect currency will have an adverse impact of 3% to 4% versus 0% to 1% as previously expected, our sales growth, which is essentially offsetting the FX pricing contribution.\nOn the bottom line 2024, we are now trending towards the high end of our previously announced adjusted operating EBITDA guidance range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. This assumes continued improvements in volumes as well as strong productivity. While it is still early in the year, volume trends are encouraging, and consequently, we have increased confidence in our ability to achieve our full year guidance.\nFor the second quarter, we expect sales to be approximately $2.75 billion to $2.85 billion driven by improved volumes with an adjusted operating EBITDA of approximately $500 million to $525 million.\nI'll now turn it back to Erik for closing remarks.\n\nJon Erik Fyrwald\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThank you, Glenn. Now as I shared at the top of the call, my first 90 days on Team IFF have been energizing as I see so much potential. We have great talent and capabilities across our global teams, and our solid top and bottom line results from the first quarter show that we are building positive momentum. And it's an honor to lead IFF during this transformative time, and I am encouraged by our positive start to the year and our outlook. Yet we still have a lot of work to do.\nAs the market continues to be very competitive, we are committed to bringing products and innovation that differentiate us from our peers and give customers what they need to win and, in turn, helps them and us to drive sustainable profitable growth. And with a solid start to the year, I'm excited to see what we can accomplish going forward.\nAnd with that, I'd like to now open it up for questions."

I'm excited to join you all today. I would like to begin by sharing some initial perspectives since joining IFF. I will then turn the call over to Glen, who will provide a look at the fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results before providing commentary on our current outlook for the full year 2024. After that, we'll open the call for Q\nA. Now I officially joined IFF on February 6, and I have been impressed by the world-class teams globally and the strong innovation across our company. I spent the last few weeks visiting our operations and teams and some of our U.S. and overseas businesses. I spent that time listening to our teams, meeting many of our customers and assessing the current status of our businesses. IFF has a proud history as a global leader in high-value ingredients and solutions and a great platform from which to build and expand our partnerships with customers across the value chain to help them create leading consumer products. I believe in our purpose to help create a better world through science and creativity applied to sustainably meet customer and consumer needs. The opportunity we have ahead of us is very big, and that is why I joined IFF. We have solid businesses and will take the actions needed to unleash our full potential to start to deliver profitable market share gains by bringing great innovation to win with our customers. A perfect example of this is in our Scent business, where we have been outperforming competition, something we must do also across our other businesses. IFF also has other high-quality businesses, such as flavors and health and biosciences, where we will leverage our innovation to deliver higher growth rates with very attractive profitability. And in some of our challenged businesses, such as functional ingredients, with focus and attention, we can significantly improve performance. In both instances, we will do so by putting the business first, eliminating unnecessary processes and overhead, driving empowerment and strong leadership. And by doing so, IFF will be a more innovative and customer-centric organization that will be effective and efficient. We also must be better executors focus the IFF team away from distractions to continuously grow market share across all our businesses, put more of our investments into our high-return businesses and transformative R&D initiatives, and our IT infrastructure and achieve our capital structure targets by reducing outstanding debt. And when we do this over time, I see strong upside and value creation for all IFF's stakeholders.\nMoving to the next slide, I'll walk through the achievements and factors that marked IFF's progress through the fourth quarter and full year 2023. Now throughout the past year, IFFers have continued to take important steps to strengthen our financial and operational foundation and position this company to deliver value for the near, mid and long term. Our performance in the fourth quarter demonstrates progress. While reported sales were down, comparable currency-neutral sales increased 1% and comparable currency neutral EBITDA grew 17% with an adjusted margin expansion of 260 basis points. We've also seen notable improvements in volume trends across the majority of our business segments in the second half of the year, enabling us to perform within previously stated guidance ranges for full year 2023 sales and adjusted operating EBITDA. Now with this progress and the improving performance through the second half of 2023, we exited the year on solid footing, and we are optimistic about our ability to build on this momentum and are targeting getting back to year-on-year growth for the full year 2024, while strengthening for 2025 and beyond. Now as I said earlier, we are committed to reducing our level of debt. We have therefore announced an update to our dividend policy to reduce the quarterly dividend by approximately 50% to $0.40 per share. This is not a decision the board and management have taken lightly as we know the dividend is important to shareholders. However, it will enable us to reduce debt faster, strengthening our capital structure, which will create additional long-term value. This will also give the company greater financial flexibility which will, when required, give us the ability to make more high-return growth investments.\nI'll now turn it over to Glenn. Glenn?\n\nGlenn Robert Richter\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.\n\nThank you, Erik, and hello, everyone.\nMoving to Slide 7. As Erik mentioned, the board and management have taken this opportunity to accelerate the improvement of our capital structure as we work towards our deleveraging target of 3x net debt- to credit-adjusted EBITDA. Consequently, we have reduced our quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share. We believe this dividend change provides a dividend yield that is consistent with industry peers and is aligned with IFF's long-term cash flow generation and target payouts. The dividend remains an important part of our capital allocation framework, and we expect this new base to grow alongside our profit over time. IFF remains committed to providing competitive returns to our shareholders and firmly believes that these actions set us up for more durable value creation in the long term.\nNow on Slide 8. As Erik mentioned, our performance for the fourth quarter reflects the operational and strategic initiatives that our team has implemented over the last several months to deliver strong results amid an uncertain operating environment. Despite some continued challenges in the market, volume trends continued to improve sequentially with increases in nearly all businesses resulting in growth for total IFF. IFF generated $2.7 billion in sales, representing a 1% increase in comparable currency neutral sales. This improvement reflected strong growth in our Scent business with continued volume pressure in nourish and pharma, both impacted by destocking. Volumes continue to improve sequentially from down mid-single digits in Q3 to down low single digits in Q4, and if excluding the impact of functional ingredients, volumes for the fourth quarter would have increased low single digits. Adjusted operating EBITDA totaled $461 million in the fourth quarter, a 17% increase on a comparable currency neutral basis. We also realized a year-over-year increase of approximately 260 basis points to our comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA margin. This growth in EBITDA was supported by both internal steps IFF has taken, including continued gains and efficiencies from our productivity initiatives and favorable net pricing.\nBefore moving on, I wanted to share that we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of $2.6 billion for the fourth quarter related to our Nourish business. The primary drivers of the goodwill impairment are related to lower business projections due to volume declines mainly in functional ingredients, continued cost inflation and unfavorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nNow moving to Slide 9. Taking a closer look at our profitability performance for the fourth quarter, we delivered $461 million, which equates to a robust comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 17%. I'm happy to report that in Q4, IFF realized strong productivity gains and in conjunction with favorable net price to inflation helped us overcome ongoing volume pressures to deliver against our objectives. Importantly, IFF has remained focused on executing upon our productivity program to improve our operational effectiveness and efficiency. In 2023, we continued to launch additional steps as part of these programs while also making strategic investments in key growth areas.\nNow on Slide 10, I'll provide a closer look at our performance by business segment during the quarter. In Nourish, sales declined 3% on a comparable currency neutral basis as strong growth in Flavors was offset by continued softness in functional ingredients. While functional ingredients remains the main driver of weakness for Nourish in the quarter, it is worth noting that we again saw a meaningful sequential improvement in terms of profitability, the positive impact from our ongoing pricing actions and productivity initiatives drove improvements and led to a 3% increase in comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA. Health & Biosciences continues to show robust top and bottom line growth. Price increases, volume growth and productivity gains led to growth across most H&B business segments led by double-digit growth in health. Overall, H&B delivered a comparable currency-neutral sales increase of 5% year-over-year and a 35% year-over-year increase in comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA. Our Scent segment continued to deliver a very strong performance in Q4 and including 11% growth in comparable currency neutral sales driven by double-digit growth in consumer fragrance as well as mid-single-digit growth in Fine Fragrance. Like Health & Biosciences, Scent also saw significant growth in adjusted operating EBITDA, increasing 34% on a comparable currency-neutral basis, driven by favorable net pricing, volume and productivity gains. While Pharma Solutions experienced significant pricing and productivity gains, these improvements were offset by lower volume, driven primarily by continued destocking trends as well as strong year ago comparison. This led to comparable currency-neutral sales declining 10% and comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA declined 13% in the quarter.\nTurning to Slide 11. I'll discuss our progress improving our cash flow and leverage positions. In the fourth quarter, cash flow from operations totaled $1.44 billion, a significant increase from the previous year, reflecting the strong improvement in inventory levels. CapEx for the year was $503 million or approximately 4.4% of sales. Our progress on working capital improvement, led by an intense focus on rightsizing our inventories helped enhance our free cash flow position, which saw a sequential increase of over $500 million, totaling $936 million for the full year [Audio Gap] and ahead of expectations. Included in our free cash flow is about $430 million of cost, primarily related to integration and transaction-related items. We also delivered $826 million in dividends to our shareholders in 2023. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $729 million, including $26 million in assets held for sale in Q4. Additionally, we realized a $200 million sequential reduction in gross debt, which totaled approximately $10.1 billion for the quarter with a net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA of 4.5x. Our trailing 12-month credit adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $2.1 billion. With the announced sale of our Lucas Meyer Cosmetics business, which we still expect to close in the first quarter of 2024, the rightsizing of our quarterly dividend and additional portfolio actions we are planning to make, we are taking decisive action to strengthen our balance sheet and achieve our leverage targets.\nOn Slide 12, I'd like to now turn to our outlook for '24. Due to a combination of improvements across our business and in the broader market towards the tail end of '23, we are cautiously optimistic about the year ahead. For the full year 2024, we expect sales in the range of $10.8 billion to $11.1 billion. This reflects our prudent approach to volume expectations and the impact of modest negative pricing in '24, which is largely isolated to more price competitive categories such as functional ingredients and fragrance ingredients given lower input costs and competitive dynamics. We expect overall pricing to decline approximately 2.5% in '24, following a 10% increase in '22 and a 6% increase in '23. Strategically, we believe this will position us to be more cost competitive in the market and allow us to regain market share in select businesses. In terms of volume, the visibility to the degree and pace of the recovery remains a bit fluid and has been explicitly incorporated in our 0% to 3% range. The most significant variable impacting in this range will be the pace of recovery in functional ingredients. However, this is a marked improvement from '23, where we finished down mid-single digits and '22, we were down low single digits as we believe our industry will return to more normalized growth rates.\nOn the bottom line, we expect to deliver full year '24 adjusted operating EBITDA between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion. Our guidance assumes not just improved volumes from '23, but also solid profitability and a margin expansion across our segments. We are hyper-focused on continuing to execute our productivity initiatives to help mitigate expected inflation, primarily labor costs, and incentive compensation reset, while continuing to reinvest in the higher return businesses. It's also worth noting we have some benefit of onetime items such as the negative impact in '23 from the inventory reduction program and the previously announced write-down of inventory related to Locust Bean Kernel or LBK, that will not repeat in '24. In particular, there was an approximately $130 million impact from negative absorption in '23 related to our inventory reduction program and some volume declines, which is down from an estimated $165 million we provided in the third quarter. A portion of this will be offset by higher annual incentive compensation expense as we reset our payout to target levels in 2024. While there's still work to do, efforts to bolster our financial profile and portfolio are providing effective, and while it's hard to predict the timing and details of the market recovery and its impact on our results, we see opportunity for improvement in '24 with all divisions targeting better volumes with improvements in profitability and margin expansion across all 4 divisions. For the first quarter, we expect sales to be approximately $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion, with an adjusted EBITDA of approximately $475 million to $500 million.\nThroughout 2024, we will be relentlessly focused on our efforts to optimize our portfolio, improve financial performance and reach our deleveraging targets.\nI'm confident that the actions taken in '23 and our outlook for improving performance in '24 will position IFF to capture significant value creation.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Erik for closing remarks.\n\nJon Erik Fyrwald\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThank you, Glenn. I'm truly excited to be joining IFF during this transformative time for the company. I have long admired IFF as the category-defining leader in the industry, and it's an honor to be able to work alongside our talented global teams to help us navigate and even thrive at a critical moment for our company and our industry. Through robust efforts from our teams worldwide and shared commitment to putting the customer at the center of all we do, IFF will continue strengthening our commercial execution and become a more nimble and efficient organization. Our global teams made progress towards ensuring we can meet the evolving needs of our customers and deliver industry competitive returns, and we will accelerate the progress going forward. While 2023 was a challenging year, our financial results in the fourth quarter highlight an improving trend. Based on this performance and some improving market conditions, we are expecting a return to volume growth this year, which should enable EBITDA growth and margin expansion. Our updated dividend policy and the additional divestitures we continue to work on, reflects our commitment to improve our capital structure. While the global economic landscape is uncertain, IFF will be focused on strengthening our execution. And as I said, we have work to do to improve our businesses and achieve our vision, but I am confident we are well positioned to build on our progress and create sustainable value for all stakeholders in 2024 and beyond.\nI'd like to thank our teams and partners for welcoming me to IFF and look forward to seeing what we'll achieve in 2024.\nWith that, I'd like to now open the call for questions."

[Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nMichael DeVeau\n\nSenior Vice President of Corporate Finance & Investor Relations\n\nWelcome to IFF's Third Quarter 2023 Conference Call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay.\nPlease take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we'll be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance and business outlook. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K and press release.\nToday's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release.\nWith me on the call today is our CEO, Frank Clyburn, and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial and Business Transformation Officer, Glenn Richter. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take any questions you may have at the end.\nWith that, I would now like to turn the call over to Frank.\n\nFranklin K. Clyburn\n\nChief Commercial Officer & Executive VP, Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Mike, and hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will begin by providing an overview of our performance in the third quarter and an update on our strong execution to position IFF for long-term success. I will then turn the call over to Glenn, who will provide a more detailed look at our third quarter financial results by business and discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2023. We will then open the call questions.\nMoving to Slide 6. Our third quarter story is one of sequential improvement. As we've discussed, improving volumes has been a top priority, and we are pleased with the sequential volume improvements that we have achieved across the majority of our business. On a total company basis, while our volume in the third quarter was down mid-single digits, it was a marked improvement from our Q2 lows where we saw a double-digit decline. Similarly, our enhanced productivity initiatives as well as favorable base to inflation led to strong adjusted operating EBITDA results. Sequentially, our adjusted operating EBITDA margin finished at 17.9%, which is a 50 basis point improvement versus the second quarter of 2023. And our focus on ongoing working capital improvements drove strong free cash flow generation.\nIn particular, the continued execution of our inventory reduction program has resulted in more than a $600 million reduction in inventory since the end of 2022. This was the largest driver of our free cash flow, which improved $320 million versus the second quarter of 23%. The net result is that we delivered higher than our expectations on both the top and bottom line. At the same time, our commercial excellence initiatives in our R&D platform continue to drive improvements in our sales pipeline. In addition, in Functional Ingredients, as discussed on our second quarter call, we are implementing a targeted operational improvement plan to improve sales execution, strengthen our operating model and reshaped portfolio.\nAs we shared previously, we expect this plan for Functional Ingredients will translate into low single-digit comparable currency-neutral sales growth in line with the market and a mid-teen adjusted operating EBITDA margin over the next 3 years with a strong improvement in 2024. And while this will take time, we are seeing improvements in our volume performance, where we finished the quarter down mid-teens versus low 20% declines in Q2 of 2023. With this momentum, we have increased confidence in our ability to deliver within our previously announced full year '23 sales guidance range and we are now targeting the mid- to high end of our full year 2023 adjusted operating EBITDA guidance range.\nAs Glenn will highlight, we are seeing signs of green shoots in the fourth quarter, with stabilization and improvements across several parts of our business. Lastly, we've made important progress against our portfolio optimization initiatives as we are rapidly addressing our capital structure. Most notably, aligned with our best owner mindset, we announced an agreement to sell Lucas Meyers Cosmetics to specialty chemical company, Clariant, for $810 million, which is equivalent to a high teens multiple based on our projections. We expect to complete the transaction in the early part of the first quarter of 2024, and all proceeds will support our deleveraging priorities. Moving forward, we continue to pursue strategic noncore divestitures that will drive further deleverage and enable us to further prioritize our fastest-growing margin-accretive businesses and deliver long-term value for shareholders.\nMoving to Slide 7. In the third quarter, IFF generated $2.8 billion in sales, representing a 3% decline on the comparable currency-neutral basis. A strong performance in Scent and Health & Biosciences was more than offset by softness in Nourish and Pharma Solutions. As I mentioned, volumes improved sequentially across nearly all businesses with strict particularly strong performance in Scent and Health & Biosciences. Excluding Functional Ingredients, which continues to disproportionately impact our results, overall volume decline low to single digits in the third quarter.\nAdjusted operating EBITDA for the quarter was $506 million, down 10% year-over-year on a comparable currency-neutral basis. Our favorable net price to inflation as well as enhanced productivity gains were more than offset by lower volumes due primarily to temporary customer destocking and unfavorable manufacturing cost absorption. Adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, was $0.89, primarily impacted by lower profitability.\nNow I'll turn it over to Glenn to provide more detail on profitability and our performance by business segment.\n\nGlenn Robert Richter\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.\n\nThank you, Frank, and good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Taking a closer look at our profitability performance on Slide 8. As Frank mentioned, we delivered higher-than-expected EBITDA of $506 million in the third quarter. While we continue to benefit from favorable price to inflation and productivity gains, as you can see from the slide, ongoing volume pressures impacted our profitability in the quarter. While we are encouraged by the sequential volume improvement we have seen across most of our portfolio, it remained the primary pressure in Q3.\nIf we look at our profitability performance, absent the unfavorable manufacturing absorption related to our inventory improvement program, adjusted operating EBITDA would have declined 6% year-over-year on a comparable currency-neutral basis. Note that our negative absorption in the quarter was less than expected as our inventory reduction program for the year has run its course and volumes have improved. We have done a good job at driving working capital improvement through our inventory reduction program, driving more than $600 million reduction in inventory since the end of '22. As a result, at this time, we are now expecting approximately a $165 million impact from negative absorption to profitability for the full year, down from $180 million. This could also reflects further as the fourth quarter unfolds. To reiterate, this is a onetime transitory impact to the P&L in order to maximize cash flow moving forward.\nTurning to Slide 9. I'll provide a closer look at our Q3 performance by business segment. In Nourish, sales declined 7% on a comparable currency-neutral basis, driven mainly by the continued weakness in Functional Ingredients. While Functional Ingredients remained a main driver of weakness in Nourish in the third quarter, we did see sequential improvement and expect this to continue as we move into the fourth quarter. Good growth in our Flavors business and the positive impact of IFF's ongoing pricing actions and productivity initiatives were more than offset by lower volumes and unfavorable manufacturing absorption. Together, this led to a 26% year-over-year decrease in comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA.\nHealth & Biosciences continued to deliver strong results in Q3, led by meaningful growth in Cultures & Food Enzymes, Grain Processing, Home & Personal Care and Animal Nutrition leading to comparable currency-neutral growth of 2% year-over-year. Price increases and productivity gains led to a 12% year-over-year increase in comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA.\nScent was once again our strongest performer, delivering 7% growth in comparable currency neutral sales driven by double-digit growth in Consumer Fragrance and high single-digit growth in Fine Fragrance. Like Health & Biosciences, Scent also saw strong 19% growth in comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA with profitability driven by favorable net pricing and productivity gains.\nPharma Solutions growth rate was pressured this quarter, in large part due to a very strong prior year comparison with a 28% 2022 sales growth comparison and a 76% '22 adjusted operating EBITDA comparison. Price increases and productivity gains for this business were more than offset by lower volumes and comparable currency neutral sales declined 9% and comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA declined 34% in the quarter.\nNow on Slide 10, I'll discuss our cash flow and leverage position. Cash flow from operations totaled $795 million, a significant increase, reflecting a strong improvement in inventory levels. CapEx year-to-date was $390 million or approximately 4.4% of sales. Our inventory reduction program and working capital improvements have also greatly contributed to IFF's improved free cash flow performance, which totaled $405 million, a significant increase of $320 million from the second quarter.\nYear-to-date, we also distributed $619 million in dividends to our shareholders. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $652 million, which includes $23 million in assets held for sale. Additionally, gross debt for the quarter totaled approximately $10.3 billion, with a net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA of 4.6x. Our trailing 12-month credit adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $2.1 billion.\nWe are making good progress on working down our debt levels. And as Frank mentioned earlier, portfolio optimization remains a near-term priority as we work to reduce our leverage position and ensure our resources are focused on the businesses that will carry our success into the future. The sale of our Cosmetic Ingredients business, which is expected to close in the early part of the first quarter 2024 will further support our strength in capital structure as we pay down debt in line with our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA targets.\nNow on Slide 11, I would like to focus on our consolidated outlook for the rest of the year. First, we are reaffirming our full year revenue guidance range of $11.3 billion to $11.6 billion, which reflects the improved momentum we are seeing across the majority of our business and accounts for the macroeconomic environment and foreign exchange impact, which we expect will persist through the end of the year. On the bottom line, we are now expecting to deliver full year 2023 adjusted operating EBITDA at the mid to high end of our previously announced guidance of $1.85 billion to $2 billion, driven primarily by favorable price to inflation and improved productivity.\nWe also now expect full year interest expense to be slightly higher at approximately $450 million. Our projected effective tax rate for the year is expected to be approximately 21% the same estimate we provided last quarter. Finally, as we look to the fourth quarter, we continue to expect an improving trend in the majority of our businesses as we navigate the macroeconomic challenges impacting our industry. We are seeing signs of green shoots in the fourth quarter, with stabilization improvements across several parts of our business.\nAs we near the end of the year, I know many of you have questions on 2024. While the macroeconomic environment remains volatile with low visibility, we are optimistic heading into the new year. We have several known one-off items that we have high level of confidence will be tailwinds, including significant negative absorption related to our successful inventory reduction program and onetime [indiscernible] inventory write-down. Also, we will continue to execute on our cost and productivity initiatives and have a carryover benefit from this year's restructuring program. These, of course, will be partially offset by a reset of our annual incentive compensation program where we have reduced payments in 2023 related to our performance versus target.\nIn the end, improved volume performance will be critical to our success, and we believe that destocking will largely be done as we exit the year and we also believe we will benefit from the acceleration of our strategic transformation initiatives. We will provide our 2024 guidance with our fourth quarter results, which we expect to be towards the end of February.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Frank for closing remarks.\n\nFranklin K. Clyburn\n\nChief Commercial Officer & Executive VP, Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Glenn. Let me start by saying that I am tremendously proud of what our teams have accomplished in the last quarter to advance our focused strategic initiatives and build a stronger, more resilient IFF. Our improved performance, productivity gains and reaffirmed financial guidance reflect the hard work of our global teams that continue to support our long-term vision. We executed against our strategic priorities in Q3, and we'll continue to take action in Q4 to build a stronger IFF, better positioned to accelerate growth, expand margins and deliver value for shareholders.\nFinally, looking at our business more broadly, we will continue to pursue portfolio optimization initiatives to strengthen our capital structure. As we've discussed previously, we are laser-focused on investing in our highest-return businesses while positioning our less margin-accretive businesses for success. Either through new ownership or through focused improvement plans, such as those we're pursuing for Functional Ingredients.\nOur goal, as we move through the end of 2023 and beyond is to ensure that each of our businesses has the resources and where appropriate, the ownership most conducive to accelerating our growth, expanding our margins and maximizing our long-term returns as we continue to innovate for customers worldwide. With that, I will now open up the call for questions."

Thank you for attending today's IFF Second Quarter Conference Call. My name is Megan, and I'll be your moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to pass the conference over to Michael DeVeau. Michael, please go ahead.\n\nMichael DeVeau\n\nSenior Vice President of Corporate Finance & Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's Second Quarter Conference Call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay.\nPlease take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we'll be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance and business outlook. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K and press release.\nToday's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in the press release.\nWith me on the call today is our CEO, Frank Clyburn, and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial and Business Transformation Officer, Glenn Richter. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take any questions that you have.\nWith that, I would now like to turn the call over to Frank.\n\nFranklin K. Clyburn\n\nChief Commercial Officer & Executive VP, Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike, and thanks, everyone, for joining today for an important discussion on our business performance and the critical actions underway to create an even stronger IFF. As you are aware, recent results from across our industry and many of our largest customers has clearly demonstrated that macroeconomic headwinds continue largely unabated.\nThis environment has challenged financial performance of IFF and our peers in the first half of 2023, and has resulted in a more cautious outlook for the remainder of the year. However, despite this tough environment, it is also important that we highlight the significant progress we are making on transforming and strengthening IFF's business.\nConsequently, today, we will share promising early results from the strategic transformation initiatives we have been discussing with you as well as some additional actions we are taking. Summarize our performance for the second quarter 2023 and outline the additional steps we are taking to drive shareholder value creation at IFF. Then we will be happy to take any questions you have at the end.\nWith that in mind, on Slide 6, I'll begin with a quick summary of the key takeaways for the second quarter, which I will unpack further here in the next few slides, including the actions we are taking to progress our strategic transformation.\nFirst, amid the current operating environment facing the industry, including temporary destocking, IFF is performing broadly in line with peers, excluding functional ingredients. Second, consistent with our invest, maximize and optimize framework that we introduced in our 2022 Investor Day, we continue to broaden our portfolio optimization efforts, including through strategic noncore divestitures.\nThird, we've outlined a clear operational improvement plan to drive improvement within our functional ingredients business. And lastly, our work behind the scenes to strengthen our organization is paying off as we are making strong progress in terms of our strategic initiatives to ensure IFF is well positioned for long-term success as market conditions begin to improve.\nLet me now unpack each of these a bit further. Turning to Slide 7. Amid the current operating environment, Q2 results were mixed as comparable currency neutral sales growth for the second quarter was down 4%. Strong results in Scent and Pharma Solutions were more than offset by softness in A&B and nearish particularly functional ingredients.\nFrom a profitability perspective, our adjusted operating EBITDA was in line with our guidance range, excluding a onetime inventory write-down due to unprecedented cost fluctuations for 1 ingredient, locus being kernel. Our focus on cash flow generation has yielded solid results improving sequentially and versus the prior year period as we successfully executed on our inventory reduction program.\nNow as we look to the balance of the year, the pace of industry recovery that we expected is not materializing according to our original expectation. Consumer demand remains soft and temporary customer destocking trends are continuing. As a result, we have adjusted our expectations for the full year 2023, lowering sales to $11.3 billion to $11.6 billion, entirely driven by lower volumes.\nFor the full year, we expect volumes to now be down mid- to high single digits versus roughly flat previously. Our adjusted operating EBITDA range is now $1.85 billion to $2 billion as favorable net price to inflation and enhanced productivity are more than offset by lower volume, higher manufacturing absorption costs related to our inventory reduction program and the impact of the write-down of LBK inventory.\nApproximately 75% of IFF's business, including Scent, Pharma Solutions, H&B, Flavors and Food Design are performing broadly in line with industry peers. The one area where we have significant opportunity to accelerate is the functional ingredients business where we are aggressively implementing an operational improvement plan. I will share more in a moment.\nOn Slide 8, looking at our business more broadly, we're continuing to accelerate our portfolio optimization initiatives to maximize returns and deleverage our balance sheet according to plan. We're investing behind to maximize our high-return businesses while optimizing other businesses, including through additional divestitures across all 3 categories: Invest; maximize; and optimize, within our strategic framework.\nWe've made significant progress on this front with the recently completed sales of our Microbial Control, Savory Solutions and Flavor Specialty Ingredients businesses. We are continuing that momentum as we launch a sale process for Lucas Meyer Cosmetics aligned with our best owner mindset. This is consistent with our mindset of ensuring each of our businesses has the resources and ownership most conducive to long-term success and maximum returns.\nFor LMC specifically, it is a fantastic business, and I have no doubt that it will continue to prosper under new ownership. And for IFF, it would allow us to reduce outstanding debt, while continuing to invest in our most core and accretive businesses.\nWe have also hired JPMorgan to explore additional divestiture actions within the portfolio as a pathway to accelerate, deleverage and unlock further value creation for our shareholders. We are reviewing all options consistent with our strategic framework, and we will only pursue opportunities that are value accretive for our shareholders.\nA key part of our approach is that we will not look to divest assets at depressed multiples, especially those that are impacted by temporary destocking trends. Instead, we believe there is more value creation from improving these businesses before divesting.\nOn Slide 9, I wanted to put this in today's presentation to show the dynamics we are seeing across the portfolio. As you can foresee from the slide, the vast majority of our portfolio from 2021 through the first half of 2023 has performed near or at expectations volumetrically. On a quarterly average basis, even amongst this unprecedented macro environment over the past 2 years.\nAlso, when comparing with our peers, we believe these businesses are largely performing in line with them based on our business mix. The main business has been functional ingredients with quarterly average volumes down approximately 6% during that same time frame. The message is similar if we analyze our volume performance on a first half 2023 basis as volumes for functional ingredients is down approximately 20% versus a mid-single-digit decline for the rest of the business.\nBased on this, and as I mentioned on the first quarter call, we have been taking immediate action to improve functional ingredients performance while continuing to invest in our high-return businesses then make up the bulk of IFF by revenue, Scent, H&B, Pharma and the other categories within our Naris division.\nOn Slide 10, I would like to focus on functional ingredients in particular. Digging deeper into functional ingredients in what has happened overall market declines in alternative protein consumption, including demand decline for plant-based products, persistent supply chain challenges given the macro backdrop since the pandemic and more aggressive inventory management by customers have collectively contributed to pressure functional ingredients.\nLooking forward, while food demand volumes are beginning to stabilize and service challenges across the entire supply chain have improved, we do expect customer destocking to persist through the second half of the year based on what we are hearing from our customers. This destocking, while temporary in nature, will continue to pressure our functional ingredients volume as we move through the second half.\nNow moving to Slide 11. Our plan includes several near-term actions to improve performance in Functional Ingredients. First and foremost, there are clear opportunities to enhance our go-to-market approach with several key customers and accelerate our pipeline to win more opportunities. Since the early part of the year, we have hired over 50 new commercial professionals entirely focused on functional ingredients to pursue incremental market opportunities. We are already seeing early signs of improvement with a strong and growing pipeline.\nThe second opportunity is strengthening our operating model. We will be disciplined in our approach from a productivity and operational excellence perspective, delivering 2% to 4% of annual productivity and also, as we think strategically about how to allocate capital to this business to deliver strong ROIC growth. We have also made the decision to report functional ingredients to provide increased transparency on performance and ensure increased management accountability with well-defined KPIs.\nLastly, we are working to significantly reshape the functional ingredients portfolio for success. This means increasing the competitive edge of our successful core product lines while modifying or discontinuing those that have proven not to be additive to the portfolio.\nThe net result of this operational improvement plan supported by our new leader in Nourish and function ingredients, will allow us to grow sales in line with the market and deliver a mid-teen adjusted operated EBITDA margin over the next 3 years. We expect that through this plan, plus the elimination of more transitory challenges such as the LBK inventory write-down and negative absorption, we will see a meaningful improvement in 2024.\nMoving to Slide 12. I would like to now focus on the significant progress we are making against our strategic plan as we seek to be the premier partner, build our future and become 1 IFF. Despite the current macro environment we see our industry in, our teams around the world are putting in the work to ensure we are setting ourselves up to capitalize as economic conditions begin to normalize.\nOur commercial excellence initiatives are yielding strong results. We have greatly improved customer service performance, identified more than $250 million in new growth opportunities in 2024 and beyond and are expanding the sales pipeline, up more than 50% year-over-year across all divisions.\nWe are building our future and extending our leadership in R&D with 15 new technology launches year-to-date and an expected revenue contribution exceeding $100 million. At the same time, our focused productivity initiatives yielded approximately $140 million in savings through the first half of the year. We are optimizing our portfolio to focus on our highest growth, highest margin businesses through selected divestitures, which will complement our efficiency objectives as we meet our deleveraging targets.\nLastly, we're making exciting progress in building a more unified IFF. We are finalizing our transition to our new customer line operating model, which will be completed in the first quarter of 2024. We've also continued to enhance our culture and deepen our bench of world-class talent. In June, we appointed [ Yuraj ] Aurora, an experienced CPG executive who previously led U.S. categories for Telog as President of our Nourish division. With our leadership team and incentive structure now in place, the organization is poised for sustainable, profitable growth and expansion.\nNow on Slide 13, I would like to highlight the strong improvements we have made in terms of our pipeline opportunity. Our scientific and technological expertise remains a key differentiator in the competitive market. We win by introducing new and unique capabilities to meet our customers' evolving needs.\nWe're seeing the benefits of our refocused R&D and commercial excellence initiatives, including a more than 50% increase in opportunities so far in 2023 versus the same 2022 period. This increase is giving us continued optimism in the future potential of IFF.\nIn Nourish, increased opportunities across regions and categories, has led to a greater than 60% pipeline inflow versus last year. Our recent notable win included xylitol, which is a sweetener used in bars, cereals and other confectionery goods. In sense, our compounds pipeline opportunity continues to be healthy and strong. Included in this was a significant win for our Boost Powder Detergent, a 100% active powder laundry detergent that is effective and safe to use unwatchable fabrics.\nIn Health and Biosciences, greater capacity is driving a robust pipeline in our cultures and food enzymes and our halting grain processing units. Included within this is a notable win in North America probiotics, a dietary supplement that supports good health.\nAnd in Pharma Solutions, the pipeline has doubled while the team has delivered key wins in METHOCEL, a plant-based more soluble functional ingredient that supports dietary supplement manufacturing in a high-growth category.\nCollectively, our team's creativity and efficiency and bringing innovative solutions to market, provides confidence in our ability to strengthen our long-term leadership as the preferred partner for CPGs worldwide.\nMoving to Slide 14. Our management team is aligned on key objectives essential to IFF success as market conditions normalize, turning IFF into a leader in high-value innovative solutions. Through the second half of this year and beyond, we are focused on accelerating growth and maximizing shareholder value, expanding our margin, enhancing our return on capital and improving our leverage ratios. We believe we have a strong achievable plan in place to ensure we are well positioned to rebound growth and profitability and continuing executing on our broader strategic transformation in 2024 and beyond.\nI will now turn it over to Glenn to discuss our second quarter performance and financial position entering the second half of 2023.\n\nGlenn Robert Richter\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.\n\nThanks, Frank. Turning to Slide 15. In Q2, IFF generated $2.9 billion in sales with comparable currency neutral sales declined 4%, a strong performance in Scent and pharma and was offset by softness in Nourish and Health and Biosciences.\nOur pricing continues to remain strong in the second quarter as it was up high single digits. However, volume in the quarter declined low double digits about twice the decline anticipated in the quarter. To provide some more color on volumes, Scent and Pharma were largely in line with expectations, while H&B underperformed in large part due to softer volume performance in health.\nThe majority of our underperformance of our overall volume decline in the quarter, approximately 60%, was attributable to Functional Ingredients. Excluding the impact of functional ingredients, IFF volume would have only been down mid-single digits.\nAdjusted operating EBITDA was $510 million, down 18% year-over-year on a comparable currency-neutral basis, largely driven by unfavorable manufacturing cost absorption of approximately $55 million and a $44 million write-down of inventory related to unprecedented cost fluctuations for locus being kernel. As Frank mentioned earlier, excluding this onetime LDK write-down, our adjusted operating EBITDA would have been $554 million, within our previously communicated guidance range of $540 million to $590 million. Adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, was $0.86 in the quarter, impacted by lower profitability.\nTaking a closer look at our profitability performance on Slide 16. Excluding the unfavorable manufacturing absorption related to our inventory reduction program and the inventory write-down of LBK, comparable adjusted operating EBITDA would have declined 3% on a currency-neutral basis versus the previous year. We continue to benefit from strong pricing and productivity gains.\nHowever, as you can see from the slide, the biggest driver impacting profitability in the quarter was the decline in volumes. This volume decline is most pronounced in our Nourish business, driven by functional ingredients. As noted, volumes across our Scent and Pharma Solutions businesses met expectations and H&D was modestly behind.\nTurning now to Slide 17. I'll provide a look at our second quarter performance by business segment. As we've noted, continued weakness in Functional Ingredients impacted Nourish performance overall. With strong results in Flavors and Food Design and in line with peers. Pricing and productivity gains were more than offset by lower volumes, unfavorable manufacturing absorption and the LBK inventory write-down.\nTurning to Health & Biosciences, strong results from certain segments, including cultures & food enzymes, grain processing and home & personal care were offset by volume declines in health, driven primarily by the continued soft market conditions across the probiotics and broader dietary supplements markets.\nFrom a profitability perspective, pricing and productivity gains were more than offset by lower volumes and unfavorable manufacturing absorption. Scent continued to remain resilient, performing strongly this quarter, led by double-digit growth in Consumer Fragrance, and high single-digit growth in Fine Fragrance with solid contributions from both volume and price. This, coupled with strong productivity, led to growth and margin expansion across the division.\nThese initiatives also drove strong growth in Pharma Solutions, which saw a 16% increase in adjusted operating EBITDA on a comparable currency-neutral basis, led by solid performance in our core pharma business, and ongoing pricing and productivity gains.\nTurning to Slide 18. Cash flow from operations totaled $375 million this quarter as a result of our very focused efforts to drive strong working capital improvements and rightsize our inventories. We are ahead of target, having achieved approximately $320 million inventory reduction year-to-date after normalizing for LBK write-down. I would like to reiterate that while this inventory reduction program is adversely impacting the P&L through negative manufacturing absorption, it is a short-term impact that we will be recovering over time.\nCapEx for the first half was $290 million or approximately 4.9% of sales. Given this, our free cash flow position for the quarter has improved sequentially from last quarter and was $85 million in Q2. Included in our free cash flow is about $160 million of cost primarily related to integration and transaction-related costs. We also distributed $413 million of dividends to our shareholders.\nIn Q2, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $641 million. Additionally, net debt for the quarter totaled approximately $10.6 billion, with net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA of 4.5x. Our trailing 12-month credit adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $2.2 billion. Improving our leverage profile and ensuring IFF continues to meet its deleverage commitments remains a top priority; and I am pleased with the strong working capital improvements made to date.\nWith the initiatives in flight, including our portfolio optimization efforts, ISF is on a path to delever according to our plan through the rest of 2023 and into 2024. As we mentioned, we remain laser-focused on achieving our target leverage profile to improve cash flow and the portfolio actions and other strategic initiatives we've discussed today.\nMoving to Slide 19. Like many in our sector, we continue to navigate this unprecedented market environment. Consequently, we now expect many of the challenges that we faced through the first half of the year to continue through the second half of the year, including customer destocking and related consumer demand visibility constraints.\nAnd as a result, we have revised our second half outlook. Importantly, we remain intently focused on the leverage that we can control, including accelerating sales growth, delivering positive price inflation margin, delivering on our identified productivity initiatives while also seeking additional efficiency opportunities and driving continued improvement in cash flow. Ultimately, these actions will strengthen the platform and better position IFF when the environment improves.\nOn Slide 20 is our updated financial guidance. We are now expecting net sales to be in a range of $11.3 billion to $11.6 billion, while our new guidance reflects softer revenue expectations across all businesses, our lower expectations in Functional Ingredients accounts for the majority of the revenue change. For the full year 2023, we are expecting Functional Ingredients volumes to be down double digits. However, the rest of the business to be down low single digits amid continued and temporary customer destocking.\nFor the second half of 2023, we expect sales to be between $5.3 billion and $5.6 billion, with comparable volumes flat to down high single digits. At the midpoint of our volume guidance range, our 2-year average volume is down 4%, which is consistent with what we delivered in the first half. Also, please remember that included in our first half '23 results are approximately $300 million in sales and approximately $30 million EBITDA related to our Savory Solutions and FSI divestitures. With these transactions closed at the beginning of June and August, respectively, our second half '23 financials will be lower by these amounts.\nFor full year '23 adjusted operating EBITDA, we now expect to be between $1.85 billion and $2 billion, which is lower than our previous guidance. This is driven by 3 factors: our reduced volume expectations; $80 million more of higher absorption costs; and the $44 million LBK inventory write-down. We are now expecting our full year inventory reduction to be approximately $425 million, and as a result, the absorption related to our inventory reduction will be approximately $180 million impact to profitability for the full year.\nTo reiterate, this is a onetime transitory impact to the P&L in order to maximize cash flow moving forward. We remain committed to driving working capital improvements through our inventory reduction program as we navigate this near-term complexity.\nAnd finally, and very importantly, in light of this environment, we are maintaining strong cost discipline to drive enhanced productivity across the organization in order to protect profitability. For our full year expectations for interest expense, we now expect it to be around $425 million, mainly due to higher interest forecast on short-term debt and factory programs and a higher balance of short-term debt due to lower earnings. And we also expect our effective tax rate for the year to be 21% or no change.\nForeign exchange headwinds are expected to continue to pressure sales in comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA growth, which we now expect will adversely impact us by 2% and 6%, respectively. This incremental pressure is due to a handful of hyperinflationary currencies that have moved against us in the first half of '23, where FX was a 3-point headwind to sales and a 7-point headwind to adjusted operating EBITDA, and we expect that many of these currencies will continue to significantly devalue in the second half of '23.\nNow I'll turn back to Frank for closing remarks.\n\nFranklin K. Clyburn\n\nChief Commercial Officer & Executive VP, Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nThanks, Glenn. Our incredible teams around the world continue to deliver pioneering discoveries and strengthen our customer relationships, ensuring that IFF is the innovative engine behind the most critical and beloved consumer products. These efforts are reflected in the solid results across the majority of our businesses, despite the current environment, which gives me great confidence in our ability to deliver industry-leading growth and profitability in the years ahead.\nOur strategic plan is showing very encouraging early results. We are investing in opportunities for growth, innovation and enhanced productivity, and we are taking decisive actions to manage through the volatile market conditions, refocusing functional ingredients with an operational improvement plan to strengthen operations and execution and progressing our deleveraging efforts through ongoing portfolio optimization efforts, including the launch of our cosmetic ingredients process.\nAmid even this challenging market environment, we are making great progress transforming IFF into the leader in high-value innovative solutions in the partner for our customers. The actions we are taking today and through the remainder of 2023, will create a stronger IFF, capable of delivering significant value for shareholders and all of our stakeholders.\nWith that, I will open the call up for questions."

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the IFF First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. DeVeau, you may begin.\n\nMichael DeVeau\n\nSenior Vice President of Corporate Finance & Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's first quarter conference call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay. Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. .\nDuring the call, we're making forward-looking statements about the company's performance and business outlook. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K investor release. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release. With me on the call today is our CEO, Frank Clyburn and our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Business Transformation Officer, Glenn Richter. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take questions at the end.\nWith that, I would now like to turn the call over to Frank.\n\nFranklin K. Clyburn\n\nChief Commercial Officer & Executive VP, Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike, and hello, everyone. We delivered first quarter 2023 results in line or ahead of our expectations amidst a challenging operating environment. Our team successfully navigated soft end market demand and customer inventory destocking as they executed on our priorities to deliver on our financial commitments. We are proud of the results and want to thank the entire IFF team for their contribution. However, year-on-year comparisons in a number of areas showed the backdrop in which we are operating remains challenging as I announced on our last call.\nAs you will see from our quarterly financials, we have made solid progress on our objectives of reducing costs to improve efficiency recovering inflation and materially reducing our inventories while improving our service levels to our covers.\nThe key challenge remains volume growth, and our management team remains keenly focused on accelerating profitable sales growth moving forward. Before I get into our first quarter performance, I do want to share an update on our search for our Nourish President. Over the past several months, we have engaged with various leaders about the opportunity to run our largest division. At this time, our search continues as we are looking to attract a well-regarded leader with a strong track record of success that can drive performance in this division. I am pleased with the slate of candidates that we have and look forward to welcoming a new leader in due course. We will provide further updates going forward as we progress the process.\nStarting on Slide 6, I'd like to begin with a high-level look at our performance in the quarter before handing it over to Glenn to discuss our financials and full year outlook in more detail. In quarter 1, IFF generated $3 billion in sales, which reflects 1% comparable currency neutral growth, led by increases in Scent and Pharma Solutions. As we expected, volumes in the first quarter, similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2022 remained under pressure, down high single digits due mainly to consumer demand slowdowns and significant customer destocking actions. It should be noted that we are also comparing to our strongest year ago comparison where our volume grew mid-single digits in the first quarter of 2022.\nAdjusted operating EBITDA finished at $503 million in the first quarter of 2023, and largely was impacted by the lower volumes as well as our proactive effort to rebalance inventories to drive cash flow generation. As we shared earlier this year, we are executing our inventory reduction program, making strong progress in the first quarter. As expected, while it was cash flow positive, it did lead to a significant headwind in terms of profitability as our fixed costs were absorbed over reduced manufacturing volumes which represented approximately a 15 percentage point year-over-year impact. At the same time, we were successfully recovering our total inflation through increased pricing actions in the first quarter and executed on our internal productivity initiatives that continue to deliver strong cost and operational efficiencies.\nFrom a leverage perspective, our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was 4.6x. As we disclosed earlier in the quarter, we have proactively renegotiated our debt covenants and to ensure IFF's continued resilience as we navigate today's complex global macroeconomic environment. These amended agreements will provide us with maximum flexibility as we grow our business and continue to optimize our portfolio to achieve our target leverage profile. To this end, we continue to deliver on our portfolio optimization commitments.\nOur Savory Solutions vestiture is now on track to close at the end of May. In February, we also announced the sale of our Flavor Specialty Ingredients business, to U.K.-based private firm Exponent for $220 million in cash proceeds, which will be used for debt repayment. We expect that this transaction will close by the end of the third quarter of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions. Moving forward, portfolio divestitures remain a central part of our strategy, and we are evaluating several opportunities to further strengthen our capital structure as we drive towards our targeted leverage profile.\nTurning to Slide 7. I'd like to provide a bit more detail on our sales performance in the quarter. As I mentioned, we delivered more than $3 billion in sales in the first quarter, which represents comparable currency-neutral sales growth of 1%. Our revenue growth in the first quarter was led by continued strength in our Scent business and steady performance in Pharma Solutions. In a moment, Glenn will take you through the underlying factors driving the performance across our business segments. But first is important, I provide high-level context on what we're seeing in the environment.\nScent once again delivered a strong performance. Both Fine Fragrance and Consumer Fragrance grew double digits. Our Pharma Solutions segment also delivered solid growth, driven once again by a strong performance in core form. Nourish was flat this quarter as our ingredients business continued to be pressured by macroeconomic factors and destocking which offset growth in flavors and food design. While certain businesses within our Health & Biosciences segment were also challenged this quarter, Cultures & Food Enzymes and Home & Personal Care were 2 strong performers in H&B that we expect will continue to gain share throughout the year.\nTaking a step back and reflecting on our performance, there are essentially a handful of categories that have disproportionately impact our volume performance. Specifically, within our Nourish segment, our Ingredients division, which represents approximately 25% of total company sales and includes protein solutions, from multipliers and sweeteners, core [indiscernible], cellulosics and food protection drove about 60% of our total volume decline in the quarter.\nAs we outlined at our December Investor Day, we are working to improve our performance and have largely addressed our capacity issues and have improved our service levels in these businesses. We are now working on modifying our pricing strategies, enhancing our commercial coverage and simplifying our internal processes, all to grow our project pipeline and deliver more robust growth going forward. And while this will take time and attention, we are doing so with a sense of urgency to ensure that when current market challenges like destocking subside, we are well positioned to capture market share.\nLooking at our profitability for this quarter on Slide 8. First quarter adjusted operating EBITDA totaled $503 million, down 19% on a year-over-year comparable currency-neutral basis as expected. As I shared on our last call, lower volumes related to consumer demand softness and significant customer inventory destocking, plus unfavorable manufacturing absorption related to our inventory reduction program, meaningfully impacted our profitability despite continued strong pricing and productivity gains. We were successful in generating approximately $60 million of gross productivity gains in the first quarter. However, this strong benefit was offset by higher manufacturing-related costs such as lower yields, slower obsolete inventory and higher manufacturing inflation. If we look at our profitability performance, absence of the unfavorable manufacturing absorption, comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA would have declined approximately 4%.\nLooking ahead, we remain intensely focused on controlling our controllables, including identifying additional opportunities to further optimize our operations and strengthen our balance sheet. While we certainly have work to do to fully execute on our refreshed strategic plan. We have taken significant action to ensure our business maintains the flexibility and resilience needed to deliver in any macroeconomic environment. While we do believe 2023 will continue to be impacted by many of these factors and dependent on an improving volume environment in the back half of the year, we continue to believe we can deliver our long-term adjusted operating EBITDA growth target of 8% to 10% on a comparable currency-neutral basis over the '24 to '26 time period.\nI'll now turn it over to Glenn to provide more context around our divisional performance, cash flow and financial outlook going forward.\n\nGlenn Robert Richter\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.\n\nThank you, Frank, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Turning now to Slide 9, let me review our first quarter performance across each of our 4 business segments.\nIn Nourish, sales were flat on a comparable currency-neutral basis, with growth in food design and flavors offset by continued volume declines in ingredients. As Frank shared, Nourish ingredients, which includes protein solutions, emulsifiers and sweeteners, core texturants and cellulosics and food protection had the most pronounced volume declines in the quarter, representing approximately 60% of our total company volume decline. Despite our pricing actions and productivity initiatives in the quarter within our Nourish segment, the lower volumes and the unfavorable manufacturing absorption due to our inventory reduction program that I mentioned earlier, more than offset those efforts, contributing to a 27% year-over-year decrease in currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA at $208 million. Those same pressures impacted Health & Biosciences this quarter with a 3% year-over-year decrease in comparable currency neutral sales and a 19% year-over-year decrease in comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA despite price increases and strong productivity gains. While we saw solid growth in Cultures & Food Enzymes and Home & Personal Care, lower volumes and unfavorable manufacturing absorption also pressured our performance.\nAs Frank mentioned earlier, our Scent division continues to perform quite well, delivering an 8% increase in comparable currency neutral sales and a 1% increase in comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA and driven by double-digit growth in Fine Fragrance and Consumer Fragrance. Scent's growth this quarter was driven by higher volumes, pricing and productivity gains as the division has remained resilient.\nLastly, I'm pleased to share that Pharma Solutions delivered a 4% increase in comparable currency neutral sales led by continued growth in core pharma. That said, like Nourish and Health & Biosciences, the segment was also impacted by lower volumes and unfavorable manufacturing absorption leading to a 6% decrease in comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA. Overall, for the quarter, sales and EBITDA were slightly ahead of our expectations with pricing on track, modestly better volumes and favorable productivity.\nNow on Slide 10, I'll discuss our cash flow and leverage position for the quarter. Cash flow from operations totaled $127 million this quarter which is an improvement versus the negative $4 million we reported in a year ago period. One bright spot in the quarter was approximately a $200 million decrease in inventory versus our year-end 2022.\nAs I discussed on our fourth quarter call, we have initiated a number of actions across our business and supply chain teams, including system process enhancements to rapidly reduce our inventories over the course of the year. And while this is adversely impacting the P&L through negative manufacturing absorption, it is a short-term impact that will be recovered over time. Looking ahead, while the majority of our efforts to reduce inventories for 2023 are behind us, we do have near-term headwind in Q2, albeit to a lesser degree than as we continue to correct our over inventory position and maximize cash flow. I also want to note that accounts payable in the quarter was adversely impacted as a result of seasoned payment patterns and by our inventory reduction program whereby we slowed the purchase of raw materials, which had a direct impact on our AP. We expect this will improve over the course of the year as we achieve our target inventory level.\nCapEx spending for the quarter was $175 million or approximately 5.8% of sales. This was elevated due to project timing, and we expect to moderate through the balance of the year. We continue to believe that we will be around $500 million in CapEx for full year 2023. Our cash flow for the first quarter was negative $48 million. This is consistent with the seasonality of cash flows for our business. Included in our free cash flow is about $100 million of costs primarily related to integration and transaction-related costs.\nIn terms of leverage, we finished the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $594 million, which includes $4 million in assets currently held for sale, while net debt totaled $10.7 [ million ]. Our trailing 12-month credit adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $2.3 billion and our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA was 4.6x for the quarter, as we mentioned earlier. While our leverage position is slightly higher than in the past few quarters, we were proactive in renegotiating our debt covenants in the first quarter to ensure that we have appropriate capital flexibility as we execute on our strategic priorities and what may continue to be a challenging market. Importantly, we continue to actively evaluate the portfolio with consideration for further divestitures that provide additional financial flexibility and debt pay down without impacting our long-term aspirations.\nTurning to Slide 11 for our consolidated outlook for the fiscal year 2023. As we look ahead to the balance of the year, we continue to believe our volume performance will improve yet acknowledge that market conditions remain uncertain. In our discussion with customers, the majority have signaled that their destocking efforts are ending as they believe the consumer will be resilient in the second half. Nevertheless, we have yet to see a broad-based volume improvement across our business, but we remain steadfast in our focus to control what we can control to protect profitability, maximize cash flow and drive portfolio optimization. For the full year, we now expect sales to be approximately $12.3 billion versus $12.5 billion previously. This change is largely related to energy and raw material pass-through price adjustments. In addition, we have a modest increase in unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. As we noted on our February earnings call, about 30% of our original 6% pricing guidance was related to energy inflation, much of which is passed through the surcharges with energy prices having moderated significantly. We are maintaining our expectation of flat comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA growth and continue to believe adjusted operating EBITDA will be approximately $2.34 billion.\nForeign exchange headwinds are expected to continue to pressure sales and comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA growth, which we now expect will adversely impact us 1% and 3%, respectively. This incremental pressure is due to a handful of hyperinflationary currencies that have and we expect will continue to significantly devalue over the course of 2023. On a comparable currency-neutral basis, all of the above noted items translates into approximately 5% versus approximately 6% previously. The sole driver once again is the energy and raw material pass-through price adjustments as we continue to believe volumes will be flat for the full year.\nIn terms of calendarization, we believe volume will sequentially improve each quarter with a growth rebound expected in the second half of the year as the market challenges are expected to subside and our year ago comparisons are more favorable. To provide additional context, first quarter volume performance was modestly better than we anticipated with the second quarter modestly lower. The net result is that on a first half basis, we are broadly in line with our expectation, which we believe will be offset by a favorable second half. On a 2-year average basis, we expect first half volumes to be approximately negative 2%, reflective of destocking and second half volumes to be up plus 2%. For the second quarter specifically, we expect sales to be approximately $3 billion to $3.1 billion with volume performance down mid-single digits and adjusted operating EBITDA of approximately $540 million to $590 million. We remain intensely focused on improving our inventory levels and driving cost savings through productivity and restructuring initiatives to ensure we generate strong cash flow for the full year. As a result, we continue to target 2023 adjusted free cash flow of more than $1 billion, excluding costs related to integration, restructuring and deal-related items.\nTurning to Slide 12. We recognize that we continue to face a challenging environment, including reduced visibility on consumer and customer demand outlook and the path of inflation. However, we remain intently focused on what we can control with the goal of continuing to strengthen IFF's operating foundation and execution performance. As we've discussed, there are a few top operational priorities that will enable IFF to not only manage these complexities but also to drive long-term profitable growth. Our highest long-term priority is accelerating top line growth. To achieve this goal, we are making key strategic investments in key areas of our business and continue to be more surgical in our pricing actions to ensure we would cover inflationary pressures while supporting volume growth. We have also made great progress in enhancing our customer service and supply chain agility to reduce bottlenecks and increase efficiency. In the first quarter, we maintained strong service levels while also reducing our inventories, improving approximately $200 million from December '22. In conjunction with this, we will be rolling out a redesigned sales, inventory and operations planning process. Enhancing productivity also remains essential as part of our transformation.\nAs mentioned earlier, during the quarter, we successfully achieved approximately $60 million of productivity benefits and began seeing initial results from our restructuring program. I expect this benefit will rapidly increase over the balance of the year and be a strong contributor to our EBITDA performance this year. Lastly, we remain laser-focused on improving our cash flows and delivering our long-term deleveraging target. We expect to continue to make improvements in net working capital through the balance of 2023 and into next year. We are in parallel executing against our portfolio optimization efforts, continuing to test noncore business. In Q2 and Q3, we expect to complete the sale of our Savory Solutions and Flavored Specialty Ingredients businesses with proceeds used to pay down debt. Going forward, this is a central part of our strategy, and we continue to evaluate additional portfolio optimization opportunities to strengthen our capital structure.\nWith that, I would like to turn the call back over to Frank.\n\nFranklin K. Clyburn\n\nChief Commercial Officer & Executive VP, Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Glenn. Moving to Slide 13, I would like to summarize our current position, in line first quarter results and reiterate where we are headed for the remainder of 2023. Over the years, IFF has remained resilient amid a variety of market conditions while successfully transformed the business to meet evolving customer needs. The same is true today as we focus on controlling what we can control and executing on the operational priorities outlined in our strategic refresh in order to achieve our financial vision and drive sustainable, profitable growth that benefits all of our stakeholders. .\nWe continue to believe our volume will improve yet acknowledge that market conditions remain uncertain. As Glenn mentioned earlier, a majority of our customers have signaled that they expect destocking efforts will end and believe the consumer will remain resilient in the second half. We will continue to take action to stay nimble, strengthen our financial and operational foundation and maintain our resilience as we continue to be diligently focused on delivering our operational and financial objectives.\nMoving forward, we remain committed to bringing strong products and innovation to our customers as we meet or exceed their service expectations. Financially, we are focused on improving our working capital positioned by rapidly reducing inventory levels to increase cash flow generation, and we will continue to execute on our growth-focused strategy by enhancing productivity driving operational efficiencies and prioritizing our highest return businesses, all while maintaining capital discipline.\nWe have started the year in line with our objectives and are confident in our ability to continue to execute going forward. Once again, I want to thank our teams for their tireless work to innovate and bring to market the essential products and solutions that shape so many of our daily experiences. And I have no doubt that we are well on track to build a more efficient agile and customer-centric organization poised to deliver sustainable, profitable growth in any market environment.\nWith that, I would like to open the call for questions."

This review of our portfolio and our business is designed to ensure we are able to defend and extend our industry leadership in key markets, geographies and grow our business with key accounts and new customers. This has included evaluating our portfolio through a return on invested capital lens, identifying portfolio optimization and divestiture opportunities. This discipline will enable us to reduce debt and reinvest in our high performing businesses, as well as identify additional growth opportunities in attractive end markets and geographies that will allow us to foster long-term growth even amid ongoing external headwinds.\nIt has been an important endeavor not only to help us streamline the business, but also ensure that we are focusing on only the highest value opportunities and maximizing our return profile across the entire business. We are in the process of refining our operating model and the organizational structure to ensure better commercial engagement, enhance One IFF company culture, strengthen talents and key roles and realign incentives to ensure accountability and ownership. We are also finalizing our financial aspirations for full year 2023, as well as what we believe the business should deliver longer term under more normalized conditions and the capital allocation strategies necessary to achieve them all, while prioritizing accelerated growth of our high-performing businesses.

And good morning to everybody. I want to start today's call by recognizing our teams and the incredible work they've done throughout '22 to bolster IFF's industry leadership and also to continue delivering innovative solutions for our customers amid the challenging operating environment. As part of our Investor Day in December, we unveiled the next phase of our strategic transformation including our strategic priorities and a refreshed operating model that will better position IFF to drive long-term profitable growth and capitalize on the market opportunities ahead of us. The plan seeks to maximize our competitive advantage and ensure that we are operating as an even more innovative, efficient and disciplined company.\nAs we delivered solid 2022 result and 2023 is in full swing, I am pleased to share that we are advancing key elements of this plan and excited to update you on today's call. It is a true privilege to work along such talented and dedicated colleagues. Across our global platform, it is clear that our teams are committed to IFF's continued transformation as we delivered unmatched innovation, service and quality in the solutions that meet the needs of our customers, both today and tomorrow.\nNow on Slide 6, I'd like to reiterate the financial and strategic initiatives central to the strategic refresh that we were discussing during our Investor Day last December. Following an extensive assessment with our key stakeholders, including our customers, shareholders and key partners, we've identified several top priorities that will guide IFF's next chapter. First, we're focused on jump-starting even stronger growth across the business. There's no question that our robust portfolio provides a clear strategic advantage by doubling down on customer excellence and making strategic investments in the opportunities that will reap the greatest returns for our business will be better positioned to drive sustained profitable growth.\nWe have many of the pieces in place to support future growth, a highly diversified offering, serving attractive end markets, global talent and a world-class R&D organization. Our long-term success requires a more disciplined approach to ensure that growth does not come at the cost of profitability. We must deliver on this objective, and we are laser-focused on doing so, particularly amid the macroeconomic pressures we are facing today, it is essential that we target enhanced cost and productivity initiatives.\nIn 2022, we implemented several productivity and cost reduction efforts that have proven effective towards offsetting market challenges. Ultimately, our goal is to realize net annual savings of approximately $350 million to $400 million between 2023 and 2025, including the additional $100 million in run rate savings we announced at our Investor Day to support this reinvestment and increased profitability.\nMoving forward, we will be disciplined to focus on the areas of our business that will best support our profitable growth, investing in R&D to get projects to market more efficiently, enhancing end-to-end productivity to drive improved costs and processes and further improving our supply chain to be more efficient. An essential component of our value creation plan is our work to simplify our operating model to closely align with our 3 core end markets: food and beverage, home and personal care and health and become One IFF. This new model will be critical to achieve the goals I just outlined as we enhance our ability to grow profitably through a more customer-centric and market-backed approach.\nAs a result of these efforts, we are building a stronger financial profile for IFF and are targeting sales growth of 4% to 6% and adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 8% to 10% on a comparable currency-neutral basis over '24, '25 and '26. We also remain committed to deleveraging our balance sheet below the 3x net debt-to-credit adjusted EBITDA objective for 2024. Underpinning these efforts will be an intense focus on enhancing our ESG leadership and accelerating our efforts to contribute to a more sustainable world through our operations and initiatives. We will also continue efforts to optimize our portfolio, ensuring we have the offering needed to support future growth while pursuing noncore divestitures like our recent announced sale of our Savory Solutions business to improve our capital structure. Doing so, will allow IFF to reinvest in the high-growth areas of our business while ensuring we are operating most efficiently as an organization.\nLastly, we continue to take steps to evolve our Board in line with best-in-class governance standards, with plans to reduce the size of our board from 14 to a target of no more than 10 IFF directors and one icon capital designee director by the 2023 Annual Shareholder Meeting. With this initiative, we are also focused on the composition of the Board and prioritizing the inclusion of senior executives with the most relevant skills, leadership experience and business expertise needed to support IFF's long-term vision.\nAs you may have seen, we have some additional board changes since our Investor Day where we announced Mark Costa is joining us. I would like to welcome Dawn Willoughby and Gary Hu to our Board as well. I also want to take the opportunity to thank several Board members that have recently come off the board or has been announced and will do so at the annual meeting. We are grateful for the years of tremendous contribution and for all of their hard work and service to IFF. Thank you to Dale Morrison, Michael Ducker, Ilene Gordon and Kare Schultz. In addition, I would like to congratulate Roger Ferguson on his upcoming appointment to the Chair of the Board and look forward to continuing to work together.\nMoving to Slide 7. I would like to spend a moment highlighting our new strategic framework. This recently introduced framework will be guided by 3 key pillars: be the premier partner, build our future and become one IFF. Our recently introduced strategic framework is designed to support our mission to do what matters most and drive sustained profitable growth.\nWith our refreshed approach, we have zeroed in on customer excellence, incremental cost reductions, consistent execution and disciplined investments to advance the opportunities with greatest potential returns. This strategy deeply embeds ESG+ priorities across our entire enterprise, strengthening IFF's commitment to positively impact our environmental footprint in the communities in which we operate. With this refreshed strategic framework, we are better positioned to meet evolving customer expectations. We're aligning even more powerfully with our customers while fulfilling our purpose of applying science and creativity for a better world.\nNow on Slide 8, there are 8 key areas that underpin our strategy to advance our growth agenda and pursue cost reduction and enhance our operating plan. Our growth strategy will rely on improvements to our supply chain, enhanced commercial execution, geographic expansion and advantages from harnessing our innovation advantage. As I mentioned, our focus on driving greater productivity and efficiency are equally important to our sustained success. And finally, introducing our end market-driven operating model, strengthening our talent pipeline and culture and improving our digital capabilities will complement our ongoing growth and productivity initiatives to support our long-term strategy. Together, these focus areas will enable us to unlock incremental value for our stakeholders and pursue profitable growth in 2023 and beyond while staying nimble through macroeconomic conditions.\nMoving to Slide 9. I'd like to review IFF's performance for the full year in which we delivered solid top and bottom line performance despite a very volatile market environment. These results and the progress we've made toward our key operational priorities demonstrate the strength of our global teams, the demand for our offerings and the effectiveness of our productivity initiatives. In 2022, we delivered $12.4 billion in sales, a 9% growth over the previous year on a comparable currency-neutral basis. Adjusted operating EBITDA was approximately $2.5 billion, which equated to comparable currency-neutral adjusted EBITDA growth of 4% versus the prior year.\nWhile we were challenged by inflationary pressures over the year, our pricing actions and productivity initiatives helped us to offset and address these challenges over the course of the year. All in, IFF recovered more than $1 billion in revenue through strategic price increases in 2022. This allowed us to fully offset our raw material, energy and logistics inflation seen throughout the year. We also continue to execute on our productivity agenda where our focus on greater efficiency and the optimization of our supply chain to reduce cost delivering nearly $150 million in productivity benefits in 2022.\nAligned with our portfolio optimization initiative, we also successfully completed the sale of our Microbial Control business and announced the sale of our Savory Solutions business. Together, these transactions will contribute more than $2 billion in gross proceeds to strengthen our capital structure. We will continue to examine our business and explore additional noncore divestitures and other timely optimization opportunities to further reduce our debt and direct focus to our core parts of the business. At year-end, our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.1x. While we made progress against our deleveraging target, this will be a priority for us moving forward as we prioritize cash flow generation in 2023.\nNow on Slide 10, I am pleased to share that IFF delivered $12.4 billion in revenue for the full year, representing 9% growth in year-over-year currency-neutral sales. Our Nourish business was a major growth driver, though we saw growth across our 4 divisions in nearly all of our submarkets. I will cover this in a bit more detail in a minute. As expected, foreign currency impacted our results through the year given the significant volatility across the global markets in which we operate.\nLooking at our overall profitability in '22 on Slide 11, despite the combination of inflation and global supply challenges, pressuring our profitability margin, IFF delivered 4% growth in comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA. As I mentioned earlier, the strategic pricing actions taken throughout the year were essential in managing the significant inflation we face. The productivity initiatives we undertaken in '22 more than offset volume weakness as we deliver nearly $150 million in operational efficiencies, which drove our full year profitability in the challenging operating environment.\nMoving forward, we'll continue to closely monitor the macroeconomic environment and take the steps in the areas which we can control to ensure we deliver for our customers, our shareholders and our stakeholders. On Slide 12, now our strong performance across business segments showcased the resilience of our portfolio and the underlying dynamics contributing to our overall top line growth. For the full year, Nourish achieved currency-neutral sales growth of 11% compared to the previous year, with $6.8 billion in overall net sales. This was led by double-digit growth in food designs and ingredients as pricing actions and productivity initiatives led to a 5% increase in adjusted operating EBITDA.\nAlthough impacted by lower volumes, price increases in Health and Bioscience enabled the business to deliver 4% currency-neutral sales growth in 2022, primarily driven by strong performance across all segments, particularly in culture and food enzymes and animal nutrition. Scent also delivered strong 8% currency neutral growth with total net sales totaling $2.3 billion, led by double-digit growth in Fine Fragrance and strong single-digit increase in Ingredients and Consumer segments. Pharma Solutions achieved 15% currency-neutral growth driven by demand in our pharma business and mid-single-digit growth in industrial.\nDue to volume growth and successful results from our pricing and productivity initiatives, Pharma Solutions enhanced profitability and achieved an impressive 25% increase in adjusted operating EBITDA. Before turning it over to Glenn, I want to provide a comment around fourth quarter performance. While we anticipated a challenging quarter, the combination of volume deterioration throughout the quarter accelerated in December, as well as its impact on our P&L and negative manufacturing absorption and higher inventories led to a shortfall relative to our expectations. Much of this can be attributed to customer destocking and also softening consumer demand, consistent with what many of our customers have already reported.\nNevertheless, as an organization, we need to be better at driving volume growth with our customers, an imperative part of our go-forward strategy. In addition, we will enhance our demand management efforts, process and tools as it relates to inventory management to ensure we are maximizing cash flow generation. I am confident that the addition of new leadership, particularly in Nourish division when our new leaders named and in operations with the recent addition of Ralf Finzel. I have no doubt that through greater commercial execution and more defined processes, we have a lot of opportunity ahead to maximize value creation for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Glenn to provide you an update on fourth quarter results and an overview of business level performance.\n\nGlenn Robert Richter\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.\n\nThank you, Frank. Greetings, everyone. Let me add my apologies for the technical issue. You should have seen we're both sweating. So I'll start off by just reiterating, as Frank mentioned, the financial and operational initiatives we implemented during the year, they have proven valuable in helping buffer the broader economic headwinds. But at the same time, we recognize, while we've taken some important steps, we have not fully delivered against our financial objectives. We recognize we have more room for improvement to realize our goals and create a more profitable organization, and I assure you we continue to be intently focused on this going forward.\nLooking at fourth quarter results, IFF generated $2.8 billion in sales revenue. On a comparable currency-neutral basis, sales were up 4% for the quarter with growth achieved across nearly all divisions. Our adjusted operating EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $441 million, and our comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA declined 5%. As it was significantly impacted by lower volumes more than anticipated, which led to meaningful impact from negative manufacturing fixed cost absorption despite continued strong pricing and productivity gains. Because of this, we saw a year-over-year decline of approximately 200 basis points to our adjusted operating EBITDA margin. Despite being partially offset by lower effective tax rate, our Q4 EPS ex amortization was 12% lower due to lower adjusted operating profit.\nCurrency headwinds also present a significant challenge in the quarter with a 7-point adverse impact on sales and an 11-point adverse impact on adjusted operating EBITDA versus the prior year, encouraging recent trends within the currencies have been promising. Clearly, a difficult market environment has weighed on our performance in the fourth quarter. However, I am confident in the steps that IFF is taking as part of our strategic refresh to create a stronger, more resilient business moving forward. Urgency is key and controlling what we can control is our focus: enhancing sales execution disciplines, continuing to price surgically to offset ongoing inflationary pressures, accelerating and importantly, expanding our productivity efforts and more aggressively managing cash flow.\nOn Slide 14, I want to provide more color on our sales performance in the quarter. In a very difficult operating environment, including strong currency headwinds, we realized 4% comparable currency-neutral sales growth. For the quarter, we saw growth in Nourish, Scent and Pharma Solutions. Health and Bioscience, which overlaps strong double-digit growth from prior year experienced a revenue decline. Factoring the strong year ago comparison, H&B is up 5% on a 2-year average in the fourth quarter. I'll go into more detail on the following slides. In the fourth quarter, we also saw a more pronounced slowdown in terms of volumes than we initially expected, down high single digits for the quarter, due mainly to consumer demand slowdowns and significant customer destocking actions. We estimate that about 75% of the drop in volume in Q4 is related to destocking, with the balance coming from softer consumer demand.\nTurning to Slide 15. The fourth quarter market challenges also significantly affected our margins. Comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA decreased by 5%, impacted by volume declines, including negative manufacturing fixed cost absorption and currency pressures. However, pricing actions allowed us to recover the total cost of inflation. Additionally, we delivered notable productivity gains and operational efficiencies, which helped offset some of the volume pressures we faced in the market.\nNow let's take a look at segment performance on Slide 16. Overall, we saw top line growth across most of our segments in the quarter. Nourish's solid comparable currency-neutral sales growth of roughly 4% year-over-year was driven by continued growth in food design and ingredients. Health & Bioscience, which saw a 3% decrease in comparable currency neutral sales delivered solid performance in Animal Nutrition and Cultures & Food Enzymes despite declines in Health & Grain Processing. Both Nourish and Health & Bioscience saves profitability pressures with 11% decline in comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA across both due to lower volumes.\nOur Scent division performed particularly well in the quarter, delivering 6% year-over-year sales growth on a comparable currency-neutral basis that was supported by double-digit growth in Fine Fragrance and mid-single-digit growth in Consumer Fragrance. We were also encouraged by since 25% growth in comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA due to a combination of favorable product mix, to catch up in pricing to raw material costs and productivity gains. Our Pharma Solutions segment again delivered excellent performance in the quarter, totaling $221 million in sales, a 15% increase on a comparable currency-neutral basis, driven by another quarter of double-digit growth in our core pharma business. However, like Nourish and H&B, price increases and productivity were more than offset by lower volumes and higher energy costs.\nMoving to Slide 17. I would like to provide some additional commentary on our free cash flow dynamics in the year and the progress towards our deleveraging targets. For the full year 2022, cash flow from operations totaled $345 million, while 2022 CapEx was $504 million or roughly 4.1% of sales. Our free cash flow for the full year was candidly disappointing at a negative $159 million. Our free cash flow included about $300 million of costs related to integration and transaction-related items. As we discussed in last quarter's call, our free cash flow for the year has been significantly impacted by growth in working capital, predominantly by higher inventories caused by inflation, demand slowdown and destocking by our customers.\nOur priority, as Frank mentioned in 2023 is to take significant actions to improve net working capital with a major focus on inventories to drive cash flow. Accordingly, we have initiated a number of actions across our business and supply chain teams, including systems and process enhancements to rapidly reduce our inventories over the course of the year. And while we understand that this will result in negative manufacturing absorption, adversely impacting the P&L in the short term, we are prioritizing improved working capital to maximize cash flow results.\nTo keep you with our commitment to return value to our shareholders, we also paid out $810 million in dividends in '22. As I mentioned during our Investor Day, we are committed to continuing to grow the dividend and will balance dividend growth as we consider reinstituting our share repurchase program once we get debt below 3x net debt-to-credit adjusted EBITDA. In terms of leverage, we remain focused on efforts to reduce our debt and finish '22 at 4.1x net debt-to-credit adjusted EBITDA ratio. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $535 million, including $52 million of assets currently in assets held for sale, while gross debt for the year totaled $11 billion.\nAs part of our strategic priorities, we remain committed to achieving our deleveraging target of 3x net debt-to-credit adjusted EBITDA by 2024, including through deploying proceeds from completed divestitures. Importantly, as Frank mentioned, we will be exploring further opportunities to streamline our portfolio while dedicating resources to our highest growth businesses.\nTurning to our consolidated outlook on Slide 18. For the fiscal year 2023, we expect revenue to be approximately $12.5 billion and adjusted operating EBITDA to be approximately $2.34 billion, representing comparable currency-neutral sales growth of approximately 6% and comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA flat versus prior year. We expect year-over-year foreign exchange to have no impact to sales growth and have a modest or approximately 1% negative impact to operating EBITDA growth.\nLet's move to Slide 19. Given the number of moving parts affecting our '23 outlook, we thought it would be helpful to unpack each of the components impacting year-over-year adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted portfolio, which includes the Health Wright products acquisition, the '22 sale of the Microbial Control business and the anticipated close of our Savory Solutions divestiture in May of this year, comparable 2022 EBITDA starts at $2.37 billion. As previously mentioned, we expect full year pricing to fully offset inflation with a net 0 EBITDA impact in the year. In our plan, we've assumed volume will be flat with high single-digit negative volumes in Q1, modestly down in Q2 and volume growth in the second half. In addition, we are anticipating mix to be slightly unfavorable for the year as we expect some of our higher-margin categories will experience volume pressure, particularly in the first half of '23.\nIn order to rebalance our inventories and with driving cash flow generation as an imperative for us this year, we anticipate negative manufacturing absorption will impact us significantly. Specifically, we expect that our actions to reduce inventory will adversely impact our adjusted EBITDA growth by several percentage points expressed in year-over-year growth terms. We anticipate that this will yield a strong improvement in inventories and be a core driver to our targeted 23% adjusted free cash flow of more than $1 billion, excluding costs related to restructuring and deal-related items.\nIn terms of cost savings, we plan to drive significant productivity by accelerating our previous launch programs, which focus on end-to-end operations improvements, supply chain efficiencies, procurement and demand management, we are also undertaking additional actions to cut costs across the organization and reduce our overall spend where possible, including in our [D&A line]. We anticipate that these additional actions to deliver an annualized run rate savings of $100 million. We will also be reinvesting some of our productivity to drive our top line through strategic growth initiatives, specifically in R&D, our commercial teams and technology, as we begin executing our long-term strategy.\nFinally, we expect currency to have a modest year-over-year negative impact on EBITDA growth of approximately 1%. As mentioned in terms of the cadence throughout the year, we are anticipating the first half to be more challenging, particularly the first quarter, with a back half improvement. In particular, we expect first quarter comparable performance to be impacted by more challenging volume conditions offset by pricing benefits. For the quarter, we expect sales to be approximately $2.9 billion to $3 billion with adjusted EBITDA of approximately $470 million to $490 million.\nAs I conclude on the next slide, I want to highlight our 4 key areas of focus for '23 and provide further perspective relative to our detailed execution plans for each. First, we are committed to accelerating sales growth as we move through 2023. While we do expect volumes to be under pressure from the items I discussed earlier, we are sharpening our sales execution discipline and continue to be more surgical with our pricing actions with the goal of progressively improving throughout the year. The build-out of the commercial excellence team, targeted growth investments and increasing our focus on revenue synergies will allow us to capture new wins.\nSecond, as previously outlined, we are focused on enhancing our customer service levels and supply chain efficiencies. With this in mind, we will be setting more granular customer service and related inventory goals by business utilizing our ROIC framework to guide those goals. Supporting these efforts, we will be rolling out our redesigned sales, inventory and operations planning process. Third, as mentioned, we are determined to accelerate our synergy and productivity efforts this year as well. For your reference, included in our '23 guidance, we are targeting more than $200 million of gross cost reductions from productivity and restructuring benefits. Fourth and very importantly, we're intently focused on maximizing our cash flow and accelerating deleverage of our balance sheet. We are being extremely aggressive in managing our working capital through a heightened focus and improved processes and systems, and we are also actively working to complete our additional noncore divestitures in evaluating additional portfolio opportunities. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Frank.\n\nFranklin K. Clyburn\n\nPresident of Nourish Division, CEO & Director, International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.\n\nThank you, Glenn. Before I open the call for questions, I want to take a moment to reflect on what has continued to make IFF a strong, resilient organization and a category defined leader in our industry. I joined IFF almost a year ago and an important moment in the company's transformation. And while our global business sought to navigate an incredibly complex operating environment. As I've mentioned before, what attracted me to IFF was its enterprise-wide purpose to apply science and creativity for a better world.\nSince then, I have seen this purpose serve as a guiding light as we have continued to build on our to -- build out our teams, expanded in new markets and strengthen our innovation portfolio and pipeline together. In 2022, we have executed tough pricing actions, rolled out new productivity initiatives and found successful ways to optimize and streamline our portfolio. So we're investing in areas that will generate growth, enhance our profits and reduce our debt. Most significantly, we have unveiled our refreshed growth strategy and our focus on carrying out those initiatives to ensure we are delivering for our customers while also creating strong returns and sustained profitable growth into the future.\nOur teams here at IFF have rallied to meet the challenges in front of us, and I'm confident in our future heading into 2023 and beyond, especially based on the excellent reception from all of our stakeholders following the announcement of our strategic refresh in December. Although we enter 2023 with a cautiously optimistic outlook. I am confident that we have the strategy and the people to address any challenge and deliver long-term value for shareholders and other stakeholders. IFF continues to play an essential role in the daily lives of so many people around the world, and I'm energized by the unique opportunity in front of us. IFF has built an incredible foundation as a trusted partner with world-class talent, a robust R&D pipeline, broad portfolio, and I'm confident that our refreshed strategic framework and new operating model will allow IFF to increase our customer centricity, more closely align with today's marketplace and deliver most efficiently for our customers around the world. With that, I would like to now open the call up for questions."

We are focused as ever on enhancing our operational plan and are making great progress towards completing the strategic refresh process and sharing this with you on December 7 at our Investor Day. I will then share our year-to-date performance and then turn the call over to Glenn, who will provide a detailed look at our third quarter financial results and discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2022. Once complete, we will then open the call up for any questions.\nBefore we move ahead, I do want to take a moment, as I always do, to thank our dedicated colleagues around the world. It continues to be an unpredictable year, and our colleagues continue to work tirelessly to deliver for our customers. Our global IFF team members are truly committed to servicing our customers, and I continue to be so inspired by our team's determination and ingenuity.\nNow beginning with Slide 6, I'd like to provide an update regarding our progress to complete our strategic refresh and begin putting this enhanced plan into action. We are now working diligently to operationalize our new divisional strategies and begin executing these focused, integrated and value-additive strategies with our customers and in the marketplace.\nThis next chapter in our company's transformation is intended to ensure we are going to market as the most effective and innovative IFF we can be to extend our position as a trusted partner to our customers and maximize value for them, employees and shareholders, both in the near and long term.\nLet me review what we focused on and what we've accomplished through this comprehensive enterprise-wide review process. This review of our portfolio and our business is designed to ensure we are able to [defend] and extend our industry leadership in key markets, geographies and grow our business with key accounts and new customers. This has included evaluating our portfolio through a return on invested capital lens, identifying portfolio optimization and divestiture opportunities.\nThis discipline will enable us to reduce debt and reinvest in our [high-performing] businesses as well as identify additional growth opportunities in attractive end markets and geographies that will allow us to foster long-term growth even amid ongoing external headwinds. It has been an important endeavor not only to help us streamline the business, but also ensure that we are focusing on only the highest-value opportunities and maximizing our return profile across the entire business.\nWe are in the process of refining our operating model and organizational structure to ensure better commercial engagement, enhance [one] IFF's company culture, strengthen talent in key roles and realign incentives to ensure accountability and ownership. We are also finalizing our financial aspirations for full year 2023 as well as what we believe the business should deliver longer term under more normalized conditions and the capital allocation strategies necessary to achieve them, all while prioritizing accelerated growth of our high-performing businesses.\nWith this collective foundational planning, I am confident that IFF will fully capitalize on our clear portfolio advantage and deliver value to all of our stakeholders. We look forward to sharing more with you at our Investor Day on December 7.\nMoving to Slide 7. I'd like to provide highlights of IFF's performance year-to-date. Despite a volatile market environment over the last 9 months, IFF has continued to execute on our operational priorities to achieve strong top and bottom-line results. Year-to-date, we have delivered $9.6 billion in sales, which translates to 11% comparable currency-neutral growth, and our comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA grew 6% to $2 billion.\nThrough the first 9 months, we continued to take strategic pricing actions as necessary to offset inflationary pressures, and as a result, have fully recovered total inflation cost to date.\nTurning to productivity by focusing on efficiency in our manufacturing processes and optimizing our supply chain and procurement, we captured over $125 million in extremely valuable operational efficiencies and deal-related synergies through the first 9 months of 2022. Accelerating productivity represents one of our top priorities and is increasingly important given the more challenging economic environment heading into the fourth quarter and full year 2023.\nTo this end, we are accelerating and expanding our efforts beyond our existing supply chain, end-to-end manufacturing, economic profit and global shared services platform initiatives we outlined on our second quarter conference call. We are now looking at our total cost structure to ensure we are optimized around go-forward strategic priorities to drive greater efficiency and effectiveness. These initiatives will be critical to support our growth strategy all while positioning us to drive long-term profitable growth.\nTo support our continuous improvement efforts within operations, I am pleased to welcome Ralf Finzel to our executive team as Executive Vice President and Global Operations Officer. He joined us from Honeywell International Performance Materials and Technologies Business Group, where he most recently served as Vice President of Integrated Supply Chain. Ralf brings decades of leadership experience, and his focus on operational excellence, sustainable continuous improvement and customer satisfaction ensures he will be a key contributor to IFF's success moving forward as he will be accountable to deliver on our net productivity goals.\nIn addition, I am pleased to announce that we've hired a new Chief Procurement Officer, [Alex Turolla], who will be responsible for leading all of IFF's procurement efforts globally with the goal to move from procurement to strategic sourcing. [Alex], who joins from [Mondelez International], where he served most recently as Senior Vice President, Sourcing Global Direct Materials, managing $11 billion globally, brings significant experience in end-to-end supply chain operations and procurement.\nWe also continue to progress against our portfolio optimization efforts now having successfully completed the divestiture of our Microbial Control business at the beginning of the third quarter. The proceeds were used to reduce our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA ratio to 3.9x from 4.4x at the end of the second quarter. As mentioned earlier, we continue to assess the profitability and potential of each of our businesses and explore additional noncore divestitures and other timely optimization opportunities to improve our capital structure and achieve our deleveraging target.\nNow I'll turn it over to Glenn to provide a deeper dive into our third quarter as well as an overview of the performance of each of our businesses.\n\nGlenn Robert Richter\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.\n\nThank you, Frank, and welcome, everyone.\nStarting on Slide 8, I would like to provide an overview of our third quarter performance. In Q3, IFF generated approximately $3.1 billion in sales, representing 10% year-over-year growth on a comparable currency-neutral basis, primarily driven by double-digit growth in our Nourish and Pharma Solutions divisions. Pricing was a strong contributor to growth and as expected, volumes were down marginally in the quarter.\nIt should be noted that on a 2-year average basis, which factors our strong 8% year ago comparison, volume growth is running at about 4%. And while we have seen strong volume growth across most parts of our Pharma and Scent businesses in the third quarter, Nourish and H&B volumes were challenged.\nTo provide some more color, nearly 2/3 of our volume decline in the quarter came in Protein Solutions, which is part of the Nourish business, where we have seen customer destocking to address higher inventory levels in response to sluggish end consumer demand. In H&B, our Health volumes were also challenged in the third quarter, a direct result from weakening market demand in the U.S. and Europe reflected in public market data.\nGross margin was negatively affected by the significant inflationary pressures we faced across our markets. Yet through strategic pricing and productivity gains, IFF delivered adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 3% on a comparable currency-neutral basis. We also delivered solid adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization of $1.36. The strong dollar continued to be a headwind to our business. In the third quarter, we saw an approximately 7% impact on sales, an 8% adverse impact on EBITDA due to foreign exchange.\nBefore moving on, I want to share that we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of $2.25 billion for the third quarter related to our Health & Biosciences business. The primary drivers of the goodwill impairment are related to increases in interest rates and lower business projections due to adverse macroeconomic impacts on volume, continued cost inflation and unfavorable foreign exchange rate variations.\nNow moving to Slide 9, I will provide a brief overview of the performance across our business segments. In the third quarter, we achieved year-over-year currency-neutral sales growth of 10% driven by broad-based sales growth across all of our business segments and nearly all of our sub-business units. Nourish had another strong quarter with double-digit growth and particularly encouraging performance from Flavors, Ingredients and Food Design. Health & Biosciences also saw strong single-digit growth despite pressure in our Grain Processing business.\nScent again saw continued currency-neutral sales growth in the high single digits, thanks to our Fine Fragrance, Consumer Fragrance and Ingredients businesses. Pharma Solutions rebound continues with an impressive 28% increase in sales driven by continued strength in both Industrial and Pharma.\nTurning to Slide 10 and looking at our profitability for the quarter. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $612 million. Comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA grew 3% year-over-year due to the disciplined pricing actions to fully recover total inflation. We also achieved meaningful productivity gains and operational efficiencies from our productivity program, which have helped offset volume headwinds. As discussed last quarter, while we are clearly seeing signs of raw material inflation easing, we will continue taking appropriate targeted actions to offset inflation to maintain profitability.\nNow on Slide 11, I'd like to discuss the underlying dynamics impacting the third quarter performance of each of our business segments. Nourish delivered another strong top line quarter. Nourish's 10% year-over-year sales growth on a currency-neutral basis was driven by double-digit growth in Food Design and Ingredients and sustained growth in our Flavors business. Health & Biosciences also maintain strong performance, delivering 3% in comparable currency-neutral sales growth driven by mid-single-digit growth in our Culture & Food Enzymes, Health, Home & Personal Care and Animal Nutrition offerings. However, for each of these segments, we saw 4% and 1% year-over-year decreases, respectively, in comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA as our price increases and productivity gains we discussed earlier were offset by lower volumes.\nOur Scent division once again delivered a strong performance with 9% currency-neutral sales growth this quarter driven by mid-teen growth in Fine Fragrance and Fragrance Ingredients and high single-digit growth in Consumer Fragrance. The division also saw 3% growth in currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA due to volume growth, our price increases and productivity gains.\nPharma Solutions contributed very strong performance with 28% growth in currency-neutral sales, led by strong double-digit growth in Pharma and Industrial. Similar to Scent, Pharma Solutions also benefited from strong volume, our pricing actions and the productivity gains we achieved in the quarter, leading to an impressive 76% growth in currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA.\nTurning now to Slide 12, I would like to cover our cash flow and leverage position. Through the first 9 months, we generated $189 million in cash from operations with CapEx finishing at $344 million or approximately 3.6% of sales. The net result is that our free cash flow through 9 months was a negative $155 million. Our free cash flow has been significantly impacted by much higher inventories due to a combination of inflation, strategic increases and improved customer service levels and to slowing volumes.\nIn addition, included in our free cash flow numbers are onetime deal and integration-related costs. As a result, we are implementing a series of initiatives to improve our cash flow with an intense focus on managing inventories down. Much of this will be driven by leveraging new S&OP processes and tools in concert with specific targets for each business unit, which [we believe] will improve our inventory efficiency across all parts of the business while continuing to maintain high service levels to our customers.\nIn addition, we will be taking targeted actions to reduce CapEx spend and improve other working capital metrics to further improve our cash position. Importantly, we continue to make progress towards achieving our deleveraging target. As Frank mentioned earlier, we improved our net debt to credit-adjusted EBITDA ratio to 3.9x from 4.4x, which was supported by proceeds from our recent Microbial Control divestiture. We finished the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $538 million, while gross debt for the quarter totaled $10.8 billion.\nTurning to our consolidated outlook on Slide 13, I want to provide some update on our expectations for the remainder of the year. Our business and broader industry continues to face challenging operational conditions with persistent foreign exchange, inflationary and other economic pressures. These challenges have only increased since last quarter.\nWe are certainly encouraged by the consistent sales growth achieved across each of our businesses this quarter, especially in this environment. However, we are adjusting our sales expectations for Q4 as we expect volume to further decelerate due to lower end-market demand, and we expect foreign exchange to remain a significant headwind. These factors will also present challenges to adjusted operating EBITDA.\nIn light of these factors, we are adjusting our full year guidance and now expect full year sales between $12.4 billion and $12.5 billion and comparable currency-neutral sales growth of 9% to 10%. We are reconfirming our adjusted operating EBITDA guidance of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion, though we anticipate results to be at the bottom end of this range as we maintain strong cost discipline and accelerate productivity to offset persistent headwinds and softer volumes.\nLooking into 2023, the current macroeconomic environment makes us cautious. And as a result, we anticipate that we will be in a low-volume growth environment, particularly in the first half of next year. In addition, while we see raw material inflation easing, we do anticipate some year-over-year increases in raw materials and continued volatile energy markets, which will require additional pricing actions.\nAs a result, we will continue to examine and refine our resource allocation to focus on strong cost discipline and accelerating our productivity across our business. We will also continue to implement pricing actions surgically to support our profitability, ensure our business remains resilient.\nAnd while it's still early in our planning process, we are targeting strong comparable currency-neutral sales growth in 2023 to be driven more predominantly by price with more modest EBITDA growth on a comparable currency-neutral basis as we reinvest in the business to accelerate sales momentum and drive long-term profitable growth. Foreign exchange will continue to be a headwind as we roll forward current spot rates. We will spend more time on 2023 at our Investor Day in a few weeks.\nI'll now turn it back to Frank for closing comments.\n\nFranklin K. Clyburn\n\nCEO & Director, International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.\n\nThank you, Glenn.\nI am tremendously proud of the work our teams at IFF have accomplished in the last quarter as we remain laser-focused on developing innovative solutions and exceeding the expectations of our customers around the world.\nAs you can see from our outlook, though we are moving into Q4 with caution, I am confident as we have demonstrated time and again and our global team's ability to navigate even the most complex environments. As Glenn said, we are closely monitoring shifts in the market to effectively address any emerging challenge.\nWe remain intensely focused on controlling the controllable through the year-end, and we continue to work with our customers to surgically implement pricing actions, meet or accelerate our productivity and portfolio optimization objectives, continue to delever our balance sheet and focus on driving profitable growth.\nAs you know, we have made significant progress this year to strengthen our business and become more efficient. By leveraging our strong foundation and being laser-focused on our growth initiatives, I am confident in IFF's ability to be resilient and drive long-term value creation regardless of the market environment.\nBefore I open the call up to questions, I would like to share official details about our upcoming Investor Day, which will be held on Wednesday, December 7 in New York City. We are excited to host this event and share more about the opportunities ahead for IFF, including how we will capitalize on our leadership position, innovate for our customers, generate strong productivity and grow our business for the future.\nWe hope you will all join us, and we look forward to seeing you there for what promises to be an engaging, interactive and informative experience. Registration links for the in-person live event have been sent out, but if you have not received one or have questions, please feel free to reach out to our Investor Relations department. This will also be webcasted broadly for those that cannot travel to New York City.\nWith that, I would like to open up the call for questions."

(Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nMichael DeVeau\n\nSenior VP and Chief IR & Communications Officer, International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's Second Quarter 2022 Conference Call.\nYesterday afternoon, we distributed a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live, and will be available for replay.\nPlease take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we're making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to the outlook for the second half and full year 2022. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K and press release, both of which can be found on our website.\nToday's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP\nmeasures is set forth in our press release.\nWith me on the call today is our CEO, Frank Clyburn; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Glenn Richter. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take any questions you have at the end.\nWith that, I would now like to turn the call over to Frank.\n\nFranklin K. Clyburn\n\nCEO & Director, International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.\n\nThank you, Mike, and hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.\nBefore I dive into our first half results, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the tremendous progress we have made over the last 3 months. Under a challenging operating environment, our global teams continued to display their steadfast commitment to our customers and passion for innovative discoveries as IFF delivered profitable growth. Since joining IFF, I have consistently been impressed by the caliber of the work, innovation and expertise our people deliver as well as the creative culture that underpins our success.\nI once again thank our teams around the world for their hard work. I will begin today's call with an update on our strategy refresh process and value creation opportunities we are focusing on for the near and long term, as well as IFF's recent accomplishments as we execute on our operational priorities. This includes delivering $70 million of cost savings in the first half of the year, taking swift and aggressive pricing action to cover inflation, exiting our Microbial Control business and ensuring that we have the right talent in the right roles. I will then turn the call over to Glenn to provide a detailed look at our second quarter financial results and discuss our outlook for the rest of 2022. We will then open the call up for questions.\nBeginning with Slide 6, I'd like to provide an update on our efforts to refresh our long-term strategic plan. While we are pleased that IFF holds strong positions across many of our business segments today, we are committed to evaluating and fine-tuning both our strategy and execution to best position the business for long-term profitable growth. I am pleased to share that we are making meaningful progress in moving quickly to map out an exciting and ambitious path forward.\nIn Q2, we continued to advance our enterprise-wide review of our business and portfolio to ensure we are well equipped to successfully navigate current and future market conditions while capturing long-term value. Our goal for this comprehensive evaluation is to further develop the refined operating plan to generate sustainable sales growth by ensuring lasting competitive differentiation through innovation, product superiority and provide a clear road map where we can execute our priorities to create significant value to all of our stakeholders.\nAlready, we have successfully completed the foundational phases of the plan. We have identified meaningful opportunities to capture additional profitable growth in attractive end markets, geographies and cross-platform synergies, while also identifying internal opportunities in near-term external pressures that must be navigated to achieve this. Now, we are working to finalize refreshed operating plans that we will align our operating model, talent and incentives as well as finalize our long-term financial targets and capital allocation strategy that prioritizes sustainable long-term growth. In addition, we are strengthening our culture, one that embodies collaboration and accountability to ensure strong execution of our commitments.\nWe will continue to move rapidly and with urgency over the coming months to finalize our refreshed strategy, and look forward to sharing more on this with you at our Capital Markets Day to be\nheld Wednesday, December 7 in New York City.\nMoving to Slide 7, I'd like to give a brief snapshot on where we are focusing as we advance our strategic refresh. There are 5 core areas of focus. First, we are prioritizing a more thoughtful and data-driven approach to our resource allocation strategy. Investment is essential to our future growth, but it is critical that our spending decisions optimize returns and reflect the unique roles that each of our businesses serve in our broader portfolio. I will explain this in more details in a moment. Similarly, we are also making strategic decisions to support our research and development efforts. By focusing on the highest return projects and identifying ways we can leverage our cross-platform offerings we will be even better positioned to accelerate top line growth and extend our industry leadership in key categories. Shortly, we will introduce an enhanced productivity program designed to help us improve profitability and unlock additional opportunities to finance our growth initiatives.\nAt the same time, we continue to evaluate our portfolio to ensure that our offerings closely align to the markets in which we operate, the evolving expectations of our customers and with our long-term objectives. We successfully completed the divestiture of our Microbial Control business, and we will continue to assess the portfolio as we explore additional non-core divestitures to reduce debt and improve our capital structure.\nLastly, we are reviewing our operating model to ensure that our structure, talent and incentives to maximize our unmatched portfolio and go-to-market strategy with our customers. Attracting and supporting the industry's best talent and aligning incentives is critical to drive continued collaboration and accountability across the organization.\nI am focused on making sure we have the right talent to execute our strategic plan, and I'm pleased that we recently announced Deb Borg, who will join us as our Chief Human Resource and Diversity and Inclusion Officer on August 29, 2022. With her deep experience connecting HR, culture, employee engagement and business as well as our change management expertise, she has the right skill set for IFF and our people as we strengthen our execution-driven culture. She brings an extensive track record of building world-class talent and helping the business execute and drive value for all stakeholders. Our success with these initiatives will be supported by our ongoing work to modernize our foundation on data and technology capabilities as we strengthen our internal operations to help ensure best-in-class execution.\nOn Slide 8, I would like to share a bit more about the deliberate choices we are making, specifically how a more strategic and disciplined approach to resource allocation will create exciting opportunities for profitable growth. Across the board, we are focused on driving margin improvements, but to do so effectively, we're pursuing differential management strategy across key areas.\nLast quarter, I shared an ROIC chart, which was a first glimpse into the lens that we are viewing the company through. To move forward with this plan, we have developed a comprehensive playbook that segments our business into 3 distinct archetypes with unique strategic imperatives. When we look at our portfolio, we would consider whether to invest to grow, maximize to drive efficiencies or optimize to rapidly improve performance. Using this model, we remain intensely focused on achieving above-market growth, strengthening our competitive global position, increasing our return on invested capital and analyzing the most valuable use of our existing assets.\nFor example, in a category like Flavors, we see meaningful opportunities to drive above-market revenue growth, primarily through reinvesting in innovation and commercial initiatives. We are prioritizing above-market revenue expansion in this category as opposed to margin improvement alone as we're focusing on large, profitable and faster-growing subcategories like Beverages or Dairy to drive strong value creation. Here, it is more about reinvesting margin upside to ensure we are bringing the best innovation to our customers to drive dollar profit growth.\nOn the other hand, in a market like Animal Nutrition, we are focused on maintaining the consistent growth we've delivered, with an emphasis on driving further productivity. By identifying certain segments in which to reinvest while strategically reducing R&D expenses in others, we will focus on margin improvement and create opportunities to invest in the highest value offerings.\nWe are taking a stronger approach within our optimized businesses, for example, our pectin business, a popular clean-label natural stabilizer, to quickly drive near-term earnings through pricing and cost initiatives while maintaining our market competitiveness and reallocating upside to invest to growth categories like Flavors. I will also say, for those optimized businesses where we do not have a strong improvement plan, we will accelerate divestitures and exit the category, with work already well underway.\nI am excited about this initiative and the progress we are seeing already. Make no mistake, we are running IFF quite differently in bringing enhanced rigor to our operations across every business and function. Earlier this year, we spent time reviewing our key priorities, including pricing and portfolio optimization.\nMoving to Slide 9. I would now like to focus on the multi-year productivity and reinvestment program I mentioned earlier, which I believe is key to achieving our long-term growth expectations and our profitability goals. Since joining IFF, I have spent time analyzing our cost profile and believe, as an organization, we have a significant opportunity to optimize our cost structure. I am fully committed to unlocking this value and have asked the team to accelerate our efforts to ensure we are well positioned to execute as we move into the second half of the year.\nFor more details, I would like to ask Glenn to comment.\n\nGlenn Robert Richter\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.\n\nThank you, Frank, and good morning and good afternoon to everyone.\nAccelerating our productivity and expense synergy efforts represents one of our top priorities, and is increasingly important in a more challenging economic environment in order to maximize financial performance. To this end, we want to provide additional transparency to our multi-year productivity program and the expected results.\nFirst of all, let me describe the scope of our efforts. Overall, we have established 4 productivity efforts that cover approximately 85% of IFF's total cost structure, focused primarily on operations and overhead expenses. The 4 teams include supply chain, which includes our procurement and global logistics operations. Opportunities include driving additional efficiencies in direct and indirect material spending through enhanced procurement strategies and demand management, particularly for indirect spend and reduced logistics costs driven by improved global S&OP processes.\nThe second team is focused on end-to-end manufacturing operations and includes a broad-based set of initiatives, including accelerating our digital manufacturing efforts, driving yield improvements, system-wide best practices and energy savings programs.\nThe third initiative is our economic profit team that is focused on leveraging improved technology and disciplined processes to optimize product mix, rationalize SKUs and enhance make versus buy decisions.\nAnd our fourth team is focused on building out our global shared service platform in [concept] with technology, to drive increased centralization and process standardization to drive efficiencies across our administrative and business support functions.\nIn total, the combined programs are targeting a preliminary net annualized P&L impact of $250 million to $300 million that we expect to be achieved between 2023 and 2025.\nTwo important notes. First, this $250 million to $300 million annual impact is net of reinvestments that are targeted to strengthen our innovation pipeline, expand our commercial efforts across key products, customers and regions, deepen our technology and digital capabilities and strengthen our talent. Secondly, the net savings will be slightly more skewed to 2024 and 2025. We look forward to sharing more details with you at our Investor Day in December.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Frank.\n\nFranklin K. Clyburn\n\nCEO & Director, International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.\n\nThank you, Glenn.\nAs I said, we will provide more specifics on this program at our Investor Day in December, but wanted to share an early indication with you as we committed to provide more details on this topic during our Q1 earnings call. More importantly, at our Investor Day, we will also provide you with a clear and more detailed road map for growth, including our incremental revenue opportunities from our combination with N&B. We remain confident that we have significant opportunities ahead, confirmed by our initial commercial wins and positive customer feedback as well as our competitors following our lead.\nI know that realization of these benefits have been slower than expected due to external factors, including COVID, supply chain disruption, customer bandwidth, pricing initiatives and constrained capacity. However, since joining, I have launched a focused initiative to reinforce our emphasis and address existing gaps.\nSpecifically, we are developing a set of prioritized opportunities, each with clear financial impact, owner and time line to provide confidence in our ability to deliver. This will be a significant focus for me going forward as I'm committed to delivering the value proposition of our combined portfolio and will be personally involved, dedicating significant time and engagement with the business to drive performance.\nI am pleased to say that we continue to see steady wins across our portfolio. Recently, we co-collaborated with a leading alternative protein producer to improve commercial and technical collaboration, essentially upstreaming the incorporation of Heritage IFF flavors into Heritage N&B Protein-Based, exceeding our customers' expectation for plant-based burgers. This resulted in IFF being awarded as a core supplier, one of three, increasing our market share and enjoying a long-term relationship. In addition, we are seeing the value of integrated solutions between our Nourish and H&B divisions.\nThe Dairy category is showing very good collaboration opportunities, thanks in large part to early technical support and a better, together approach with customers. In this win, we were a step ahead of the competition due to early engagement with a dairy customer during culture development phase and showing the best flavor collaboration.\nThese are just 2 examples, but strong proof points that we are moving in the right direction and delivering a better value proposition to our customers.\nNow turning to Slide 10, I'd like to provide an overview of our performance for the first half of the year. Our strong first half results are once again a testament to the strength of our portfolio and the dedication of our talented global teams who have continued to go above and beyond in a complex market. Despite the macroeconomic challenges of the last 6 months, sales grew by a strong 18% or 12% on a currency-neutral basis to $6.5 billion. Comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA grew 8% to $1.4 billion.\nI am proud to report that we increased our quarterly dividend by approximately 3%, the 13th consecutive year of increased payouts to our shareholders, which underscores our belief in our business and IFF's strong future cash flow generation. We also continue to work on deleveraging objectives, where we remain committed to our deleverage target of reducing net debt to EBITDA to less than 3x 36 months post the transaction, which is February 1, 2024. At the same time, we prudently and proactively amended the covenants on our existing credit agreements given the market volatility and uncertainty. Glenn will discuss in more detail.\nAs I mentioned a bit earlier, we also completed the divestiture of our Microbial Control business on July 1 and continuing to evaluate additional divestiture opportunities for our non-core assets as we move ahead based on our category management approach I described earlier.\nNow, I would like to turn the call back over to Glenn to provide a closer look into our second quarter financials.\n\nGlenn Robert Richter\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.\n\nThanks again, Frank.\nTurning first to our consolidated second quarter results. IFF generated more than $3 billion in sales, representing 11% year-over-year increase on comparable currency-neutral basis, primarily driven by double-digit growth in Nourish and Pharma solutions. In terms of our growth contribution, pricing represented the majority, with volumes up modestly.\nOur focus coming into 2022 was to fully recover inflation through pricing actions, and for the full year, we are on track to recover approximately $1 billion in cost inflation. We are doing so in a very thoughtful and strategic manner, over [in fixing] on lower margin and capacity-constrained businesses.\nWhile foreign exchange rates have had an adverse impact on our sales and EBITDA in the second quarter, I'm pleased to report that adjusted operating EBITDA grew 3% year-over-year on a reported basis or 7% on a comparable currency neutral basis driven by productivity gains and pricing actions we implemented in the quarter. We also achieved solid year-over-year earnings per share growth of 3%, excluding amortization.\nBefore moving on, I wanted to share that during the second quarter of '22, we took an impairment charge of $120 million within certain entities in Russia due to a number of factors, including reduced business focus as we have restricted our operations to essential consumer products that include food, hygiene and medicine, supply chain issues, reduced product demand and exchange rate volatility, all as the result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. It was determined that such declines in operating performance were not expected to reverse in the near future, and future expected growth is expected to be limited given the operating conditions in Russia. This non-cash impairment charge was allocated pro rata to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment within the asset group in the amount of approximately $92 million and $28 million, respectively.\nMoving now to Slide 12, I'll provide a brief overview of the underlying performance across our business segments. As I mentioned, sales growth across each of our business segments, including Nourish, Health & Biosciences, Scents and Pharma Solutions contribute to IFF's year-over-year comparable currency-neutral sales growth of 11%.\nNourish was once again our largest growth driver, with a significant broad-based growth across our Flavors, Ingredients and Food Design businesses. Scent had another strong quarter, with currency-neutral sales growth in the high single digits led by Fine Fragrance, Consumer Fragrance and Ingredients. Health & Biosciences delivered mid-single-digit growth due to consistent performance in Health, Cultures & Food Enzymes and Animal Nutrition, as well as Microbial Control prior to the official divestiture completed in July. Both Home & Personal Care and Grain Processing were negative in the second quarter as each business had very strong double-digit comparison in the prior year period.\nLastly, we are pleased by Pharma Solutions continued rebound, having achieved double-digit growth driven by continued strength in our Industrial and Pharma businesses.\nTurning to Slide 13, I'd like to provide a review of our profitability for the quarter. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $700 million, exceeding our expectations and representing 7% in year-over-year comparable currency-neutral growth driven by the pricing actions and productivity gains that I mentioned earlier. Our comparable adjusted EBITDA margin in the second quarter was 21.3%, and on an inflation-adjusted basis would have been approximately 220 basis higher or approximately 23.5%, if we normalize for the impact of pricing contribution to sales. This compares to an EBITDA margin of 22% in Q2 of 2021.\nAs a result of our strategic pricing actions, we have fully recovered total inflation cost to date, and we are optimistic that we will achieve full dollar cost recovery for the full fiscal year. As we continue navigating this uncertain market, we will continue to closely monitor raw materials and logistics costs in the quarters ahead and take appropriate action to offset additional inflationary pressures and maintain profitability.\nOn Slide 14 is an overview of our second quarter performance by business segment. Nourish, which delivered year-over-year comparable currency-neutral sales growth of 15% and 18% growth in comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA, saw strong demand, particularly in Food Design and Flavors. In Health and Biosciences, high single-digit increases in Health and Cultures & Food Enzymes, and mid-single-digit growth in Animal Nutrition drove 4% comparable currency neutral sales growth for the division. While we implemented strategic pricing actions and saw notable productivity gains similar to Nourish this quarter, lower volumes and an unfavorable mix led to 2% year-over-year decrease in comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA.\nIn Scent, Fine Fragrances continue to lead the way with double-digit growth, followed by high single-digit growth in Ingredients and low single-digit growth in Consumer Fragrance. Collectively, Scent achieved year-over-year comparable currency neutral sales growth of 9%, though inflationary pressures outpaced our strategic pricing actions, which led to a 17% decrease in comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA. Our teams are continuing to work with our customers to address these ongoing inflationary pressures, and we fully anticipate to recover all inflationary costs over time.\nLastly, Pharma Solutions was one of our strongest performers this quarter, achieving 10% in year-over-year comparable currency-neutral sales growth and an exceptional 25% increase in comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA, driven by double-digit growth in Industrial and high single-digit growth in Pharma. The division's profitability was further supported by pricing actions and productivity gains.\nTurning to Slide 15, I would like to discuss our cash flow and leverage position for the first half results. In our first 6 months, our free cash flow position was impacted by higher inventory values. This was a result of a combination of continued inflationary pressures and rebuilding inventories to support customer service levels. [$236] million in the first half, representing approximately 3.6% of sales, as we continue to make necessary investments in our business. In addition, IFF delivered $402 million in dividends to our shareholders.\nFrom a leverage perspective, we remain well positioned as we advance our strategic refresh. We finished the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $569 million while gross debt for the quarter totaled $12.15 billion. Note that we received the $1.3 billion gross proceeds from the sale of our Microbial Control business in July. At the end of Q2, we maintained a 4.4x net debt credit adjusted EBITDA ratio.\nIn addition, just last week, we proactively amended our existing term loan credit agreement and revolving credit agreement in order to ensure we maintain adequate flexibility to navigate near-term market uncertainties. The associated amendment fee was approximately $800,000. The amended agreements delayed certain step-downs from maximum permitted leverage ratio of 4.5:1, stepping down to 3.5:1 over time, with the first step down now occurring at the end of the third quarter 2023 versus the end of the fourth quarter 2022 previously. Trailing 12-month credit adjusted EBITDA totaled $2.644 billion.\nAs Frank mentioned, on August 3, our Board of Directors authorized a 3% or $0.02 increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.81 per share of the company's common stock. The quarterly dividend is payable on October 5, 2022 to shareholders of record as of September 23. Including this authorization, we increased our quarterly dividend payment for the 13th consecutive year.\nLet's now turn to our consolidated outlook on Slide 16. As we look to the remainder of 2022, we remain on track to deliver our commitments and are reconfirming full year guidance projected sales of $12.6 billion to $13 billion and currency-neutral sales growth of 9% to 12%. While we are reconfirming our outlook, we also are increasingly cautious on the overall market environment outlook as we navigate continued foreign exchange fluctuations, ongoing inflation and potentially recessionary pressures. We expect to achieve our sales targets through pricing actions as we press ahead toward full dollar cost recovery.\nWe expect foreign exchange pressures to impact sales by approximately 5 percentage points compared to our previously forecasted 4 percentage points. We are also reconfirming adjusted operating EBITDA to be $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion, which equates to currency-neutral operating EBITDA growth of 4% to 8%. Please note that we expect foreign exchange to impact that growth by approximately 6 percentage points versus 5 percentage points previously.\nAs always, we remain laser focused on mitigating the many macroeconomic challenges with an emphasis on controlling what we can control during these uncertain times, notably focusing on pricing execution and productivity.\nIn terms of the third quarter, we expect sales growth to be strong driven by pricing actions, with sales coming in modestly above $3 billion and impacted by incremental foreign exchange headwinds, some seasonality of our business and the divestiture of Microbial Control. The sale of Microbial Control will impact Q3 revenues by approximately $110 million. For the third quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $600 million to $610 million.\nBefore passing the call back to Frank, I want to revisit the 4 core business objectives we outlined at the beginning of the year. Overall, we are executing well against our operational priorities so far this year. Relative to maintaining strong sales momentum, we achieved 12% year-over-year currency-neutral sales growth for the first half of '22 and are targeting currency-neutral growth of 9% to 12% for the full year.\nIn terms of executing our broad-based pricing actions, we've fully recovered the total cost of inflation, and we remain on track to achieve a full dollar cost recovery for the full year '22. Importantly, we are closely monitoring inflationary trends in the broader market environment to ensure we are well equipped to stay ahead and, where necessary, quickly respond to future challenges.\nOn the productivity front, we continue to make tremendous progress towards our productivity savings goals for the full year. In the first half of the year, we delivered over $70 million operational efficiencies and deal-related synergies, well above our expectations. We are well on track to exceed our $100 million full year savings target.\nFinally, relative to accelerating non-core divestitures, we successfully completed the sale of our Microbial Control business on July 1 and are continuing to assess our portfolio to identify additional portfolio optimization and divestiture opportunities in this uncertain market. These divestitures will help us delever our balance sheet and enable us to reinvest in our highest performing businesses.\nWith that, I'll pass the call back over to Frank.\n\nFranklin K. Clyburn\n\nCEO & Director, International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.\n\nThanks, Glenn.\nBefore I wrap up today's call, I want to say I am proud of the efforts of our global teams as we continue to execute amid challenging market conditions. We've achieved strong performance in the first half of 2022 and increased our dividend for the 13th consecutive year. I am confident in our ability to achieve our full year financial targets as we continue executing against our operational priorities and control what we can control.\nAt the same time, we are committed to advancing our strategic transformation efforts, deploying innovation, refining our portfolio and strengthening our culture to deliver strong value creation for all of our stakeholders.\nMoving through the second half of the year, we will be intensely and urgently focused on protecting and growing our business, identifying new strategic value creation opportunities, and communicating our refreshed operating model across the business and the market to position IFF for long-term success. I look forward to sharing more at our upcoming Capital Markets Day in early December.\nI'd now like to open the call for any questions. Thank you."

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nMichael DeVeau\n\nSenior VP and Chief IR & Communications Officer, International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's First Quarter 2022 Conference Call. Yesterday evening, we distributed a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay.\nPlease take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2022. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K filed on February 28, 2022 and in our press release, all of which are on the website.\nToday's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which excludes those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release that we issued yesterday. Please note that we'll be using comparable results for the first quarter defined as 3 months of legacy IFF results, January through March, and 3 months of legacy N&B results in both the 2021 and 2022 periods. These results also exclude the impact of divestitures and acquisitions.\nWith me on the call today is our CEO, Frank Clyburn; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Glenn Richter. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take any questions that you may have.\nWith that, I would now like to introduce Frank.\n\nFranklin K. Clyburn\n\nCEO & Director, International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.\n\nThank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to be speaking with you all and excited to share perspectives from my first 90 days as CEO of IFF. During today's call, I will discuss my initial thoughts since joining IFF and highlight our key operating priorities and commitments as a company for the full year 2022.\nAs I've spent the last 90 days meeting with IFF colleagues and key customers around the world, asking questions, listening and evaluating our business, it has become even more clear to me that IFF has built a very strong foundation with incredible opportunities ahead. Our business has both a robust, diversified portfolio and driven team needed to continue meeting our industry while delivering sustainable, profitable growth.\nSimply put, I am thrilled to lead and work along such a passionate team of more than 24,000 employees with a shared commitment to strengthening customer partnerships and driving differentiated innovations. Together, we will focus every day on the operational rigor and executional excellence required to deliver even greater value for our customers and shareholders.\nBefore moving forward, I first must acknowledge the humanitarian tragedy facing the Ukrainian people since Russia's invasion began. As we have previously stated, IFF unequivocally stands with the people of Ukraine. Our top priority remains the safety of our team members and their families in Ukraine. And like many other global companies, we are working closely with local governments to offer assistance where possible.\nAligned with our core values, several weeks ago, we limited production and supply of ingredients and into Russia, to only those that meet the essential needs of people, including food, hygiene and medicine. Our plan at this time is to continue to supply to the best of our ability in accordance with sanctions, logistics availability and other key factors.\nNow I would like to begin by sharing some initial learnings and insights from my first 90 days with IFF. I will then turn the call over to Glenn, who will provide a detailed look at our first quarter 2022 financial results before providing commentary on our current outlook for the full year 2022. After that, we will open the call for Q&A.\nStarting on Slide 6, I'd like to reflect on what I've seen and heard from our global colleagues, customers, investors, suppliers and members of our Board. As I noted in my introduction, IFF is incredibly well-positioned from a portfolio perspective with an exceptional depth and breadth of product offerings and an unrivaled R&D platform that uniquely positions IFF to win with our customers.\nOur business is poised to benefit from sustained long-term tailwinds for profitable growth as we have demonstrated leadership in the most in-demand consumer categories. We are the largest player in our industry with unmatched global scale, a strong innovation pipeline and a highly diverse and balanced business mix across categories, regions and customers to create significant value. Collectively, these are attractive characteristics and a strong foundation to build upon moving forward.\nEqually important, however, are the clear opportunities to improve our operating practices and ensure that we are achieving our financial commitments. This is one of my top priorities going forward as I believe a consistent and consecutive delivery, of course, within our control, is critical to build trust and credibility as IFF's CEO.\nSpecifically, we are working to cultivate a culture across our entire platform that motivates our teams and ensures accountability across the business.\nWe are continuing to enhance our operational execution with a remained focus on instilling greater rigor and excellence aligning our compensation metrics to keep to KPIs that are measurable and strongly correlate to value creation. Please know that we are committed to investing in capacity, digital, R&D and commercial to capture incremental growth and productivity opportunities to ensure we deliver long-term, sustainable, profitable growth. With all our initiatives, we are closely focused on consistently delivering on our short- and long-term financial commitments and creating enhanced value for all stakeholders.\nMoving to Slide 7. I'd like to provide a bit more detail on the process underpinning our efforts to accelerate value creation across IFF. Our success starts with enhancing our corporate culture to ensure that IFFers worldwide are aligned with our vision of strategic excellence. It starts with establishing a renewed focus on winning while outlining the benefits for our team around the world. To guide our efforts, we are developing a deeper understanding of the sources and drivers of value across the business to help prioritize our investment of energy and resources moving forward. By understanding the facts, our extended leadership team will have the ability to make better business decisions, including investment allocations, which we expect will lead to greater financial returns.\nWith that understanding, we will have better visibility into our strategic road map, essentially setting our profitable growth agenda for both the near and long term as we dedicate strategic investments on the highest value opportunities. Underpinning everything we do will be a commitment to operational rigor and a culture of executional excellence across our platform. Our results in the first quarter are beginning to reflect this commitment to operating discipline, which will remain a top priority for our leadership team going forward. We plan on going into more depth on our strategy and financial outlook moving forward with an investor event that we are planning on having in the second half of 2022. More details to come on that in due course.\nTurning now to Slide 8. I would like to start with the foundational look at our portfolio. Since my joining IFF in early February, our executive management team have begun a full diagnostic of our strategies and business model to ensure we were operating to the best of our ability. As part of this process, we have thoroughly examined our business relative to the drivers of our current and future levels of profitability. To ensure we capture the full cost of doing business, we have gone beyond traditional operating costs to account for invested capital, such as CapEx, inventory and fixed assets. Through this return on invested capital lens, we have incorporated all costs to create a more robust back base across our entire business portfolio to make better resource decisions.\nBased on the preliminary assessment, here's a snapshot of our sub businesses. As you can see, we have a significant amount of high-return businesses, but also like most businesses, we identified opportunities where we can improve our performance. In high-performing areas of the portfolio, we will reinvest with conviction to fuel strong profitable growth. We will also explore all avenues to more efficiently manage resources in our medium-return business with a goal of maximizing our performance. In areas of our portfolio where returns are not meeting our expectations or are below best-in-class benchmarks, we intend to either optimize our capital decisions to improve returns or evaluate appropriate opportunities to deprioritize or exit the business.\nAs we move forward, we are fully committed to maximizing our portfolio to deliver the most attractive returns and value creation opportunities. In fact, for 2022, we have adjusted our long-term incentive plan, replacing our net debt ratio with return on invested capital as a performance metrics to increase focus on capital efficiency.\nNow before I dive into our first quarter results, I want to reemphasize that I am committed to the 4 key operating priorities we outlined earlier this year. Building upon the strong sales momentum we established in 2021, we are first aiming to maintain volume growth consistent with overall industry growth rates. To achieve this, we are making significant investments to increase capacity, improving supply chain bottlenecks and driving greater revenue synergy opportunities.\nOn revenue synergies specifically, it is all about expanded revenue growth opportunities, and we feel good about the longer-term prospects and the power of the portfolio. To highlight an example, we recently were awarded access in vanilla, a large opportunity with a global customer. By leveraging heritage N&B's global technical know-how in ice cream and heritage IFF's vanilla sustainability program, IFF offered a combination of technical expertise and sustainability that competitors do not have. The result was not only strong potential revenue in Flavors but also incremental value creation for total IFF, including protein, emulsifiers and LBG. I'm pleased to see my role in these, the traction we are making and excited to dig in with the business to unlock more growth opportunities ahead.\nTurning to Slide 10. I'd like to provide an overview of our solid performance for the first quarter. Despite the macroeconomic challenges of today's environment, we achieved good sales profit and growth across our business. In the first quarter, IFF delivered $3.2 billion in sales representing 31% growth or 13% growth on a comparable currency-neutral basis. While inflation and global supply chain restrictions continue to impact our profitability margin, we achieved 9% growth in our comparable currency-neutral EBITDA.\nWe also achieved strong adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization of $1.69 for the first quarter. As I mentioned, we are evaluating and implementing specific initiatives to ensure we continue to navigate the future headwinds during the remainder of 2022 and beyond.\nAs a result of increased working capital requirements, higher CapEx and seasonality, our free cash flow results were negatively impacted in the first quarter. Looking ahead, I can assure you this will be a significant focus area for the remainder of the year, and we expect strong improvements in the back half of the year.\nIn terms of deleveraging the balance sheet, we remain on plan as our net debt-to-credit adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.2x. We also delivered meaningful synergies and productivity gains of more than $30 million in the quarter, including operational efficiencies and deal-related synergies. As mentioned, we continue to prioritize portfolio optimization and are making strong progress on the divestiture of the Microbial Control business. It should be noted that the anticipated closing of our Microbial Control business is now expected to happen on July 1 versus June 1 previously to provide more time to complete the separation work streams and minimize disruptions and risk to the Microbial Control business upon close.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Glenn to provide a closer look into our first quarter financials.\n\nGlenn Robert Richter\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.\n\nThank you, Frank. Good morning, and good afternoon to everyone. Let's start on Slide 11 with sales performance of each of IFF's 4 businesses.\nTogether, Nourish, Health & Biosciences, Scent and Pharma Solutions achieved $3.2 billion in sales revenue in Q1, representing comparable currency-neutral sales growth of 13%. Of note, all our sub businesses posted year-over-year comparable currency-neutral growth in the first quarter.\nNourish delivered the most substantial growth with significant broad-based strengths in our Flavors, Ingredients and Food Design businesses. Health & Biosciences similarly achieved strong sales growth, having managed headwinds in the Health business. The Scent division carried its strong momentum from last year through the first quarter with strong results in Fine Fragrance, Consumer Fragrance and Ingredients. Lastly, Pharma Solutions also achieved currency-neutral sales growth driven by the division's continued strength in its industrial business and resume demand for Pharma. In terms of sales growth contribution, pricing increased approximately 8% and volume grew approximately 5%.\nTurning to Slide 12. Let's walk through our profitability in the quarter. First quarter adjusted operating EBITDA totaled $702 million, representing 9% comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA growth versus the first quarter of 2021. Our adjusted EBITDA margin in the first quarter was 21.8% and on an inflation-adjusted basis would have been approximately 175 basis points higher or approximately 23.5%. Margins did come in better than we expected in the first quarter due to stronger-than-anticipated volume growth, better cost management as well as the fact that a significant amount of our higher inflationary costs remains in inventories and did not impact the P&L to the degree originally anticipated. However, this is largely timing-related and will change as we progress throughout the year.\nIncluded in our results is a charge of approximately $20 million related to expected credit loss on receivables from customers located in Russia and Ukraine. While the macroeconomic environment remains incredibly dynamic with continuing inflationary pressures at the moment, we are pleased with the actions taken by our teams to manage through these challenges. We took a very proactive approach and quickly instituted broad-based pricing actions across our portfolio in response to these pressures. Consequently, the actions we have taken have resulted in a full dollar cost recovery of total inflation cost in the first quarter.\nUnfortunately, since our February earnings call, we have seen additional increases in raw material, logistics and energy costs and are diligently working with our customers on incremental pricing actions. One important note to call out is that we are seeing the strong cost increases flowing to inventory, which is due to our inventory days means that the higher cost will eventually impact the P&L as we progress through the balance of the year.\nNow on Slide 13, I would like to highlight the underlying dynamics in first quarter performance of each of our business segments. In the first quarter, Nourish's strong comparable currency-neutral sales growth of 16% was led by double-digit growth in Food Designs and Ingredients. The segment's comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA growth was also strong at 14%, primarily driven by the division's pricing actions, volume growth and productivity gains.\nIn Health & Biosciences, double-digit growth in Health, Microbial Control and Grain Processing and high single-digit growth in Animal Nutrition and Cultures & Food Enzymes drove comparable currency-neutral sales growth of 10% for the first quarter. Similar to Nourish, the segment's comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 8% was led by pricing, volume growth and productivity that helped offset mix challenges.\nIn Scent, Fine Fragrance continued its strong rebound with double-digit growth and Cosmetic Actives and Fragrance Ingredients continue to perform above expectations. As for Consumer Fragrance, the business experienced modest growth in the first quarter. Overall percent on a 6% comparable currency-neutral sales growth, comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA declined 2% as inflationary pressures outpaced pricing for the quarter. As a reminder, in Scent, there is a delay in pricing recovery about 18 months before you fully recover inflation via price increases.\nFinally, in Pharma Solutions, we saw double-digit growth in both Pharma and Industrial to deliver 10% comparable currency-neutral sales growth for the quarter. Volume growth and productivity gains helped drive 10% comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA.\nNow on Slide 14, I would like to address our cash flow and leverage positions. In the first quarter, increased working capital requirements, in part due to seasonality and in part due to increased values of inventory and accounts receivable driven by inflation as well as higher capital expenditures negatively impacted our cash flow results for the quarter. In the first quarter, CapEx totaled $132 million, representing approximately 4.1% of sales. As a reminder, we anticipate our '22 CapEx to be approximately 5% of sales due to '21 CapEx carryover and increased investments in capacity expansion in key technologies which will help support growth while also lowering logistics costs.\nFrom a leverage perspective, we are on plan and are continuing to make progress toward achieving our deleveraging target.\nQ1 ended net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.2x. Gross debt for the quarter totaled $11.7 billion and we finished the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $662 million. Despite the global financial pressures, we remain on track to achieve our deleveraging target of 3x or lower by year 3 post close, which will be supported by our Fruit Preparation divestiture, sale of our Microbial Control business and other noncore business divestitures.\nSlide 15 provides our revised business outlook for 2022. We are adjusting our expected full year '22 revenue up to $12.6 billion to $13 billion from $12.3 billion to $12.7 billion. This reflects the effects of additional anticipated pricing actions not incorporated in our original guidance primarily due to the additional inflationary pressures. This revision also reflects the expected completion of our Microbial Controls divestiture on July 1, 1 month later than originally planned and the acquisition of Health Wright Products completed in April. In addition, our outlook takes into account a weaker euro to dollar currency outlook for the balance of the year.\nWe continue to expect adjusted operating EBITDA in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion as we continue to target full cost recovery of additional inflationary pressures via price increases. On a comparable currency-neutral basis, this translates into sales growth of approximately 9% to 12% versus 6% to 9% previously for the full year, and comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA growth of approximately 4% to 8%, which is unchanged.\nIt should be noted that while we have increased our sales expectations for the full year due to incremental pricing, we have reduced our volume expectations given a more challenging environment including lost revenues as a result of the Russia-Ukraine war, continued global supply chain issues and anticipated softer consumer demand as a result of higher energy prices and general inflation negatively impacting consumer spending.\nOne data point is that in early Q2, we have already seen volumes soften and for the full year, we are now targeting low single-digit volume growth and high single-digit pricing contributions. Also based on current market foreign exchange rates, we expect that foreign exchange will negatively impact sales in 2022 by approximately 4 percentage points versus 2 percentage points previously and adjusted operating EBITDA growth by approximately 5 percentage points versus 4% previously. These changes now reflect current market exchange rates, particularly the euro, where we are assuming that it remains at EUR 1.06 to the $1 for the balance of the year or a blended full year rate of approximately EUR 1.08 to the $1. We are also confirming our '22 CapEx spend will be approximately 5% of sales.\nIn terms of the second quarter, we continue to believe that sales growth will be driven by price increases with volumes contributing much less they did in the first quarter. From an adjusted EBITDA perspective, we expect to be in the range of $640 million to $650 million pressured by unfavorable impacts of currency as well as higher inflationary costs flowing from inventories to the income statement.\nAs I wrap up, I want to revisit the 4 key areas of focus we touched upon in February to update you on our progress. As a reminder, our 4 key priorities for 2022 are maintaining strong sales momentum, executing broad-based pricing actions, capturing synergies and productivity, and accelerating our noncore business divestitures. Overall, we feel good about our progress across all 4 areas in Q1 and are confident in our ability to deliver on these commitments this year.\nIn terms of supporting strong sales momentum, we are increasing our capacity across constrained portions of our portfolio enhancing our supply chain efficiencies, most notably in our H&B, Pharma Solutions and Ingredients business to ensure that we maintain our volume growth in line with or above the industry.\nRelative to executing broad-based pricing actions, in an effort to react more quickly to today's evolving environment and better prepare for tomorrow's challenges, we have significantly enhanced our processes, implemented new pricing tools and established core pricing teams to oversee each of our business units. Our focus has been centered around minimizing the amount of time loss between inflation signals and customer pricing actions to ensure that we quickly adjust priorities to protect profitability.\nWith these changes, we successfully implemented our first round of pricing actions and we covered the total cost of inflation in Q1 '22. Given additional noninflationary pressures and a lot of uncertainty regarding the future path of inflation, this remains our highest priority.\nAccelerating our productivity and expense synergy efforts also remains a key priority and increasingly important in a more challenging macroeconomic environment. To this end, we were able to deliver over $30 million of operational efficiencies and deal-related synergies in the first quarter, above our expectations.\nAs a result, we expect to exceed our original $100 million full year cost reduction target, which is net of reinvestments. This higher level of productivity is helping offset lower full year volume expectations.\nAs we look to accelerate our long-term productivity opportunities, we have sharpened our focus on 3 large areas of productivity: procurement efficiencies, notably in indirect spend; end-to-end operations efficiencies inclusive of digital enablement, yield and mix enhancements and logistics efficiencies; and expanding the scale and efficiency of IFF's global shared service platform. Importantly, we will remain prudent in protecting key topline investments, including R&D, customer sales and service and technology. We plan on providing more details of these initiatives at our Q2 earnings call.\nFinally, we made further headway in accelerating our noncore divestitures. We are on track to successfully complete the sale of our Microbial Control business by July 1. We are also targeting additional portfolio optimization and noncore business divestiture opportunities to delever our balance sheet and invest greater resources toward our higher return businesses. We are making very good progress in early noncore business marketing efforts and have already received strong interest from prospective buyers. Should these transactions go through, we anticipate that they will, in aggregate, be accretive to our go-forward growth rate and margin profile.\nWith that, I'd like to pass the call back to Frank.\n\nFranklin K. Clyburn\n\nCEO & Director, International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.\n\nThanks, Glenn.\nTurning now to Slide 16. As I look back on the last 3 months, I am proud of the work underway to ensure that IFF's next chapter is it brightest yet. Our solid results, including consistent volume growth across our portfolio reflect IFF's critical role in the consumer goods value chain, particularly amidst such a challenging operating environment. While market volatility will inevitably continue to impact our industry, we will closely monitor developments, strengthen our financial discipline and fortify our portfolio to address ongoing pressures.\nWith the strong foundation we established in the first quarter, I remain confident in our ability to achieve our full year 2022 financial targets, improve value creation and further cement our key operating priorities. Having begun the process of our strategic refresh, I look forward to sharing additional updates on IFF's long-term strategic vision at an Investor Day in the second half of 2022.\nI know many of you have questions as it relates to my perspective on IFF's long-term financial targets. Given we are going through a robust review of our value creation opportunity via our strategy refresh, I ask that you give us time to appropriately assess our long-term financial objectives. I want to thank you very much for all of your support, and I know that the best is yet to come for IFF.\nWith that, I would like to now open the call for questions."

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nMichael DeVeau\n\nSenior VP and Chief IR & Communications Officer, International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Conference Call. Yesterday, we issued a press release announcing our fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results and outlook for 2022. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay.\nI ask that you please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we'll be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance and outlook based on the current state of the business. These statements contain elements of uncertainty, which we have laid out on Slide 2 under the Cautionary Statements. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors stated in our press release.\nToday's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is available on our website. Please note that we will be using combined historical results for the fourth quarter defined as 3 months of legacy IFF results and 3 months of N&B results and for the full year, defined as 12 months of legacy IFF, January to December, and 11 months of N&B, February to December in both 2020 and 2021 periods to allow comparability in light of the merger completion on February 1, 2021.\nWith me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Glenn Richter. We will begin today's call with our prepared remarks and then take any questions you have at the end.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Andreas.\n\nAndreas Fibig\n\nChairman & CEO, International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.\n\nThank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before we dive into our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2021, I think it's important to acknowledge that this has been a transformational year for IFF. We continue to make tremendous progress amid the global -- the complex global operating environment. With a world-class team and an unmatched portfolio, IFF has become a global leader in high-value ingredients and solutions for the global food, beverage, home and personal care and health and wellness markets. .\nIFF is a significantly larger, stronger and more diversified organization than when we began our transformation several years ago. The enhanced scale gains through our combination with N&B makes us an even more powerful innovator and trusted partner to our customers.\nOn a personal level, I must also reflect on what has been a tremendous and highly satisfying journey leading IFF. Together, we have taken a number of strategic actions that have transformed IFF into the category-defining leader it is today. And I'm also incredibly optimistic about IFF's future. The company's leadership team is going forward, has the right expertise to lead IFF's next chapter of growth and excellence in execution. I and the entire IFF team are pleased that Frank Clyburn will join IFF as our Chief Executive Officer, effective February 14.\nFrank brings extensive experience leading complex global businesses and overseeing large-scale integrations. He is a proven operator and will enhance the team's focus on execution to benefit our customers, teams and shareholders. It has been a privilege to lead such a talented global team, and I know that with the recent appointment of both Frank and Glenn, IFF will be in good hands.\nWe also recently announced the appointment of Barry Bruno to IFF's Board of Directors as an independent director. Barry is a welcome addition to our Board as he has significant experience leading innovative consumer brands that will benefit all of IFF stakeholders as the company executes its strategic and operating priorities. Barry joins the Board, 8 of which are new to the IFF Board within the past year when Frank begins next week. That consists of proven executive with deep experience leading global organizations, overseeing transformative merger, integrations and executing business strategies across a diverse set of industries.\nOn today's call, I will begin with providing an overview of IFF's full year 2021 performance and discussing the progress we have made so far on our integration. I will then turn the call over to Glenn, who will provide a detailed look at our fourth quarter financial results. Before we conclude today's call with a question-and-answer session, Glenn will also speak to our outlook for 2022.\nI'd like to begin on Slide 6 by reflecting on our strong performance for the full year 2021. IFF's financial results in 2021 reflect the strength and durability of our expanded portfolio and the exceptional dedication of our teams. Within the challenges of today's global operating environment, we delivered strong sales growth across our business divisions, including meaningful recoveries in the segments most affected by the pandemic.\nFor the full year 2021, IFF delivered $11.7 billion in sales, representing 10% growth or 8% on a currency-neutral basis, consisting of very strong volume growth and modest pricing contributions. Like so many companies now, persistent inflation and low supply chain challenges pressured our profitability margin. Yet, we achieved 3% growth in our combined adjusted operating EBITDA. Glenn will cover these topics in greater depth, but I want to note here that we are taking significant actions to best position the business and met the evolving macroeconomic environment, including significant pricing actions.\nIFF continues to operate with a very strong financial foundation, having delivered $1.04 billion in free cash flow or approximately 9% of our sales, driven by robust cash generation. Given our strong financial position, we continue to make significant progress towards meeting our deleveraging target, having already reduced net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA to 4.1x.\nWe also delivered meaningful synergies in connection with our integration initiatives. Importantly, we have outperformed our cost synergy targets for year 1 post close of the N&B merger and our ongoing focus on execution positions us well to further drive synergy realization and productivity improvements.\nIn 2021, we also made significant strides to optimize our portfolio, including the successful divestiture of our Food Preparations Business and the announced sale of our Microbial Control business, which we expect will be completed in the second quarter of 2022. Once our Microbial Control sale is complete, the combination of all of these 2 transactions will generate approximately $1.4 billion in gross proceeds. Growing IFF to more rapidly delever the balance sheet as we continue to progress with our integration objectives, Frank and team will explore additional opportunities to optimize our portfolio, driving greater focus on the core parts of the business and enhancing shareholder value through rapid deleveraging.\nFor IFF, 2021 was filled with exciting achievements and meaningful change that continue to propel us forward and solidify the importance of our business within the global supply chain. Our business is delivering strong growth as an indispensable partner to our customers. And while we are operating in a challenging environment, our leadership team is taking the right action to position our business for the future. We are delivering on our commitment to boldly reinvent, deliver consistent execution and transform our ability to reach and partner with more customers around the world. 2021 was a foundational year and one that I have no doubt that the company will build on as it accelerates into the future.\nNow turning to Slide 7. I would like to walk through the regional sales dynamics underpinning our results for the full year 2021. I'm pleased to share that we saw strong growth in all 4 of our key operating regions. In North America, we achieved 8% growth across nearly all segments, led by high single-digit growth in Health & Bioscience. In Asia, sales increased by 9%, led by continued double-digit growth in India and China. Nourish, Scent and Pharma Solutions all performed particularly well in Asia, with strong growth and momentum throughout 2021.\nIFF achieved 11% growth in Latin America region with double-digit growth across nearly all countries. Our Nourish division delivered strong double-digit growth, with Health & Bioscience and Scent businesses growing in the high single digits. Our EMEA region also delivered strong sales results with 9% sales growth, driven by the double-digit growth in Fine Fragrance business. EMEA was also bolstered by strength in our Nourish business which saw significant growth led by Food Service.\nMoving now to Slide 8. I would like to discuss our sales performance across IFF business segments that contributed to our overall strong growth for the year. For the full year, Nourish achieved currency-neutral sales growth of 9%, with broad-based strength in our Flavors, Ingredients and Food Design businesses. Health & Biosciences delivered 6% currency-neutral growth in 2021, primarily driven by strong performance in Home & Personal Care, Animal Nutrition and Culture & Food Enzymes.\nScent also delivered strong 8% currency-neutral growth, led by Fine Fragrance, Consumer Fragrance and ingredients. Pharma Solutions achieved 2% currency-neutral growth driven by demand in our industrial business, while we continue to see headwinds related to ongoing limited material availability and logistical constraints.\nNow on to Slide 9. I would like to focus on the underlying dynamics driving segment performance. For Nourish, consistent strong performance included double-digit growth in Ingredients. While our margins were impacted by higher costs of raw materials, EBITDA increased 8% from strong volume growth, pricing actions and a continued focus on cost management.\nIn Health & Bioscience, strong growth in Home & Personal Care, Grain Processing and Cultures & Food Enzymes were key drivers. Higher costs for raw materials and logistics remains a challenge with adjusted operating EBITDA margin of 26.8% in the segment.\nOur Scent division benefited by a particularly strong rebound from last year in Fine Fragrances, in addition to continued solid performance in Consumer Fragrances and double-digit growth in Cosmetic Actives. Adjusted operating EBITDA grew 11% as margin expanded 30 bps led by volume growth, favorable mix and higher productivity.\nAnd finally, in Pharma Solutions, we saw significant customer demand and double-digit growth in the segment's industrial business. Global supply chain issues, however, remained an overhang for 2021 margin performance.\nMoving now to Slide 10. I'm very pleased to share that our full year sales results exceeded pre-COVID levels, which is particularly encouraging for the year ahead. As previously outlined, sales growth was consistent across our business segments, reflecting the strength and resilience of our expanded portfolio and IFF's position as an essential partner for customers in critical industries around the world.\nIt is clear that IFF continues to deliver enhanced value to our customers as a result of our merger with N&B and the work we are doing to strategically integrate our businesses and focus on execution. Simply put, we are a stronger business today and our customers recognize the unique value we bring as a trusted innovation partner.\nLet's move to Slide 11. I would like to reiterate our strong progress to deliver synergies in connection with the N&B combination. In 2021, we exceeded our year 1 target of $45 million to deliver approximately $60 million in cost savings. This includes approximately $20 million in savings in the fourth quarter. Revenue synergies also were a modest contribution to top line performance with a projected pipeline continuing to develop. Execution and operating discipline remains the top priority for our leadership team, and I'm pleased to see results that reflect this commitment.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Glenn.\n\nGlenn Robert Richter\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.\n\nThank you, Andreas, and welcome, everyone. Thank you again for being with us today.\nAs Andreas highlighted, 2021 was a strong year for sales growth, including a strong fourth quarter finish. Looking more closely at our consolidated fourth quarter results, IFF generated greater than $3 billion in sales, representing a 10% year-over-year increase on a currency-neutral basis, our third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, primarily driven by double-digit growth in our Health & Biosciences division as well as high single-digit growth across our Nourish, Scent and Pharma divisions.\nAs with our full year results, our fourth quarter margin performance continued to face inflationary pressures, much like our entire industry which offset positive volume growth solid price increases and the benefits of synergies and productivity. Early in the fourth quarter, we recognized a significant escalation in inflationary pressures and as a result, we quickly mobilized to prepare to implement significant pricing actions across all businesses to protect overall profitability. I'll discuss these actions as well as our efforts to accelerate productivity and operational excellence when I discuss our 2022 outlook.\nOn the next several slides, I will briefly dive deeper into the fourth quarter financials of each of our 4 business segments. Turning to Slide 13. I'll begin with our Nourish segment, which experienced both a solid quarter and overall performance in 2021.\nIn the fourth quarter, Nourish achieved 9% year-over-year sales growth on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strong volume growth and price increases. Our Flavors business, in particular, realized strong growth with increased sales across all regions. Ingredients grew by strong double digits due to increasing customer demand and both Food, Design and Food Service also drove growth for Nourish in the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating EBITDA declined slightly due to inflationary pressures. Pressure on profitability occurred despite strong volume growth, increased productivity and strategic price increases in this segment.\nOn Slide 14, our Health & Biosciences division delivered fourth quarter year-over-year sales growth of 13% on a currency-neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Health, Microbial Control, Animal Nutrition and Grain Processing. Additionally, Cultures & Food Enzymes and Home & Personal Care each grew at a high single digits against strong year-over-year comparisons. Our adjusted operating EBITDA increased to 4% due to volume growth and higher productivity, while margins faced pressure due to inflation and higher logistics costs.\nTurning now to Slide 15. Our Scent division continued to perform well and achieved strong growth in the fourth quarter, delivering 6% year-over-year growth or 7% growth on a currency-neutral basis. This performance was supported by a continued rebound in Fine Fragrances, which saw double-digit growth driven by new wins and increased volume. Our Consumer Fragrances category delivered single-digit growth against a strong high single-digit year-ago comparison. The Ingredients business continues to contribute to the success of the overall segment, with double-digit growth in Fragrance Ingredients. Despite solid volume growth and favorable mix in the business, Scent's adjusted operating EBITDA growth was affected by higher cost of raw materials, which we continue to take action to mitigate.\nOn Slide 16, our Pharma Solutions segment delivered year-over-year currency-neutral sales growth of 9% from 2020 as a result of volume strength and price increases. Both our core Pharma and Industrials categories contribute to our strong performance in the quarter. For Pharma Solutions, adjusted operating EBITDA and margin was also impacted by higher raw material and energy costs. We recognize the challenges this segment is experiencing due to the current market environment and macro supply chain constraints and are optimistic that as a global situation recovers, we will recognize the full potential of Pharma Solutions.\nNow on Slide 17, I would like to review our cash flow position from progress in deleveraging. For the full year 2021, we delivered strong cash flow of over $1 billion and are on track to meet our deleveraging goals. 2021 CapEx was $393 million or approximately 3.4% of sales as we made strategic investments in the most attractive segments of our portfolio. Overall, our capital expenditures were lower than originally planned, in part due to slower implementation of projects due to some vendor delays and a continuation of the COVID environment.\nWe also paid out $667 million in dividends to our shareholders in 2021. From a leverage perspective, we continue to make substantial progress towards achieving our deleveraging target, finishing 2021 with 4.1% net debt-to-credit adjusted EBITDA ratio. IFF reduced gross debt by $124 million to $11.4 billion versus Q3, and we finished 2021 with cash and cash equivalents of $716 million. We remain confident that IFF is on track to achieve our deleveraging target of 3x net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA by year 3 post close, further supported by additional divestitures that I will touch on in a moment.\nTurning to Slide 18, I'd like to provide commentary on our business outlook for 2022. For fiscal year 2022, we expect revenue between $12.3 billion and $12.7 billion, with adjusted operating EBITDA in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. We also are forecasting foreign exchange rates will be a headwind in 2022, approximately 2 percentage point headwind to our revenue and a 4 percentage point headwind to adjusted operating EBITDA in '22.\nAs you are all well aware, we continue to operate in a complex market environment with ongoing uncertainties from pandemic, global political tensions and supply chain challenges. IFF and our industry at large have been impacted by these issues, and we expect and have planned for that these challenges will remain into 2022. As I shared on our third quarter call, we expect inflationary pressures to be significant in 2022 as we see large cost increases in raw materials, energy and logistics. As a result, we are taking significant pricing actions to fully offset our dollar cost exposure, which we expect will result in strong sales and profit growth but will depress margin.\nLonger term, we remain confident in our ability to recover margins to pre-inflation levels as we are focused on improving returns to generate strong value creation for our shareholders. We also remain intently focused on driving cost reductions through synergies and increased productivity efforts throughout our business. In addition, we are increasing CapEx in 2022 to approximately 5% of sales as a result of '21 CapEx carryover and increased investments in capacity expansion in key technologies, which will help support growth while also lowering logistics costs. Finally, we will also be increasing inventory by approximately $300 million to more appropriate levels to ensure we can continue to serve our customers well.\nNow moving to Slide 19, I would like to focus more specifically on the cost inflation trends that we saw in '21 and now forecast to see in '22. Heading into 2022, we expect certain costs, including raw materials, energy and logistics, will continue to rise much as they did in '21. Overall, we expect '22 cost increases to be double digits, call it approximately 10%. We are seeing most of these increases related to inflation in raw materials with double-digit increases in (inaudible), oils, cellulose, pulp, turpentine, aroma chemicals, petrochemicals, fragrance specialty chemicals, savory ingredients, specialty chemicals, agriculture, grains and sweeteners.\nThe inflationary pressures manifest themselves differently between the legacy N&B and IFF businesses. Most of the higher energy and logistics cost in '22 are related to legacy N&B. With added capacity coming online later this year, we hope to start to mitigate some of the logistics headwinds we have been facing due to an imbalance in supply and demand. If you look at legacy IFF portfolio, we are seeing high single-digit raw material inflation, similar to our flavor and fragrance peers. Recognizing these challenges, we have been aggressively pursuing broad-based pricing actions and accelerating synergy and productivity efforts.\nTurning to Slide 20. I will provide a bit more insight into our sales guidance for 2022. Our $12.3 billion to $12.7 billion sales expectation represents continued momentum on top of our strong 2021 results. To get a more comparable revenue basis, you must add back approximately $500 million of sales related to N&B in January of 2021 as N&B results were not part of IFF until February 1, 2021.\nOur sales guidance also accounts for the removal of June to December '21 revenue results following the anticipated completed sale of our Microbial Control business as well as the first 9 months of '21 sales for the Fruit Prep divestiture which we closed in October of last year. That gets you to our comparable '21 revenue base of $11.85 billion as indicated on the slide.\nAs I said earlier, we are significantly increasing our prices in order to fully offset the dollar cost exposure of our inflation for 2022. With that in mind, we anticipate pricing to be significantly larger contributor to the top line in '22. This pricing impact, plus more months volume growth following a strong '21, will be central to our overall sales performance in '22 where we expect to grow approximately 6% to 9% year-over-year on a comparable currency-neutral basis.\nNow in terms of our guidance on the adjusted operating EBITDA front, we also had to make adjustments for comparability. If you add back EBITDA related to N&B January results and subtract the EBITDA related to 7 months of EBITDA as a result of the anticipated divestiture of our Microbial Control business as well as the EBITDA related to the Fruit Prep business for the first 9 months of '21, you get to a comparable '21 base of approximately $2.5 billion.\nAs mentioned, implementing broad-based pricing actions to offset inflationary pressures is critical to our '22 plan. Over the last 3-plus months, each of our business has executed pricing actions across essentially our entire customer base. As a result, we anticipate to completely offset projected '22 inflationary pressures with pricing actions.\nThe majority of these actions will be implemented in the first and second quarter. I would also note that we anticipate that 2023 will benefit from an additional $200 million of net pricing benefit due to the full annualization of our pricing actions, which will be equal to 100% capture of the combined 2021 and 2022 inflation impact on our business. Importantly, we also continue to closely monitor the global supply chain environment and we'll be prepared to execute additional price actions as appropriate.\nBy adding anticipated volume leverage plus synergies and productivity, we expect comparable EBITDA growth in '22 to be strong, up approximately 4% to 8%. It should be noted that the synergy and productivity contribution here is a net number, working with combination of the benefits of synergy and productivity net of cost of living increases and reinvestments in the business. Our guidance implies that our adjusted operating EBITDA margin will be down modestly versus '21, principally due to our net dollar cost recovery which equates to approximately 100 basis points.\nOver the course of '21 and '22, we will see more than $1 billion of total inflation. And while we are working rapidly to cover via price increases, it has impacted margins significantly. To give you a perspective of the magnitude, our margins for full year '22 on an inflation-adjusted basis, will be approximately 300 basis points higher or approximately 23.5%.\nIn terms of margin cadence throughout '22, we expect the first half to be down year-over-year, with expansion coming in the second half. While sales are expected to be strong in the first quarter, year-over-year adjusted operating EBITDA margin performance will be the most challenged of the year, down over 300 basis points versus our reported first quarter 2021 margin, with each quarter after that including. Much of this will be driven by price to total inflation, where we expect to turn positive starting the third quarter.\nAs I conclude, I want to highlight our 4 key areas of focus for '22 and provide further color into our detailed execution plans for each. First, we are committed to building on our strong '21 sales momentum. Our 6% to 9% targeted '22 currency-neutral sales growth anticipates that we will continue to maintain volume growth consistent with overall industry growth rates. We believe that our exceptional R&D pipeline and scaled global commercial teams, including targeted '22 investments, will allow us to continue to deliver superior customer solutions and support strong growth.\nIn addition, as I mentioned previously, we are making substantial investments to increase capacity across constrained portions of our portfolio and enhancing supply chain efficiencies. Lastly, we will be sharpening our focus on our revenue synergy opportunities as we are behind our original planned pace, as much of last year was focused on addressing near-term supply chain issues. That said, we are confident that the breadth and depth of our platform will allow us to build meaningful revenue synergies over time.\nSecond, as previously outlined, we are intently focused on broad-based pricing actions to offset inflation. And importantly, as the macro environment evolves, we are prepared to quickly execute additional pricing actions throughout the year as needed. To enhance our ability to react more quickly to the dynamic environment, over the last several months, we have undertaken a comprehensive end-to-end review of our procurement processes, implemented new pricing tools and established core pricing teams for each one of our businesses. Our focus has been to compress the time between inflation signals and customer pricing actions, ensuring we optimize product segment and customer-specific pricing actions and closely monitor the level and pace of pricing utilization. Going forward, we are focused on further enhancing our procurement processes and pricing programs.\nThird, we are determined to accelerate our synergy realization and more broadly, our productivity efforts in 2022. For your reference, included in our '22 guidance, we are targeting approximately $200 million of cost reductions from synergies, yield enhancements and reformulations, logistics efficiencies and other operational improvements. Net of wage inflationary pressures and targeted investments to help drive top line growth, we are targeting net cost efficiencies of approximately $100 million for the year.\nWhile we feel this is good progress, we also recognize that there is more work to do. Consequently, in addition to the end-to-end review of procurement, we are undertaking a comprehensive review of our global manufacturing and logistics platform, constructing and plan to accelerate the scope and scale of our global shared service capabilities, and developing a detailed technology and digital integrated road map, all with the goal of driving meaningful efficiencies while also ensuring we provide superior customer solutions and service.\nFourth, we are actively working to accelerate our noncore divestitures. As we have discussed, we are on track to successfully complete the sale of our Microbial Control business, which will enhance the efficiency and profitability of our portfolio. We are also targeting additional portfolio optimization to further delever our balance sheet and focus on core growth opportunities.\nOver the coming quarters, we will proceed with marketing a handful of nonstrategic businesses, call it 3 or 4, where we believe that over the next 18 months, we can generate expected proceeds of approximately $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. Similar to our Fruit Prep and Microbial Control businesses, these are nonstrategic and the transactions will be accretive to our go-forward growth rate and margin profile. With this action plan, together with our current sales momentum and strength in our leading portfolio, I am confident that it will deliver strong results in 2022.\nWith that, I would like to turn the call back to Andreas.\n\nAndreas Fibig\n\nChairman & CEO, International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.\n\nThank you, Glenn.\nI thought transformation has been deeply personal to me, and I know that this company is stronger today than it has ever been. I'm proud of a solid year we had in 2021 with significant year-over-year sales and profit growth as well as steady progress towards our integration with N&B. So all my time at IFF, I've been consistently impressed by the thousands of employees who have dedicated their time and talent to make our company the category-defining leader it is today.\nI want to thank them for their contributions over this year at the time I have led the company and also for their passion about IFF and the commitment to our customers. The path ahead for the company and its new leadership team is clear. I'm confident that IFF enters its next chapter with the right team, a best-in-class portfolio, innovative spirit, significant financial flexibility and a unified sense of purpose to drive long-term growth and benefit our shareholders, employees, customers and communities.\nWith that, I would now like to open the call for questions. Thank you."

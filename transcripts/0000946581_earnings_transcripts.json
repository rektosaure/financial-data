Zelnick\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nicole. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. We delivered fantastic second quarter results, including net bookings of $1.96 billion, which vastly exceeded our expectations and represent the best second quarter of net bookings in our company's history. We have many achievements during the period. 2K launched 3 major titles, including NBA 2K26, which set multiple records and has been delivering an unprecedented level of in-game spending. Our mobile business outperformed substantially driven by our teams unparalleled innovation and live services and Grand theft Auto online continued to benefit from its highly engaged community. .\nDue to these outstanding second quarter results and our optimism for the balance of the fiscal year, we're again raising our net bookings outlook for fiscal 2026 to $6.4 billion to $6.5 billion. Rockstar Games has announced that Grand Theft Auto V will now be released on November 19, 2026, giving the team some additional time to finish the game with a high level of polish players expect and deserve.\nRockstar has our full support, of course, and we're confident they'll deliver an unrivaled blockbuster entertainment experience. Turning to highlights from the period. Our mobile business delivered another quarter of excellent results. Peaks Forever franchise Toone Blast, grew 26% year-over-year and approximately 90% over the past 2 years, driven by new gameplay elements and meta-game features such as card collection.\nMatch Factory!, another hit title from Peak, achieved record net bookings and grew 20% over last year. Players responded positively to innovative new features, including the Super Bowl Power Up which increased engagement and monetization within the game. Rollic's hit title, Color Block Jam continues to engage and grow its audience with new features and levels and remains the highest grossing title in the studio's history. In addition, Rollic surpassed 3.8 billion lifetime downloads and achieved a new net bookings record for the quarter.\nThe CSR franchise achieved $1 billion in lifetime in-game spending with more than 180 million players worldwide since its launch in 2012, which we believe indicates great momentum ahead of the release of CSR 3. Zynga Poker launched on Steam with full cross-functionality enabling players to enjoy the game freely across mobile, web browsers and PC. 2K's mobile offerings had another strong quarter with WWE SuperCard surpassing 38 million lifetime downloads. NBA 2K Mobile continued to grow its audience and the 2K26 Arcade edition holding its top 5 position on the Apple Arcade charts and NBA 2K All-Star in China, capturing 8 million registered users after just 6 months in market.\nWe continue to focus on our mobile direct-to-consumer business and are achieving higher conversion driven by new offers, events and enhanced personalization. Also as a result of recent legislative changes, our teams have rolled out new technologies that enable direct transactions and new payment mechanisms, including solutions designed to support international growth, which should help us expand meaningfully net bookings and margins via this highly accretive channel.\nWith the record-breaking launch of NBA 2K26, 2K and Visual Concepts proved once again their ability to create phenomenal gameplay, innovate with new features and optimize live service offerings. To date, the title is sold in over 5 million units, representing a double-digit increase over NBA 2K25 and with average selling prices reaching an all-time high, led by higher sales on premium additions. We were pleased to see daily active users and MyCAREER daily active users grow nearly 30% and nearly 40%, respectively, which contributed to recurrent consumer spending growth of 45%.\nPlayers love many of the game's new features, including a thriving hub of competition, a more accessible layout, all new rewards and fresh cosmetics. I'd like to congratulate 2K and Visual Concepts for once again delivering a superb basketball experience led by innovation and an unwavering commitment to excellence.\n2K and Gearbox Software lunch Borderlands 4, the latest offering in our beloved looter shooter franchise. The game received high critical praise, with many reviewers calling it the best Borderlands yet. The series highly active community eagerly welcomed the title. And during its opening weekend, it reached the largest concurrent player count on Steam in franchise history. Borderlands 4 also dominated YouTube with 300 million views and are in the #1 spot on Twitch during its launch, underscoring the franchises enduring mass appeal.\nWhile we experienced some challenges with optimization and performance on PC, Gearbox has been addressing these issues and releasing updates to improve gameplay. We're confident that Borderlands 4 will achieve strong unit sales over its lifetime. We're immensely proud of Gearbox and look forward to robust post-launch content offerings that will support the game in the months ahead.\n2K and Hangar 13 released Mafia: The Old Country, the first new entry in our popular organized crime franchise in nearly a decade, which earned the vast praise from critics and consumers alike. The title quickly surpassed our internal expectations and affirmed our belief that consumer demand remains strong for premium narrative-driven experiences that overindex on value. The team at Hangar 13 will continue to push the boundaries for cinematic experiences in this series and in future creative pursuits.\nGrand Theft Auto V continues to grow its audience. And to date, the title has sold in more than 220 million units worldwide. Players remain deeply engaged with Grand Theft Auto Online, which added holiday theme jobs and rewards as well as new vehicles, community events and outfits. GTA+ continued to increase its membership achieving over 20% growth year-over-year. We're pleased with the consumers' ongoing passion and engagement with the franchise, which we believe will help usher in a record-breaking launch for Grand Theft Auto V.\nIn closing, we're very pleased with our position as one of the largest, most diversified companies within the interactive entertainment industry, a sector that we believe will enjoy robust growth. As we embrace our core values and focus on delivering the most captivating and engaging entertainment experiences, we expect to achieve record levels of net bookings in fiscal 2027, establish a new baseline for our business, and enhance our profitability. I'll now turn the call over to Karl.\n\nKarl Slatoff\n\nPresident, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Strauss. I'd like to thank our teams for delivering another terrific quarter, which reflects our unique ability to consistently deliver the highest quality entertainment experiences. Our teams plan to sustain this momentum over the balance of the year by releasing an array of new content and product offerings. Following the successful launches of Mafia: The Old Country, NBA 2K26 and Borderlands 4, 2K plans to release new content and updates for each game that will provide our fans with even greater opportunities to engage with these franchises.\nZynga will continue to enhance its portfolio with the introduction of new features and innovation in live services, while also pursuing new titles. During the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, 2K and Visual Concepts will launch WWE 2K26, the next installment in our popular wrestling franchise. Since taking over the series, Visual Concepts has immersed players in the most intense and realistic action that the Squared circle Can hold.\nAnd WWE 2K26 will continue this legacy. 2K will have more to share about the game shortly. Looking ahead, we believe strongly in our long-term pipeline, which includes the release of Grand Theft Auto V on November 19, 2026 as well as the future launches of Judas, Project ETHOS, CSR 3, [indiscernible], the next BioShock and many other exciting new titles from across our labels.\nIn closing, we are thrilled with our performance for the first half of fiscal 2026. As we continue to execute our proven strategy and capitalize on emerging opportunities, we expect to achieve a period of meaningful long-term growth and shareholder returns. I'll now turn the call over to Lainie. .\n\nLainie Goldstein\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Our second quarter results were truly fantastic. We are excited to raise our annual net bookings outlook for the second consecutive quarter. Our outperformance was driven by many of our key titles, which underscores the strength of our core franchises and the power of our diverse portfolio of owned intellectual property. .\nI'd like to thank our teams for their outstanding execution and unwavering focus on creativity, innovation and efficiency. Turning to our results. We delivered second quarter net bookings of $1.96 billion, which was significantly above our guidance range of $1.7 billion to $1.75 billion. This reflected better-than-expected performance from NBA 2K, Mafia: The Old Country and several mobile titles, including Toon Blast, Color Block Jam, Match Factory! and Empires & Puzzles, which more than offset softness in the initial launch of Borderlands 4.\nRecurrent consumer spending rose 20% for the period, which outperformed our guidance of 1% growth and accounted for 73% of net bookings. NBA 2K grew 45%. Mobile increased mid-teens and Grand Theft Auto Online declined as expected. During the quarter, we launched Mafia: The Old Country, NBA 2K26 and Borderlands 4. GAAP net revenue increased 31% to $1.77 billion, cost of revenue increased 27% to $793 million, and operating expenses increased 5% to $1.1 billion.\nOn a management basis, operating expenses rose 13% year-over-year, which represented significant operating expense leverage on our strong top line growth. Operating expense dollars were above our forecast due to incremental user acquisition investments to support robust performance in our mobile portfolio and higher performance-based compensation, which was partly offset by a shift in some console marketing and IT expenses into the second half of the year.\nTurning to our guidance. I'll begin with our full fiscal year expectations. Our momentum is strong, and we are raising our net bookings outlook range to $6.4 billion to $6.5 billion, which represents 14% growth over fiscal 2025 and at the midpoint. The increase reflects our second quarter outperformance and higher expectations for many of our core franchises for the second half of the year.\nThe largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, the Grand Theft Auto series, Toon Blast, Match Factory!, Borderlands 4, Color Block Jam, Empires & Puzzles, the Red Dead Redemption series and Words with Friends. We now expect recurrent consumer spending to grow approximately 11%, representing 77% of net bookings. This growth percentage is more than double our prior forecast of 4%, driven by NBA 2K and higher expectations for several mobile titles. Our revised recurrent consumer spending forecast assumes that NBA 2K now grows in the mid-20% range.\nMobile increases approximately 10% and and Grand Theft Auto Online declines, which is unchanged from our prior forecast. We project the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 46% Zynga, 39% 2K and 15% Rockstar Games. We are raising our operating cash flow forecast to approximately $250 million, reflecting the strength in our business. We now expect to deploy approximately $180 million in capital expenditures which is above our prior guidance due to the acquisition of an office building to support our global footprint. We're also increasing our forecast for GAAP net revenue, which is now expected to range from $6.38 billion to $6.48 billion and the cost of revenue, which is now expected to range from $2.66 billion to $2.69 billion.\nOur total operating expenses are expected to range from $3.98 billion to $4 billion compared to $7.45 billion last year. On a management basis, we now expect operating expense growth of approximately 9% year-over-year, which represents notable operating expense leverage on our higher net bookings outlook. Our forecast for operating expense dollars is increasing due to incremental marketing to support our mobile portfolio and higher performance-based compensation.\nNow moving on to our guidance for the fiscal third quarter. We project net bookings to range from $1.55 billion to $1.6 billion compared to $1.37 billion in the prior year. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, the Grand Theft Auto series, Toon Blast, Match Factory!, the Red Dead Redemption Series, Color Block Jam, Empires & Puzzles, Borderlands 4 and Words with Friends. We project recurrent consumer spending to increase by approximately 8%, which assumes low double-digit growth in mobile, a mid-single-digit increase for NBA 2K and a decline for Grand Theft Auto Online.\nWe expect GAAP net revenue to range from $1.57 billion to $1.62 billion. Operating expenses are planned to range from $980 million to $990 million. On a management basis, operating expenses are expected to grow by approximately 12% year-over-year, which is primarily driven by incremental user acquisition investments to support our robust performance in our mobile portfolio and higher performance-based compensation.\nIn closing, we are thrilled with the strength in our business today, and we are extremely optimistic about the future ahead. As we execute on our strategic priorities, which include expanding our core franchises to even greater levels of commercial success, releasing groundbreaking new heads, driving efficiencies and capitalizing on new business opportunities we believe that we will meaningfully grow our scale and our profitability. I'd like to thank you all for your support and look forward to sharing more details on our exciting pipeline in the coming months. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss.\n\nStrauss H. Zelnick\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for continuing to deliver outstanding results for Take-Two. To our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator? ."

Zelnick\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nicole. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Fiscal 2026 is off to an excellent start, reflecting ongoing demand for our core franchises and the increasingly diversified successful nature of our business. Net bookings for the first quarter exceeded $1.4 billion, which was meaningfully above the high end of our expectations, led by the outperformance of several Mobile titles as well as the continued success of NBA 2K and the Grand Theft Auto series. We're optimistic about the year ahead, and we're raising our net bookings outlook for fiscal 2026 to $6.05 billion to $6.15 billion.\nWe have great confidence in our long-term pipeline and expect to achieve record levels of net bookings in fiscal '27 that we believe will establish a higher baseline for our business and set us on a path enhanced profitability. I'd like to express my gratitude to all of our teams across our worldwide organization for their deep passion and intense commitment to our collective vision. We strive daily to do our best work and to exemplify our core pillars of creativity, innovation and efficiency, all in service of our goal to make the biggest and best hits in the entertainment business.\nTurning to highlights from the period. Our Mobile business vastly exceeded expectations. Peak's successful forever franchise, Toon Blast, grew 22% over last year and nearly 75% on a 2-year basis, driven by the Seasonal Collection feature that provided a new avenue of engagement for the game's millions of active players. Match Factory!, another hit title from Peak, achieved record net bookings as the title grew 33% over last year. Players experienced new features such as the Treasure Cave event as well as new levels.\nRollic's newest hit, Color Block Jam, maintained its positive momentum and has become the highest grossing title in the studio's history. Throughout the quarter, Color Block Jam remained at the top of the app charts, demonstrating its strong market position and mass appeal. Rollic supported the title with its first bold beat, [ Pilot Stop ], where players receive progressively larger rewards with each consecutive win, amplifying engagement and monetization.\n2K's mobile offerings also had a great quarter, including WWE SuperCard, which remains the label's most successful mobile game with over 37 million lifetime downloads. NBA 2K Mobile has been steadily growing its audience with new content and challenges, while NBA 2K25 Arcade Edition continues to top the Apple Arcade charts, and NBA 2K All-Star in China has been posting strong and profitable results since its launch in March.\nWe continue to focus on our mobile direct-to-consumer business, and we're achieving better conversion driven by new offers, events and enhanced personalization. In the context of recent court rulings, we see ample runway for further growth in this area. The Grand Theft Auto series once again exceeded our expectations. Momentum remains exceptionally strong, and to date, Grand Theft Auto V has sold over 215 million units worldwide. During the quarter, engagement for Grand Theft Auto Online benefited from the record setting launch of Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer Two and the successful release of the [ Money Front ] Summer Content Pack, which culminated in higher-than-expected recurrent consumer spending growth. We're pleased that new player accounts for GTA Online grew over 50% year-over-year.\nNBA 2K25 delivered another quarter of fantastic results. To date, the title has sold over 11.5 million units, and engagement grew significantly year-over-year, with daily active users and MyCareer daily active users each up 30%, which helped drive 48% growth in recurrent consumer spending. We're thrilled that 2K announced a new multiyear global partnership expansion with the NBA, NBA PA and WNBA PA and extended its long-standing relationship with the NBA G League and USA Basketball. We're excited to continue our highly successful partnerships and look forward to building upon the record-setting achievements that we've accomplished together.\nEngagement with our other sports titles has been healthy, including WWE 2K25. The title launched on Nintendo Switch 2 in July, which expanded its audience and featured same game modes that are available to players on PS5 and Xbox Series X and S.\nFiraxis Games continues to introduce monthly updates for Sid Meier's Civilization VII. In addition, the studio released the title for Nintendo Switch 2, our first offering for the platform, featuring new mouse controls that offer a more intuitive gameplay experience. We're very pleased to continue supporting Nintendo with additional titles launching throughout the year.\nIn closing, we're thrilled with our company's positive momentum and have enormous anticipation for this quarter's launches of Mafia: The Old Country, NBA 2K26 and Borderlands 4. We remain deeply committed to excellence, to delivering the highest quality entertainment experiences for all of our audiences and to driving meaningful returns for our shareholders.\nI'll now turn the call over to Karl.\n\nKarl Slatoff\n\nPresident, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Strauss. I'd like to thank our teams for delivering a fantastic start to the year and for setting the stage for what promises to be an exciting chapter in our history. I'll now discuss our upcoming releases. Tomorrow, 2K and Hangar 13 will once again immerse players in the detailed, rich and storied world of organized crime with Mafia: The Old Country. With more than 2.5 million wishlists across all platforms, community sentiment for this linear, narrative-driven action game is very strong. 2K unveiled a new story trailer during the Annual Summer Game Fest show and provided the press with early play time, which resulted in glowing impressions and previews. We are very excited to expand our beloved franchise and help the players feel the passion and pride that our team brought to this exciting release.\nOn September 5, 2K and Visual Concepts will release NBA 2K26, which promises to once again raise the bar for our top-selling basketball experience. The title will be available on Early Access on August 29 and will be the first game from our series to launch on Nintendo Switch 2, offering the complete Gen 9 experience for the platform. With all new Pro Play features, players on Gen 9 will experience our immersive technology like never before, including revamped size ups and fast-paced dynamic movements. Fans can build a transcendent MyPlayer as they strive to reach the pinnacle of NBA stardom and a reimagined MyCareer journey and team up with friends to battle rival squads in a fresh and more optimized city.\nNBA 2K26's MyTeam will put past and present legends to test in new single and multiplayer modes while also offering 30 unique storylines to win a championship. More details on NBA2K26 will be shared in the coming weeks.\nOn September 12, 2K and Gearbox Software will launch Borderlands 4, the eagerly anticipated next entry in our iconic looter-shooter franchise. Recently, global press and content creators played the game for the first time, and response was extremely positive, with some calling it the best in the series. In June, our team hosted the first ever Borderlands Fan Fest, where attendees played a demo of Borderlands 4 and generated over 600,000 hours of streams and videos. With the title launching on Nintendo Switch 2 in October, we are excited to harness the power of the new console and allow players to enjoy our mayhem fueled looter shooter at home or on the go.\nLater this fiscal year, 2K and Visual Concepts will once again challenge players to step into the squared circle with WWE 2K26, the forthcoming installment in our popular wrestling franchise that continues to set new standards for excellence with each release. 2K will have more to share about this game in the coming months. This is one of the strongest lineups of 2K's history, positioning us to deliver best-in-class game play for our players and outstanding financial results.\nZynga will remain focused on continuing to enhance its existing portfolio and releasing new Mobile titles. In closing, we are deeply excited about this year's release slate and our ability to deliver entertainment experiences that captivate and engage audiences throughout the world. As we continue to execute our proven strategy and capitalize on emerging markets and opportunities, we believe that we will achieve a period of meaningful long-term growth and shareholder returns.\nI'll now turn the call over to Lainie.\n\nLainie Goldstein\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. We achieved outstanding first quarter results, driven by our strong franchises, talented teams and unwavering commitment to our strategic vision. Our performance was broad-based across our labels, as we engage players with exciting new game features and content updates while also advancing development of our highly anticipated pipeline. I'd like to thank our incredible teams worldwide for their hard work and passion for our business.\nTurning to our results. We delivered first quarter net bookings of $1.42 billion, which was significantly above our guidance range of $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion. This reflected better-than-expected performance from several Mobile titles, including Toon Blast, Match Factory!, NBA 2K All-Star and Color Block Jam, as well as NBA 2K and the Grand Theft Auto series.\nRecurrent consumer spending grew 17% for the period, which was meaningfully above our guidance of 7% growth and accounted for 83% of net bookings. Several of our businesses outperformed, including NBA 2K, which is up nearly 50%, Mobile, which grew low teens, and Grand Theft Auto Online, which increased low single digits.\nDuring the quarter, we released Civilization VII for Meta Quest VR and Nintendo Switch 2. GAAP net revenue increased 12% to $1.5 billion, while cost of revenue declined 1% to $559 million and operating expenses decreased 3% to $923 million. On a management basis, operating expenses rose 3% year-over-year, which was slightly above our forecast of 2% growth, primarily due to higher personnel costs. Total marketing expenses were within our forecast range for the quarter. Zynga made incremental user acquisition investments to support its robust performance, which was offset by 2K shifting some marketing out of Q1 into later this fiscal year.\nTurning to our guidance. I'll begin with our full fiscal year expectations. We are raising our net bookings outlook range to $6.05 billion to $6.15 billion, which represents 8% growth over fiscal 2025 at the midpoint. The increase predominantly reflects our strong first quarter performance and to a lesser degree, updates to our forecast, including FX. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, the Grand Theft Auto series, Toon Blast, Borderlands 4, Match Factory!, the Red Dead Redemption series, Color Block Jam, Empires & Puzzles and Words With Friends. We now expect recurrent consumer spending to grow approximately 4%, which is revised upward from our prior forecast of flat, representing 76% of net bookings.\nWe expect NBA 2K to grow mid-teens, Mobile to grow low single digits and Grand Theft Online to decline. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our label to be roughly 45% Zynga, 39% 2K and 16% Rockstar Games.\nWe continue to expect operating cash flow of approximately $130 million and capital expenditures of approximately $140 million. We now expect GAAP net revenue to range from $6.1 billion to $6.2 billion and cost of revenue to range from $2.55 billion to $2.57 billion. Our total operating expenses are now expected to range from $3.84 billion to $3.86 billion compared to $7.45 billion last year. On a management basis, we expect operating expense growth of approximately 5% year-over-year. This is up slightly from our prior forecast due to higher personnel costs as well as increased marketing spend to support our Mobile portfolio and [ netbacks ]. I'd like to point out that our earnings per share calculations reflect our higher share count following our recent equity issuance.\nNow moving on to our guidance for the fiscal second quarter. We project net bookings to range from $1.7 billion to $1.75 billion compared to $1.47 billion in the second quarter last year. Our release slate for the quarter includes Mafia: The Old Country and NBA 2K26 and Borderlands 4. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Borderlands 4, the Grand Theft Auto series, Toon Blast, Match Factory, Empires & Puzzles, Color Block Jam, the Red Dead Redemption series, Words With Friends and Mafia: The Old Country.\nWe project recurrent consumer spending to increase by approximately 1%, which assumes a low single-digit increase for NBA 2K, slight growth for Mobile and a decline for Grand Theft Auto Online. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $1.65 billion to $1.7 billion.\nOperating expenses are planned to range from $1.02 billion to $1.03 billion. On a management basis, operating expenses are expected to grow by approximately 7% year-over-year, which is primarily driven by marketing to support our strong release slate during the period.\nLooking ahead, our confidence in our outlook is exceptionally strong. Our company is set to deliver the most ambitious pipeline in our history, which we believe will unlock a new record level of scale as well as enhanced profitability. As we release exciting new hits and explore additional growth opportunities, both organic and inorganic, we expect to achieve meaningful returns for our shareholders.\nThank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss.\n\nStrauss H. Zelnick\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for delivering a stellar start to what is poised to be an outstanding year for Take-Two. To our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support.\nWe'll now take your questions. Operator?"

We concluded our 2025 fiscal year with outstanding results, including fourth quarter net bookings of $1.58 billion, which was the top of our guidance range. Each of our labels contributed meaningfully to our performance. 2K posted a fantastic quarter, the successful launches of Sid Meier's Civilization VII, WWE 2K25 and PGA TOUR 2K25. NBA 2K delivered one of its strongest periods on record, including recurrent consumer spending growth of 42%. Rockstar Games excelled once again, with the Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption series surpassing our forecast, and Zynga continued to gain momentum, led by Match Factory!, Toon Blast and Rollic's newest hit Color Block Jam.\nWe're providing our initial financial outlook for fiscal 2026, including net bookings of $5.9 billion to $6 billion, which represents 5% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. This outlook assumes a continuation of our current positive trends, including healthy mobile performance and ongoing strength in NBA 2K as well as the release of several eagerly anticipated titles, including Mafia: The Old Country, and Borderlands 4. Rockstar expects to release Grand Theft Auto VI on May 26, 2026, which is in our fiscal year 2027. I believe affording Rockstar additional time for such a groundbreaking project is a worthy investment. Grand Theft Auto VI began development in earnest in 2020 following the massive success of Red Dead Redemption 2 and the title is now the most anticipated entertainment property of all time.\nConsumer anticipation is unprecedented with [ Trailer 2's ] Cross-Platform debut last week, shattering records to become the biggest video launch of all time with over 475 million views in 24 hours.

Spotify streams of the track featured in the trailer Hot together by The Pointer Sisters surged by 182,000%, once again, proving Rockstar's ability to influence popular culture. The ambition and complexity of Grand Theft Auto VI is greater than any previous Rockstar title and the team is poised to release another astonishing entertainment experience that will exceed players' expectations.\nNow I'll share more specific highlights from the quarter. NBA 2K25 posted near-record performance and exceeded our forecast. To date, the title has sold in nearly 10 million units, a 7% increase compared to NBA 2K24 during the same time frame. Engagement grew significantly, daily active users, MyCAREER daily players and average games per user increasing 30%, 40% and 80%, respectively.

And to date, GTA V has sold in over 215 million units for current consumer spending outperform our forecast growing 5% year-over-year, led by an array of new modes, rewards and vehicles for GTA Online as well as ongoing demand for GTA+ memberships.

Red Dead Redemption 2 also outperformed, with net bookings growing 23% over last year.

Net bookings grew meaningfully over the last quarter and the title is generating profits. Net [indiscernible] for Toon Blast grew 7% over last year, primarily due to the introduction of the Canon Fest event. We're also thrilled, title achieved its largest quarter of net bookings since Zynga acquired Peak in 2020.\nRollic's newest hit Color Block Jam is scaling rapidly and is currently a top 10 downloaded game and among the top grossing titles in the U.S. Apple app store.

Our direct-to-consumer business delivered record performance as our teams continue to launch new offers events and enhanced personalization, which are driving better conversion. While we've been implementing D2C in our titles for some time, we do believe there's an even greater opportunity to extend this highly accretive channel given recent beneficial court rulings.\nAs we approach the 3-year anniversary of our acquisition of Zynga, we're extremely pleased that the label has become an integral part of our company. Zynga's core franchises are strong and we're energized by the team's unique ability to launch [indiscernible] in a highly competitive mobile market, demonstrating further the effectiveness of their multi-studio approach and continued excellence in live ops.\nIn closing, with a player-first approach and a deep commitment to quality, we strive to create the best entertainment experiences for our global communities and to redefine our art form.

Through these actions, we are setting our business up for a strong multiyear period of growth and enhanced profitability, and I'd like to thank our teams for their passion and dedication.\nTurning to our results. We delivered fourth quarter net booking of $1.58 billion, which was the top of our guidance range of $1.48 billion, $1.58 billion. This reflected better-than-expected performance from NBA 2K25, Zynga [indiscernible] Toon Blast, our hypercasual mobile portfolio and Match Factory!, the Red Dead Redemption series and Grand Theft Auto Online. Recurrent consumer spending growth was phenomenal, increasing 14% over last year and accounted for 77% of net bookings. NBA 2K grew over 40% of Grand Theft Auto Online and mobile both increased mid-single digits. All of these businesses greatly exceeded our forecast.\nDuring the quarter, we launched Sid Meier's Civilization VII, PGA TOUR 2K25 and WWE 2K25. GAAP net revenue increased 13% to $1.58 billion. Cost of revenue declined 16% to $779 million primarily due to lower impairment of acquired intangibles in the current year as well as timing of development credits. Operating expenses increased by 44% to $4.6 billion due to an impairment expense of $3.6 billion related to goodwill and acquired intangible assets.\nOn a management basis, operating expenses rose 3% year-over-year which was above our guidance due to higher development costs for titles not technologically feasible. For fiscal 2025, we achieved net bookings of $5.65 billion, which was also the top of our guidance range of $5.55 billion to $5.65 billion. Recurrent consumer spending exceeded our outlook, growing 7% and accounted for 80% of net bookings. NBA 2K grew high teens, mobile increased mid-single digits and Grand Theft Auto Online declined modestly. Operating cash flow was an outflow of $45 million compared to our forecast of an outflow of $200 million due to timing of tax payments and lower development costs. We spent approximately $169 million in capital expenditures which was above our forecast of $140 million, primarily due to higher game technology expenses. GAAP net revenue rose 5% to [ $5.63 ] billion, while cost of revenue decreased 17% to $2.6 billion, primarily due to lower impairment of acquired intangibles in the current year as well as timing of development credits.\nOperating expenses increased 28% to $7.5 billion due to the impairment charges that I mentioned previously that we reported during our fourth quarter. On a management basis, operating expenses rose 11% year-over-year slightly above our guidance due to higher development costs for title, not technologically feasible.\nToday, we are providing our initial outlook for fiscal 2026.

Largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, the Grand Theft Auto series, Toon Blast, Borderlands 4, Match Factory!, Empires & Puzzles, Words with Friends, the Red Dead Redemption Series and Zynga Poker. We expect recurrent consumer spending to be flat compared to fiscal 2025, and to represent 76% of net bookings. Our current consumer spending forecast assumes high single-digit growth for NBA 2K and declined from mobile and Grand Theft Auto Online. We expect the net booking breakdown from our labels to be roughly 45% Zynga, 39% 2K and 16% Rockstar Games. We expect operating cash flow to be approximately $130 million and we plan to deploy approximately $140 million of capital expenditures for game technology and office build-outs.\nWe expect GAAP net revenue to range from $5.95 billion to $6.05 billion and cost of revenue to range from $2.52 billion to $2.55 million. Our total operating expenses are expected to range from $3.78 billion to $3.8 billion. On a management basis, we expect operating expense growth of approximately 3% year-over-year, which is largely due to higher marketing expenses.\nNow moving to our guidance for the fiscal first quarter. We project net bookings to range from $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion compared to $1.22 billion in the first quarter last year. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, the Grand Theft Auto series, Toon Blast, Color Block Jam, Match Factory!, Empires & Puzzles, Words with Friends, Red Dead Redemption Series and Zynga Poker.

We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $1.35 billion to $1.4 billion and cost of revenue to range from $544 million to $562 million. Operating expenses are planned to range from $908 million to $980 million. On a management basis, operating expenses are expected to grow by approximately 2% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher development costs.\nIn closing, our core businesses are showing strength into fiscal 2026, and our long-term outlook continues to be positive. Fiscal 2027 represents a massive inflection point in our business that our teams have worked long and hard for. One that we believe will significantly enhance a multiyear financial profile.

In addition, Red Dead Online engaged its audience further during the period with the release of the fan favorite Halloween pass featuring seasonal theme to bonuses and rewards. Turning to mobile.\nRecurrent consumer spending grew mid-single digits. While this was somewhat below our plan, we remain highly optimistic about Zynga's future.

Match factory is performing very well and remains on track to become Zynga's second largest title by the end of this fiscal year in terms of net bookings.

We delivered solid third quarter results led by the power of our diversified business. During the period, our teams brought innovation to our existing franchises enhanced our relationships with our player communities and made outstanding progress on our eagerly anticipated pipeline. I'd like to thank our teams for their disciplined execution and continued focus. Turning to our results. We achieved third quarter net bookings of $1.37 billion, which was within our guidance range of $1.35 billion to $1.4 billion.\nWe delivered outstanding performance in NBA 2K, which helped offset moderation experience in some of our mobile franchises. Recurrent consumer spending rose 9% over last year, which was in line with our guidance and accounted for 79% of net bookings. NBA 2K grew over 30%, which greatly surpassed our forecast led by new features and innovation in our game modes. Mobile increased 6%, driven by the addition of Match Factory and strength in June Blast, Toy Blast and [indiscernible] brands. However, this was below our guidance of low double-digit growth primarily due to underperformance in our hypercasual, mobile portfolio and Empires & Puzzles and as anticipated, Grand Theft Auto Online declined.\nGAAP net revenue was $1.36 billion and was flat to last year, while cost of revenue declined 13% to $600 million as the prior year included an impairment charge related to acquired intangibles. Operating expenses increased by 10% to $892 million. On a management basis, operating expenses rose 8% year-over-year. This was favorable to our forecast largely due to a shift in timing of expenses into the fourth quarter. This shift, along with the outperformance of NBA 2K drove operating results that were above the high end of our guidance range. Turning to our outlook.\nI'll begin with our full fiscal year expectations. As Strauss mentioned, we are reiterating our net bookings outlook range of $5.55 billion to $5.65 billion, which represents 5% growth over fiscal 2024. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, the Grand Theft Auto series, [ T ] Blast, our hypercasual mobile portfolio, Match Factory, Empires & Puzzles, The Red Dead Redemption series, Sid Meyer's Civilization VI and Words with Friends. We're raising our recurrent consumer spending forecast of 5% growth, which represents 78% of net bookings driven by the phenomenal performance we are experiencing in NBA 2K, which we now expect to grow low double digits.\nMobile is now expected to grow low single digits as we are factoring in the current business trends. And Grand Theft Auto Online is still expected to define. We project the net bookings breakdown from our label to be roughly 49% Zynga, 34% 2K and 17% Rockstar Games. We forecast our geographic net booking split to be about 60% United States and 40% international. Non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow is expected to be an outflow of $150 million which is unchanged from our prior forecast, and we remain on track to deploy approximately $140 million of capital expenditures, primarily for game technology and office build-outs. We continue to expect GAAP net revenue to range from $5.57 billion to $5.67 billion while we now expect cost of revenue to range $2.41 billion to $2.44 billion. Total operating expenses are still expected to range from $3.77 billion to $3.79 billion as compared to $5.83 billion last year.\nOn a management basis, we expect operating expense growth of approximately 10% year-over-year. which is unchanged from our prior guidance and is largely due to an increase in ongoing marketing support for Match Factory as well as other mobile and immersive core launches planned for the year. The addition of Gearbox and higher personnel costs partially offset by savings from our cost reduction program. Excluding incremental marketing and the addition of Gearbox, our operating expenses are expected to grow low single digits over last year.\nAs it relates to our operating performance, while our third quarter results exceeded our expectations, we are maintaining our outlook for the fiscal year as we're factoring several dynamics, including [indiscernible] and NBA 2K, offset by a continuation of the mobile trends we have been experiencing and the shift of some operating expenses in the fourth quarter. Now moving on to our guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter. We project net bookings to range from $1.48 billion to $1.58 billion compared to $1.35 billion in the prior year. Our release rate for the quarter includes Sider Civilization V, PGA Tour 2K25 and WWE 2K 25. Largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, the Grand Theft Auto series, Sid Meyer Civilization VII, [indiscernible] blast, [ Match ] factory, our hypercasual mobile portfolio, Empires & Puzzles, WWE 2K 25 and words with friends.\nWe project recurrent consumer spending to increase by approximately 3%, which assumes a high teens percentage increase for NBA 2K, partly offset by declines in both mobile and Grand Theft Auto Online. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $1.52 billion to $1.62 billion. Operating expenses are planned to range from $900 million to $920 million. On a management basis, operating expenses are expected to decline approximately 2% year-over-year, which was primarily driven by a more normalized level of marketing for Match Factory as the title has now been in the market for over a year as well as savings from our cost reduction efforts.\nIn closing, we are forecasting a milestone year ahead of us, and we look forward to showing our fans and the global gaming community on our new titles can take our industry to another level of creativity. We are also optimistic that the chapter ahead will set us on a path to achieving new financial goals, including reaching a record level of scale, enhancing our profitability and unlocking significant value for our shareholders. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss.\n\nStrauss H. Zelnick\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for embodying our core tenets of creativity, innovation and efficiency and for delivering another consecutive quarter of strong results.

The total operating expenses are expected to range from $3.7 billion to $3.72 billion as compared to $5.83 billion last year.\nOn a management basis, we expect operating expense growth of approximately 10% year-over-year.

Recurrent consumer spending declined to Grand Theft Auto Online, although it was up for virtual currency and GTA Plus. NBA 2K was in line with the prior year and mobile increased slightly.\nDuring the quarter, we successfully launched WWE 2K24 and which demonstrates 2K and Visual Concepts ability to raise the bar further for our popular westling series. GAAP net revenue decreased 3% to $1.4 billion while cost of revenue declined 24% to $930 million. And included an impairment charge of $304 million related to acquired intangible assets. Operating expenses increased by 244% to $3.2 billion due to a goodwill impairment charge of $2.2 billion and $9 million of business reorganization expenses related to our recently announced cost reduction program. On a management basis, operating expenses rose 20% year-over-year, which was slightly above our guidance due to higher personnel and IT expenses and professional fees.\nFor fiscal 2024, we achieved net bookings of $5.33 billion, which was slightly above our revised guidance range of $5.25 billion to $5.3 billion. Recurrent consumer spending grew 2% and which exceeded our outlook and accounted for 78% of net bookings. Recurrent consumer spending for mobile increased high single digits. NBA [indiscernible] virtual currency and seasons was up slightly and Grant Test Auto Online virtual currency and GTA Plus membership was flat. Non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow was $42 million as compared to our outlook of approximately $100 million due to higher external developer advances, cash tax and interest payments.

Today, we provided our outlook for fiscal 2025. We project net bookings to range from $5.55 billion to $5.65 billion, which represents 5% growth over fiscal 2024. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, the Grand Auto series, [indiscernible] Empires & Puzzles, our hyper casual mobile portfolio, Match Factory!, Redhead redemption series, and unannounced immerses [indiscernible] from 2K and Words with Friends. We expect recurring [indiscernible] spending to be up approximately 3% compared to fiscal 2024 and to represent 76% of net bookings. Our recurrent consumer spending forecast assumes high single-digit growth for mobile, a slight increase for NBA 2K and inclined for Grand Theft Auto Online.

We recently implemented a cost reduction program that is expected to deliver over $165 million of annual cost savings across our entire business. As part of these efforts, we have eliminated several projects in development that we did not anticipate would meet our financial benchmarks.\nWe also took actions to streamline our organizational structure, which reduced both exit headcount and future hiring needs. Our total operating expenses are expected to range from $3.56 billion to $3.58 billion as compared to $5.83 billion last year. On a management basis, we expect operating events growth of approximately 7% year-over-year. which is largely due to an increase in ongoing marketing support for Match Factory! as well as other mobile and immersive core launches planned for the year, partially offset by savings from our cost reduct program. Looking ahead, and as Josh mentioned earlier, we have narrowed the previously established release when Granchest6 the fall of calendar 2025 from calendar 2025. The -- as development advances, our confidence in the title and its potential commercial impacts continue to grow. That said, we are not providing specific guidance beyond fiscal 2025 as our release schedule includes numerous titles each year and even modest shifts can have a significant effect on results in any given period. Our outlook for the lifetime value of our pipeline remains as strong as ever, and we expect sequential growth in net bookings in fiscal 2025, 2026 and 2027.\nNow moving on to our guidance for the fiscal first quarter. We project net bookings to range from $1.2 billion to $1.25 billion compared to $1.2 billion in the first quarter last year. Our lease rate for the quarter includes [indiscernible] 2K25, to rest with [indiscernible] on early access for PC and NFL 2K play makers, all of which have already released, and Star Wars Hunters. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, the Grand Theft Laughter Series, Tebas and Pirates & Puzzles; our hypercasual mobile portfolio, Match Factory!, the Red Dead Redemption series, [indiscernible] and Zynga Poker. We project recurrent consumer spending to increase by approximately 1%, which assumes mid-single-digit growth in mobile, flat results for NBA 2K and the decline for Grand Theft Auto Online.

Welcome to Take-Two's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn the conference call over to Nicole Shevins, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nNicole B. Shevins\n\nSVP of IR & Corporate Communications, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 ended December 31, 2023. Today's call will be led by Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Karl Slatoff, our President; and Lainie Goldstein, our Chief Financial Officer. We will be available to answer your questions during the Q&A session following our prepared remarks.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that statements made during this call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to us. We have no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Actual operating results may vary significantly from these forward-looking statements based on a variety of factors. These important factors are described in our filings with the SEC, including the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q, including the risks summarized in the section entitled Risk Factors.\nI'd also like to note that unless otherwise stated, all numbers we will be discussing today are GAAP and all comparisons are year-over-year. Additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release, including the items that our management uses internally to adjust our GAAP financial results in order to evaluate our operating performance. Our press release also contains a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure. In addition, we have posted to our website a slide deck that visually presents our results and financial outlook. Our press release and filings with the SEC may be obtained from our website at take2games.com.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Strauss.\n\nStrauss H. Zelnick\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nicole. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we achieved solid results, including net bookings of $1.3 billion. Our performance reflects our unwavering commitment to quality, the ongoing contributions from our outstanding portfolio, which is one of the strongest and most diverse in the entertainment industry and our immensely talented creative teams. During the period, Grand Theft Auto V, Grand Theft Auto Online, the Red Dead Redemption series and Zynga's in-app purchases led by Tom Blast exceeded our plans, driven by engaging new content, partnerships and activations. This was partially offset by some softness in mobile advertising and sales for NBA 2K24. 2K is implementing measures to enhance performance for the title such as offering new events and promotions and delivering an exciting and engaging content lineup.\nWe expect lifetime net bookings for the title to be in line with NBA 2K23. Due to these factors, a planned release moving out of the fourth quarter and increased marketing for Zynga's new hit mobile title Match Factory, we're lowering our full year outlook. While the timing of Match Factories user acquisition expense will reduce our profitability in the current fiscal year, we believe that this investment will allow us to grow our audience meaningfully and increase the lifetime value of the Match Factory franchise. We've always managed to take to for the long term, and we have great confidence in our groundbreaking pipeline for fiscal 2025 and beyond, which we believe will enable us to grow our net bookings, increase our scale and enhance our profitability. At the same time, our teams are always looking for ways in which we can operate at the highest level of efficiency, which is one of our core tenets.\nWe're currently working on a significant cost reduction program across our entire business to maximize our margins while still investing for growth. These measures are incremental to and even more robust than our prior cost reduction program and we aim to achieve greater operating leverage as we roll out our eagerly anticipated release schedule.\nTurning to the performance of our titles during the quarter. Momentum for Grand Theft Auto remains phenomenal. Sales of Grand Theft Auto V exceeded our expectations during the holiday season. And to date, the title has sold in more than 195 million units worldwide. During the quarter, Rockstar Games released its holiday update for Grand Theft Auto Online, the chop shop, which captured the highest number of active users in several years, including the largest ever increase in new Grand Theft Auto Online accounts driven by the variety and depth of new vehicles in robberies, positive community sentiment and the game's inclusion in various subscription services.\nThe Grand Theft Auto series is also benefiting meaningfully from excitement surrounding Rockstar's announcement of Grand Theft 06 and the release of its first trailer, which at 93 million views in 24 hours broke YouTube's records for a nonmusic video launch and along with partner channels became the biggest video debut ever. Rockstar's recent partnership with Netflix to launch the GTA Trilogy is also a resounding success, quickly yielding the highest rate of installs and engagement on the subscription services game platform. In addition, Rockstar's membership program, GTA+ continues to grow rapidly, powered by enhanced benefits from members, including a rotating assortment of classic Rockstar titles. Red Redemption 2 also surpassed our plans as our exciting holiday promotions and events resonated deeply with players. To date, the title has sold in more than 61 million units worldwide.\nDuring the quarter, Rockstar Games supported Red Dead Online with free updates, including the new All Halos call to arms locations, a trio of new Dead of Night Maps and a hard-core telegram mission alongside the return of the Halloween Pass 2. NBA-2K24 remains the #1 basketball simulation experience in our industry and to date has sold in over 7 million units. Unit sales for the Gen 9 version of the game were growing at a double-digit percentage increase over last year due to an enhanced gameplay experience and wider console availability. As players migrate to Gen 9 platforms, we are seeing significant declines in demand for our Gen 8 offering. Players have been highly engaged with many of NBA-2K24's new features, including a season pass that helped average revenue per user grew 30% year-over-year. On October 6, 2K and Gearbox Software launched the Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition for Nintendo Switch. We're pleased to expand further our beloved franchise by enabling players to make some mayhem at home or on the go with this thrilling high stakes of venture.\nNow turning to Zynga. We're very pleased with the team's ability to create successful new mobile games, including Peak's Match factory, which launched on iOS in November and Android in late December. The title is a top 30 grossing game on the Apple App Store in key target markets such as the U.K. and the U.S. and has shown stellar retention and monetization metrics on par with previous category-leading peak titles such as Toon Blast. Based on these excellent metrics, we see strong long-term potential for the title, and we're planning to invest in new features and a robust marketing campaign to capitalize on its popularity with consumers and to scale it further. Zynga's other recent release, Top troops, increased its engagement by more than 10% over last quarter, propelled by the launch of new features and semi-monthly battles. Looking ahead, the team is focusing on new brand collaborations player competitions and social and community engagements.\nOverall, Zynga's in-app purchases exceeded our expectations with significant sequential improvement compared to last quarter. This was led by Toon Blast, which materially outperformed, delivering its highest ever average revenue per daily average user and over 50% growth in its daily in-app purchase revenue compared to last quarter. While we're encouraged by the trajectory of Zynga's in-app purchases, its ad revenues were below our expectations due to some changes that we're implementing in the hypercasual business, including a heightened focus on our profitability and the launch of new features that deliver blended monetization.\nOur direct-to-consumer business continues to grow and enjoyed a record holiday season. Our teams are working actively to add more titles each quarter to this highly accretive owned distribution channel.\nLooking ahead, Zynga has numerous titles in development and soft launch that we're eager to release worldwide in fiscal 2025 and beyond. If there's noting that launching hit mobile titles is both highly complex and challenging, and we're gratified by Zynga's unique ability to release new properties to capture mind share and market share.\nIn closing, although we're lowering our outlook for the year, we believe that our company's potential is vast and unique, driven by our creative talent, our owned and controlled intellectual property and our groundbreaking new pipeline for fiscal 2025 and beyond. As we execute on our strategic priorities, we believe that we'll deliver an array of unparalleled entertainment experiences that can captivate, engage and redefine our industry for audiences around the globe.\nI'll now turn the call over to Karl.\n\nKarl Slatoff\n\nPresident, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Strauss. I'd like to thank our teams for delivering another solid quarter and adding to the continued positive momentum of our business. I'll now turn to our upcoming launches for the balance of fiscal 2024 and beyond. This quarter, Private Division and Evening Star will launch Penny's Big Breakaway, a 3D platforming game. Private Division will share more news about this exciting release shortly. On March 8, 2K and Visual Concepts will launch WWE 2K 24. The title will feature several franchise advancements, including the 2K showcase of the Immortals, celebrating 40 years of Rusomania. 4 new match types, 2 new My Rise experiences and much more. We're thrilled to build upon our long-standing partnership with WWE and to continue to set new creative benchmarks for this franchise.\nAt the game awards in December, Private Division announced no rest for the Wicked, an action role-playing game from Moon Studios, creators of the critically acclaimed Ori and Blind Forest and Ori- the will of the West, the title will launch early access of PC in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 with a full release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series XNS and PC thereafter. We will reveal more information about the game on March 1 during the label's Wicked inside digital showcase. After 13 years, we're pleased that 2K will return to Tennis and broaden its sports offerings with the upcoming release of Top Spin2K25. Developed by Hangar 13, the title was poised to provide an incredibly realistic and engaging tennis simulation featuring the world's top players and courts. 2K will share more details in the coming weeks, including an expected launch date.\nZynga continues to deliver on their outstanding pipeline with their much anticipated titles, Star Wars Hunters and Game of Thrones Legends, each slated for global release in calendar 2024. We are encouraged by both games performances and soft launch and are confident that they will resonate with broad audiences when they debut worldwide. At the same time, Zynga's hypercasual studios plan to release a steady cadence of mobile titles for games that have the potential for enhanced retention rates and a mix of in-app purchases and advertising to drive higher monetization and profitability. And as always, our labels will continue to provide new content and experiences that drive engagement and recurrent consumer spending across many of our key offerings. Looking ahead, we remain highly optimistic about what we believe to be the strongest and most exciting development pipeline in our company's history.\nI'll now turn the call over to Lainie.\n\nLainie Goldstein\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered solid holiday results, including net bookings of $1.34 billion, which was within our guidance range. I'd like to thank our talented teams for their commitment to creativity, innovation, quality and value, which allows us to provide outstanding entertainment experiences for our players across the world. Grand Theft Auto V, Grand Theft Auto Online, the Red Dead Redemption series and Zynga in-app purchases led by Toon Blast exceeded our expectations. This was partially offset by softness in mobile advertising and NBA 2K. Recurrent consumer spending declined 7% for the period and accounted for 75% of net bookings. This was slightly less than our outlook, driven by weakness in mobile advertising and NBA 2K, which was largely due to the effect of of lower unit sales on its in-game monetization. Recurrent consumer spending for Grand Theft Auto online, Virtual Currency and GTAs membership was up notably. During the quarter, we launched several mobile titles, including Top Troops, Match Factory and NBA 2K 24 Arcade edition for Apple Arcade as well as Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition for Switch. GAAP net revenue decreased 3% to $1.37 billion and cost of revenue declined 1% to $688 million, which included an impairment charge of $53 million and $177 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Operating expenses decreased by 10% to $808 million, on a management basis, operating expenses rose 4% year-over-year and was favorable to our guidance due to lower marketing and personnel expenses.\nTurning to our guidance. I'll begin with our full fiscal year expectations. As Strauss mentioned, we are lowering our outlook to reflect the softness we are currently experiencing in mobile advertising and NBA 2K 24 and a planned release will be out of the fourth quarter and increased marketing for Zynga's new hit mobile title Match Factory, which we believe will enable us to scale it more meaningfully to reach its full long-term potential. Our advisement bookings forecast is $5.25 billion to $5.3 billion. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our label to be roughly 51% Zynga, 30%, 2K and 19% Rockstar Games. And we forecast a geographic net booking split to be about 60% United States and 40% international.\nWe are projecting recurring consumer spending of 1% compared to fiscal 2023, which includes a full year of Zynga, partially offset by a slight decline in NBA 2K. Grand Theft Auto Online is expected to deliver modest growth for virtual currency and GTA+ membership. RCS is expected to represent 79% of net bookings. We plan to generate approximately $100 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow and to deploy approximately $150 million for capital expenditures, primarily to support our office build-outs and larger footprint. We now forecast GAAP net revenue to range from $5.7 billion to $5.32 billion. Our total operating expenses are now planned to gain from $3.55 billion to $3.56 billion as compared to $3.45 billion last year. On a management basis, we continue to expect operating expense growth of approximately 14% year-over-year due to a full year of Zynga and increase in personnel marketing expenses and higher depreciation, which are being partially offset by the realization of synergies from our combination with Zynga and savings from our prior cost reduction program announced last year.\nNow moving on to our guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter. We project net bookings to range from $1.27 billion to $1.32 billion compared to $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter last year. Our release slate for the quarter includes WWE 2K24 as well as Penny's Big Breakaway from Private Division. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Toon Blast, our Hypercasual mobile portfolio, Empire & Puzzles, WWE 2K 24, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Boards with Friends and Match Factory. We project recurrent consumer spending to decrease by approximately 5%, which assumes flat results for Zynga and a decline for NBA 2K. For Grand Theft Auto Online, Virtual Currency and GTA Plus membership are expected to be up.\nWe project GAAP net revenue to range from $1.32 billion to $1.37 billion. Operating expenses are planned to range from $896 million to $906 million. On a management basis, operating expenses are expected to grow by approximately 17% year-over-year, driven by the additional marketing expense from Match factory that I mentioned previously, higher personnel costs and an increase in depreciation, which are being partially offset by the realization of synergies from our combination with Zynga and savings from our prior cost reduction program that we announced last year.\nLooking ahead, our teams remain committed to efficiency. We've begun a rigorous analysis to identify additional areas for cost optimization. The expected savings are incremental to our previously announced cost reduction program, and we expect that it will be more expensive. We believe that these measures will enhance our margin profile and position our business for greater operating leverage in the future.\nIn closing, while we are disappointed to have lowered our outlook for the year, we are exceedingly confident in our growth prospects. With our industry-leading portfolio and passionate teams, we believe that we are poised to deliver the best content in our industry, reached new record levels of operating performance and deliver long-term value for our shareholders. Thank you for your continued support.\nI'll now turn the call back to Strauss.\n\nStrauss H. Zelnick\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for enabling us to achieve our goals and deliver another solid quarter. And to our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator?"

Zelnick\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nicole. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. We delivered another consecutive quarter of excellent results, highlighted by net bookings of $1.44 billion, which was at the high end of our guidance and management results that exceeded our plans. While we expect continued macroeconomic uncertainty, we believe that we're well positioned for the holiday season and are reiterating our fiscal 2024 net bookings guidance of $5.45 billion to $5.55 billion.\nLooking ahead, I'm exceedingly optimistic about our company's multiyear growth trajectory and our ability to deliver long-term value to our shareholders. Our development pipeline is robust and diverse, and we're getting closer to delivering the groundbreaking titles that our audiences throughout the world have been anticipating eagerly. Our unwavering commitment to being the most creative, the most innovative and the most efficient entertainment company gives us great confidence that our offerings will surpass our players' expectations and set new standards of creative excellence in our industry.\nNow turning to the performance of our titles during the quarter. Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online continue to surpass our expectations, an outstanding achievement for 2 titles celebrating their 10th anniversaries. To date, Grand Theft Auto V has sold an approximately 190 million units. Grand Theft Auto Online experienced continued momentum due to the rollout of new gameplay and items from the San Andreas Mercenaries update with new seasonal events, vehicles, modes, clothes and weapons, driving sustained engagement and net bookings.\nOur GTA+ membership program continue to grow, and we're deepening our relationships with our player communities through new offerings, which now include access to a rotating assortment of classic Rockstar Games titles. During the quarter, Rockstar Games announced that CitizenFX, the team behind the FiveM and RedM role-playing communities for Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption 2 officially joined the label. With their immense passion and creativity, Citizen FX has been pivotal in expanding the possibilities of user-generated content around Rockstar's leading titles. We're excited to see them continue to build these creative communities and help them thrive into the future.\nWe're also thrilled by today's announcement from Rockstar Games founder, Sam Houser, that the eagerly anticipated first trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto will be revealed this coming December. As the label approaches its 25th anniversary [Technical Difficulty] we congratulate Rockstar Games on their constant innovation in the pursuit of the highest quality interactive entertainment. Red Dead Redemption 2 surpassed our plans and has sold in more than 57 million units to date. Rockstar Games continues to support Red Dead Online with new content, including bonuses for the naturalist and bounty hunters and new free roam missions and events.\nIn addition, Rockstar Games expanded the audience for the franchise with the launch of Red Dead Redemption and Undead nightmare for PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch. On September 8, 2K and Visual Concepts once again redefined the #1 NBA simulation experience in our industry with the successful worldwide launch of NBA 2K24.\nWith exciting new features and next-generation enhancements, the title is off to a great start and to date has sold in over 4.5 million units. NBA 2K24 features new season pass options that provide players with the opportunity to earn even more rewards, seasonal progression that combines my career and my team into one linear reward system. Engagement has been phenomenal with season pass and virtual currency bookings exceeding our plans and driving [Technical Difficulty] growth in ARPU compared to NBA 2K23. Our franchise extensions continue to perform extremely well, including NBA 2K Mobile, NBA 2K Online in China and the recently launched NBA 2K24 Arcade edition on Apple arcade.\nI'd like to thank 2K and Visual Concepts for continuing to bring innovation and creativity consistently to our beloved franchise. 2K continued to support LEGO 2K Drive with its second drive past season in the Creators Hub and PGA toward 2K23 with additional pros and gear. In addition, the label harness the power of our industry-leading catalog with the launch of the Borderlands Collection, Pandora's box which bundles together all 6 acclaimed Borderlands games in their previously released add-on content into a single offering at an amazing value.\nWe have great respect for the team at Gearbox and we value deeply our long-term relationship. Zynga once again delivered solid results during the quarter, and we remain pleased with its ongoing performance. We continue to benefit from Zynga's ability to create engaging new games, which is a distinguishing capability of our mobile business.\nFor example, Rollic successfully launched Power Slap on the world's first regulated and sanctioned slap fighting promotion. The title is highly entertaining and to date has experienced more than 1 billion slabs across training and matches. With the launch of this new mobile game, Rollic has now had 22 titles reached the #1 or 2 spot in the U.S. Apple App Store.\nWe'd like to thank the entire team over TKO including Ari Emanuel and Dana White for their strong partnership as well as our colleagues, Rollic, created this title from inception to release in just 8 weeks. Zynga also recently launched Top Troops and Match Factory, both of which delivered excellent KPIs in soft launch and appeared to have strong long-term potential for our portfolio. And Star Wars Hunters continues to hit important milestones as we approach its planned release date in calendar 2024.\nKarl will discuss these titles in greater detail. Other highlights from our mobile business this quarter include our advertising bookings grew year-over-year driven by the addition of Popcore, contributions from strategic partnerships and our efforts to increase adamant inventory in many live games.

I'll now turn the call over to Lainie.\n\nLainie Goldstein\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss the key highlights of our second quarter before reviewing our financial outlook for the full year and third quarter of fiscal 2024. Additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. We delivered another great quarter, which demonstrates the enduring strength of our catalog, our ability to deliver deeply engaging [indiscernible] content and our commitment to disciplined execution. At the same time, our teams continue to make excellent progress advancing our development pipeline, which gives us confidence in our multiyear growth trajectory.\nI'd like to thank our incredible teams worldwide for their hard work and passion for our business. Now moving on to our results. We achieved net bookings of $1.44 billion, which was at the high end of our guidance range. Our performance reflects better-than-expected results from Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Redemption.\nDuring the quarter, we released NBA 2K24, Red Dead Redemption and Undead nightmare switch and PlayStation 4, Borderlands Collection, Pandora's box and Power Slap. Recurrent consumer spending declined 7% for the period, which was in line with our outlook and accounted for 78% of net bookings.\nGAAP net revenue decreased 7% to $1.3 billion, while cost of revenue increased 24% to $884 million, driven by an impairment charge of $220 million and $190 million amortization of acquired intangibles. Operating expenses increased by 3% to $959 million and included $165 million of loan impairment, representing a partial impairment of one of our reporting units. On a management basis, operating expenses were flat year-over-year, which is favorable to our guidance. This was driven by lower marketing expenditures, some of which shifted to later this year.\nTurning to our guidance. I'll begin with our full fiscal year expectations. As Strauss mentioned, we are reiterating our net bookings outlook range of $5.45 billion to $5.55 billion. The largest contributors to net bookings are planned to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, our hyper-casual mobile portfolio, Empires & Puzzles, Toon Blast, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Words with Friends, Merge Dragon and Zynga poker.\nWe expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 49% Zynga, 31% 2K, 18% Rockstar Games and 2% other. And we forecast our geographic net booking split to be about 65% United States and 35% international. We are projecting the current consumer spending growth of 4% compared to fiscal 2023, which assumes an increase for NBA 2K as well as Zynga since we will own the business for a full 12 months this year. Grand Theft Auto Online, Virtual Currency and GTA+ membership is expected to be flat. RCS is expected to represent [Technical Difficulty] 8% of net bookings. We plan to generate approximately $100 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow and to deploy approximately $150 million for capital expenditures, primarily to support our office build-outs and larger footprint.\nYou can see our GAAP net revenue to range from $5.37 billion to $5.47 billion. Our total operating expenses are now planned to range from $3.53 billion to $3.55 billion as compared to $3.45 billion last year. On a management basis, we continue to expect operating expense growth of approximately 14% year-over-year due to a full year of Zynga, an increase in personnel and marketing expenses and higher depreciation of office build-outs and capitalized IT expenses, which are being partially offset by the realization of synergies from our combination with Zynga and savings from our cost reduction program.\nWe remain vigilant in our efforts to optimize our cost structure and reduce discretionary costs where possible, while still investing for growth.\nNow moving on to our guidance for the fiscal third quarter. We project net bookings to range from $1.3 billion to $1.35 billion compared to $1.4 billion in the third quarter last year. Our release slate for the quarter includes 2 mobile titles Top Troops and Match Factory as well as Borderlands 3 ultimate edition, all of which have been released. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, our hyper-casual mobile portfolio, Empires & Puzzles, Toon blast, Red Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Words with Friends, Merge Dragons and Zynga Poker.\nWe project recurrent consumer spending to decrease by approximately 5%, which assumes a modest decline in our mobile business, which is being partially offset by expected growth in NBA 2K. The Grand Theft Auto Online, virtual currency and GTA+ membership is expected to be up. We project GAAP net revenue to range from $1.29 billion to $1.34 billion. Operating expenses are planned to range from $826 million to $836 million.\nOn a management basis, operating expenses are expected to grow by approximately 7% year-over-year driven by higher personnel and depreciation expenses, which are being partially offset by the Zynga synergies and our cost savings initiatives. In closing, there are many exciting upcoming catalysts that we believe will enable our company to achieve new record levels of financial performance. Powered by our incredible talent, we believe that our projects in development will set new standards for creativity and engagement in our industry while also significantly enhancing our financial profile.\nWe'd like to thank all our stakeholders for being on this journey with us, and we can't wait to share more details with you. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss.\n\nStrauss H. Zelnick\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for enabling us to achieve our goals and to deliver another strong quarter. To our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator? ."

GTA+, Rockstar's premium membership service for GTA Online on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, offered exclusive options for members to test drive and purchase an array of vehicles and we're continuing to see strong growth in GTA+ adoption with each passing quarter.\nWe were pleased with the performance of Red dead Redemption 2, which has sold in more than 55 million units to date.

Today I'll discuss the key highlights from our first quarter before reviewing our financial outlook for the full year and second quarter of fiscal 2024. Our combination with Zynga closed on May 23, 2022, which affects the comparability of our results relative to last year. Additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. We had a strong start to the fiscal year, powered by our portfolio of iconic industry-leading intellectual properties. As we approach our next phase of growth, our teams continue to make excellent progress advancing our development pipeline and capitalizing on our revenue-driven opportunities and synergies.\nWe also partnered together to maintain our focus on efficiency and this a challenging macroeconomic backdrop and cautious consumer spending trend. I'd like to thank our incredible teams worldwide for their determination and passion for our business.\nNow moving on to our results. We achieved net bookings of $1.2 billion, which was at the high end of our guidance range. In the current backdrop, many consumers are purchasing established franchises and those that offer great value. Our catalog stands at the intersection of these 2 trends. Accordingly, our performance reflects better-than-expected results from Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V and NBA 2K23. During the quarter, we launched Marvel's Mini Sun, [ Pergeno Console ] LEGO 2K Drive and [ Astra. ] Recurrent consumer spending was 38% for the period, which was above our outlook of 35% growth and accounted for 84% of net bookings.\nThe outperformance was primarily driven by Grand Theft Auto Online and NBA 2K23. GAAP net revenue increased 17% to $1.28 billion, and cost of revenue increased 39% to $606 million, driven by $187 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. We also recorded an impairment of $80 million related primarily to capitalized software and development costs for an unreleased title, which affected our management results compared to our guidance.\nOperating expenses increased by 25% to $883 million. On a management basis, operating expenses grew by 46%, which primarily reflected a full quarter of Zynga, higher personnel costs and depreciation related to office build-outs and capitalized IT expenses.\nTurning to our guidance. I'll begin with our full fiscal year expectations. As Strauss mentioned, our business is performing well, and we are reiterating our net bookings outlook range of $5.45 billion to $5.55 billion. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, our hypercasual mobile portfolio, Empires & Puzzles, Toon Blast, Merge Dragon, Words with Friends, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and Zynga Poker.\nWe expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 51% Zynga, 30% 2K, 17% Rockstar Games and 2% other. And we forecast our geographic net bookings split to be about 65% United States and 35% international. We continue to forecast recurrent consumer spending growth of 5% compared to fiscal 2023, representing 78% of net bookings. Mobile trends are projected to remain stable and Zynga's ad business continues to deliver growth.\nWe expect to generate approximately $100 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow and deploy approximately $180 million for capital expenditures, primarily to support our office build-outs and larger footprint. We continue to expect GAAP net revenue to range from $5.37 billion to $5.47 billion. Our total operating expenses are expected to range from $3.38 billion to $3.4 billion as compared to $3.45 billion last year.\nOn a management basis, our operating expenses are expected to grow by approximately 15% year-over-year due primarily to a full year of Zynga, an increase in personnel and marketing expenses and higher depreciation of office build-outs and capitalized IT expenses, which are being partially offset by the realization of synergies from our combination with Zynga and savings from our cost reduction program. As we announced previously, our teams are taking extensive measures to review our cost structure and reduce discretionary costs whenever possible to offset the current consumer backdrop and inflationary environment while still investing for growth.\nNow moving on to our guidance for the fiscal second quarter. We project net bookings to range from $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion compared to $1.5 billion in the second quarter last year. Our release slate for the quarter includes Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare for Switch and PlayStation 4 and NBA-2K24. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, our hypercasual mobile portfolio, Empires & Puzzles, Toon Blast, Words with Friends, Merge Dragon, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and Zynga Poker. We project recurrent consumer spending to decline by approximately 7%, which assumes modest declines in our mobile business, NBA 2K driven by changes to its summer promotional cadence and Grand Theft Auto Online as well as a reduction in DLC revenue from several titles that were released in prior years.\nWe expect GAAP net revenue to range from $1.26 billion to $1.31 billion. Operating expenses are expected to range from $811 million to $821 million. On a management basis, operating expenses are expected to grow by approximately 5% year-over-year, driven by last year's acquisition of Bapcor and higher personnel costs, which are being partly offset by the Zynga synergies and our cost savings initiatives.\nIn closing, we are confident that the actions our teams are taking this year are preparing us for a strong trajectory of growth. Through our collective efforts, we continue to believe that we are positioning our business for a significant inflection point in fiscal 2025 and that will culminate in us delivering new record levels of operating performance next year and beyond.\nI thank all of our stakeholders for their continued support, and we look forward to delivering on this exciting next chapter. Thank you.\nI'll now turn the call back to Strauss.\n\nStrauss H. Zelnick\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for delivering a strong start to the fiscal year.

I'm pleased to report that we concluded fiscal 2023 by delivering strong fourth quarter results, including net bookings of $1.4 billion, which were above the high end of our expectations. On behalf of our management team, I'd like to thank all of our colleagues around the world for helping us achieve these results and supporting our vision to become a more scaled, diverse industry-leading organization. Especially as we navigate and oftentimes volatile and uncertain economic landscape.\nWith fiscal 2024 underway, our initial expectation is to deliver full year net bookings in the range of $5.45 billion to $5.55 billion. We're assuming a continuation of the current challenging consumer backdrop within our forecast. Additionally, the development time lines of some of our titles lengthened especially as we strive to redefine the creative standards of excellence of our industry, which affect our release slate for the year. Looking ahead, fiscal 2025 is a highly anticipated year for our company. For the last several years, we've been preparing our business to release an incredibly robust pipeline of projects that we believe will take our company to even greater levels of success. In fiscal 2025, we expect to enter this new era by launching several groundbreaking titles that we believe will set new standards in our industry and enable us to achieve over $8 billion in net bookings and over $1 billion in adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow. We expect to sustain this momentum by delivering even higher levels of operating results in fiscal 2026 and beyond.\nI'd now like to discuss several key highlights from fiscal 2023, which was a milestone year in the 30-year history of our organization. We delivered net bookings of $5.3 billion, which reflects both the transformative evolution of our company through our combination with Zynga and our ability to create market and distribute the highest quality entertainment experiences. We made excellent progress integrating Zynga. The combination has been highly accretive to our business as we've embarked on new revenue-driven opportunities, exceeded our anticipated cost synergies for year 1 and enhance further our mobile platform through select acquisitions. As we approach the 1-year anniversary of our combination, we're immensely proud of the trajectory of our integration and the strength of our shared culture and values.\nOur headcount now stands at nearly 12,000 talented individuals, including approximately 9,000 developers in our studios throughout the world, which positions us exceedingly well to reach the full potential of our pipeline. And we've maintained our focus on our core tenet of efficiency. We've taken a rigorous approach to our cost reduction program announced in February, which we believe will surpass meaningfully the $50 million in annual savings that we originally anticipated. Our fourth quarter outperformance was led by strong results from Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Online, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Zynga's mobile portfolio. Broadly speaking, the macroeconomic environment remained relatively consistent with what we experienced throughout the third quarter holiday season. While consumers continue to exercise restraint with their purchasing behaviors they prioritize blockbuster franchises and titles that offered great value.\nAs a result, our vast catalog of proven high-quality titles achieved strong results. As part of our ongoing portfolio management measures, we made the decision to cancel several unannounced titles in development, which we believe will enable us to tighten our focus and reallocate resources to projects for which our creative teams have higher levels of conviction expectations of success. Excluding the associated write-offs, our fourth quarter and full year management earnings results were above the high end of our guidance. We manage our pipeline actively, sometimes making difficult decisions to ensure that we're meeting our creative standards and achieving financial returns that are consistent with the goals of our company. We believe that an evolving robust pipeline is an essential part of our long-term strategy to expand, enhance and diversify our portfolio to grow our player base and to launch a multitude of new hit franchises across an array of platforms and business models.\nTurning to the performance of our titles for the period. Grand Theft Auto V exceeded our expectations, and to date, the title has sold in more than 180 million units worldwide. As hardware supply constraints receded, Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online adoption on the latest generation of platforms continue to grow. For the first 3 weeks of Grand Theft Auto Online's Holiday update, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S consoles grew to 14% of its audience penetration and 25% of its revenue penetration, up from 11% and 20%, respectively, versus last summer's content update for the comparable period.\nDuring the period, Rockstar Games continue to support the passionate global Grand Theft Auto online community with an array of new content offerings, including the last dose and Epic Finale at the Los Santos Drug Wars update as well as the [ Rollic Gun van Taximissions ], a new 50 car garage, new vehicles, closed, weapons, modes and much more. Los Santos Drug Wars introduced a phased approach to delivering high-value content, creating a much longer tail of sustained engagement in net bookings than we've seen with previous content updates. Additionally, GTA plus Rockstar's premium membership program continues to perform well, driven by a positive response to monthly events since the launch of Los Santos Drug Wars.\nRed Dead Redemption 2 outperformed our plans and to date, the title has sold in more than 53 million units worldwide. We're also pleased with the continued engagement of players we've Red Dead Online as demonstrated by its 10% year-on-year increase in new online players on all platforms. NBA 2K23 continues to grow its audience with the title selling in over 11 million units to date, a record for the series at this stage and achieving its highest ever virtual currency sales. In addition, engagement with NBA 2K23 remained incredibly strong, with approximately 2.3 million daily active users, including growth in the city, my career and my team users. NBA 2K23 arcade addition continues to bring the best basketball experience to mobile devices and has maintained its #1 position on Apple arcade.\nBuilding upon visual concepts resounding success and reinvigorating our WWE franchise last year, WWE 2K23 enjoys the highest metacritic review score average in the history of the series, engagement with the game has been outstanding, players logging nearly 8 million hours of gameplay and facing off of more than 100 million matches. [ 22K ] is supporting the title with a series of add-on content that can be purchased individually or as part of the season pass. We value deeply our relationship with the WWE and look forward to continuing and expanding upon our successful partnership in the years to come. Private Division and Intercept Games launched Kerbal Space Program 2 in early access for PC on Steam, Epic Games Store and other storefronts. Our teams are encouraged by the incoming player feedback and we've already implemented several updates with more on the way as development continues.\nLast week, Private Division announced a partnership with [ Entre ] to publish their upcoming new action at [ Vetri ], which is one of Private Division's most ambitious projects to date. In addition, Private Division and the Roll 7 Studio were recently honored with 2 prestigious industry awards, the [ Vasta ] for Best British game for [ Rolidrom ] and best sports game at Dice for [ Aliali ] world. Zynga's mobile business had a strong finish to the year in app purchases were above our expectations. Momentum has continued and we were pleased to experience strong demand over the Easter holiday. Efforts to increase our advertising business are tracking well with ad revenue growing quarter-over-quarter and accounting for approximately 27% of Zynga's net bookings. Our teams are successfully increasing advertising supply in our games, investing in optimization and implementing new ad products, which are helping us monetize a much broader cohort of users.\nOur direct-to-consumer efforts are tracking well with numerous titles currently in our platforms and plants for nearly all mobile games across our labels to leverage our highly profitable proprietary distribution channel over the next few years. A few highlights of Zynga's offerings during the period include a Empires & Puzzles, Zynga's highest grosing title drove engagement through its new in-game event, Season Of Love. Zynga's social casino portfolio had its best quarter in nearly 2 years, driven by record performance from Game of Thrones Slots Casino and strong overall results from Zynga Poker, [ Hetterich ] and Wizard of Oz Slots. Top 11 had a robust quarter and launched its proven ground England mini game update in February, which challenged players to recreate the greatest moments in the English football history. The new rate pass from CSR Racing 2 continue to drive player engagement, retention and monetization with innovative new profile manners for players to collect. We remain quite pleased with our hyper casual mobile business. Popcore achieved strong results during its first full quarter under our ownership.\nAdditionally, Rollic has increased its profitability and the studio celebrated several milestones during the period, including the first anniversary of title [ FilteFridge ] as social media inspired pressure washing run, reaching the #1 most downloaded spot in Apple's U.S. App Store.\nIn closing, as we continue to pursue our mission to be the most creative, the most innovative and the most efficient entertainment company in the world, we do so incredibly well positioned with a broader portfolio of owned intellectual property, a deeper pool of the industry's top creative talent, and the sound infrastructure to capitalize on the vast opportunities on the horizon. As we execute on our strategy, we believe that we can increase meaningfully our scale and prominence within the industry, grow margins and achieved record-breaking operating results for fiscal 2025 and beyond.\nI'll now turn the call over.\n\nKarl Slatoff\n\nPresident, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Strauss. I'd like to thank our colleagues around the world for delivering another momentous year for Take-Two. Our integration with Zynga has gone incredibly well, and we continue to release many of the industry's highest quality, most engaging entertainment experiences, thanks to the incredible passion and talent of our teams. We are extremely excited about our release pipeline, which includes approximately 52 titles through fiscal 2026. Our revised plan reflects several title cancellations as well as the reclassification of our mobile games to include only those titles currently in our plans for worldwide launch. For fiscal 2024, our pipeline includes 16 planned releases. We expect to deliver 3 immersive core offerings. This includes NBA 2K24 and WWE 2K24, our genre defining sports titles developed by Visual Concepts.\nAdditionally, we expect to release an eagerly anticipated new IP from one of our premier studios later this fiscal year. We plan to release 2 mid-core arcade titles, which includes LEGO 2K Drive, the ultimate driving adventure game from 2K and Visual Concepts. LEGO 2K Drive brings the iconic LeGalplay experience into a vast open world where players of all ages can go any vehicle, drive anywhere and become a LEGO racing legend. LEGO 2K Drive is the first release in a multi-title partnership between 2K and the LEGO Group. We are confident that 2K's proven expertise in creating high-quality and engaging interactive entertainment properties combined with the LEGO Group's unprecedented cultural reach, will evolve the iconic legal games experience that fans love in exciting new ways.\nWe also plan to launch 2 new iterations of previously released titles and 3 independent titles, including private divisions planned May 23 release of After Us from Piccolo Studios. Players of After Us will navigate stunning environments in a surrealistic world to salvage the souls of extinct animals and restore life on Earth. And lastly, we expect to release 6 mobile titles during the year, including Zynga's Star Wars Hunters, which offers players the opportunity to join the greatest hunters from across the Star Wars Galaxy. Players will engage in thrilling third-person combat in a range of competitive game modes across battlegrounds steady both the iconic worlds of Star Wars.\nThroughout the year, our hypercasual studios will release the steady cadence of mobile titles, focusing on games that have the potential for enhanced retention rates and a mix of in-app purchases and advertising to drive higher modernization and profitability. Our labels will also continue to provide new content and experiences that drive engagement and recurrent consumer spending across many of our hit franchises, including Grand Theft Auto Online, Red Dead Online, WWE 2K, LEGO 2K Drive, PGA Tort 2K and throughout Zynga's mobile portfolio.\nLooking ahead, we currently expect to deliver 36 titles throughout fiscal 2025 and 2026. As always, these plants are a snapshot of our current development pipeline. It is likely that some of these titles will not be developed through completion, that launch timing may change and that we will also add new titles to our slate. Our release slate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 includes 14 immersive core releases, 6 of which are sports simulation games, 2 mid-core games, one of which will be sports-oriented, 4 new iterations of previously released titles, 4 independent titles from Private Division, 2 of which include our previously announced partnerships with [ Wetter ] workshop and Game break and 12 mobile games.\nIn addition to our full game releases, we will continue to offer post-launch content for nearly all of our titles, including virtual currency, DLC packs and season passes. Given the strength of our upcoming release schedule and the high degree of visibility we have into our pipeline, we believe that we'll achieve the record levels of results that Strauss mentioned. Including over $8 billion in net bookings and over $1 billion in adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow in fiscal 2025 with further growth in fiscal 2026 and beyond. As we approach the significant inflection point in our business, we believe our expanding scale and margins will generate industry-leading returns for our shareholders.\nI'll now turn the call over to Lainie.\n\nLainie Goldstein\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss the key highlights from our fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 before reviewing our financial outlook for the full year and first quarter of fiscal 2024. Please note that our results include our combination with Zinga, which affects the comparability of our results relative to last year. Additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. I'm so proud of our team for their strong execution and unwavering focus throughout the year. We made fantastic progress on our integration with Zynga delivered incredible high-quality content and announced several exciting new games from our pipeline. Efficiency was also a major area of focus. We announced our cost reduction program in February, and as part of our ongoing portfolio management process, we canceled several titles that we anticipated would not meet our internal hurdle rates. We are confident that all these steps will help grow our scale, enhance our long-term margin structure and ultimately deliver sustainable returns for our stakeholders.\nAs Strauss mentioned, we finished fiscal 2023 with momentum and delivered fourth quarter net bookings of $1.39 billion, which was above our guidance range of $1.31 billion to $1.36 billion. This reflected better-than-expected results from Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Zynga's mobile portfolio. During the period, recurring consumer spending growth 115%, which was above our outlook of 105%. Growth and accounted for 78% of net bookings. The outperformance was primarily driven by Zynga and Grand Theft Auto Online. Digitally delivered net bookings increased 76%, above our guidance of 70% growth and accounted for 97% of the total.\nDuring the quarter, 78% of console game sales were delivered digitally, up from 75% last year. GAAP net revenue increased 56% to $1.45 billion, and cost of revenue increased 207% to $1.22 billion which included impairment charges of $465 million related to intangible assets acquired from Zynga, reflecting forecast changes for a few titles and $54 million relating to capitalized software and development costs for unreleased and canceled console and PC title, a lot of which was included in our management results. Operating expenses increased by 130% to $926 million, which primarily reflected the addition of Zynga, which is partially offset by lower marketing expenses. And GAAP net loss was $610 million or $3.62 per share, which includes $302 million of amortization of acquired intangibles and $45 million of business acquisition costs. Excluding the $54 million impairment charge, our management earnings would have been above the high end of our guidance range.\nTurning to our fiscal 2023 results. Total net bookings were $5.28 billion, which was above our guidance of $5.2 billion to $5.25 billion. While the challenging macroeconomic backdrop affected certain components of our portfolio, we experienced favorable performance within our catalog of industry-leading intellectual properties and Zynga a strong finish to the year. Recurrent consumer spending increased 88%, which was slightly above our outlook of 85% growth and accounted for 78% of net bookings. Digitally delivered net bookings increased 63%, which was also above our guidance of 60% growth and accounted for 95% of the total. And during the year, 74% of our console game shelf were delivered digitally, up from 68% last year. Non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow was $56 million as compared to our outlook of over $400 million. During fiscal 2023, we spent $204 million on capital expenditures.\nAt fiscal year end, we had cash and short-term investments of approximately $1 billion and debt of $3.1 billion. GAAP net revenue grew 53% to $5.35 billion in cost of revenue income 100% to $3.1 billion, which included impairment charges of $465 million related to intangible assets acquired from Zynga and $79 million related to capitalized software and development costs for unreleased and canceled titles, the latter of which was included in our management results.\nOperating expenses increased by 131% to $3.45 billion, which primarily reflected the addition of Zynga as well as higher personnel, stock compensation and IT expenses. And GAAP net loss was $1.12 billion or $7.03 per share, which includes $1.04 billion of amortization of acquired intangibles and $270 million of business acquisition costs. Today, we provided our initial outlook for fiscal 2024. We project net bookings to range from $5.45 billion to $5.55 billion. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, and Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V our hyper cash flow mobile portfolio, Empires & Puzzles, [ the Blast ], Words with Friends, Merge Dragon, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and Zynga Poker.\nWe expect the net bookings breakdown from our label to be roughly 53% Zynga, 31% 2K, 15% Rockstar Games and 1% other. And we forecast our geographic net booking site about 57% in United States and 33% international. We saw recurrent consumer spending to be up approximately 5% compared to fiscal 2023 and represents 79% of net bookings. Our forecast assumes a 76% of console game sales will be delivered digitally. [ Brexit ] generates approximately $100 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow, and we plan to deploy approximately [ $180 ] million for capital expenditures. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $5.37 billion to $5.47 billion and cost of revenue to range from $2.51 billion to $2.54 billion.\nOur total operating expenses are expected to range from $3.39 billion to $3.41 billion as compared to $3.45 billion last year. At the midpoint, this represents a 1% reduction, reflecting lower acquisition costs, the realization of synergies from our combination with Zynga and savings from our cost reduction program, which are partly offset by a full year of Zynga, higher stock compensation and personnel expenses driven by the annualization of new hires and the effects of inflation on other business operating expenses primarily reflected in IT costs.\nWe expect the GAAP net loss ranging from $477 million to $518 million or $2.80 to $3.05 per share, which assumes a basic share count of 170.1 million shares. For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 18% throughout fiscal 2024. I'd like to acknowledge that our current forecast for fiscal 2024 reflects the continuation of the challenging economic environment as well as an extension of the development time lines for several high-profile and long-awaited titles. While this affects our expectations for our current fiscal year, our high degree of visibility into our pipeline gives us confidence that we are approaching a significant inflection point in our business where we will achieve new record levels of results for our business next year and beyond.\nNow moving on to our guidance for the fiscal first quarter. We project net bookings to range from $1.15 billion to $1.2 billion, which reflects the full quarter of Zynga compared to $1 billion in the first quarter last year. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online, Grand Theft Auto V, a hyper-casual mobile portfolio, Empires & Puzzles, [ Tumblast ], Merge Dragon, [ Worth's Friends ], Zynga Poker, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online. We project recurrent consumer spending to increase by 35%. Our forecast assumes that 79% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from slightly from 77% in the same period last year. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $1.21 billion to $1.26 billion and cost of revenue to range from $572 million to $592 million.\nOperating expenses are expected to range from $827 million to $837 million. At the midpoint, this represents an 18% increase over last year, which reflects the full quarter of Zynga and higher stock compensation, personnel and IT expenses based on the factors I mentioned previously. And GAAP net loss is expected to range from $161 million to $178 million, or $0.95 to $1.05 per share, which assumes a basic share count of 169.4 million shares. [indiscernible], we believe that we are very well positioned in our industry to deliver the highest quality content, gain market share and enhance our profitability as we grow our scale and maintain our focus on efficiency. We're extremely excited about our next chapter of growth, and we look forward to our label, sharing more detail about the many exciting projects we have underway. Thank you.\nI'll now turn the call back to Strauss.\n\nStrauss H. Zelnick\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nThank you, Karl, and Lainie, and thank you to all of our colleagues for your dedication, your hard work and these terrific results.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Nicole Shevins, Senior Vice President of IR and Corporate Communications. Thank you, Nicole. You may begin.\n\nNicole B. Shevins\n\nSVP of IR & Corporate Communications, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 ended December 31, 2022. Today's call will be led by Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Karl Slatoff, our President; and Lainie Goldstein, our Chief Financial Officer. We will be available to answer your questions during the Q&A session following our prepared remarks.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that statements made during this call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws.

Zelnick\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nicole. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. During the third quarter, we continued to execute on our ambition to create the highest quality, most engaging interactive entertainment franchises in the industry, to deliver them across an array of platforms and to captivate our global audiences. All of our new game releases and post-launch content have received significant critical acclaim, and we're pleased to have the highest catalog sales based on units sold in the Americas. The strength of our portfolio reflects the passion, vision, artistic acumen and hard work of our world-renowned development teams and studios, and we're immensely proud of our long-standing commitment to quality.\nNow notwithstanding our creative achievements, our third quarter net bookings of $1.38 billion were slightly below our prior guidance. We believe that as a result of macroeconomic conditions, consumers shifted holiday spending toward established blockbuster franchises and titles that were offered with pricing promotions. While our catalog benefited from this trend, it affected the performance of certain of our new releases and recurrent consumer spending for some of our console and PC games.\nDespite the current market, we believe that our long-term success will be driven by our consistent ability to create the best entertainment experiences, including sequels of our beloved franchises and the introduction of engaging new intellectual properties. Sales of Grand Theft Auto V exceeded our expectations during the holiday season. And to date, the title has sold in more than 175 million units.\nDuring the quarter, Rockstar Games released an array of new content for both Halloween and the holiday season as well as a new story-driven update Los Santos Drug Wars. The update launched in December and continues to deliver exciting new story and gameplay features to players across the winter season, including a new business, tax emissions and much more to come, which is continuous to drive stronger engagement with our player base.\nWe were also pleased with the performance of Red Dead Redemption 2, which outpaced our expectations driven by successful holiday promotions and a vest. To date, the title has sold in more than 50 million units. During the quarter, Rockstar Games continued to release new updates for Red Dead Online, including a new Halloween hardcore telegram mission and new call to arms locations for Halloween and the holidays. We remain incredibly pleased with the enduring quality of these entertainment experiences.\nGrand Theft Auto V was ranked #3 for units sold in the U.S. during calendar year 2022 on all platforms and was #2 overall for 2022 on Steam. Additionally, 2022 was GTA V's tenth consecutive year in the NPD top 5 for unit sales. Red Dead Redemption 2 also continues to resonate strongly with players, ranking as the #1 selling game on Steam for the quarter end ,#3 for 2022.\nNBA 2K23, which remains the #1 selling sports title in North America continues to expand its audience and to date has sold in over 8 million units. Full game sales for NBA 2K23 are up 3% year-over-year, and MyTeam users grew more than 50% over last year, as players enjoyed assembling the rosters of the NBA's all-time greatest stars to dominate the competition. In addition, NBA 2K23 Arcade edition remains the #1 game in Apple Arcade since its launch in October.\n2K and HB Studios supported PGA Tour 2k23 with a limited-edition holiday bundle that included NBA 2K23 and new content featuring branded gear from Barstool Sports, 100 Thieves and Dude Perfect. HB Studios will release more content and features, including the addition of Pebble Beach, cosplay functionality and ranked patch making. On December 2, 2K and Firaxis Games launched Marvel's Midnight Suns on Windows PC via Steam and Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S. The title launched a critical acclaim with BGC rating at a 5 out of 5, calling it a modern strategy classic.\nPC Gamer said it was completely brilliant, scoring at 88 out of 100 and Rock Paper Shotgun called it one of the best Superhero games. The title is being supported with a series of post-launch content that can be purchased individually or as part of the game seasons pass. During the quarter, Zynga's in-app purchases performed in line with our expectations, and we saw mobile trends improve from prior lows, particularly during the holiday season.\nThe label continued to experience strong engagement among its active players and we believe that we're maintaining our global market share. Our advertising business outpaced the broader industry as we continue to introduce new ad supply and products, optimize our networks to increase ad yields and roll out Chartboost throughout our inventory.\nA few key highlights of our mobile offerings during the quarter include Empires & Puzzles was a top performer due to strong seasonal content and Black Friday offerings. This is one of our first titles to leverage our direct-to-consumer platform for in-app purchases, which we believe can enhance significantly the margins for our mobile portfolio over the next few years. Rollic's Balls'n Ropes reached the #1 spot for most downloaded game in the U.S. in December, giving Rollic a total of 20 games that have reached the #1 or #2 spot in Apple's U.S. App Store.\nWe acquired Popcore, which offers a unique balance of hypercasual experiences that also prioritize long-term player retention rates. This strengthens our leadership among hypercasual publishers with respect to downloads in revenue. Following the acquisition, Popcore's game Tap Away reached the #1 spot for most downloaded game multiple times throughout the quarter in Apple's U.S. App Store.\nZynga's casino titles remained resilient with Game of Thrones Slots posting its best quarter ever. Top Eleven had a strong quarter, driven by various in-game updates celebrating the World Cup. CSR Racing 2 released Race Pass, which features innovative new rewards that are driving stronger retention and monetization. Our combination with Zynga remains highly accretive to our business. We remain committed to delivering our planned synergies, and we're well on our way to exceed our target of $100 million in annual cost savings within the first 2 years post close. During the quarter, recurrent consumer spending rose 117% and accounted for 78% of net bookings.\nTurning to our outlook. We're operating in an environment that is, in many ways, more challenging than we anticipated. And we're lowering our fiscal 2023 net bookings guidance to $5.2 billion to $5.25 billion to take this backdrop into account.\nTo be clear, I take personal responsibility for our revised downward guidance. We believe there's always more to achieve, particularly when we fall short of our expectations. We've embarked on a company-wide cost reduction program that will optimize our expense structure while also positioning us to deliver on our anticipated growth trajectory. We expect to achieve savings in excess of $50 million as a result of this initiative.\nOur balance sheet remains strong, allowing us to navigate these uncertain times with confidence. We've always managed our business for the long term as we achieve the powerful synergies from our combination with Zynga, release new titles from our robust multiyear pipeline and execute on our cost savings initiatives. We expect to deliver sequential growth and record performance over the next several years.\nOur business and creative teams have done a phenomenal job during these challenging times, and I'd like to thank all of our colleagues for their tireless work. I'd also like to thank our shareholders for their continued support. I look forward to sharing our progress with you on all of our key initiatives.\nI'll now turn the call over to Karl.\n\nKarl Slatoff\n\nPresident, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Strauss. As we focus on the remainder of the year and beyond, we remain steadfast in our commitment to providing the most captivating and engaging entertainment experiences for our audiences across all platforms and geographies. We believe this is the best strategy and path forward to achieving our goals, driving our expected long-term growth and bringing value to our shareholders.\nTurning to our upcoming releases. On February 24, Private Division and Intercept Games will launch Kerbal Space Program 2, its early access for PC on Steam, Epic Games Store and other storefronts. KSP 2 will bring an array of content for players to explore and the title promises to be the most visually impressive game in the franchise. Those that purchased KSP 2 in early access will help inform the future development of the game by providing feedback directly to its creators leading up to the full launch of the title.\nIn addition, Private Division has announced several new projects. After Us, a riveting exploration debenture game from Piccolo Studios is expected to launch this spring during fiscal 2024 for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S. Private Division announced a publishing partnership with Bluebird team to develop a new survival horror game, expected to launch after calendar 2024. And we unveiled our new Private Division development fund to support smaller independent teams with project financing and mentorship opportunities.\nOn March 17, 2K and Visual Concepts will release WWE 2K23 for PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC on Steam. In celebration of John Cena's 20th anniversary as a WWE superstar, the 16-time World Champions, record-setting philanthropist and WWE 2K23 Executive soundtrack producer will be featured on the cover of each addition of the game.\nIn addition, global music phenom, Bad Bunny, 2022's most streamed artist in the world will make his WWE 2K debut as a preorder bonus. Building upon the success of WWE 2K22, this year's installment features a unique take on the 2K showcase, the introduction of the fan-favorite war games matches and expansions to several marquee game modes. Fans can look forward to a deep roster of WWE Superstars and Legends, including Roman Reigns, American Nightmare Cody Rhodes, Ronda Rousey, Brock Lesner, Stone Cold Steve Austin, and more. 2K will support the game with an array of post-launch content and may be purchased individually or through a season pass.\nThroughout the balance of the fiscal year, Rockstar Games will continue to support Grand Theft Auto Online with additional content updates. And 2K and Firaxis Games will continue to release add-on content for Marvel's Midnight Suns and Sid Meier's Civilization VI: Leader Pass. In mobile, Zynga's Wallet studio will release a vast array of titles as they've done previously, while the labels of other studios remain at work on a variety of games, including several in soft launch that we expect to release in fiscal 2024. We will have more to share on our pipeline when we report our fourth quarter results in May.\nI'll now turn the call over to Lainie.\n\nLainie Goldstein\n\nCFO, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss the key highlights from our third quarter before reviewing our guidance for fiscal year 2023 and our fourth quarter. Please note that our third quarter results include our combination with Zynga, with respect to the comparability of our results relative to last year. Additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release.\nAs Strauss mentioned, we delivered net bookings of $1.38 billion, which was slightly below our prior guidance as consumers displayed more cautionary purchasing behaviors during the holiday season. As in prior periods of economic headwinds, full game sales from our catalog of industry-leading intellectual properties were relatively resilient. However, we felt pressure on some of our newer releases that are in earlier stages of building their player base, alongside softness in recurrent consumer spending.\nDuring the period, recurrent consumer spending rose 117% and accounted for 78% of net bookings. Zynga's in-app purchases performed in line with our revised expectations. However, this was offset by weakness in recurrent consumer spending for several of our console and PC games. Digitally-delivered net bookings increased 72% and accounted for 95% of the total. During the quarter, 69% of console game sales were delivered digitally, up from 63% last year.\nGAAP net revenue increased 56% to $1.41 billion, and cost of revenue increased 97% to $692 million. Operating expenses increased by 123% to $889 million, primarily driven by the addition of Zynga as well as higher marketing and stock-based compensation expenses. The GAAP net loss was $153 million, $0.91 per share, which was impacted by $302 million of amortization of acquired intangibles and $24 million of business acquisition costs.\nOur management tax rate for the third was 18% as compared to 16% in the prior year as a result of our combination with Zynga. We ended the quarter with over $1.1 billion of cash and short-term investments and paid down $200 million of revolver borrowings, reducing our debt to $3.1 billion.\nTurning to our guidance. I'll begin with our full fiscal year expectations. We now expect to deliver net bookings of $5.2 billion to $5.25 billion. Our forecast takes into account the current economic environment and consumer purchasing trends that we have been experiencing, which we expect to continue into the fourth quarter, including lower expectations for some of our recent game releases and softer recurrent consumer spending as well as the shift of an unannounced mobile title and a focus on enhanced profitability for our hyper casual business.\nThe largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Empires & Puzzles, Toon Blast, Rollic’s hypercasual mobile portfolio and Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Redemption Online.\nWe expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be 46% Zynga, 36% 2K, 17% Rockstar Games and 1% Private Division.\nWe forecast our geographic net bookings split to be about 65% United States and 35% international. We expect recurrent consumer spending to grow by approximately 85% and represents 77% of total net bookings. Our digitally delivered net workings are expected to grow by approximately 60% and represent 95% of the total. Our forecast assumes that 74% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 68% last year.\nWe expect to generate more than $400 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow, and we expect to deploy approximately $170 million for capital expenditures. Our GAAP net revenue to range from $5.24 billion to $5.29 billion and cost of revenue to range from $2.53 billion to $2.55 billion, which includes approximately $694 million of amortization of acquired intangibles.\nTotal operating expenses are expected to range from $3.4 billion to $3.41 billion as compared to $1.5 billion last year. This increase reflects the inclusion of Zynga, business acquisition costs and higher personnel compensation and marketing expenses, which we anticipate will be slightly offset by our expected cost synergies from our integration with Zynga.\nAs we've mentioned on prior calls, in light of the current backdrop, we have been evaluating cost savings opportunities that can structurally enhance our margin and make our company more efficient and nimble for the long term. After a comprehensive review, we now believe that we can deliver over $50 million of annual savings, which we will begin to execute on this quarter. Opportunities include personnel, processes, infrastructure and other areas, particularly in publishing and corporate function. This program is in addition to the over $100 million of annual cost synergies from our combination with Zynga and is not expected to impact the delivery of our robust multiyear pipeline. We expect the GAAP net loss ranging from $704 million to $721 million or $4.40 to $4.50 per share, which assumes the basic share count of 159.8 million shares. We expect our management tax rate to be 18% throughout the year.\nNow moving to our guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter. We project net bookings to range from $1.31 billion to $1.36 billion, compared to $846 million in the fourth quarter last year. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, and Empires & Puzzle, Toon Blast, Rollic's hypercasual mobile portfolio and WWE 2K23. We project recurrent consumer spending to grow approximately 105% and digitally delivered net book to increase approximately 70%.\nOur forecast assumes that 80% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 75% last year. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $1.34 billion to $1.39 billion and loss of revenues to range from $688 million to $708 million, which includes approximately $198 million of amortization of acquired intangibles.\nOperating expenses are expected to range from $871 million to $881 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 120% increase over last year. This increase reflects the inclusion of Zynga, business acquisition costs and higher marketing and personnel expenses, which we believe will be slightly offset by the realization of some of our anticipated cost synergies. And GAAP net loss is expected to range from $197 million to $214 million of $1.17 to $1.27 per share, which assumes a basic share count of 168 million shares.\nIn closing, while we are disappointed to have lowered our outlook for the year, we are highly confident in our long-term growth potential. We believe that the actions we are taking now will position us to deliver sequential growth and record performance over the next several years, which we anticipate will drive meaningful shareholder value.\nI'd like to thank all of our stakeholders again for their support. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss.\n\nStrauss H. Zelnick\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for their firm commitment to creativity, innovation and efficiency as we continue to navigate a challenging economic landscape. I'd also like to express our appreciation to our shareholders for their continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator?"

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn the conference over to our host, Nicole Shevins, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nNicole B. Shevins\n\nSVP of IR & Corporate Communications, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 ended September 30, 2022. Today's call will be led by Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Karl Slatoff, our President; and Lainie Goldstein, our Chief Financial Officer. We will be available to answer your questions during the Q&A session following our prepared remarks.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that statements made during this call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws.\nThese forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by information currently available to us. We have no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Actual operating results may vary significantly from these forward-looking statements based on a variety of factors. These important factors are described in our filings with the SEC, including the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q, including the risks summarized in the section entitled Risk Factors.\nI'd also like to note that, unless otherwise stated, all numbers we will be discussing today are GAAP and all comparisons are year-over-year. Additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release, including the items that our management uses internally to adjust our GAAP financial results in order to evaluate our operating performance.\nOur press release also contains a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure. In addition, we have posted to our website a slide deck that visually presents our results and financial outlook. Our press release and filings with the SEC may be obtained from our website at take2games.com. And now, I'll turn the call over to Strauss.\n\nStrauss H. Zelnick\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nicole. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we delivered another consecutive quarter of solid results with net bookings of $1.5 billion. We experienced healthy player engagement, driven by exciting new game releases, post-launch content updates and bold beats for many of our mobile offerings, even as consumers continue to navigate the effects of various macroeconomic and geopolitical factors.\nWe made excellent progress with our integration of Zynga, and we remain highly optimistic about the vast long-term growth potential for the mobile industry, which is expected to reach over $160 billion in gross bookings within the next 4 years. Some of our key achievements in the period include: we successfully reached our 100-day integration milestone at the end of August. Zynga's President, Frank Gibeau and his leadership team have evaluated our mobile portfolio, including existing games and titles in development, and they've identified numerous opportunities to enhance our performance.\nThese initiatives include reorganizing several teams, sharing development tools, resources and best practices across our mobile studios, conceptualizing new bold beats and leveraging Zynga's highly valuable publishing platform, which is now even stronger following the recent acquisition of Storemaven. We're also starting to expand our direct-to-consumer efforts more meaningfully across our mobile portfolio further to enhance profitability.\nWe remain committed to delivering $500 million of annual net bookings opportunities over time. The Zynga team has been working with our other labels to explore potential creative projects. As part of this process, we've identified certain underrepresented genres in our mobile portfolio that we believe we can pursue more aggressively over time. Our efforts to deliver cost synergies are tracking extremely well, and we're now confident that we can achieve over $100 million of annual savings within the first 2 years post close.\nI'd like to thank Frank, his leadership team and all of our new colleagues at Zynga once again for helping to make our combination happen so seamlessly. We're thrilled to have Zynga as part of our Take-Two family.\nTurning to our second quarter results. Our net bookings performance was within our guidance range, led by Grand Theft Auto V, which exceeded our expectations and to date has sold more than 170 million units worldwide. Starting July 26, Grand Theft Auto Online launched its latest major update, The Criminal Enterprises, introducing expanded gameplay across the criminal careers of executives, bikers, nightclub owners and gun-runners as well as the opportunity to work with federal agents to uncover a criminal conspiracy in the new Operation Paper Trail series of contact missions.\nThe update also featured a range of new vehicles and more, including the new Community Series, showcasing some of the most fun and unique experiences created by players across the globe. This major update also delivered a host of overall improvements to the gameplay experience, including increased payouts across a wide array of activities and several other player-requested features. The Criminal Enterprises was very well received, and we've seen millions of players engaging with significant new features such as the ability to run cell missions and private lobbies, new weapon wheel controls and more.\nIn addition, Rockstar Games GTA+ subscription service continues to grow its members who enjoy a rotation of numerous exclusive in-game benefits, including vehicles, upgrades and gear every month. On September 9, 2K and Visual Concepts successfully launched NBA 2K23 with the title earning an 80-plus Metacritic grading at launch and is receiving praise for raising the bar on the top-selling sports title in the U.S. To date, NBA 2K23 has sold in nearly 5 million units, alongside significant growth in virtual currency sales and a higher average selling price compared to NBA 2K22.\nPlayer engagement has been very strong with more than 2 million daily active users and 4% growth in average days played. We believe that NBA 2K23 will continue to grow its audience as the title provides a year-round experience for its fervent community of players throughout the world. I'd like to congratulate the teams of 2K and Visual Concepts for once again delivering such a stellar basketball experience.\nThe franchise's momentum extends beyond the core console experience, with NBA 2K22 Arcade Edition for Apple Arcade remaining the #1 game on the platform, and our recent launch of NBA 2K23 Arcade Edition offering many new features and improvements. Furthermore, NBA 2K Online continues to be the #1 PC online sports game in the country with nearly 59 million registered users.\nRed Dead Redemption 2 is continuing to impress, with sell-in of more than 46 million units worldwide to date and more active players in the second quarter than we've seen for the comparable period in previous years. 2K supported WWE 2K22 and Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, the final downloadable content packs for each title, which were made available individually and as part of the game's season passes.\nDuring the quarter, recurrent consumer spending rose 76% and accounted for 80% of net bookings. Zynga continues to experience strong engagement among its active players and we believe that we're maintaining our market share globally. Our mobile business delivered mid-teens growth in advertising bookings on a year-over-year basis, outperforming the broader industry. At the same time, in-app purchases continue to be under some pressure due to current macroeconomic conditions.\nSome key highlights of our mobile offerings during the quarter include: the Rollic business remained very strong and exceeded our plan. Notably, Rollic surpassed 2 billion lifetime downloads worldwide and have now launched 19 titles that have reached #1 or #2 most downloaded game position in the U.S. App Store. Several of Zynga's title-celebrated milestones, included the second anniversary of Harry Potter Puzzles & Spells, the tenth anniversary of Farmville and the 15th anniversary of Zynga Poker. Each of these anniversaries was supported with an array of in-game events and unique content offerings.\nZynga unveiled several high-profile brand integrations, including Social Point's partnership with AMC Networks' the Walking Dead and Dragon City and Monster Legends. CSR2's debut of Pagani's new multimillion dollar Utopia hypercar, and Game of Thrones Slots Casino launched a new in-game event, Week of the Dragon in conjunction with HBO's new hit fantasy series, House of the Dragon.\nTurning to our outlook. We now expect to deliver net bookings of $5.4 billion to $5.5 billion in fiscal 2023. Our reduced forecast reflects shifts in our pipeline, fluctuations in FX rates and a more cautious view of the current macroeconomic backdrop, particularly in mobile. Lainie will provide more detail on our outlook shortly. Despite these headwinds and their effect on our guidance for the year, we remain highly confident in our diverse and extensive development pipeline that we expect will deliver a sequential growth and record performance over the next several years.\nTake-Two has a proven strategy, a consistent track record of success, driven by our core tenets. We aspire to be the most creative, the most innovative and most efficient entertainment company in the world. As we strive to capitalize on the numerous opportunities ahead of us, we're committed to creating significant long-term value for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Karl.\n\nKarl Slatoff\n\nPresident, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nI'd like to begin by thanking our teams for delivering another strong quarter, which reflects our ability to captivate and engage audiences consistently by delivering the highest-quality entertainment experiences across all platforms. And I'll discuss our recent releases. On October 14, 2K and HB Studios launched PGA Tour 2K23, the latest entry in our golf simulation franchise, a positive community sentiment and great critical acclaim, including GameSpot coining the title the Best Simulation Golf Game Ever Made.\nPGA Tour 2K23 features golf icon and all-time sports great Tiger Woods, and celebrate his legacy by introducing him as both the playable in-game Pro and an Executive Director who advised the games development team. The game features several new additions and improvements, including an enhanced roster of male and female pros, the ability to play as NBA legends, Michael Jordan and Steph Curry, a top golf mode, a deeper array of personalization options and gear, license courses and the ability to design original courses and multiplayer offerings. HB Studios will continue to support the game with additional pros and courses as well as seasonal updates in the Club House pass.\nOn October 21, 2K and Gearbox Software released new tales from the Borderlands, a choice-based narrative adventure game that is a successor to the beloved Telltale Games title. The franchise has always been an incredible canvas for storytelling, and we are pleased to add this new offering to the portfolio.\nOn November 2, Private Division and Roll7 released Finding the Flowzone, the second and final DLC expansion for the critically acclaimed skateboarding action platform OlliOlli World. The release has received praise from critics, including Eurogamer, who commended Finding the Flowzone as a (inaudible) this magnificent game and stating that the expansion is completely rad.\nNow I will discuss our announced offering for the balance of fiscal 2023 and beyond. On December 2, 2K and Firaxis Games will launch Marvel's Midnight Suns on Windows PC, Xbox Series X and S and PlayStation 5. The Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch versions will follow at a later date. In support of the upcoming launch, 2K has produced 5 short videos that are being released weekly on Marvel Entertainment's YouTube channel, which provides the back story of how the game's lead character Lillis became the mother of demons and how superheroes like Blade, Magik, Ghostrider, and Nico Minoru came together to form the young core of the Midnight Suns. 2K will have more to share on the game in the coming weeks.\nDuring the fourth quarter, 2K and Visual Concepts will launch WWE 2K23. Building upon the success of 2K22, which had nearly 450 million matches played and 10 million hours of game content viewed on Twitch, fans can look forward to the series, once again, redefining interactive entertainment within the SquaredCircle. We are grateful to have such a supportive and collaborative partnership with WWE, and 2K will have more to share about WWE 2K23 in the coming months.\nOn February 24, Private Division and Intercept Games will launch Kerbal Space Program 2, the sequel to the beloved rocket building sim. An early access for PC on Steam, Epic Games Store and other digital storefronts. KSP2 will bring an array of content at the launch of early access, making this the most digitally impressive KSP game yet. The game will also feature improved tutorials and user onboarding to provide players with the necessary knowledge to excel at space flight. Built from the ground up, KSP2 will also introduce the ability to customize and paint vehicles, leading to deeper personalization and expression in every build. Those who purchased KSP2 and early access will help inform the future development of the game by providing feedback directly to Intercept Games leading up to the full launch of the title. We can't wait for the incredibly passionate KSP community to take flight in this new entry to the series.\nThroughout the balance of the fiscal year, Rockstar Games will continue to support Grand Theft Auto Online with additional major content updates alongside popular annual seasonal themed offerings and more. In mobile, Zynga's Wallet Studio will continue to release a consistent cadence of titles, while the labels of other studios remain hard at work on a variety of offerings, including several titles that are currently in soft launch and expected to release in fiscal year 2024.\nTurning to eSports. The NBA 2K League is currently gearing up for its sixth season, which will tip off in spring 2023. Last month, the League announced a landmark agreement with Australia's National Basketball League to launch an expansion team, NLB Oz Gaming. Not only is this the first time an Australian professional sports league has joined a global sports league but it also marks our third expansion team from outside of North America. We remain very excited about the continued growth and success of the NBA 2K League.\nIn closing, we believe that Take-Two is home to the best talent in our industry across all segments of interactive entertainment. With an expanding portfolio of the most exciting and commercially successful own intellectual property and the ability to deliver deeply engaging and captivating entertainment experiences to a broad array of audiences around the world, we believe that we are well positioned to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Lainie.\n\nLainie Goldstein\n\nCFO, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss the key highlights from our second quarter before reviewing our guidance for fiscal year 2023 and our third quarter. Please note that our second quarter results include our combination with Zynga, which affects the comparability of our results relative to last year. Additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release.\nAs Strauss mentioned, our combination with Zynga is tracking very well, from the progress we are making against our integration milestones with the net bookings and cost synergy realization that we are working towards and our highly complementary company cultures. We have great confidence that over the long term, our portfolio is poised to benefit from the significant expected growth in mobile gaming, evolving player dynamics towards more immersive mobile content and our massive combined scale, which will enable our teams to cross-promote titles and build stronger tools to connect with new users.\nDuring the quarter, we identified additional cost savings opportunities, and we now feel confident that we can deliver over $100 million of annual synergies within the first 2 years post close. We're also evaluating other efficiencies across our core businesses while ensuring that we have the appropriate resources to deliver on our significant growth prospects.\nOur second quarter results were solid and we delivered net bookings of $1.5 billion, which was within our prior guidance range. Movement in foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected our net bookings by approximately 1%. With consumers navigating ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, we believe that our financial performance truly demonstrates the incredible quality of our games and the significant value that our interactive entertainment experiences provide to our players.\nDuring the period, recurrent consumer spending rose 76% and accounted for 80% of net bookings. NBA 2K and Rollic's hyper-casual mobile portfolio outperformed our plans, while we experienced some softness across other parts of our portfolio as the interactive entertainment industry faced continued headwinds. Digitally delivered net bookings increased 62% and accounted for 94% of the total. During the quarter, 73% of console game sales were delivered digitally, up from 65% last year. GAAP net revenue increased 62% to $1.4 billion, and cost of revenue increased 56% to $714 million.\nOperating expenses increased by 144% to $932 million, primarily driven by the addition of Zynga, business acquisition and higher personnel costs, which was partly offset by lower console and PC marketing expenses. And GAAP net loss was $257 million or $1.54 per share, which was impacted by $320 million of amortization of acquired intangibles and $37 million of business acquisition costs. Our management tax rate for the third was 18% as compared to 16% in the prior year as a result of our combination with Zynga. We ended the quarter with over $1.3 billion of cash and short-term investments and $3.3 billion of debt.\nTurning to our guidance, I'll begin with our full fiscal year expectations. As Strauss mentioned, we are revising our guidance. We now expect to deliver net bookings of $5.4 billion to $5.5 billion. Approximately 70% of the downward revision reflects lower expectations for our mobile business and shifts in our release slate, while the balance reflects an updated view for the rest of our portfolio based on current business trends across the interactive entertainment industry. Our guidance reflects $50 million of FX headwinds.\nThe largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Empires & Puzzles, Rod's hypercasual mobile portfolio, Toon Blast and Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be 45% Zynga, which includes our former Take-Two mobile titles, 36% 2K, 18% Rockstar Games and 1% Private Division. We forecast our geographic net booking split to be about 60% United States and 40% international.\nWe now expect recurrent consumer spending to grow by approximately 90% and represent 77% of total net bookings. Our digitally delivered net bookings are expected to grow by approximately 70% and represent 96% of the total. Our forecast assumes that 75% of actual game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 68% last year. We expect to generate more than $650 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow. And we're expected to deploy approximately $150 million for capital expenditures.\nWe expect GAAP net revenue to range from $5.41 billion to $5.51 billion and cost of revenue to range from $2.61 billion to $2.64 billion, which includes approximately $694 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Total operating expenses are expected to range from $3.4 billion to $3.42 billion as compared to $1.5 billion last year. This increase reflects the inclusion of Zynga, business acquisition costs and higher personnel, marketing and IT expenses, which we anticipate will be slightly offset by our expected cost synergies.\nIn light of the current economic backdrop, we continue to monitor our costs prudently to find potential areas of savings this year while being mindful of the resources we need to support a robust multiyear release schedule. And we expect the GAAP net loss ranging from $631 million to $674 million or $3.95 to $4.22 per share, which assumes a basic share count of 159.8 million shares. Our revised forecast includes an increase in amortization for intangible assets acquired from Zynga based on updated valuation estimates. We expect (inaudible) to be 18% throughout the year.\nNow moving to our guidance for the fiscal third quarter. We project net bookings to range from $1.41 billion to $1.46 billion compared to $866 million in the third quarter last year. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Empires & Puzzles, Rock's hyper casual mobile portfolio and Toon Blast. We project recurrent consumer spending to grow approximately 125% and digitally delivered net bookings to increase approximately 80%.\nOur forecast assumes that 72% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 63% last year. We expect GAAP net revenue to range $1.43 billion to $1.48 billion and cost of revenue to range from $690 million to $710 million, which includes approximately $198 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Operating expenses are expected to range from $897 million to $907 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 126% increase over last year. This increase reflects the inclusion of Zynga, business acquisition costs and higher marketing, which we believe will be slightly offset by the realization of some of our anticipated cost synergies and cost-saving efforts. And GAAP net loss is expected to range from $142 million to $160 million or $0.85 to $0.95 per share, which assumes a basic share count of 167.7 million shares.\nIn closing, we continue to focus on our execution against an uncertain economic backdrop, and we are highly optimistic about our future growth trajectory. Our long-term development pipeline is stronger than ever, and we're excited to deliver a high profile of sequels and engaging new properties that have the potential to enhance our financial profile even further.\nAt the same time, we are confident in our ability to create significant shareholder value as we continue our integration of Zynga by collaborating on new creative projects, leveraging our combined scale, unlocking greater potential from the mobile platform and entering new business models and geographies. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss.\n\nStrauss H. Zelnick\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for delivering another solid quarter. And to our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support.

Zelnick\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nicole. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that fiscal 2023 is off to a great start, highlighted by first quarter net bookings of $1 billion. Our performance demonstrates the quality of our games and our ability to engage audiences across the globe despite the impacts of various macroeconomic and geopolitical factors.\nThis has been a milestone period in the history of our company as we closed our combination with Zynga. This transaction firmly establishes Take-Two's position as one of the largest pure-play interactive entertainment companies in the world. We're home to the industry's top creative talent, and we own and control an exceptional, diverse portfolio of intellectual properties encompassing all key platforms and genres.\nWe're exceedingly optimistic about the long-term growth potential for the mobile industry as well as our ability to create greater shareholder value as a combined entity. Over the past few months, we've made significant progress in our integration efforts. Zynga, which is being run by the label's President, Frank Gibeau, established its ongoing leadership structure. Alongside Frank, we're fortunate to have numerous proven senior executives who will be instrumental in overseeing Zynga's day-to-day operations and taking our combined mobile business to the next level of success.\nThe integration of our corporate functions and systems has been tracking well, and we're pleased that our day 1 plans were executed seamlessly with no disruptions to our business operations or player communities. While it's still early, we're confident that we can realize $100 million of annual cost synergies within 2 years post-close, and we're exploring additional areas of efficiencies. Our creative teams are in active discussions about potential projects, and we remain committed to delivering over $500 million of annual net bookings opportunities over time.\nThere are several meaningful drivers in mobile that we believe our teams can begin to activate this fiscal year, including implementing new bold beats driven by new content and other live service enhancements, user acquisition optimization, creating a centralized library for development technologies and tools, enhancing the monetization of in-game advertising, and continuing to invest in our ad tech platform with Chartboost.\nOver the intermediate and long term, our vision is to introduce mobile games for some of our most popular and proven intellectual properties that have the potential to be greatly additive to our financial profile. We've observed positive signs that some mobile players are looking for more sophisticated and immersive content, and we look forward to participating in this trend that should continue for the foreseeable future. We also see a tremendous opportunity to establish more meaningful presence in key mobile-first emerging markets.\nTurning to our first quarter results on a pre-combination basis. Our net bookings of $731 million were within our previously stated outlook range led by the outperformance of NBA 2K22 and WWE 2K22. Zynga's offerings complemented our results significantly for the period. NBA 2K22 continued to dominate as the industry's leading basketball game with sell-in of over 12 million units to date, exceeding the series sell-in from the prior year. During the first quarter, engagement with the title remained strong with average games played per user increasing 16% year-over-year.\nIn addition, NBA 2K22 arcade addition remains the #1 game in Apple Arcade since its launch in October 2021 and downloads of NBA 2K Mobile remained robust driven by the Courtside Pass updates and content surrounding the NBA playoffs and finals. Our partnership with the NBA remains incredibly strong, and we look forward to the launch of NBA 2K23 in September.\nThroughout the first quarter, 2K and Visual Concepts released a series of DLC packs to support WWE 2K22, which brought even more fan favorite superstars into the ring for what has been hailed by critics and consumers alike as our best WWE offering in the series. Engagement with the title has been outstanding, with more than 330 million in-game matches played and over 8.5 million hours of WWE 2K22 content viewed on Twitch. We greatly value our partnership with the WWE, and we're thrilled about the long-term opportunity to grow the franchise further together.\nRockstar Games capitalized on the momentum from last quarter's releases of Grand Theft Auto V for PlayStation 5 and Xbox series X and S, Grand Theft Auto Online standalone and the launch of GTA+ as the experience continues to captivate players. Latest generation console players of Grand Theft Auto Online grew over 40% this quarter and are monetizing at a rate 36% higher than players in the previous generation. GTA+, the premium membership available exclusively on those consoles, has seen consistent growth since launch. The GTA Online community remains strong and its audience size is operating in the new normal that is 49% higher than the pre-pandemic first quarter of fiscal 2020.\nSales of Grand Theft Auto V also remained strong. And to date, the title has sold-in nearly 170 million units. With development of the next entry in the Grand Theft Auto series well underway, the Rockstar Games team is determined once again to set creative benchmarks for the series, our industry and for all entertainment just as the label has done with every one of their frontline releases.\nWe were also pleased with the performance of Red Dead Redemption 2, which continues to expand its audience and to date, has sold-in more than 45 million units worldwide. Tiny Tina's Wonderlands exceeded our expectations and continued to sustain healthy player engagement due in part to its robust post-launch content, which will continue throughout the fiscal year. The title has resonated with core fans and new audiences with nearly 40% of players having never before played a Borderlands title. Additionally, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands launched on Steam in June alongside its previously released DLC offerings.\nAlso in June, 2K and Supermassive Games launched The Quarry, an all-new horror narrative game, where every choice, big or small, shapes your story and determines who lives to tell the tale. The title launched to strong reviews with NPR declaring it this summer's best horror game and Variety calling at every horror fan's dream video game.\nAnd Private Division released Void Riders, the first expansion for their critically acclaimed skateboarding action titled OlliOlli World from Roll 7. The expansion earned an 87 on OpenCritic, which was even higher than the base game's excellent review scores. Private Division will share more details regarding the game's second expansion later this year.\nRecurrent consumer spending rose 48% and accounted for 73% of net bookings. This was significantly above our prior guidance due to the inclusion of Zynga for part of the quarter, which was not included previously as well as outperformance from our core portfolio.\nDuring the period, Zynga continued to experience strength in player engagement and retention, and we believe that we're maintaining our healthy market share on a global basis. Additionally, we delivered significant growth in advertising net bookings, which was offset by some pressure on in-app purchases due to current macroeconomic conditions and seasonality.\nSome key highlights of our mobile offerings during the quarter include Harry Potter: Puzzles & Spells featured an in-game event to celebrate the cinematic release of Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore. Empires & Puzzles introduced the game's fifth season, Dynasty of Dunes. Zynga Poker released the Omaha update giving players a new way to enjoy the popular game. Words with Friends introduced Clubs, a new feature that expands the game's social experience by offering shared spaces that players can enjoy together. Rollic launched 11 games in the quarter and Colors Runners! reached the #1 top-free downloaded games position in the U.S. App Store in June.\nTurning to our outlook. We now expect to deliver net bookings of $5.8 billion to $5.9 billion, which includes Zynga for part of the year. Our pipeline for the year continues to look very strong, and we're excited to expand significantly our mobile presence with a best-in-class platform. Our new forecast also takes into account some movement in our release slate for the year, foreign currency pressures and macroeconomic uncertainty. Lainie will provide more detail shortly.\nLooking ahead, our long-term vision is clearer than ever, and we believe that our combination with Zynga will enable us to capitalize better on the evolving dynamics of the interactive entertainment industry. As we deliver our expansive, diverse pipeline and pursue the vast opportunities that we've identified through our combination with Zynga, we see a path to engage even greater audiences around the world, grow our scale and enhance our margins.\nI'll now turn the call over to Karl.\n\nKarl Slatoff\n\nPresident, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Strauss. I'd like to begin by thanking our teams for a great start to the year driven by their tireless passion, creativity and commitment to deliver the best entertainment experiences in the world. I'll now discuss our recent releases.\nOn July 7, 2K and Supermassive Games launched an update to the popular horror experience, The Quarry, which introduced several new features, including Wolf Pack, a new online multiplayer mode where the host can invite other players to help shape the story as a collaborative group. In addition, all 6 episodes of the Bizarre Yet Bonafide podcast featured in The Quarry are now available in-game and in their entirety. The podcast, which was previously available only on select streaming platforms, follows 2 fictional paranormal investigators as they delve into the troubling secrets of The Quarry.\nOn July 19, 2K and Visual Concepts released the fifth and final DLC pack for WWE 2K22 entitled The Whole Dam Pack. The update features pop culture icon, Machine Gun Kelly; social media megastar, Logan Paul; and high-flying, hard-hitting WWE Hall of Famer, Rob Van Dam, alongside franchise debuts from LA Knight, Xia Li, Commander Azeez and Sarray. We are very proud to have delivered such a stellar WWE offering this year and to support the title with our fans' most beloved superstars.\nOn July 26, Rockstar Games continued to grow and evolve the world of Grand Theft Auto Online across all platforms with the launch of the Criminal Enterprises, a sweeping update, bringing new business prospects for criminal careers plus new elaborate Contact Missions, auto showrooms to test drive and purchase vehicles, and many other upgrades rolling out all summer long. The update also delivers highly requested experience improvements as well as increased payouts across a range of game play, offering players more choices and freedom as they climb their way up the criminal ranks.\nWe remain incredibly excited about our pipeline for fiscal 2023 and beyond. On August 16, Private Division and Roll 7 will release Rollerdrome, a brand-new, third-person single-player shooter. This stylish high-octane game combines adrenaline-fueled skate stunts with intense combat in a retro-futuristic world. The title will be available on Steam and for PlayStation Plus members for an introductory price just under $20, after which it will retail for $29.99. Additionally, PlayStation Plus premium members will be able to play a free trial of the game when it launches.\nOn September 9, 2K and Visual Concepts will launch NBA 2K23, the next offering from our industry-leading NBA series. Phoenix Suns' shooting guard, 3-time NBA All-Star and 2021-'22 Kia All-NBA First Team selection, Devin Booker, is featured on this year's Standard Edition and cross-gen Digital Deluxe Edition. The iconic Michael Jordan appears on the cover of the NBA 2K23 Michael Jordan Edition and the brand-new NBA 2K23 Championship Edition, which retails for $149.99 and delivers incredible value by including a 12-month subscription to the NBA League Pass for the first time.\nIn the U.S. and Canada, players can purchase the WNBA Edition as a GameStop exclusive featuring Phoenix Mercury Superstar, Diana Taurasi, along with Seattle Storm legend, Sue Bird. 2K has partnered with Every Kid Sports to support greater representation of females in basketball with a $100,000 donation that will enable girls across the U.S. to participate in youth sports. 2K will reveal more details on NBA 2K23 in the coming weeks.\nWe've made the decision to move back the launch timing of Marvel's Midnight Suns to ensure the teams at Firaxis Games and 2K deliver the best possible experience for our fans. The title will launch later this year on Windows PC, Xbox Series X and S and PlayStation 5. The Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch versions will follow at a later date.\nDuring the fourth quarter, Private Division and Intercept Games will launch Kerbal Space Program 2 on PC. The game's dedicated community can look forward to more information about the game and its new features from the title's ongoing gameplay reveal video series.\n2K's teams at Visual Concepts and HB Studios remain hard at work on their upcoming launches of WWE 2K23 and PGA TOUR 2K23. 2K will have more to share on these annual sports offering shortly.\nZynga has a handful of games that are currently in soft launch with more on the horizon, and we expect some of these titles will begin launching worldwide in our next fiscal year. This includes Star Wars Hunters, which is continuing to regularly roll out new content updates and features as it progresses through to a more mature phase of soft launch and strategic territories. At the same time, Rollic will continue to release a high volume of mobile titles as it has done previously.\nTurning to eSports. The NBA 2K League Championships tip off will take place in Indianapolis at the Pavilion at Pan Am with 3v3 play August 17 through the 20th and 5v5 play August 24 through the 27th. We remain excited about the continued success and growth of the NBA 2K League.\nIn closing, we believe that our company today is the strongest and most diverse it has ever been with approximately 11,000 of the industry's best and brightest talent and most exciting and commercially successful portfolio of owned intellectual property and the ability to deliver deeply captivating and engaging entertainment experiences on any platform anywhere in the world. We believe that we are well positioned to deliver long-term value for our shareholders.\nI'll now turn the call over to Lainie.\n\nLainie Goldstein\n\nCFO, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss the key highlights from our first quarter before reviewing our financial outlook for the fiscal year 2023 and second quarter. Please note that our first quarter results include Zynga's financial performance for 39 days of the quarter, which impacts the comparability of our results relative to last year as well as to our prior guidance, which did not include the contribution from Zynga.\nAlso, any references to Take-Two's pre-combination results are referring to our financial performance, excluding the acquired Zynga business. Additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release.\nAs Strauss mentioned, this was a momentous quarter for our organization as we closed our transaction with Zynga and made significant progress on our integration efforts. Our teams created detailed plans to realize at least $100 million of annual cost synergies. And we continue to expect approximately $50 million to be achieved within the first 12 months post-close.\nThe largest opportunities include reducing duplicative corporate overhead and contracts, consolidating systems, rationalizing our real estate footprint and leveraging Zynga's marketing functions across our other mobile titles. We are also exploring additional areas of efficiencies.\nAt the same time, we delivered strong first quarter results driven by net bookings of $1 billion. On a pre-combination basis, our net bookings were $731 million, which grew 3% compared to last year and was within our guidance range of $700 to $750 million.\nThe movement in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted our net bookings by approximately 1%. We were also pleased with Zynga's contribution for part of the quarter. With consumers today navigating various macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, we believe that our financial performance truly demonstrates the resiliency of our business model driven by the incredible quality of our games and the significant value that our interactive entertainment experiences provide our players.\nDuring the period, the current consumer spending rose 48% and accounted for 73% of net bookings. This is significantly above our prior guidance due to the inclusion of Zynga for part of the quarter as well as the outperformance of our pre-combination portfolio led by NBA 2K22, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands and Top Eleven.\nDigitally delivered net bookings increased 41% and accounted for 95% of the total. During the quarter, 77% of console games sales were delivered digitally, up from 73% last year. GAAP net revenue increased 36% to $1.1 billion and cost of revenue increased 32% to $436 million, which included a $20 million impairment charge related to our decision not to proceed with further development of a title from an unannounced new franchise.\nOperating expenses increased by 125% to $704 million primarily driven by the addition of Zynga and a full quarter of Nordeus, business acquisition costs, and higher personnel and marketing expenses. And our GAAP net loss was $104 million or $0.76 per share, which was largely impacted by $117 million of amortization of acquired intangibles and $165 million of business acquisition costs.\nOur GAAP net loss benefited from a reversal of expense of approximately $48 million related to forfeitures of the previously granted stock awards. In the first quarter last year, our GAAP net income was $152 million or $1.30 per share.\nOur management tax rate for the period was 18% as compared to 15% in the prior year as a result of our combination with Zynga. On a pre-combination basis, our management results, excluding the impact of the Zynga transaction, exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $0.06 despite the impairment charge taken during the quarter and the higher tax rate. We ended the quarter with over $1.3 billion of cash and short-term investments and $3.3 billion of debt.\nTurning to our guidance. I'll begin with our full fiscal year expectations. As Strauss mentioned, we are initiating new guidance that includes our combination with Zynga for approximately 10 months of our fiscal year. We now expect to deliver net bookings of $5.8 billion to $5.9 billion. Our assumptions take into consideration some shifts in our pipeline for the year as well as movement in foreign exchange rates and the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop.\nThe largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Empires & Puzzles, Rollic's hypercasual mobile portfolio, Toon Blast and Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online.\nWe expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be 45% Zynga, which includes the former T2 mobile titles, 37% 2K, 17% Rockstar Games and 1% Private Division. We forecast our geographic net bookings split to be about 60% United States and 40% international.\nWe now expect recurrent consumer spending to grow approximately 110% and represent 77% of total net bookings. Our digitally delivered net bookings are expected to grow by approximately 80% and represent 96% of net bookings. Our forecast assumes that 74% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 68% last year.\nWe expect to generate more than $700 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow, and we expect to deploy approximately $135 million for capital expenditures. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $5.73 billion to $5.83 billion and cost of revenue to range from $2.74 billion to $2.79 billion, which includes approximately $700 million of amortization of acquired intangibles.\nTotal operating expenses are expected to range from $3.37 billion to $3.38 billion as compared to $1.5 billion last year. This increase reflects the inclusion of Zynga, business acquisition costs and higher personnel, marketing and IT expenses, which is slightly offset by our anticipated cost synergies for the year. And we expect a GAAP net loss ranging from $398 million to $438 million or $2.50 to $2.75 per share, which assumes a basic share count of 159.2 million shares. We expect our management tax rate to be 18% throughout the year.\nNow moving to our guidance for the fiscal second quarter. We project net bookings to range from $1.5 billion to $1.55 billion compared to $985 million in the second quarter last year. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Empires & Puzzles, Rollic's hypercasual mobile portfolio and Toon Blast. We project recurrent consumer spending to grow approximately 85% and digitally delivered net bookings to increase 70%. Our forecast assumes that 73% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 65% last year.\nWe expect GAAP net revenue to range from $1.37 billion to $1.42 billion and cost of revenue to range from $700 million to $719 million, which includes approximately $200 million of amortization of acquired intangibles.\nOperating expenses are expected to range from $849 million to $859 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 125% increase over last year. This increase reflects the inclusion of Zynga and business acquisition costs as well as higher marketing and personnel expenses, which we believe will be slightly offset by the realization of some of our anticipated cost synergies. And GAAP net loss is expected to range from $144 million to $160 million or $0.86 to $0.96 per share, which assumes a basic share count of 166.4 million shares.\nIn closing, we had a great start to the year. We believe that our combination with Zynga will enhance our positioning as one of the top interactive entertainment companies in the world. As our teams continue to leverage the core competencies from Zynga's publishing platform, we believe that we will be able to engage our player base more deeply, add new dimensions to our existing portfolio, and deliver significant long-term growth and margin expansion for our shareholders.\nThank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss.\n\nStrauss H. Zelnick\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I would like to thank our colleagues for delivering an excellent start to the year. And to our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator?"

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Nicole Shevins, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. You may begin.\n\nNicole B. Shevins\n\nSVP of IR & Corporate Communications, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon.

Zelnick\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nicole. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today.\nOur strong fourth quarter results concluded another highly successful year for our company. We delivered net bookings of $3.4 billion, which reflect our creative team's unwavering commitment to quality and the ability to deliver captivating and engaging entertainment experiences that transcend geographies and generations.\nOn behalf of our management team, I'd like to thank all of our colleagues around the world for helping us to achieve these results, especially as we continue to navigate through the new normal following the pandemic.\nDuring the year, we positioned our organization strategically for long-term growth. To that end, we bolstered our creative teams by adding nearly 1,000 new developers, including through the acquisition of several talented studios which will help us expand our capabilities and support our growing pipeline of offerings. We broadened our portfolio further with the introduction of new intellectual properties and business models to drive player engagement.\nWe agreed upon our pending combination with Zynga, which will grow our audience significantly and increase exponentially our net bookings for mobile, the fastest-growing segment in interactive entertainment, while also providing us with substantial cost synergies and revenue opportunities. As we build our scale, we believe that we can grow our margins meaningfully.\nLastly, we advanced our ESG efforts, and I'm pleased that we recently published our first dedicated report, which includes information on our initiatives to date as well as our road map for the future.\nDuring the quarter, our newly released WWE 2K22 and Tiny Tina's Wonderlands outperformed our expectations, as did Red Dead Redemption 2. NBA 2K22 continued to grow its audience, with the title selling in over 10 million units to date and exceeding sell-in from the prior year.\nDuring the fourth quarter, engagement remained very strong with average active days of playing up 6% on average games per user, up 13% year-over-year. In addition, NBA 2K22 Arcade Edition continues to hold the #1 position on Apple Arcade's top game chart. And for the full year, downloads of NBA 2K Mobile increased nearly 25% as compared with fiscal 2021. We see a significant opportunity to add unique and innovative experiences throughout the game and focus on expanding our player base.\nOn March 11, 2K and Visual Concepts returned triumphantly to the Squared Circle with the eagerly anticipated release of WWE 2K22, which achieved the highest Metacritic scores on both Xbox and PlayStation platforms in franchise history. Setting new benchmarks for quality, the title offers more features and enhancements than any prior release in the series, including a redesigned gameplay engine, new controls, foundational improvements, upgraded visuals and an array of options requested by our passionate player base.\nNotably, WWE 2K22 sell-in for its first 4 weeks exceeded the levels achieved for both WWE 2K19 and WWE 2K20, even with the revised release window that was not during the holiday season. Consumer engagement with the title has been outstanding with over 140 million in-game matches played to date and over 5.6 million hours of WWE 2K22 content viewed on Twitch.\nI'd like to thank 2K and the WWE team of Visual Concepts for their commitment to reestablishing this incredible franchise. We greatly appreciate WWE's immense support in launching this year's game and look forward to continuing and building upon our successful partnership in the years to come.\nOn March 25, 2K and Gearbox Software released Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, an all-new fantasy-fueled offering that has taken our partnership with Gearbox to new creative heights and is viewed as the best new franchise launch from 2K in several years. The title has resonated with core fans and new audiences alike with nearly 30% of players having never before played a Borderland's title.\nTo date, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands has exceeded our expectations and is being supported with cross-play functionality, an array of post-launch content and a season pass. I'd like to congratulate 2K and Gearbox on delivering another stellar game, and we look forward to the possibilities for this new franchise in the years to come.\nDuring the fourth quarter, Rockstar Games expanded the reach of their iconic entertainment experience, Grand Theft Auto V, with the release of new versions of the game upgraded specifically for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S. This marked the third console generation for which the game has been made available since its initial launch in 2013. And to date, the title has sold in more than 165 million units.\nAlso for the first time ever, Grand Theft Auto Online was made available as a stand-alone title for the latest generation consoles. Featuring an array of graphical and technical enhancements, a new career builder, new vehicles and more, these versions were well received by the game's vast community of players.\nIn the period, Grand Theft Auto Online maintained its massive audience size from the prior year, while growing 8% and 74% as compared to the fourth quarters of fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition, Rockstar Games launched GTA+, an all-new membership program that's exclusive to Grand Theft Auto Online players on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S consoles whereby participants can receive a range of valuable player-friendly benefits, including a monthly deposit of GTA dollars and other bonuses designed to help players experience everything Grand Theft Auto Online has to offer, including access to major content packs like last holiday's, The Contract. Initial conversion has been above our expectations, which we believe bodes well for this to be an ongoing engagement driver over time.\nRed Dead Redemption 2 continued to expand its audience and to date has sold in more than 44 million units worldwide. Results for the series were notably above our expectations for the period, which is further proof of the ongoing popularity of Rockstar's blockbuster entertainment experiences.\nTurning to Private Division. The label's recently acquired studio, Roll7, successfully launched OlliOlli World in February, which received significant critical praise for its unique art style and impressive gameplay mechanics. We'll support the title with its first expansion, Void Riders, in the first half of this fiscal year.\nChampioning the best independent talent in our industry, Private Division recently signed 4 new publishing agreements with leading independent developers, Die Gute Fabrik, Evening Star, Piccolo Studio and Yellow Brick Games. We look forward to working with these talented teams.\nDuring the fourth quarter, recurrent consumer spending declined 6% over last year and accounted for 60% of net bookings. Over the past few months, the consumer has seen a wide array of long-awaited high-quality new releases in the market, including several of our own exciting titles that have not deployed significant live service offerings. We believe that this dynamic has impacted our overall recurrent consumer spending.\nNBA 2K and Grand Theft Auto Online were the largest contributors to our current consumer spending during the fourth quarter, and many of our free-to-play offerings were notable drivers as well. Top Eleven continued to perform very well following our acquisition and was our #1 mobile title during the fourth quarter. Two Dots delivered notable year-over-year growth and posted its best ever net bookings performance driven by new in-game events and successful marketing activations. Dragon City and Monster Legends delivered a solid finish to the year, supported by enhanced live operations.\nWWE SuperCard has now been downloaded more than 26 million times and remains 2K's highest grossing mobile game. And NBA 2K Online in China outperformed our expectations. The title remains the #1 online PC sports game in the region with nearly 57 million registered users.\nWe're incredibly excited about our future path of growth, including our pending combination with Zynga. We believe that this will be a transformative moment for Take-Two as we continue to build upon our core tenants to become the most innovative, the most creative and the most efficient entertainment company in the world. Combined, we'll create a powerhouse of industry-leading titles that span key platforms and genres across interactive entertainment, developed by some of the most creative and forward-thinking talent within the industry.\nLater this week, our respective shareholders who will vote on the transaction, which, assuming such approvals are obtained, we anticipate will close on May 23, 2022. On a stand-alone basis, for fiscal 2023, we expect to achieve a new record of $3.75 billion to $3.85 billion in net bookings as we plan to deliver many new exciting releases during the year.\nLooking ahead and excluding the impact of our combination with Zynga, we expect fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025 to set even higher records of net bookings for our company alongside a significant ramp-up in profitability. Lainie will provide additional details on our outlook shortly, while Karl will share an update on our exciting diverse multiyear pipeline, including approximately 69 titles that we plan to release through fiscal 2025.\nIn closing, we're highly optimistic about our future. As we continue to expand our enterprise and execute on our growth strategies, we believe that Take-Two remains incredibly well positioned to increase its scale and prominence within the industry, expand margins and deliver long-term value for our shareholders.\nI'll now turn the call over to Karl.\n\nKarl Slatoff\n\nPresident, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Strauss. I'd like to begin by thanking our teams around the world for delivering another outstanding year for our company. Strong results were driven by our colleagues' passion, creativity and commitment to deliver value for all of our stakeholders.\nI'll now discuss our recent first quarter releases. On April 21, 2K and Gearbox Software released Coiled Captors, the first of 4 exciting downloadable content packs in the Tiny Tina's Wonderlands season pass. Featuring a new environment, boss encounter and legendary loots, the offering represents an innovative post-launch experience from this exciting new franchise.\nOn April 26, 2K and Visual Concepts launched the Banzai Pack, featuring 5 playable superstars plus MyFACTION EVO cards for each. This is the first of 5 downloadable plan content offerings for WWE 2K22, all of which will be available individually and as part of the game's season pass throughout the year.\nLooking ahead, fiscal 2023 will be another exciting year for Take-Two as we deliver captivating new entertainment experiences for our players while also growing our business through our pending combination with Zynga.\nI'll now provide details on Take-Two's fiscal 2023 pipeline on a stand-alone basis, which includes 18 planned releases. We expect to deliver 6 immersive core offerings, all of which will be available for purchase. These include The Quarry, an all-new or narrative game from 2K and Supermassive Games where every choice, big or small, shapes her story and determines who lives to tell the tale.\nFeaturing an iconic ensemble cast of Hollywood stars, including David Arquette, Ariel Winter, Justice Smith, Brenda Song, Lance Henriksen, Lin Shaye and more. The Quarry will launch on June 10 for PlayStation and Xbox consoles and Windows PC via Steam.\nMarvel's Midnight Suns is planned for release during the second half of calendar 2022 and is one of this year's most anticipated games. The title is being developed by Firaxis Games, the acclaimed studio that brought audience such iconic franchises as Sid Meier's Civilization and XCOM and features the Marvel Universe's most revered heroes and entirely new gameplay experience. 2K will have more to share in the coming months.\nKerbal Space Program 2, which is coming from Private Division and Intercept Games, is now expected to launch on PC in early calendar 2023, and on console later in calendar 2023. Anticipation for the title is high, with more than 12 million views of the announcement trailer. The dedicated Kerbal community can look forward to more information about the game and its new features from the title's ongoing gameplay reveal video series.\nTurning to our annual sports offerings. Fans can expect all new releases from our popular sports series, including NBA 2K23, WWE 2K23 and PGA TOUR 2K23, which will debut legendary Gulf icon Tiger Woods as the game's Executive Director. 2K will have more to share about these titles shortly.\nContinuing with our fiscal 2023 pipeline, we plan to release 8 mobile titles, including 4 from new franchises and 4 from existing franchises and 3 mid-core RK titles for purchase, which include one new sports title from 2K, a new franchise from Private Division and a new tales from the Borderlands game, which will feature new characters and stories set in the Borderlands universe. And lastly, we'll have one new iteration of a previous released title available for purchase.\nOur labels will continue to provide new content and experiences that drive engagement and recurrent consumer spending across many of their hit franchises including NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online, Red Dead Redemption Online, WWE 2K, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, OlliOlli World and more.\nExcluding our pending combination with Zynga, we expect to deliver 51 titles throughout fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025, which we believe will pave the way for us to achieve a strong acceleration in net bookings and growth and profitability. This includes 18 immersive core releases, 7 of which are sports simulation games. 16 of these will be available for purchase while 2 will be free-to-play. 10 independent titles, which will all be avail for purchase; 12 free-to-play mobile games; 4 mid-core games for purchase, 2 of which will be sports-oriented; and 7 new iterations of previously released titles, which will all be available for purchase.\nBears noting that these titles are a snapshot of our current development pipeline. It is likely that some of these titles will not be developed through completion that launch timing may change and that we will also be adding new titles to our slate. In addition to our full game releases, we will continue to offer post loss content for many of our releases, ranging from virtual currency sales to DLC packs and Season Passes.\nTurning to eSports. The NBA 2K League kicked off its fifth season on March 23 and included new sponsors such as Google and Coinbase. This year, the league has partnered with the City of Indianapolis to bring all tournaments as well as playoffs and finals to its new home at The Pavilion at Pan Am.\nThe League's overall price pool has increased to $2.5 million this season, the largest since its inception. We remain very excited about the continued success and growth of the NBA 2K League, which has a long-term potential to enhance engagement and to be a driver of profits for our company.\nIn closing, as we execute on our organic growth initiatives and unlock new opportunities presented by our pending transaction with Zynga, we believe that we can broaden our portfolio and capitalize further on new platforms, business models, emerging markets and distribution channels. As we deliver on these growth opportunities, we believe that Take-Two is exceedingly well positioned to deliver long-term value for our shareholders.\nI'll now turn the call over to Lainie.\n\nLainie Goldstein\n\nCFO, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2022 results and then review our financial outlook for the full year and first quarter of fiscal 2023. Please note that our initial outlook does not include Zynga in our projected results or the interest expense on the notes that Take-Two issued in April to fund the cash portion of our pending acquisition of Zynga. Additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release.\nI'm extremely pleased with the accomplishments that Take-Two delivered during the fourth quarter and fiscal year. We posted strong financial results, took exciting steps to position the company for long-term growth and announced our transformational pending combination with Zynga, which brings massive potential to our portfolio and financial profile. I'd like to thank our teams for their passion commitment and for continuing to help Take-Two deliver its strategic vision.\nStarting with our fourth quarter. Total net bookings grew 8% to $846 million. Our newly released WWE 2K22 and Tiny Tina's Wonderlands outperformed our expectations, as did Red Dead Redemption 2. During the period, digitally-delivered net bookings grew 4% and accounted for 91% of the total. This exceeded our outlook of a slight increase due to the outperformance of digitally-delivered full game sales. 75% of console game sales were delivered digitally, up slightly from last year.\nAs Strauss mentioned, over the last few months, there's been a wide array of long-awaited, high-quality new releases in the market, including several of our own exciting titles that have not deployed significant live service offering. Accordingly, our recurrent consumer spending declined 6% and accounted for 60% of total net bookings.\nGAAP net revenue grew 11% to $930 million, while cost of goods sold increased 43% to $399 million, driven by amortization of software development costs for our fourth quarter release. Operating expenses increased by 32% to $403 million, driven by the addition of Nordeus, including its earn-out as well as higher marketing and transaction costs. And GAAP net income was $111 million or $0.95 per share compared to $290 million or $1.88 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\nTurning to our fiscal 2022 results. Total net bookings were $3.41 billion as compared to $3.55 billion in the prior year. As we expected, throughout the year, our engagement trends are notably higher than they were pre-pandemic. However, as the world began settling into a new normal, there was a moderation of the trends that benefited our industry during the height of the pandemic.\nAs a result, digitally-delivered net bookings declined 2%, slightly outperforming our guidance of a 3% decline and accounted for 91% of the total. 68% of our console game sales were delivered digitally, up from 64% last year, and recurrent consumer spending declined 6%. Non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow was $425 million as compared to our outlook of over $400 million.\nDuring fiscal 2022, we spent $159 million in capital expenditures. At fiscal year-end, our cash and short-term investments balance was approximately $2.6 billion. GAAP net revenue grew 4% to $3.5 billion, while cost of goods sold was flat at $1.5 billion. Operating expenses increased 24% to $1.5 billion driven primarily by the additions of Playdots and Nordeus, including the revaluation of its earn-out, higher personnel, stock compensation, marketing and IT expenses and higher transaction costs. And GAAP net income was $418 million or $3.58 per share as compared to $589 million or $5.09 per share in the prior year.\nToday, we provided our initial fiscal 2023 outlook for Take-Two on a stand-alone basis. We project net bookings to range from $3.75 billion to $3.85 billion, which is a new record level for the company and implies strong growth of 11% at the midpoint. We have an exciting pipeline of releases that we expect to bring to market during the year, including 6 immersive core titles, which is twice as many as we delivered in fiscal 2022.\nThe largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, Marvel's Midnight Sun and PGA TOUR 2K23. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 60% 2K, 30% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division and T2 mobile games. And we forecast our geographic net booking split to be about 60% United States and 40% international.\nWe expect recurrent consumer sending to be flat compared to fiscal 2022 and represents 58% of net bookings, which is down from 64% last year due to a greater number of new releases. We project digitally-delivered net bookings to grow 10% and represent 91% of net bookings, which is in line with last year. Our forecast assumes that 71% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 68% last year.\nWe expect to generate more than $350 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow, and we plan to deploy approximately $120 million for capital expenditures. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $3.67 billion to $3.77 billion and cost of goods sold to range from $1.66 billion to $1.7 billion.\nOur total operating expenses are expected to range from $1.74 billion to $1.76 billion. At the midpoint, this represents a 17% increase over the prior year. As Karl mentioned, we have approximately 69 titles that we plan to deliver over the next 3 years, and we will be investing behind our pipeline in key areas such as marketing, personnel and IT. And we expect GAAP net income to range from $223 million to $252 million or $1.90 to $2.15 per share. For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 16% throughout fiscal 2023.\nNow moving on to our guidance for the fiscal first quarter. We project net bookings to range from $700 million to $750 million as compared to $711 million in the first quarter last year. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K22, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, The Quarry and WWE 2K22. We expect digitally-delivered net bookings to increase 2%.\nOur forecast assumes that 78% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 73% in the same period last year. We project recurrent consumer spending to decline by 10% as we believe that the momentum behind our own exciting titles that have not deployed significant live service offerings will continue into the first quarter. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $810 million to $860 million and cost of goods sold to range from $307 million to $333 million.\nOperating expenses are expected to range from $387 million to $397 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 25% increase over last year, driven primarily by higher personnel and marketing expenses as well as transaction costs. And GAAP net income is expected to range from $93 million to $105 million or $0.80 to $0.90 per share.\nIn closing, we have great confidence in our ability to drive accelerated growth into fiscal 2023 and beyond. And we believe that our pending combination with Zynga will take our business to an even greater level of scale and profitability. As we execute on our strategic initiatives, we believe that we can deliver sustainable, profitable growth for our shareholders.\nThank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss.\n\nStrauss H. Zelnick\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for delivering another outstanding year. And to our shareholders, I'd like to express our appreciation for your continued support.\nWe'll now take your questions. Operator?"

Zelnick\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nicole. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we delivered another strong quarter, highlighted by net bookings of $866 million, which exceeded our expectations and increased 6% over the prior year. Our outstanding holiday season results were driven by our new and existing titles as well as strong ongoing engagement from our player communities that continue to immerse themselves in their favorite experiences and exciting new content updates.\nWe continue to position our company to deliver on its long-term pipeline, build scale and gain market share. During the quarter, we grew our pool of creative talent with the addition of more than 300 developers. This includes our highly complementary acquisitions of elite3d and Roll7. Based in Valencia, Spain, elite3d is one of the world's leading creative studios that is dedicated to innovative 2D and 3D artwork for the interactive entertainment industry. elite3D will form a second office for 2K's 31st Union Studio and serve as a new publishing location for 2K's Global Services Division.\nRoll7 is the BAFTA award-winning studio behind OlliOlli World, which is launching tomorrow. Going forward, the team will help support Private Division's mission to bring games to market from the industry's top creative studios as well as to broaden the label's portfolio of owned intellectual property and internal development capabilities.\nOur most significant recent development was our agreement to combine with Zynga, which we expect to close during the first quarter of our fiscal 2023. We're very excited by the prospect of this transformative combination, which will significantly diversify our business; establish us as a leader in mobile, the fastest-growing segment of the interactive entertainment industry; and greatly enhance our positioning as 1 of the world's top 3 pure-play publishers of interactive entertainment. We believe there will be tremendous strategic and financial benefits for our company. And we've already identified $100 million of annual cost synergies that we expect to achieve within the first 2 years post closing and over $500 million of annual revenue opportunities that we can deliver over time. We look forward to welcoming the team Zynga into the Take-Two family in the coming months.\nTurning to our third quarter results. Our better-than-expected performance was driven primarily by Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy -- The Definitive Edition, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and NBA 2K22. NBA 2K22 continue to exceed our expectations. And according to the MPT Group, it was the #1 selling title in the U.S. across all new releases in calendar 2021. In addition, the game achieved a new franchise record for experiencing the largest number of users in the shortest amount of time. This performance helped solidify NBA 2K's legacy as the top basketball simulation experience in our industry with over 8 million units sold-in to date worldwide.\nPlayers remain deeply engaged, and an average of 1.9 million users are playing the game every day, which is up 10% compared to NBA 2K21 in the same period last year. This helped drive better-than-expected recurrent consumer spending growth of 10% year-over-year even as we face challenging comparisons from the Gen 9 launch of the game last November. In addition, NBA-2K22 experienced an 8% increase in total in-game purchasers and a 30% increase in new-to-franchise spenders. 2K expanded the brand's addressable market further with the launch of NBA 2K22 Arcade Edition for Apple Arcade. The title continues to sit at the top of the Arcade's top game chart and has an average score of 4.7 out of 5 across more than 35,000 ratings.\nWe continue to be pleased with the ongoing innovation the Visual Concepts brings to the series annually and look forward to seeing how they'll deliver new experiences to NBA 2K in the future.\nSales of Grand Theft Auto V continue to be strong, and to date, the title has sold-in more than 160 million units worldwide. Since its launch in 2013, Grand Theft Auto V has remained within the top 5 best-selling titles for each calendar year across the Americas, including the U.S., and over 50 major territories across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific.\n2021 marked another excellent year for Grand Theft Auto Online with the title matching 2020's record-setting monthly audience size. Grand Theft Auto Online's engagement was driven by an array of free content updates, including new events around Halloween, new vehicles and clothing options for the race creator, and the contract update featuring Grammy award-winning artist, legendary producer in this year's Super Bowl halftime show headliner, Dr. Dre, which were all released during the third quarter. In particular, the contract broke new ground for Grand Theft Auto Online from a design standpoint with its deep story elements and increased access for solo players while also advancing Rockstar Games' unique ability to innovate through incorporating elements of pop culture and music into their experiences.\nThe update also features co-op story missions with Grand Theft Auto V Protagonist Franklin and sidekick Lamar's playable characters; a new social space, Record A Studios, where players were able to hang out with Dr. Dre and special guests; a new radio station hosted by global pop stars,\nRosalía and Arca called Motomoney Lots, named after\nRosalía's forthcoming album; updates to 2 existing radio stations from LA DJ Royalty, DJ Po and Big boy; 6 exclusive new tracks by Dr. Dre, which officially released to streaming services this past Friday; and new purchasable properties, vehicles and more.\nIn addition, Rockstar Games celebrated the 20th anniversary with the launch of Grand Theft Auto III with the release of Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy -- The Definitive Addition for Curt and prior-gen consoles and PC via the Rockstar Games Launcher with the title significantly exceeding our commercial expectations.\nRed Dead Redemption 2 also had an excellent quarter. The title's outperformance was primarily driven by strong holiday sales and to date, it has sold-in nearly 43 million units worldwide. In addition, Red Dead Online outperformed our expectations due to strong sales of Red Dead Redemption 2 and the continued influx of new players alongside a series of updates, including the fourth installment of the Quick Dra Club, All Halos Called Arms, The Halloween Pass 2 and Holiday Call To Arms.\n2K and Gearbox Software expanded our popular Borderland series further with the release of Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition. Our teams also rereleased the 2013 fan favorite, Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep A Wonderlands One-shot Venture on a stand-alone basis, which exceeded our expectations and is helping set the stage for next month's eagerly anticipated launch of Tiny Tina's Wonderlands.\nDuring the third quarter, recurrent consumer spending rose 2% over last year, which was in line with our expectations of a slight increase and accounted for 57% of net bookings. Our ability to captivate and deeply engage audiences with our offerings remains a distinguishing characteristic of our enterprise. NBA 2K Grand Theft Auto Online were the largest contributors to recurrent consumer spending, and many of our free-to-play offerings were notable drivers as well.\nFortis delivered a strong quarter as its newly released Top Eleven 2022 achieved record-high seasonal net bookings, driven by new features, gameplay improvements and enhanced live operations. Two Dots posted record net bookings results attributable to additional in-game events, curated seasonal content and successful marketing activations. Dragon City and Monster Legends performance was driven by enhanced live operations, new event types and strong seasonal content.\n2K launched Season 8 for WWE SuperCard, which has now been downloaded more than 25 million times and remains 2K's highest-grossing mobile game. NBA 2K Online in China outperformed our expectations. The title remains the #1 online PC sports game in the region with over 55 million registered users.\nTurning to our outlook. As a result of our third quarter outperformance, along with our updated forecast for the balance of the year, we are once again raising our guidance for fiscal year 2022 and we now expect to achieve net bookings of $3.37 billion to $3.42 billion. Lainie will provide more detail shortly.\nLooking ahead, we remain highly optimistic about the future of the interactive entertainment industry and our multiyear growth trajectory. We have the strongest and most diverse pipeline in our company's history, comprised of new intellectual properties as well as sequels to many of our beloved franchises. We look forward to delivering many of these titles in the coming months and beyond.\nWe're also confident that we can emerge as an even stronger player within our industry and deliver long-term value for our shareholders following the anticipated closing of our transaction with Zynga. With greater scale, extensive synergies and a more diversified portfolio of industry-leading titles, we believe that together, our 2 companies will far exceed our individual goals. We'd like to thank all of our stakeholders for their continued support.\nI'll now turn the call over to Karl.\n\nKarl Slatoff\n\nPresident, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Strauss. I'd like to thank our teams for delivering another outstanding quarter driven by their continued commitment to excellence and dedication to our business.\nI'll start by discussing our announced offerings planned for the remainder of this fiscal year. Tomorrow, Private Division and our recently acquired Roll7 Studio will launch OlliOlli World on Nintendo Switch, Xbox and PlayStation consoles and Steam. This skateboard and action performer has been eagerly awaited by fans and received significant critical praise for its unique art style and tight gameplay mechanics. Reviews for OlliOlli World have been extremely positive with multiple sites recommending or calling the title an essential purchase, with the game currently scoring an 85 on OpenCritic and 84 on Metacritic. We're thrilled to add this popular series to our portfolio and to pursue exciting new projects with the talented team at Roll7.\nIn early March, 2K and Visual Concepts will launch WWE 2K22, which we believe will set a new benchmark in quality for the series. The game offers more features and enhancements than any prior WWE 2K release, including a redesigned gameplay engine, new controls, foundational improvements, upgraded visuals and an array of features specifically requested by our passionate player base. WWE 2K22 will hit different, giving players complete control over the game's universe, including a new look and feel, accessible but challenging gameplay and significant replay value.\nRightin Stereo, one of the most renowned and respected WWE icons of all time, will grace the cover of this year's game in true Lucho Libre fashion. We can't wait for players to step into the ring with WWE 2K22 and experience all the groundbreaking enhancements on which our teams have been tirelessly working.\nOn March 15, Rockstar Games will launch Grand Theft Auto V for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S and X, bringing the blockbuster entertainment experience to an unprecedented third console generation. This new release features new graphics, modes -- feature new graphic modes with up to 4K resolution, up to 60 frames per second, texture and draw distance upgrades, HCR options and rate tracing as well as faster loading times in merchant 3D audio, platform-specific features and much more. We are also excited for new players to join the thriving Grand Theft Auto Online community on the latest hardware when the stand-alone offering is released in March, with Grand Theft Auto Online free on PlayStation 5 for the first [3 months].\nPlayStation 4 and Xbox One players eager to continue their journey on the newest generation of hardware will be able to transfer both the Grand Theft Auto V Story Mode progress and our current Grand Theft Auto Online characters and progression to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S with a onetime migration at launch.\nOn March 25, 2K and Gearbox Software will launch an exciting delay tree from the Borderlands universe, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, the highly anticipated fantasy-fueled and all new take on the liter shooters genre. During the game awards in December, 2K debuted a story trailer introduced on stage by members of Tiny Tina's Wonderlands' all-star celebrity cast. On the heels of the star-studded event, player segment for Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is at an all-time high. We expect the segment to continue to build as we grant access to media and content creators for extended previews and reviews and reveal new gameplay details in the coming weeks. We are looking forward to wrapping up our fiscal year with this tentpole release.\nLooking ahead to fiscal year 2023. Rockstar Games will launch Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy -- The Definitive Edition for iOS and Android devices in the first half of calendar 2022. 2K and for access games remain deeply immersed in the development of Marvel's Midnight Suns, one of our most exciting upcoming releases, which will launch this fall. The team is diligently working to add more story content, cinematics and overall polish to the game. Given the immense global popularity and cross-media presence of the Marvel Universe, coupled with Firaxis' games proven success in creating deeply immersive games, we believe this title has the potential to appeal to a broad audience that will enjoy experiencing some of comics' most legendary heroes in all new way.\nPrivate Division and Intercept Games remain hard at work on Kerbal Space Program 2, the next iteration in our beloved space exploration simulation series. We'll have more to share about our fiscal 2023 pipeline in the coming months and during our fourth quarter call in May.\nTurning to eSports. The NBA 2K League is gearing up for its fifth season, which will provide a thrilling tournament-centric structure, including 3-on-3 gameplay, amateur teams versus NBA2K League teams and a significantly higher price pool. On February 26, fans continued to release Twitch and YouTube channels to watch its draft on live stream. In keeping with its ongoing commitment to women and eSports, last month, the League held its third Annual Women in Gaming Development Camp and brought together top amateur female NBA 2K players to compete alongside and learn from League players and coaches and to participate in off-court development sessions focused on amplifying the voices in women and gaming.\nIn closing, we believe there is a vast potential for our company to continue captivating and engaging audiences around the world by delivering the very best entertainment experiences. The next few months represent an exciting time for Take-Two as we release many of our new titles and prepare for a transformative combination with Zynga, which brings with it a diverse portfolio of titles, impressive data science capabilities, industry-leading publishing and live operations, a massive customer database and their leading advertising platform, Carlos. Together, we expect to benefit from substantial costs in publishing synergies while also unlocking significant new revenue streams and reaching new audiences around the world. As we capitalize on these and other opportunities, we believe we will deliver long-term value for our shareholders.\nI'll now turn the call over to Lainie.\n\nLainie Goldstein\n\nCFO, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our third quarter results and then review our financial outlook for our fiscal year 2022 and fourth quarter. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release.\nAs Strauss mentioned, our holiday results were outstanding driven by strong engagement across our key franchises. Net bookings were $866 million, which was above our guidance of $800 million to $850 million and up 6% as compared to last year. Our outperformance was primarily driven by Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy -- The Definitive Addition, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and NBA 2K22.\nDuring the period, recurring consumer spending increased 2% compared to our outlook of a slight increase and accounted for 57% of total net bookings. Digitally delivered net bookings increased 12%, which was above our outlook of a 5% increase and accounted for 88% of the total. Our outperformance was primarily due to higher-than-expected digitally delivered full game sales. During the quarter, 63% of console game sales were delivered digitally, up from 56% last year.\nGAAP net revenue increased 5% to $903 million, and cost of goods sold increased 1% to $350 million. Operating expenses increased by 18% to $399 million, primarily driven by higher personnel and stock-based compensation expenses, the addition of Nordeus and the revaluation of its earnout, partially offset by lower marketing expense. GAAP net income was $145 million or $1.24 per share as compared to $182 million or $1.57 per share in the third quarter last year. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.5 billion of cash and short-term investments.\nTurning to our guidance. I'll begin with our full fiscal year expectations. We are raising our net bookings outlook range to $3.37 billion to $3.42 billion. This is up from our prior outlook of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion due to our third quarter outperformance, along with our updated forecast for the fourth quarter. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Borderlands 3 and Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy -- The Definitive Edition. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our label to be roughly 50% 2K, 40% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division and T2 Mobile Games. We forecast our geographic net booking split to be about 60% United States and 40% international.\nWe now expect recurrent consumer spending to decline by 5% compared to our prior outlook of a 6% decline and represents 65% of net bookings, which is in line with last year. We now project digitally delivered net bookings to decrease by approximately 3% compared to our prior outlook of a 4% decline. 90% of our net bookings are expected to be digital, slightly above 89% last year. Our forecast assumes that 69% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 64% last year.\nWe expect to generate more than $400 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow, and we plan to deploy approximately $170 million for capital expenditures. We are raising our GAAP net revenue outlook to $3.41 billion to $3.46 billion, and we now expect cost of goods sold to range from $1.52 billion to $1.54 billion.\nTotal operating expenses are expected to range from $1.48 billion to $1.49 billion, which at the midpoint represents a 23% increase over the prior year. This increase includes investments in marketing, personnel, IT and research and development that will help us deliver our expansive multiyear pipeline. It also reflects the addition of Nordeus and a full year Playdots as well as an increase in stock compensation expense. Our operating expense expectations are slightly above our prior guidance, primarily driven by the transaction costs associated with our anticipated combination with Zynga.\nWe expect GAAP net income to range from $361 million to $373 million or $3.10 to $3.20 per share. For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 16% for the remainder of fiscal 2022.\nNow moving to our guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter. We project net bookings to range from $808 million to $858 million compared to $785 million in the fourth quarter last year. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, which includes Grand Theft Auto V for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, Tiny Tina's Wonderland, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy -- The Definitive Edition and WWE 2K22. We project recurrent consumer spending to be down 3% compared to last year and digitally delivered net bookings to increase slightly.\nOur forecast assumes that 77% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 74% last year. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $835 million to $885 million and cost of goods sold to range from $380 million to $406 million. Operating expenses are expected to range from $389 million to $399 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 30% increase over last year driven primarily by higher marketing expenses to support our fourth quarter release slate, the addition of Nordeus, and transaction costs associated with our anticipated combination with Zynga. GAAP net income is expected to range from $53 million to $65 million or $0.46 to $0.56 per share.\nLooking ahead, we have many exciting projects underway across all of our labels, and we plan to make continued investments next year to prepare for some of our major launches. With our incredible portfolio of creative assets, our significant growth opportunities, including our robust pipeline and our strong balance sheet, we remain highly confident in our long-term growth trajectory and our ability to deliver shareholder value.\nBefore I turn the call back over to Strauss, I'd like to reiterate that we are very excited about our anticipated combination with Zynga. We believe that the proposed transaction will not only bring together our highly complementary portfolios but will also significantly increase take to scale and provide many new growth opportunities. As we disclosed in our January 10 announcement, we expect the combined business to deliver a 14% compound annual growth rate for the 3-year period from our fiscal 2021 through 2024, excluding any of the proposed transactions, revenue opportunities or any future acquisitions. In terms of next steps, we expect to file our joint S-4, which includes the proxy statement and prospectus, with the SEC in late February or early March, and our stockholder voting will occur in the spring. We continue to expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023.\nThank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss.\n\nStrauss H. Zelnick\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.\n\nThanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for delivering another outstanding quarter. And to our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support.\nWe'll now take your questions. Operator?"

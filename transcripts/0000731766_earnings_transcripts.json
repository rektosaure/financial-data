[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here are some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations.\nA description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amount is available on the financial and earnings reports section of the company's Investor Relations page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com.\nInformation presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated October 28, 2025, which may be accessed from the Investor Relations page of the company's website.\nI will now turn the conference over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley.\n\nWayne Scott DeVeydt\n\nExecutive Chairman, Surgery Partners, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining us today. Our enterprise continues to advance on the improvement path first discussed with you in July. We've been introducing new leaders, strengthening underperforming businesses, identifying both opportunities and inefficiencies and importantly, recommitting to the mission and culture of this company. We're getting at the core of the underperformance issues with fresh perspectives, intent on positioning our organization as a positive and innovative leader helping to advance next era of health care. A keen sense of urgency in this effort is consistent throughout the enterprise.\nAt the same time, recognizing the pace of progress varies across our businesses, depending upon their challenges and opportunities. Some efforts will require more time and investment. Others will show more immediate progress. Repricing within UnitedHealthcare is on track to drive solid operating earnings growth from margin improvement within that business in 2026. In our less mature businesses such as OptumHealth and OptumInsight, our efforts to improve operations and make needed investments will show more measured progress in 2026 and will take more time to fully bear fruit.\nAs Patrick Conway will discuss, our belief in the need for an impact of value-based care remains intact, as is our confidence in returning to expected performance standards. And throughout the company, we will ensure we are focused on activities that align with our long-term future and be very disciplined about moving on from those that do not. We're committed to returning to the consistent enterprise-wide performance levels you should expect of us.\nWithin OptumHealth, the team has taken concrete steps that will refocus the business back to its original mission, actions that will narrow networks with more emphasis on appropriately aligned physicians, geographies, the right clinical services and the right benefit offerings for the members we serve. We are also keeping sharp focus on the continued competitiveness of UnitedHealthcare as evidenced by our recent Medicare Star scores showing improvement year-over-year, and that work remains intense now for payment year 2028 Star's performance.\nAs we look ahead to the next few years, we will consistently emphasize the fundamental execution discipline that has long been a key trade of this company. and I'm gratified to see the quick and enthusiastic response to this enterprise emphasis from our leadership team. External challenges will remain, including continued headwinds in 2026 and from the third year of nearly $50 billion in industry-wide Medicare cuts by the previous administration as well as Medicaid funding and program pressures.\nEven so, I'm confident we will return to solid earnings growth next year given the operational rigor and more prudent pricing. While we are still finalizing 2026 plans and intend to share full guidance with you in January, current analyst consensus captures a likely stepping off point for next year. We intend to balance our earnings growth ambitions in 2026 and with investments and actions that will drive higher and sustainable double-digit growth beginning in 2027 and advancing from there. That is the perspective we're keeping front of mind. Our longer-term outlook will be refreshed as we continue to execute over the next year. As we've been doing these last few months, we will continue to engage actively with both investors and the broader stakeholder community and plan to convene our investor conference in the back half of 2026.\nThis morning, Tim Noel and Patrick Conway will provide details on the progress of UnitedHealthcare and Optum, respectively. Our Chief Financial Officer, Wayne DeVeydt; will review third quarter results. I'm pleased to welcome William to our leadership team. He has the right experience, values and expertise to help guide UnitedHealth Group at this moment in our development, and he's off to a fast start. So with that, Tim, you want to take it?\n\nTimothy John Noel\n\nCEO of UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated\n\nThanks, Steve. For the current year, overall UnitedHealthcare performance remains in line with the expectations we offered in the second quarter. Medical cost trends remained historically high but consistent with our second quarter guidance, and we expect that to continue throughout the remainder of 2025.\nTurning to our efforts for 2026, a vital element has been our pricing. Since our last update with you, we've repriced the vast majority of our UHC risk businesses, including Medicare Advantage and to varying degrees, our commercial fully insured and residual ACA offerings. Trend experience for the third quarter continues to validate the actuarial forecasts underpinning our 2026 pricing actions. Taken together, these actions position each of our businesses on a clear path towards margin growth in 2026 with the exception of Medicaid, which I will discuss in a moment.\nOur Medicare business continues to perform in line with the expectations we shared last quarter. That's true for care activity and medical cost trends, and importantly, for the mix of clinical activity and utilization across physician, outpatient and inpatient. We forecast a full year 2025 trend of approximately 7.5% in Medicare Advantage, consistent with our previous expectations. As we shared with you last quarter, trend remains elevated across Medicare overall with our Med Sup offerings still seeing medical cost trends in excess of 11%.\nIn individual Medicare Advantage, we continue to believe an expected 10% medical cost trend for 2026 has us positioned appropriately. This trend assumes assumption reflects a continuation of the elevated care activity levels observed in 2025, known impacts from fee schedule changes and continued expansion of aggressive provider coding and billing practices. We have taken a similarly prudent view across all our Medicare product offerings for 2026, including Medicare Supplement, Group MA and stand-alone Part D.\nFor Medicare Advantage, we're now about 2 weeks into the annual enrollment period and early results are in line with our strategic positioning for 2026. Our plan for next year reflects a conservative path focused on margin growth. We made significant adjustments to benefits and executed targeted plant exits and network reductions to offset elevated medical trends and government funding decreases. As a result of our planned actions as well as competitive market dynamics, we expect membership contraction of approximately 1 million members in total Medicare Advantage, including individual and group markets. We expect these actions will drive margin improvements in 2026 with potential for further advancements in 2027 that will position us to reach the upper half of our 2% to 4% targeted margin range, all of which is supported by strong Star's results. As Steve mentioned earlier, we already have shifted focus to the next Star's performance period. including incremental investments made in the fourth quarter.\nTurning to commercial. We are focused on pricing and cost management efforts to support 2026 margin recovery. At this point, approximately 60% of our group commercial insured offerings have been priced for next year. Our commercial pricing reflects the elevated cost levels we've seen this year, which we expect to persist in 2026. While we expect our group fully insured business to contract in line with the broader market, we continue to see strong traction for our self-funded offerings. We expect the vast majority of our employer insurance businesses to be repriced for 2026 and to return to our normal margin range in 2027.\nMoving to ACA markets. We have submitted rate filings in nearly all of the 30 states where we participate that reflect 2025 morbidity and experience. These include average rate increases of over 25%. Where we are unable to reach agreement on sustainable rates, we are enacting targeted service area reductions. We believe these actions will establish a sustainable premium base while likely reducing our ACA enrollment by approximately 2/3. These actions should drive margin improvement in our employer and individual segment in 2026, though still below our targeted 7% to 9% range.\nIn Medicaid, the path to recovery will be more challenging. States have not funded in line with actual cost trends. So funding levels are not sufficient to cover the health needs of state enrollees. While we're making steady progress in bridging this gap with states, the mismatch between rate adequacy and member acuity will likely extend through 2026. To date, we have received 2026 draft rates on almost half of our contracts, which have a January 1 rate cycle, and we continue to advocate for rate updates to better reflect our ongoing experience with elevated trends. Our team is focused on addressing drivers unique to these markets, especially behavioral health and will continue to push for appropriate funds.\nAs I said last quarter, wherever states support responsible funding for Medicaid, we remain committed to serving people through that program and view this as integral to our mission. As we indicated in July, we anticipate Medicare margins will be breakeven for 2025. As we look to 2026, we expect margins to decline further as existing cost trends continue and the current rate environment does not change. Looking at UnitedHealthcare overall, the underlying business continues to perform well in serving consumers, plans and program sponsors.\nTo give you some examples of how we're enhancing the experience for these cohorts. Nearly 85% of member inquiries are served digitally. When members call us, 90% of calls are answered within 30 seconds and 95% of members' questions are resolved in the first interaction. So 95% of our claims are automatically processed immediately. We're delivering more value, ease, simplicity and guidance throughout the UHC member experience. We're also aggressively scaling AI and machine learning capabilities to enhance these experiences and optimize core performance.\nWhile 2025 remains a transition year, the pressure we experienced is largely a result of mispricing and suboptimal market positioning. We remain humbled by the challenges of this environment and the lessons we've had to learn once again, but confident that we are in solid footing to recapture our performance potential.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Patrick Conway, CEO of Optum.\n\nPatrick Hugh Conway\n\nChief Executive Officer of Optum Rx\n\nThanks, Tim. I will spend the majority of my time today updating you on our efforts to restore OptumHealth to its original intent around value-based care, which experienced [indiscernible] care at the right time in the right setting for the best outcomes at the lowest cost to the people we serve, particularly in light of current cost trends and the market dominance of the large health systems. Over the last few years, through a period of rapid expansion, OptumHealth's strategy around value-based care strayed from the initial intent of the model. Three critical issues emerged.\nFirst, the provider network grew too large; second, the rapid pace of expansion and slower pace of integration resulted in operating inconsistencies exacerbated by relying too much on affiliated physicians who are less aligned with core VBC policies. And lastly, OptumHealth was accepting risk in products and services less suited for a clinically oriented value-based model. Understanding these issues has helped us better pursue the steps needed to get back to the original intent of OptumHealth and value-based care.\nOver the past 6 months, we have made significant leadership changes to better drive an integrated VBC provider model. Under the leadership of Krista Nelson, our Chief Operating Officer, we are focusing our efforts on 3 key connected areas to drive better performance. First, returning to the original intended clinical framework that best supports VBC. Second, moving towards narrower, more integrated and dedicated value-based care provider model and network; and third, focusing on the appropriate managed benefit product and patient base.\nWithin this framework, our team has made solid progress, especially in bringing greater discipline to how we approach risk arrangements, which will benefit the business in 2026. This includes partnering with payers on benefit adjustments and appropriate rates to match the risk and mix of the populations we serve. At this point, we are close to completion and over 90% of our value-based payer contracts for next year and are on track to reach our goal of offsetting approximately half of the 2026 V28 headwind through payer contracting.\nWe are also pursuing market and product exits, including from lower-performing PPO contracts. As indicated last quarter, we have finalized exits for 200,000 lives in 2026, the majority of which are PPO. While still early in the Medicare annual enrollment period, we expect total OptumHealth value-based care membership to shrink by approximately 10% in 2026 before returning to growth in 2027. We also continue to intentionally shape our care provider network to prioritize high-performing partners who demonstrate strong patient engagement and consistently positive outcomes. We are moving to employed or contractually dedicated positions wherever possible.\nWe are separating from providers who are less aligned with the VBC model. The targeted network actions we've taken over the last 60 days will result in fewer providers in our networks starting in 2026. Within our markets and their related networks, we are working to more fully integrate our clinical practices to ensure greater performance consistency. The team is refining our portfolio and accelerating a consistent national operating model for regionally led high-performing OptumHealth practices that reduces fixed cost drives purchasing economies, align technology and most importantly, ensures continued high-quality care.\nThese actions increase our confidence in our ability to meet our V28 cost reduction targets in 2026 and strengthen our operating foundations for the long term. Lastly, our engagements clinical work at Optum continue to track with our expectations for meaningfully reducing medical cost trends, engaging with over 85% of our high-risk members in 2025, which accounts for the remaining V28 pressure offsets in 2026.\nBottom line, getting back to the basics of our VBC model will be good for the people we serve and for our business. As a point of reference, our 2026 CMS star rating projections show 80% of Optum at home members and 4+ Star plans and nearly 100% of our [indiscernible] members in 4+ Star plans. Evidence of our quality of care is underscored by a strong MPS of 90 at our highest-performing facilities.\nFor the third quarter, OptumHealth performance was in line with our expectations, reflecting the natural seasonality in our business and the pull forward of some investments. Within this, we expect to end 2025 with margins of just under 3%, which includes value-based care margins under 1%. We expect margin improvement across all of OptumHealth in 2026 even in the face of the third year of the Medicare funding cuts. We believe these efforts will drive further acceleration in 2027 towards our long-term margin targets of 6% to 8%.\nTurning to OptumHealth's fee-based care services, as we discussed last time, these were not performing to their potential. We are adopting more consistent and rigorous processes to better manage these practices for growth and appropriate profitability. We are seeing early results in our East region, which serves nearly 5 million patients, where we have generated a 3% per visit productivity increase quarter-over-quarter, driven by targeted improvements in scheduling, workflow efficiency and patient acquisition. We have similar undertakings in motion in our South and West regions.\nAs for OptumInsight, we continue to perform solidly but not at the level of the potential for these services. Under the leadership of Sandeep Dadlani, we now see the alignment of our end-to-end technology and AI innovation efforts coming into formation. We will make the investments needed to accelerate the advancement of this distinctive platform that serves the expanse of the health system. We are confident in our plan will ignite top line revenue and operating earnings in line with our long-term growth targets.\nAt OptumRx, we continue to perform well with double-digit revenue growth in our pharmacies and a strong selling season for our pharmacy offerings. Our products are resonating in the market with stronger customer retention and new customer growth. At this stage, we expect new membership growth in 2026 will be more than offset by expected membership attrition from the UnitedHealthcare business. Importantly, our team remains disciplined around pricing, transparency and quality outcomes for our customers at a time when the pharmaceutical industry continues to drive cost ever higher.\nToday, we offer full rebate pass-through arrangements to all of our customers with nearly 85% of them participating. We were the first in our industry to announce this arrangement back in the beginning of the year and we expect 95% of our customers will be in these arrangements in 2027 with the remainder in full rebate pass-through by 2028. And we have increased payments on branded drugs to over 14,000 and independent retail pharmacies as part of our commitment to a balanced pricing approach.\nThanks for your time today. I'll now turn it over to Wayne DeVeydt.\n\nWayne Scott DeVeydt\n\nExecutive Chairman, Surgery Partners, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by expressing my sincere appreciation to Steve, Tim, Patrick and all of my colleagues at UnitedHealth Group for the warm welcome. It's truly an honor to be part of this team and to contribute to our shared mission.\nToday, I'd like to cover 3 important topics. First, I'll provide an overview of our quarterly performance and how it informs our outlook for the rest of the year. I will then discuss our capital and liquidity framework as we look ahead to 2026, particularly in terms of resuming share buybacks and strategic acquisition activities. And finally, I'll offer some insights into our expectations for 2026.\nMoving to the quarter. Today, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.92, which was slightly ahead of our expectations. These results reflect steady execution while we work through our longer-term improvement plans. We've balanced immediate performance with strategic investments that will support our future growth and natural diversification.\nSome details for the quarter. We delivered revenues of over $113 billion, reflecting 12% year-over-year growth driven by domestic membership expansion of over 780,000 lives year-to-date. We ended the third quarter with total domestic membership of more than 50 million. Our medical care ratio of 89.9% in the quarter compares to 85.2% in the same quarter last year. with the full year trending towards the lower end of the projections we offered last quarter.\nAs Tim stated, medical cost trends, while historically high, remain consistent with our outlook for 2025 and align with our pricing actions for 2026. The operating cost ratio of 13.5% in the quarter reflects larger investments in technology and people than originally contemplated when guidance was set in 2Q. Specifically, we invested more than $450 million in broad-based employee incentives and in contributions to the UnitedHealth Foundation, both critically important for strengthening our relationships with our workforce and with local communities in the health system at large. And investments were proportionately greater in OptumHealth and OptumInsight. Finally, our earnings were supported by strong cash flows of 2.3x net income and an overall increase in days claims payable of 1.7 days sequentially.\nTurning to our capital and liquidity framework. As previously communicated, we have paused our strategic acquisitions and share buyback while we dedicate our cash to returning to a long-term debt-to-capital ratio around 40% and interest coverage ratio is in line with historic levels. In the third quarter, our debt-to-capital ratio remained stable at 44.1%, reflecting continued actions to improve cash efficiency, offset by the completion of the Amedisys transaction late in the third quarter which represented a net cash disbursement of $3.4 billion. We expect our debt-to-capital ratio to trend closer to 40% in the second half of 2026. Accordingly, while we have not finalized plans for 2026, we anticipate we may be in a position to reinstate our historical capital deployment practices later in the year.\nFinally, we generated operating cash flow from operations of $5.9 billion. We still expect to close this year with $16 billion in operating cash flow or 1.1x net income.\nLooking ahead to 2026. As Steve mentioned, we will provide formal guidance with our fourth quarter results in January. We are comfortable with current consensus and within that, we are making the requisite investments needed to accelerate our returns in 2026 and to position our company for meaningfully stronger growth in 2027 and beyond. We are optimistic in our ability to execute on our 2026 plans, but there are remaining headwinds we will have to overcome. Items to keep in mind include, we're entering the final year of V28, which represents a more than $6 billion headwind to the overall enterprise. As you heard from Tim and Patrick, we've taken numerous actions around benefit design, cost control and member engagement to substantially offset this impact.\nFurther investment in OptumHealth and OptumInsight is needed and we are accelerating some of those investments as noted in our third quarter results. We are also accelerating our pace of AI applications to fundamentally advance a vast spectrum of processes and capabilities we expect will structurally improve our enterprise performance.\nOur effective tax rate is expected to return to a more normalized level in 2026 as compared to 2025. And finally, investment income should continue to move lower as interest rates decline. From a tailwind perspective, our repricing efforts will be a catalyst for earnings growth as we begin returning to our long-term target margins with particularly solid year-over-year results expected in our Commercial and Medicare businesses. We also expect stability and a measured return to growth in our Optum entities, with aspects of that growth being reinvested in the business, specifically OptumHealth and OptumInsight. These investments may slow 2026 growth, but should accelerate growth in 2027, more in line with historical expectations. We will be paying down debt and identifying opportunities to further reduce our interest expense as a result of the declining rate environment.\nAnd finally, we're taking an aggressive step on affordability initiatives that should improve overall medical trend relative to our pricing. While we have a number of moving parts to manage for the remainder of this year, we also have concrete plans to execute on all the items we discussed this morning that will position us for the type of growth you've come to expect from UnitedHealth Group.\nThanks for your time this morning. I'll now turn it back to Steve.\n\nStephen J. Hemsley\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Wayne. As I hope you clearly -- you heard clearly, this team and our 400,000 colleagues are focused on delivering on all fronts for the people we're privileged to serve and for our shareholders. As I said in the outset, we're being very disciplined. This plays out day to day as this management team recognizes the need to manage our costs, both in the short term as well as structurally. And through another lens, throughout the quarter, we have continued to evaluate the company's businesses with fresh perspectives and with continued confidence in our progress and our overall direction. We expect to complete that assessment in the fourth quarter as we position for 2026 and the years ahead.\nA few themes emerge from these efforts. We are dedicating our energies to serving U.S. health care needs and we'll be reducing our footprint in international markets that do not support these needs. We will be finalizing our initiatives for recovery of the remaining outstanding loan balances from the care provider support programs associated with the 2024 Change Healthcare cyber attack.\nFor OptumHealth, we are consolidating locations and completing plans addressing the geographic markets in which we will serve patients all intended to operationally advance and scale the leading value-based clinical care business of OptumHealth. And we are realigning Optum Financial services within our OptumInsight Services platform. While we have not yet finalized these plans, many of these actions are underway, and we believe they will improve both our focus and long-term performance. We are in the process of quantifying the accounting, tax and cash implications of our plans.\nAt this stage, our preliminary work would imply a non-GAAP substantially noncash low single-digit billion-dollar charge. We will provide further details on our fourth quarter call as we conclude these efforts. Simply put, we will end 2025 well positioned for a return to solid growth in 2026, acceleration in 2027 and a clear focus on our long-standing mission and strategy. An important reason for my confidence in our outlook is the way I see our people embracing a renewed focus on the mission, culture and values of our company. How we go about things in the sensitive area of health care is as essential as what we do, and we are bringing new energy to that imperative each day.\nNow operator, let's open it up for questions.",

Good morning and welcome to the UnitedHealth Group Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. A question and answer session will follow the UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here are some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements. Under US federal securities laws, these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations.\nA description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.

I will now turn the conference over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley.\n\nStephen Hemsley\n\nChairman and CEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining today. Our prepared remarks will be a little longer than usual, so we will be allowing more time for your questions. As we begin, I want to recognize and thank our employees who have been so dedicated to serving our patients, consumers, and customers during a prolonged, challenging period for our business.\nI'd like to thank our leadership team, many of whom are new in their roles, for their willingness to join me in looking hard at our businesses, getting a grounded assessment of our action plans, re-baselining our outlook, and moving apace to advance the performance of each of our businesses this morning.\nI know you are eager to get into the underlying details of our revised.\nFinancial outlook, which we will do, but at this moment I believe it's also important to convey the tone we're setting at this enterprise. More than anything, it is a tone of change and reform born out of recommitment to our mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. It's a mission that requires a commitment to a culture of values of service, responsibility, integrity, and humility. We pair that mission driven ambition of reform with a keen sense of the opportunity and the expectation to perform better than we ever have.\nAs we continue to assess the state of our businesses, it is very apparent that some require a fundamental reorientation, others require building and nurturing, and others must be reconsidered and redirected to original purpose.\nWe also recognize the need and the opportunity to revisit and address critical processes and fundamental business practices, both internal and market facing. We're acutely aware we have an enormous responsibility for providing care for millions of people and for protecting the government and private programs we partner in. As such, we have embarked on a real cultural shift in our relationship with regulators and all external stakeholders.\nWe intend to be proactively engaged, constructive, and responsive to the concerns of all stakeholders and in our engagement with them. We had the chance to reposition our enterprise as a far more modern, reliable, consumer- and provider-friendly enterprise using new technologies and approaches and we're going to pursue that course. Pursuit of these opportunities aligns to and enables our reform and change mandate and allows us to better achieve our mission and to steadily perform better in doing so.\nWe are on this course against a challenging environment, which includes a generational pullback in Medicare funding set in motion in 2023 and playing out through 2026, unprecedented medical cost trends measured in both intensity of services used as well as unit prices, and more aggressive care provider coding and billing technologies, the prospects for further contraction of the Medicaid and exchange markets.\nThe growing need to invest in the opportunities new technologies offer, and the expectation of all healthcare entities to offer a better experience for consumers, customers, care providers, and employees, and finally, the continuing public controversy over long-standing practices and complexities across the entire healthcare sector, particularly managed care, which bears the critical roles for coverage, for care management, and for pricing for the intensity of the cost and services used in the benefit products and programs for the entire healthcare market.\nAs a leading provider of health services, we must help advance a better health system.\nWe are committed to engaging in these pursuits with a sense of purpose and better partnership with all stakeholders, transparency in our business and reporting practices, and continued integrity in all we do.\nBeyond the environmental factors that are affecting the entire sector and more specifically to us. We've made pricing and operational mistakes as well as others. They are getting the needed attention. Our critical processes, including risk adjustment, care management, pharmaceutical services, and others are being reviewed by independent experts, and they will be reviewed every year and reported on as these processes can be reviewed at any time by outside stakeholders.\nWhile we believe in our oversight and the integrity of these processes, wherever they are determined to be at variance with prescribed practice, they will be promptly remediated and will continue on this path.\nAll the foregoing is fully addressable. We can steadily restore our performance to levels consistent with our mission and stakeholder expectations, all as we strengthen an institutional culture aligned to that mission and accountable for performance. Over the last 60 days or more, we have made extensive management and operational changes aligned to this agenda of reform and performance. Other such changes to leadership, to our businesses, our culture, our approaches and practices, and to our board governance and succession oversight, as appropriate, will continue to be made as we proceed through this period.\nWith those thoughts in mind, Tim Noel and Patrick Conway, heads of UnitedHealthcare and Optum, respectively, will walk through some of the specifics in their businesses. John Rex will discuss financial performance and the elements affecting our outlook, and I'll come back with some closing thoughts and then we'll have ample time for questions and answers.\n\nTim Noel\n\nCEO, UnitedHealthcare\n\nThanks, Steve. I want to start by emphasizing that we are approaching our business with greater humility, greater transparency, and a renewed determination to meet your expectations and our standards. The primary driver of UnitedHealthcare earnings shortfall for 2025 is that our pricing assumptions were well short of actual medical costs.\nOur current view for 2025 reflects $6.5 billion more in medical cost than we anticipated in our initial outlook. A little over half or $3.6 billion of this is in our broad based Medicare portfolio. About 1/3 or $2.3 billion is in the commercial business, split evenly between ACA plans and our employer business. The remaining trend pressure is related to Medicaid, most notably due to elevated behavioral trend.\nIn addition to trend-driven issues, updated 2025 outlook removes about $1 billion from previously planned portfolio actions that we are no longer pursuing. It also reflects about $850 million of other items, including unfavorable prior period items primarily from 2024 and recognition of several one-time settlements. We know these are serious challenges. We are humbled by them and will carry that sense of humility more deeply into our culture. But we also believe we can resolve our current issues and recapture our earnings growth potential. Let me now provide an update on where each business stands, starting with Medicare.\nWhen we prepared our 2025 Medicare Advantage offerings back in the first half of 2024, we significantly underestimated the accelerating medical trend and did not modify benefits or plan offerings sufficiently to offset the pressures we are now experiencing. This was compounded by the magnitude of plan exits across the sector and the extent to which we now see care providers placing further service intensity into the health system.\nThe increasingly flexible orientation to which our Medicare networks and plan designs have evolved over recent years left us less able to address these trends in year-on-year trends. Specifically, the increasing care activity across individual and group Medicare Advantage we saw earlier this year has now affected complex populations and our Medicare Supplement business as well.\nAcross Medicare Advantage, physician and outpatient care together represent 70% of the pressure year to date. However, inpatient utilization has accelerated through Q2 and we expect will comprise a relatively larger portion of the pressure over the full year.\nWe continue to see utilization increases in ER and observation stays, and consistently see more services being offered and bundled as part of each ER visit and clinical encounter. In short, most encounters are intensifying in services and costing more. The higher trend is broad-based geographically and across our membership, including our large retained membership base. To put this into context, we had initially assumed Medicare Advantage medical cost trend of just over 5% when configuring our 2025 bids, in line with our normalized trend experience in 2024. We now expect full year 2025 trend to be approximately 7.5%.\nMedicare Supplement, which typically is representative of overall care activity levels and cost trends in Medicare Fee-for-Service broadly, is up similarly in 2025 compared to historical levels. We expect that trend to be over 11% this year versus 8% to 9% in recent years, further confirming the broad-based nature of the care activity and the coding and billing patterns we are seeing.\nOn commercial, we are seeing higher than expected medical cost increases, particularly in outpatient care and, although to a lesser extent, inpatient care. Orthopedic spending and pharmacy infusions are notable factors here. In the ACA business, the revenue impact resulting from a difference between the morbidity that we price for and what we experienced is the primary cause of our underperformance.\nOne example of the elevated commercial trend is group fully insured. The trend is approaching 11%, which is approximately 100 basis points higher than our initial expectations.\nMoving to Medicaid, similar elevated trends are apparent and further affected by increasing and unanticipated acceleration of cost. In behavioral health, where TRND is running at 20%, as well as in pharmacy and home health. We anticipate the existing rate and acuity mismatch will extend well into next year. Beyond these segment-specific factors, there are other broad drivers of higher medical cost. There has been a marked increase in healthcare cost due in part to increases in service intensity per encounter. For example, in Medicare\nAdvantage, higher frequency of physician rounding, testing, and related services of specialists and in ER settings are contributing to elevated outpatient spend. In addition to strongly responsive pricing for 2026, which I will speak to in a moment, we are intensifying our remediation actions. We have stepped up our audit, clinical policy, and payment integrity tools to protect customers and patients from unnecessary costs.\nThese efforts ensure care is delivered in appropriate settings and grounded in safety and quality, while also identifying waste and abuse in outlier coding and billing practices. We are shifting to narrower networks and focusing on more disciplined managed products, particularly in Medicare Advantage. We have scaled our AI efforts across health plan operations which improves the patient and provider service experiences while driving cost savings.\nLastly, in Medicaid we continue to actively engage with state partners using both past experience and data-driven insights to show the need for immediate and more regular rate updates. Taken together, this work is helping restore our operational muscle and reclaiming executional rigor, helped by modern tools and driven by a relentless focus on improvement.\nTurning now to 2026, our pricing strategy is intensely focused on margin recovery and moving back towards our earnings growth targets. In Medicare we have historically targeted an operating margin range of 3% to 5%. Now, with the changes from the Inflation Reduction Act on the Part D program which resulted in higher revenue but do not impact earnings, the equivalent target margin range is in the 2% to 4% range.\nWe are working intensively to remediate Medicare through pricing, product design, and benefit changes that will enable us to be within the lower half of the targeted margin ranges in 2026 and advancing further in 2027.\nOur Medicare Advantage pricing strategy for 2026 assumes a trend approaching 10% compared to our current 7.5% trend expectation. This accounts for trend acceleration and incorporates factors such as changes in fee schedules and the continuation of higher yields from provider coding and billing practices.\nConsidering the continued cost trends, funding pressures, and the need to support margin recovery, we have made significant adjustments to benefits. Additionally and unfortunately, given these pressures, we have made the difficult decision to exit plans that currently serve over 600,000 members primarily in less managed products such as PPO offerings. We have taken similar approaches for Medicare Supplement, Group MA, and standalone Part D pricing for next year. We will be watching the market closely as the 2026 Medicare offerings become public so we can better assess our market positioning and respond quickly.\nFor commercial, because renewals occur over the course of the year, we are able to price for changes more dynamically. Our pricing will anticipate higher trend continuing into 2026 and 2027. We expect increased membership decline as well as shifts into both Level Funded and self-funded product categories because of higher medical cost trends.\nIn the individual exchange business. While we are prepared to continue to participate in the majority of the 30 markets we currently serve, we will approach them far more conservatively for 2026. We may need to make the difficult decision to exit select markets if we are unable to achieve the rates necessary for higher market-wide morbidity. Additionally, due to the projected expiration of premium subsidies across the ACA market, our membership should decline significantly, and we are mindful of the potential for adverse selection dynamics as we reprice these offerings for next year.\nIn Medicaid, there remains a lag between funding levels and member health risk, and we expect this to continue into 2026, resulting in additional margin compression in the business, including a loss within the non-dual segment of Medicaid in 2026. Membership losses from early adoption of recent legislation is also factored into our initial views for 2026. Wherever states support responsible funding for Medicaid, we remain committed to serving people through that program and view this as integral to our mission.\nThe American health system's long-standing cost problem is accelerating. We are embracing our responsibility to continue to drive better health outcomes while trying to keep health care affordable for all Americans. The operational and pricing strategies I have described reflect our understanding of the challenges we face as a company and a society and our dedication to responsibly navigating the current financial pressures so that we can set a stable course for the future. I'll now turn it over to Patrick Conway, CEO of Optum.\n\nPatrick Conway\n\nCEO, Optum\n\nThanks Tim. Clearly, Optum's performance this year has also not met expectations. Yours or ours? Echoing Tim and Steve, we are approaching this with humility, and the need for deep analysis of key issues, and commitment to substantially improved execution. Serving our patients and customers is at the heart of our mission and business, and we have the opportunity to truly help make the health system better for everyone.\nTo do that, we need to refocus on our performance discipline with a bias for action and transparency for all stakeholders. We have launched our agenda of change at Optum, starting with the evolution of our leadership team. Roger Connor brings tremendous experience in organizational execution as our Chief Financial Officer. Krista Nelson is a deeply experienced healthcare operator now in the new role of Chief Operating Officer of Optum Health.\nDhivya Suryadevara is already re-energizing product development, marketing, and service as the new CEO of Optum Insight, and Jon Mahrt brings his unmatched pharmacy services experience to bolster the already compelling offerings of OptumRx. These are not the only people in new roles, and there will be more. We are taking these and many other steps swiftly to enable Optum to recapture its historic momentum.\nLet me turn now to a review of our businesses, starting with Optum Health, where improved execution is needed most and we are experiencing the greatest pressures to our business. Our belief remains steadfast. Value-based care has the potential to transform healthcare, yet even as we struggle to align this model with new funding dynamics, it consistently delivers better outcomes.\nTim highlighted the challenges of rising healthcare unit cost, accelerating service volumes, and provider coding intensity, which further underscores that value-based care remains the most effective method for compensating providers to improve and sustain a patient's health, in contrast to simply increasing the volume and price of services.\nResearch consistently supports this premise, showing Medicare Advantage patients in fully accountable arrangements are 20% less likely to be hospitalized and experience 11% fewer ER visits compared to those in fee-for-service. We are early in our value-based care journey. We know we have real and self-inflicted executional challenges, and we bear the responsibility to get this right.\nRecognizing that urgent work lies ahead, we have spent a decade assembling a care delivery model today serving nearly 20 million patients across three lines of business, value-based care, fee-for-service, care delivery, and services, the latter two of which help further enable value-based care. The first category, value-based care, has grown to account for approximately 65% of Optum Health's revenues and serves 5 million patients in fully accountable arrangements.\nI'll provide more details on this in a moment, but first we'll detail the gap to our original Optum Health outlook.\nOverall Optum Health earnings in 2025 are approximately $6.6 billion below our expectations. To break this down, approximately $3.6 billion or 55% is concentrated in our value-based care business with three principal drivers of roughly equal weight. Number one, the mix of enrollment, including more complex and dually eligible members and more new to Optum patients who are underserved.\nTwo, accelerated medical trend, particularly physician and outpatient in Medicare, and behavioral and Medicaid; and three, underestimation of new members risk status as they come into our care and suboptimal execution of the V28 risk model transition. Second category, another $2 billion or 30% relates to the decision to discontinue previously planned portfolio actions, and about $1 billion or 15% from a combination of lower service volumes in our services businesses, some non-recurring prior period impacts, and the slowing of tuck-in acquisitions, for example on lower service volumes.\nIn 2025 we planned for approximately 20 million fee-for-service visits in our care delivery clinics, and we are tracking 19 million visits or 5% below this expectation.\nLet me dive a bit deeper, specifically into factors affecting our value-based care business. First, V28. This industry-wide shift is effectively a price reduction that we now estimate created an $11 billion headwind over three years for Optum Health, with $7 billion that will be realized through 2025. That is $2 billion and $1 billion, respectively, more than our initial estimates. While we also overestimated the impact and misexecuted the planned efforts to offset these V28 funding cuts.\nSecond, enrollment mix. Consistent with Q1 in 2025, we have an unanticipated number of new to Optum Health patients who are previously underserved. These new patients are largely in markets where numerous plan exits occurred. They include complex patients who require time to be managed effectively by us. This mix impact implies negative margins near double digits for these new patients, which will improve meaningfully in 2026.\nLastly, the elevated medical trend we recognized in Q2 was exacerbated by insufficient pricing within UnitedHealthcare and other payer partners pulling through in the form of insufficient capitation rates for Optum. Despite these headwinds, Optum's fully accountable value-based care business is delivering an operating margin of about 1% in 2025. This compares to full year operating margins of over 3% in 2024 and nearly 5% in 2023.\nA large part of the MIS execution addressing the V28 funding cuts was due to non-standardized and overly localized management approach which we are addressing with urgency. We are driving to a consistent and much more concentrated regional operating model with four market leaders. We are evaluating our position in each market. We will shift risk back to the original underwriters until we have the hardened capacity to navigate it under value-based constructs and Optum will be much more disciplined in taking risk arrangements in product designs and constructs that allow value-based care to have its intended impact.\nThe margin compression reflects significant growth in new membership cohorts with nearly 40% of patients served today having come in since the beginning of 2024. It also reflects the pull through for Medicare Advantage pricing dislocation Tim described and the V28 payment cuts.\nRegarding patient cohorts and our value-based care practices, margins improve the longer patients remain. Our most mature value-based care cohorts, those from 2021 and prior, are operating at an estimated 8+% margin in 2025. Those in 2022 and 2023 cohorts are operating at a 2% margin. The 2024 through 2025 groups are at negative margins.\nStrong physician engagement, appropriate medical diagnosis, and improved consistent quality of care continues to drive year-over-year improvement in a cohort's financial performance and in their health. But it's taking too long and there is too much variability in results among practices. We are actively addressing those factors.\nThat's the overall picture of what is happening. I'll turn now to remediation. Our plan for improvement has four key elements. First and foremost, we are improving the implementation and consistency of our clinical model which is anchored in primary care and supported by wraparound services that continue to outperform on quality and cost.\nSecond, we are committed to margin recovery in value-based care. We've aligned our 2026 benefits and product portfolio and footprint with our payer partners to address the final year of V28 headwinds. We plan to cease arrangements for about 200,000 patients largely in fully accountable PPO products representing approximately 40% of the PPO patients we serve today.\nWe expect to keep narrowing our exposure beyond 2026. We are increasing rates to reflect the higher risk profiles and acuity we are seeing and expect to continue. We believe the combination of these activities will mitigate about half the remaining $4 billion V28 headwind in 2026. The remainder of our offset will come from operating cost discipline, and consistent execution of our care programs which enhance engagement, diagnosis accuracy, and quality outcomes and reduce overall cost of care.\nWith 2026 being the final year of V28 phase-in, you should expect 2026 value-based care margins to remain relatively consistent with the 1% margin we are achieving this year and then begin to advance again in 2027 and beyond.\nWe are optimizing our portfolio of clinical practices. We are managing our fee-for-service and fully accountable-risk practices to align with performance expectations, transitioning to partial risk or service arrangements where necessary, and exiting fully accountable products in certain markets. Third, we are aggressively advancing operational disciplines across our portfolio of businesses.\nThe more concentrated operating model I mentioned earlier plays into more standardized approaches, predictable outcomes, and lower operating cost. We will complete the final stages of our technology integration, which will enable meaningful advances with emerging technologies like AI to drive efficiency gains. For 2026, we expect to deliver almost $1 billion in cost reductions.\nFinally, beyond value-based care, Optum Health also includes fee-for-service care delivery, including home care, ambulatory surgical care, and medical practices that are not yet fully accountable but support value-based care.\nThese together account for 15% of Optum Health's revenues. Most of these businesses are performing well and operate at low double digit margins. However, the primary care and multi-specialty medical practices that are not yet fully accountable are running at negative margins, generating hundreds of millions of losses this year alone, placing the overall fee-for-service care delivery business in the mid single digit margin range.\nSo we are actively working to improve payment yields and productivity while growing these high-value services and fee-for-service margins. We are targeting growth for these services which are projected to deliver strong year-over-year earnings growth in 2026.\nThe third component of Optum Health Services is comprised of businesses including managed behavioral health, military and veterans, and health financial services. These account for about 20% of Optum Health revenues and combined have an almost 10% operating margins.\nOverall at Optum Health. While we expect continued pressure for the rest of this year, we anticipate meaningful improvement in our operations and with earnings growth in 2026, albeit with a longer path to recovery in our value-based care business. We now see Optum Health long-term margins in the 6% to 8% range at about 5% for value-based care. Specifically, as we see significant growth opportunity for the decade to come, the overall blended margin will reflect the early-year investment losses generated by new cohorts. Optum Health is early in its development and mixed execution is a clear setback, but the long-term growth potential and expectations remain intact and significant.\nMoving to Optum Insight. There is a great need and appetite for technology and data products to help the health system perform more efficiently and effectively. Yet Optum Insight has not fully capitalized on this opportunity. That's largely due to an unfocused suite of products, lagging innovation, and longer than expected impact from last year's cyber attack, which unfortunately came at the expense of being able to drill down on business innovation, operations, and growth.\nBut as I mentioned earlier, we have a talented team in place now and continue to recruit talent to develop the next generation of products rooted in AI. As it relates specifically to 2025, we are adjusting our outlook downward by $1 billion. About half of this is due to more gradual recovery than initially expected in some of our volume-based businesses due to Change Healthcare and one-time cyber-related expenses. The other half is due to pausing previously planned portfolio actions so that we can prioritize growth and innovation across our broader portfolio.\nAt OptumRx, client retention remains high and consistent with past years. We expect revenue growth of $18 billion or 13% and earnings growth of just over $200 million or nearly 4% driven by low margin specialty drugs. Compared to the strong revenue growth rate, our earnings growth has been constrained by four main factors. The removal of portfolio actions from our plan is roughly $150 million headwind.\nAnother $50 million is from a couple of ancillary businesses where we are taking aggressive corrective actions and adjusting plans, and the impact of initial launch phase of our private label business, Nuvela, is a roughly $150 million headwind. As it matures, we see Nuvela delivering affordability for our clients and consumers and strong earnings for OptumRx. Additionally, GLP-1s, which can benefit appropriate patients, continue to impact earnings representing $160 million headwind for our pharmacy services businesses.\nAfter three months in this role, I want to thank the thousands of people serving in Optum and to let external stakeholders know that the problems are fixable and that Optum will continue to drive long-term growth and make the most of our opportunity to serve people. I'll turn it over to our President and Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\n\nJohn Rex\n\nPresident and CFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThanks Patrick.\nI'll first walk through Q2 results, then provide some color around the underlying assumptions within our re-established 2025 outlook. Starting with Q2, UnitedHealth Group reported revenues of nearly $112 billion, a 13% increase over the prior year, which reflected growth across UnitedHealthcare and Optum. Adjusted earnings per share of $4.08 was below the same period last year. This was due primarily to the pricing and Medical Cost Trend factors at UnitedHealthcare and Optum Health.\nIncluded is about $1.2 billion in discrete items. A little over half reflects the recognition of unfavorable impacts to our ACA Exchange offerings, which I will describe later in more detail. The remainder is the settlement of several outstanding items which have been in dispute or for which collection has recently become questionable. Most of these items arise from prior years.\nThe full-year 2025 outlook we've offered today accommodates $1 billion in additional potential such items that we may seek to resolve in 2025.\nNow, on to business overviews at UnitedHealthcare. Q2 revenues grew by over $12 billion to $86.1 billion, while operating earnings declined by $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion, primarily due to the medical trend factors Tim discussed within our Medicare businesses. Year to date, Medicare Advantage growth is 650,000 people, including those who are dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare.\nAs noted, the Q2 results reflect just over $600 million of unfavorable impacts from our ACA Exchange business, which includes acceleration of anticipated second half losses with the establishment of a Premium Deficiency Reserve. This is due to the higher patient morbidity that is pervasive across the entire exchange market.\nGiven competitive market dynamics, we have less member growth within our commercial offerings than initially anticipated. ACA exchange drives about 1/3 of our reduced commercial risk member growth outlook for 2025 with group insured comprising much.\nOf the rest of the.\nAs outlined earlier, our Medicaid offerings continue to experience pressure from the lag in state rate updates relative to the health status of the members being served. Our state partners remain highly engaged in ongoing rate conversations, and we are closely attuned to the federal funding changes and the continued pace of medical cost trends, particularly in behavioral health.\nMoving to Optum. Optum Health revenues were $25.2 billion in the second quarter, a decline of $1.8 billion from last year. This was driven by the previously noted contract adjustments and the effects of the Medicare funding reductions.\nOptum Health now expects to add 300,000 new value-based care patients this year compared to the initial 650,000 outlook as it seeks to focus on improving operating performance.\nAs noted, we've updated our long-term target margin objective for Optum Health to the 6% to 8% range.\nOptum Insight had revenues of $4.8 billion, an increase of $285 million or 6% year-over-year. We continue to progress on customer recovery following last year's cyber event, albeit pacing more slowly than expected, and this is a component of the reduced full-year outlook. The contract revenue backlog at the end of Q2 was $32.1 billion. OptumRx Q2 revenues grew $6 billion, or 19% over last year to $38.5 billion, driven by new customer adds as well as continued contribution from specialty products. Total adjusted scripts were 414 million compared to 399 million in the year-ago quarter.\nMoving on to 2025 guidance, our adjusted earnings outlook is at least $16 per share. Revenues will approach $448 billion, growth of 11% over 2024. We now expect a full year medical care ratio of 89.25% ±25 points. This compares to the initial 86.5% midpoint we offered at the end of last year, with the increase driven by the factors discussed within. This seasonal pacing compared to historical measures is impacted somewhat by the Part D coverage gap modifications due to the Inflation Reduction Act.\nWith first half results at the midpoint. That places the second half at just under 91.5%, with the fourth quarter expected to be the highest, and at this distance, a relatively proportionate distribution on either side.\nThe full year outlook contemplates a total of $1.6 billion of potential settlement items, an incremental $1 billion over the $600 million recognized in Q2.\nOur tax rate for the year is now estimated at about 18.5%, affected by our revised earnings outlook as expected. Benefits remained steady while earnings declined. The lower tax expense in the second quarter reflects the year to date recognition of the updated full year effective tax rate. We expect the second half rate to be just over 20%.\nFull year 2025. Cash flows from operations are expected to be about $16 billion or 1.1x net income. In June we increased our dividend by 5% and we will strike a balance as to how we use capital over the near term, being thoughtful about maintaining a strong balance sheet and credit rating, and mindful of long-standing commitments including the pending Amedisys transaction.\nOur updated share count of 912 to 914 million compares to the original outlook of 918 to 923 million and considers only share repurchase completed earlier this year.\nWe will continue to balance and assess our capital priorities as we progress to returning to the performance levels we know we can achieve.\nWith that, I will hand it back over to Steve before we head into Q&A.\n\nStephen Hemsley\n\nChairman and CEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThanks John. This is a challenging year for our enterprise, but I feel strongly we can overcome these challenges as we've done before. I can see the depth of the commitment of our team. We are regaining the intensity, the precision, and the executional disciplines required to perform consistently and reliably. Our customers and our shareholders deserve it and the health system expects us to function at our full potential.\nAs we look towards 2026 and beyond, we expect the efforts we discussed throughout today's call to steadily improve our performance. It begins with respecting pricing basics, advancing our foresight acumen, and just better, more intense, more decisive overall management. We will be driving better business practices, better consumer and provider experience, and accelerating investments in areas in key areas to both strengthen our foundations and modernize our businesses.\nAnchored in practical innovations and scaled AI applications, we are continuing to evaluate the investments we need to make in the near term to meet our long term growth potential while acknowledging the challenging environment in the year ahead.\nAs I mentioned at our shareholder meeting in June, we're rebuilding the trust through both change and through increased transparency. That includes work to ensure a wide range of stakeholders have confidence in the integrity of our company and our business practices. This work is moving forward in our assessment of key policies, practices, and associated processes by the end of Q3 and our first Performance Measures report in Q4.\nWe have retained independent experts to oversee and assist in these reviews, including the Analysis Group and FTI Consulting. We will use this to continually strengthen and advance our strong compliance environment. Looking to 2026 at this distance, I would expect solid but moderate earnings growth. As we look further ahead, we see our earnings growth outlook strengthening quickly in 2027 and pacing steadily upward over the succeeding years. Now let's open it up for questions.\nOperator, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe floor is now open for questions. At this time, if you have a question or a comment, please press star one on your touchtone phone. You may remove yourself from the queue by pressing star two on your touchtone phone. We ask you to limit yourself to one question. If you ask multiple questions, we will only be answering the first question so that we can respond to everyone in the queue this morning.\nOur first question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS.\n\nA.J. Rice\n\nManaging Director and Senior Healthcare Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nHi everybody. Maybe just to drill down a little bit on Optum Health, if I could. You're talking about some rate increases or how you're pricing for a much higher trend in MA on the insurance side. I would assume that has some trickle down benefit to Optum Health. Or when you're talking about having margin.\nConsistent with this year, next year on.\nThe physician piece, is that does that.\nyou contemplate some benefit from that repricing, and maybe as well talk about your discussions with the outside plans that Optum Health contracts. I mean, are you seeing them make similar steps toward pricing for a more reasonable margin next year that you're trying.\nTo do at UHC?\n\nStephen Hemsley\n\nChairman and CEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nIt certainly does, A.J., Patrick, you want to comment?\n\nPatrick Conway\n\nCEO, Optum\n\nYeah, thanks A.J. for the question. Let me take the sort of pieces in parts. So yes, in terms of the pricing across payers, UnitedHealthcare and other payers as they adjust pricing that flows into our capitation rates, that is a tailwind versus the headwind we saw this year. We're also working with our payer partners on benefit reductions, which we talked about. So significant benefit reductions across payer partners and a much tighter transparent bidirectional dialogue in this year, which I think sets us up better for next year. Those combinations we think mitigates 50% of the headwinds of V28, which as you heard, we sized at $4 billion for next year.\nThe other two components that will mitigate the other 50%—one, operating cost reductions, where we continue to hone our model using AI and other tools, generating operating cost reductions, and then next, deep engagement with the patient cohorts we see. So as you heard, as we mature and remain stable in those cohorts, you have increased performance over time. So as you pace into 2026, as you heard, we believe we can maintain those margins at the 1% level.\nObviously, we'll continue to do the work each day to see if there's any upside to that potential, but the approach this year with our payers has been tight, close, and I think will bear benefits going into 2026.\n\nStephen Hemsley\n\nChairman and CEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThank you, Pat. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\n\nJustin Lake\n\nManaging Director and Senior Healthcare Services Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks.\nGood morning. Appreciate all the detail. Wanted to focus on the run rate out of 2025 into 2026. So it looks like you're about $5 of earnings for the second half. I add back about $1 for the discrete items that John mentioned. You're about $6 bucks given typical seasonality. Maybe that's like $13 of run rate earnings. So wanted to see if that's reasonable math first and then what are the moving parts that drive EPS growth specifically. Maybe you could talk to where your MA margins are this year versus where you expect them to be next year.\n\nStephen Hemsley\n\nChairman and CEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThanks.\nJustin.\nJohn.\n\nJohn Rex\n\nPresident and CFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nHey Justin, good morning, it's John.\nRex.\nJust a few comments on that. Yes, your overall kind of assessment.\nSecond half is correct.\nA few things I'd point to, and then I think that's Tim and Bobby to comment a little bit also on, as we talk about Medicare Advantage margins.\nAnd where that goes.\nI mean the key elements here.\nYes, we are kind of looking at getting some things behind us in terms of the actions we're taking. We anticipate taking in the second half, and as you know really quite well, 80% of our premium revenues repriced on 1 January. Very significant impact in terms of that as you move into that next year, in terms of the impact that creates off the run rate that you see going into the second half. I'd ask Bobby to maybe comment a little bit specifically on your piece on Medicare Advantage.\n\nBobby Hunter\n\nCEO of Government Programs, UnitedHealthcare\n\nYeah, yeah. Thanks, Justin, for the question. Thanks, John.\nJustin, when you think about 2026 or 2025 where we're likely to kind of pencil out for the balance of the year, here is more in the low end of the new normal range that Tim outlined in his prepared remarks. Think kind of the 2% to 2.5% range, and I'm talking about kind of all broad based UHC Medicare in that bucket.\nThen, given the actions that we're taking for 2026, the meaningful benefit cuts, the plan reductions, the trend that we're pricing towards, we do believe that will allow us to overcome some of the headwinds again tied to, you know, V28 funding cuts and that embedded trend, and expand those margins to a range of 2.5% to 3%. Think about us then getting to kind of the midpoint of that range by 2027 and advancing from there.\n\nTim Noel\n\nCEO, UnitedHealthcare\n\nThanks for the question. Justin.\nYeah, really kind of the math that you're looking at here. Continued trend accelerations that we look at through the end of the year while our revenues are staying the same, and then we get to 1 January where the vast majority of our premium revenues reset. That's really the impact that you're seeing in terms of as you look at that H2 run rate.\nWhere we come out.\n\nStephen Hemsley\n\nChairman and CEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThank you. Next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.\n\nJosh Raskin\n\nResearch Analyst, Nephron Research\n\nThanks.\nGood morning.\nI appreciate some of the commentary you've made on 26 and 27 even. Do you have an updated view on your long-term EPS growth rate? It was formerly cited at 13% to 16% at the enterprise level, and then I heard the target margins obviously updated for Optum Health. Do you have updated target margins for maybe UnitedHealthcare in its entirety, as well as the other two segments within Optum?\n\nStephen Hemsley\n\nChairman and CEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah, thanks Josh for the question. You know, as you can appreciate, as we just coming back on stream in the near term, our growth rates do not reflect, I think, the potential of this enterprise. From it's somewhat academic, but I expect we will pace back steadily to low double-digit ranges and continue to advance from there.\nI think, importantly, the framework for our long-term growth outlook remains very much intact, reasonable year-over-year organic growth from within well-run businesses, the compounding effect of deliberate productivity gains, the compounding effect of capital applied in the form of share buybacks as we return value and capital to shareholders, and the compounding effect of capital use in evolving the business model toward a more expansive view of the healthcare markets that is less fragmented, more integrated to better serve consumers.\nThe overall system and the components of that should allow us to continue to grow at the strong levels we've experienced in the past. That's our outlook on it.\n\nJohn Rex\n\nPresident and CFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nJosh, just maybe a little bit on margins. Maybe Tim has a comment, and he made some comments on Medicare in particular with the IRA changes. Tim, maybe if you just could reflect on those.\n\nTim Noel\n\nCEO, UnitedHealthcare\n\nGood morning, Josh. Thank you. You know, we talked about the reframing of the broad-based Medicare Advantage targeted margin range. Really, kind of really not all that different, just the mechanical implications of more revenue coming through the IRA without necessarily any incremental earnings.\nAs Bobby just talked about, you know, we see that pacing to closer to the midpoint in 2026 and getting there in 2027 on the commercial business. 2026 will be a year where we'll not get all the way into our target margin range of 7% to 9%, but certainly see path to get there thereafter. Really, no change bottom line to the targeted margin range across UnitedHealthcare.\n\nStephen Hemsley\n\nChairman and CEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nJohn, any more?\n\nJohn Rex\n\nPresident and CFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nI think just maybe Tim's comment that he made on the call in terms of how he thinks about Medicare Advantage with the addition of those IRA dollars and such doesn't change really the productivity of the business. It's just that that piece of the revenue impacts the margin calculation that came in, a piece of revenue that came in without really any earning to when it came in.\nSimilar profile and in general I don't think we've actually ever seen the full portfolio of Optum perform to its full potential. I think that should be strongly additive, as well as the emergence of the Optum Insight businesses, the strong margins that are coming off the platform of more technology-enabled services. Those elements play in. It is so early in our restart that to me the discussion of a long-term growth rate seems somewhat academic, other than the framework for our historical outlook remains fully intact.\n\nStephen Hemsley\n\nChairman and CEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nNext question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Kevin Fishbeck with Bank of America.\n\nKevin Fishbeck\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nOkay, great, thanks. You know, in your commentary around the guidance reduction, you mentioned across a number of businesses that you had portfolio actions that you're delaying. Can you talk a little bit about.\nWhat exactly those types of actions were.\nAcross the businesses, are those potential savings still something that you think you're going to execute on, or are those not the right ways to think about it? Is, you know, adding those up and then coming up with, you know, an earnings power number at some point?\nOver the next couple of years. Thanks.\n\nStephen Hemsley\n\nChairman and CEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nClarify the question.\nI'm not sure I understand portfolio actions.\n\nKevin Fishbeck\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYeah, you mentioned a number of things.\nLike when you're trying to bridge between.\nLike you know, the Medicare Advantage.\nResults this year versus, you know, what you.\nAssumed would happen, you put, I think you put some buckets in there saying.\nYou were going to do some things and then you decided to, to put them on pause.\nIs that not the right way to think about it?\n\nStephen Hemsley\n\nChairman and CEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThese are on transactions. Yeah, so.\nThat's a good question because I do think that needs to be clarified. The company pursued kind of a re-evaluation of the portfolio of all of its businesses last year, and we're taking actions to position some of the businesses.\nDivested some that I think is evident in our results. As I came in and looked at that, my orientation is to pursue more the.\nPerformance of the business portfolio that we have, make those businesses perform to their full potential. I think that portfolio needs to be considered in light of.\nYou know, what I think the real performance potential is. We stopped that entire activity, and some of that was considered in the outlook in the current year, and that has been withdrawn completely. We are focused on the performance of the businesses that we have, and we'll pick up portfolio assessment somewhere down the road. Right now, our focus is on the portfolio that we have, and we have removed any of that from our outlook.\nNext question, please. Does that answer your question?\nKevin, does that answer your question?\n\nKevin Fishbeck\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nActually maybe.\nJust to clarify.\nAre these businesses that you thought.\nYou were going to be losing money, and you're now going to keep them.\nFocusing on the earnings power going.\nForward, or was there something around gains on sales or things like that that you were going to recognize from the.\nVesting things that you're not going to. Include in the guidance?\n\nStephen Hemsley\n\nChairman and CEO, UnitedHealth Group",
    "content2": "Oh, I think that's a much more complex issue, Kevin. I think the motivations for those transactions all have different reasons. Some of those businesses we thought were better in the hands of others. Others were thought to be, let's say, not core. But we're really not debating that right now. I think all solid businesses, and we'll continue to run them, optimize their performance, and then consider their long term standing in our portfolio.\nNext question please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.\n\nLance Wilkes\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Bernstein\n\nGreat. Can you talk a little bit about the management process and strategic review process that you've undertaken with the company and where you are to date with that? Maybe providing some insight into what the management process was previously and the changes you've made to it. And then from a strategic review process, would you say you're completed with any sort of strategic review or are there any sort of timeline associated with future strategic review? Thanks.\n\nStephen Hemsley\n\nChairman and CEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nWell, I'm not sure I know what you mean by strategic review, but just kind of thematically address this. Probably just 70 plus days in.\nKind of returning to what I would call very basic fundamental discipline. So much greater intensity around.\nDepth of review of the businesses, underlying financial levers, et cetera. Core of the economic levers in the businesses. You know, basically just a much more intensive.\nMonthly management review of business performance. Not just on financials, but on operating metrics, on relationships with the external stakeholders, on future potential, on the.\nProgress made on remediation efforts and programs, offsetting some of the headwinds that we have discussed this morning like V28 and so forth. So just a really comprehensive business by business review.\nAssessment of the performance prospects of the businesses. I'd say relatively, in the near term.\nMuch more broader engagement of the management team and engaging our resources across the enterprise to take just a very fresh objective look at all of the businesses, the progress made in terms of their undertakings, and maybe refocusing those things to things that.\nLet’s say a more narrow, more concentrated agenda of priorities, faster decision making, changes in people. There have been, I think, as Pat described, pretty far reaching changes across the entire Optum portfolio that is still.\nIn motion across our other businesses and across corporate. So.\nI'm just basically rambling to give you a sense that it is a much more intensive, everyday kind of engagement. We have returned to monthly business meetings. We are focused on, on six underlying.\nDirections along those lines, and the leadership team has really engaged exceptionally well. We have returned to work across the enterprise, just to give you an example of things like that. I just think there is a new tone and a new expectation setting in.\nAnd then we are going to continue to drill down on these businesses and get much more granular, particularly as we get in and complete the 2026 planning process. So I think that gives you a feel for it.\n\nLance Wilkes\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Bernstein\n\nGreat, thanks.\n\nStephen Hemsley\n\nChairman and CEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Lisa Gill with J.P. Morgan.\n\nLisa Gill\n\nManaging Director and Head of Healthcare Services Research, J.P. Morgan\n\nThanks very much. Good morning Steve. When you talked about 2026, you talked about this steady improvement, but you also.\nSaid you need to evaluate investments.\nHow should I think about that for 2026? Are there incremental costs that you need.\nTo bring online.\nOther investments that you.\nNeed to make in the business as we think about 2026 and if we.\nDo we have incremental investments in 2026? How do we think about the returns on those investments in the timeline?\n\nStephen Hemsley\n\nChairman and CEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nSo.\nYou know, coming into.\nKind of returning to this environment, you obviously looked at, particularly with the results at the cost structures, the organizational.\nApproaches that have been taken and so forth. You know, I think there are meaningful cost opportunities.\nWithin the enterprise, but I and we are pursuing them with urgency. But I also believe that we should be balanced, that there are areas that we have underinvested and they include.\nAreas of Optum Insight where Patrick talked about the performance challenges there. Optum Insight, I think, can be a remarkable business, but we need to pay more attention to it, make sure it has stable and deep leadership, and we need to make the investments in updating the product offerings, which are largely a portfolio of point to point solutions, and with the technology capacities we have and the expertise we have, make them much more compelling end to end kind of impacts.\nThat would be just one example. I think our AI agenda, Sandeep, has gotten real traction on that agenda, and I intend to accelerate it, to really infuse this entire enterprise with an AI first orientation and also use that as a means to develop the capabilities to again revitalize products really across the enterprise. I'd also tell you that again in what I'll view as Optum Insight, Dhivya, who's leading that business, the fintech agenda for that could also be compelling and has also been underinvested, and we have an excellent and distinctive platform there, and we need to push forward on that.\nSo I think there are so many areas of opportunity that really are near term for us. Do I think they will translate? I think they'll translate into good contributions for 2026.\nBut I think not only do we need a little money, we need a little bit of time. And so I do think 2027, 2028 is really where you're going to see acceleration in those for sure in 2027. So does that give you a feel for those kinds of things? And I don't know Patrick or Dhivya, if you have other commentary.\n\nPatrick Conway\n\nCEO, Optum\n\nSo just briefly building what Steve said and then Dhivya, feel free to add on. Look, I think Optum Insight and Optum Financial and the AI Agenda are a large area of opportunity as we interact with clients and customers. We hear that from payers, providers, others. They want our support in those areas. So I think it's both external and internal. Internal on cost savings, external on growth and innovation as Steve alluded to. And Dhivya, turn over to you if you want to add more.\n\nDhivya Suryadevara\n\nCEO, Optum Financial\n\nYeah, Lisa, coming into this business and just giving it a fresh look, there is a lot to be optimistic about in both of these businesses, Optum Insight and Optum Financial. There's some structural tailwinds when you think about it. Firstly, as Steve said, payers and providers are looking for tech forward solutions to help solve their problems and the headwinds that they face. Coming in, I'm finding that we have deep customer relationships and domain knowledge that will help us do that. On top of that, combining Optum Insight and Optum Financial, we're able to create unified solutions that are going to offer the market a lot more financial flexibility, and that's something that the market really needs.\nSo what we're doing is taking all these trends, and we're coming up with a product portfolio that's AI based, and we're launching. We've already launched this year an AI powered RCM solution. Later this year we'll be launching an AI powered real time coordination of benefits. So think of this as early innings in our product journey, and we're going to have more launches coming out in the coming quarters and years, which makes me very optimistic about the future of the business. As Steve said, this is not an area we've focused in in the past, but we have the right strategy, we have the right investments, and we have the right team to go execute. Thank you.\n\nStephen Hemsley\n\nChairman and CEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nI'll just make two other comments, and one pretty basic, and that is you come in and you take a look and you see cost opportunities for sure, and starting at corporate and the corporate versions of the business units, and you basically are sitting back saying.\nWe're going to pull those back and we're going to make the investments in the businesses that we think can produce remarkable performance for us going forward, high margin businesses, et cetera. That plays into the long-term growth view. That is if we.\nExecute on those which have always been in our strategic sights, the contributions of those can be distinctive and plays into.\nA very.\nPositive long term growth outlook. Next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.\n\nStephen Baxter\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, hi. Thanks. I think you suggested the long term.\nTarget margin for value based care is now 5%.\nI think this is also what you.\nSuggested the business earned as recently as 2023 before the onset of V28.\nSo it just might be helpful to.\nBetter understand, I guess, what were the old value-based care target margins that compare the 5% to?\nI heard you loud and clear talk about expected stability in 2026.\nCan you better help us understand the.\nMargin drivers beyond 2026, with the exception maybe of the MA repricing, which we already understand, to get back to that 5%.\nThank you.\n\nStephen Hemsley\n\nChairman and CEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah, maybe we'll start with Patrick, and then if John wants to comment about kind of the change of perspective on margins there. Patrick.\n\nPatrick Conway\n\nCEO, Optum\n\nYeah, thanks, Stephen, for the question.\nYou did hear correctly. Optum Health margin all in 6% to 8%, value-based care as we sit today, you know, estimating around that 5% level. Really the issue is the significant.\nRevenue hit to the system with V28 and what that meant, and adjusting the curve, adjusting the impact. I'd point you back to the cohorts that we called out. I think this is critical in years one and two, which is about 40% of our membership as we stand today in 2025. Negative margins, years three to four cohorts, 2% margins, year five plus 8+% margins. If you look at the progression as we focus on taking risk in markets that we're confident in our ability to perform, and in products, primarily HMO, confident in our ability to perform, focused on employed and contracted positions, you should see those cohort shifts. Years one to two will be more in the range at 25% to 30% of the portfolio, years five plus more 40+% that gets you to that 5.\nRange in terms of margins. As you heard on the services businesses, we've got services businesses often with a margin around 10%. We'll continue to grow those. I'd call out in care delivery fee-for-service, we have an opportunity for both growth and margin improvement. Home health, low double digits; surgical centers in the range of 20%. In care deliveries in our clinics, we've got opportunities, especially in some regions, to improve performance, improve that margin portfolio, and improve the performance of the care delivery service.\n\nJohn Rex\n\nPresident and CFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nStephen, it's considering the change in the Optum Health margin target. Most of that is driven by really.\nThe value-based care.\nThe value-based care perspective and what's going on there is really we are.\nBeing a little more circumspect about how.\nIt takes to get these practices into the zone that we need them to be in, the appropriate amount of time to get them performing as they should perform.\nThat's a component there.\nThe conversion for those that are still mostly fee-for-service and getting those into a position where they can actually also start becoming fully accountable practices is important. Elements in that, and then this perspective that at 5 million patients served today, that should be.\nAddressable market is much, much larger than that and that we will be continuing to do this for a decade as Patrick has stated in his prepared comments. The investments that that take, a little more circumspect about the investments that we need to put in to bring these into full production. Patrick noted that some of the.\nLongest standing vintages or cohorts of members are performing at 8% plus margins. We're giving ourselves more time to get there and also giving ourselves more investment room. Maybe echoing a little on what Steve said in terms of the investments we need to make into getting them fully ready and to be performing, and that we'll be making these investments for the next decade as we grow this business.\n\nStephen Hemsley\n\nChairman and CEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nMore so, 6 to 8 becomes a much more rational and better guidance outlook. Good question. Thank you for asking it. Next please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald.\n\nSarah James\n\nManaging Director and Equity Analyst, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nThank you. Can you talk about any changes you've made in your management review process of underwriting assumptions and conservatism, and the independent party review that you talked about? Does that involve any of your underwriting process? Thank you.\n\nStephen Hemsley\n\nChairman and CEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYes, first I'll have maybe Tim comments about kind of underwriting perspectives as well. Maybe then Dan Schumacher, because kind of from an enterprise point of view, we are looking at.\nLet's say, strengthening underwriting and making sure that we are taking a total enterprise view from an underwriting point of view. Tim, you want to start?\n\nTim Noel\n\nCEO, UnitedHealthcare\n\nYes, thanks for the question, Sarah. With respect to, you know, underwriting and the processes associated with that, you know, we still feel like we have, you know, very strong people, processes in place to submit product filings, to analyze and assess our business. I think that's, you know, one of the reasons why we have a very clear view on what's happened in 2025. If there's one change, the change would be that I think we're a little bit more respectful of the environment that we're in and the dynamic nature of it.\nWe're contemplating that as we think about our pricing in all of our businesses, commercial, Medicare, and then we're going to use those data and analytics on the Medicaid side to approach our partners, our state partners, with data-driven insights as we talk about how to configure rates appropriately moving forward so that revenue matches the new acuity of these populations, but no fundamental change in the processes in people. We're very strong there, and these analytics will frankly drive the approach that we're seeing, which I think is appropriate and respectful of what's going on broadly in the healthcare industry.\n\nStephen Hemsley\n\nChairman and CEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nDan.\n\nDan Schumacher\n\nChief of Strategy and Growth Officer, UnitedHealth Group\n\nMorning, Sarah, this is Dan.\nAt the enterprise level, we are.\nWorking to strengthen our forecasting process. We've implemented an internal audit review that examines our guidance and the work that we put into that. We're also strengthening our actuarial resource base. To Tim's point, we'll be looking at the underlying trend builds across the company and across membership cohorts, as well as the revenue composition. Obviously, revenue is complex when you think about the interactions between.\nYou know, risk.\nModel changes and so forth.\nWe'll be doing that as well, likewise building out and strengthening our analytics, taking advantage of new approaches, working.\nWith Sandeep on the AI front.\nPulling in signals earlier, being able to adapt to those more quickly, and then propagate them rapidly across the enterprise.\nThose are some of the things. We have underway,\nAnd I think we already use third-party experts in our processes. That would not be anything new. I think we probably use as much or most of the resources in the marketplace along those lines and have for years. At the end of the day, as those processes come to closure, judgments are made, and judgments are made about market reads and how markets are predicted to perform. I think those judgments are some of the areas that are kind of sensitive in terms of outlook right now.\nThe oversight of those judgments and the conservativeness of them is also something we are taking into place and broadening those decisions across the enterprise. A good question, but it is definitely among the processes that are under review across the enterprise.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Andrew Mock with Barclays.\n\nAndrew Mock\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning. Wanted to follow up on Medicare margins. If we think about the three patient populations in Medicare Advantage, retail, group, and special needs, can you compare the relative margin profiles and different paths of margin recovery for each, including which population is most addressable near term?\nThanks.\n\nStephen Hemsley\n\nChairman and CEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nBobby please.\n\nBobby Hunter\n\nCEO of Government Programs, UnitedHealthcare\n\nHey, good morning, Andrew.\nBobby here. Yep, again, overall margins for 2025, think about 2% to 2.5%, 2026 expanding to 2.5% to 3%. We talked about early in the year some of the pressures that we were seeing in the group business, in particular with the trend pressure, kind of overweight in that area. I would say that phenomenon has continued. We continue to see certainly pressure on the medical side across all populations, but that one in particular has been elevated.\nYou know, group, as you kind of note, does have the opportunity to reprice each year, not dissimilar from, you know, individual MA. We are pursuing those discussions with our group customers, so think about the majority of those being able to be repriced on a given year.\nThat is absolutely kind of the path that we're moving down on the retail and SNP portions. You know, I would say both performing, you know, generally in line. Obviously, more of our growth this year is coming in both the D-SNP.\nC-SNP space.\nWe saw that in AEP. We've continued to see that as the years progressed. On balance, you know, that growth is accretive to the enterprise. Those are areas that we're going to continue to focus. I think we have the broad care management tools, you know, really that kind of best equip us in partnership with some of our value-based care providers like Optum to really effectively manage that population. That is going to be an area you continue to see us lean into heavily and bring the full capabilities and.\nAssets of the enterprise.\nOn the retail side, you know, we talked about obviously the different approach we're taking to trend for 2026 and different approach that we're taking to the products. The benefits exiting a significant number of plans and obviously impacting, as Tim noted, about 600,000 plus members. That is predominantly in the PPO space, and think about roughly 1/3 of those as kind of full market or sub market exits. You know, meaningful adjustments coming both on, you know, the individual side and the group side to help advance that margin progression for 2026.\n\nStephen Hemsley\n\nChairman and CEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThank you. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities.\n\nAnn Hynes\n\nSenior Healthcare Services Equity Analyst and Managing Director, Mizuho Securities\n\nGreat, thank you. I don't know if you addressed it.\nOn the call, can you remind.\nWhat your target margin is for Medicaid and what you expect it to be in 2026? Just to follow up, John, you had talked about 80% of the.\nPremium next year will increase because the.\nPricing cycle should improve in 2026 for the industry. Can you give us a compounded increase that you expect?\nThat would be great.\nThank you.\n\nStephen Hemsley\n\nChairman and CEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nPatrick.\n\nPatrick Conway\n\nCEO, Optum\n\nThank you for the question for 2025. We expect break-even performance for a non-dual or core Medicaid business under Community & State. Our 2025 Medicaid earnings outlook is down modestly due to persistent high medical trend stemming from care usage levels that are really higher than we realized in the final stages of redetermination, and also increased service intensity per encounter as identified within our claims data. We do expect some degradation with our cost benefits ratio driven by the 12.\nTo 18 month lag that we see.\nIn our core Medicaid rating cycle process, as we think about 2026, we contemplate negative margins at that time anywhere from negative 1% to negative 1.7%. Thank you for the question.\n\nJohn Rex\n\nPresident and CFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThis is John, following up on the rest of your question here, a few comments. I'm going to ask some of the UnitedHealthcare people to contribute to this here. As Bobby and Tim have explained, a lot of what happens in Medicare Advantage, you know, is the benefit redesign and then the cost trend assumptions they're building in. They've talked looking towards about a 10% trend for 2026 with the actual rate of premium increase determined by what CMS has come out with. Let's get a little deeper into that and talk about specific components, maybe even getting to commercial and some of the things that we're doing in there. Tim, I'll lead it with you and just go ahead.\n\nTim Noel\n\nCEO, UnitedHealthcare\n\nYeah. Answering the question around our long-term margins in the Medicaid business itself, excluding the dual special needs plans in Community & State, the rated margin that we attempt to attain with the states is around a 2% margin. Historically, we've talked that blending to a 3% to 5% margin within the Community & State segment.\nGiven the adjustments we've talked about around Medicare Advantage broadly moving from 3% to 5% to 2% to 4% because of the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act, we'd expect that to be mirrored in the Community & State growth targets. So 2% to 4% still in Community & State are adjusted to in Community & State, and Medicaid would be kind of a 2% targeted margin.\n\nPatrick Conway\n\nCEO, Optum\n\nAnn, in terms of the point you were making about kind of premium increases one would expect in 2026 as you go into that overall on the 80% of premiums renewal, Bobby and Tim shaping up, what happens in kind of those businesses, those government program businesses, and the premiums coming.\nFrom those customers and what they're.\nDoing and the benefit design underneath there. Maybe it'd be helpful if Dan Kueter comment a little bit on some of the pricing expectations in commercial markets and what he's seeing there, because that's another important part. What's driving that premium increase in that marketplace.\n\nJohn Rex\n\nPresident and CFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah, John sure can.\nIn 2025, as noted in Tim's remarks, trend in the commercial group business has materialized 100 basis points above our expectation, which has created some trend and margin pressure. We are well below our margin range for the commercial business of 7% to 9% this year. As we look to 2026, we're pricing for margin recovery in both the exchange business and the group business.\nThis will lift our margins to be closer to, but modestly short of, our target margin range of 7% to 9%. We expect to recover into that range for 2027, as has been previously noted, to provide that margin expansion and recovery in 2026 with our trend outlook to be above 11%. We are pricing with that fully in mind.\n\nDan Schumacher\n\nChief of Strategy and Growth Officer, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThis is Dan, just to round it out in terms of the premium increases, you know, so what Dan just described in the commercial business, you should think in terms of, you know, double.\nDigit on that one.\nOn the Medicaid side, we're operating at about a combined 6% premium increase in 2025 and would expect that to be comparable as we move into 2026.\nObviously on the Medicare side.\nAs John mentioned, that would track with what the CMS adjustments were.\n\nStephen Hemsley\n\nChairman and CEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nOkay, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Matthew Gillmor with KeyBanc.\n\nMatthew Gillmor\n\nDirector and Senior Research Analyst, KeyBanc\n\nHey, thanks for the question. For the settlements you called out, that.\nAre part of the discrete items, can.\nYou give some detail on the nature of those settlements? Are those mostly tied to value-based care contracts and Optum Health? If that's the case, can we think about the Optum Health outlook for 2025 as being burdened by about $1.5 billion of those settlements that hopefully don't repeat next year?\n\nJohn Rex\n\nPresident and CFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nMatt, John Rex here. I wouldn't call it necessarily mostly tied to that.\nIt is across businesses.\nThink of these things as ranging from.\nElements like you've described. I'd put it more in the.\nContext potentially in some areas, it's company receivables we have from other companies that we, for which we started questioning whether or not they're collectible. As it moved into that zone.\nWe've taken some provisioning for those other areas where just disputed items. In this business, you know, there can be disputed items that persist for some period of time. I think as we were taking a fresh look and we were coming to come out with our outlook for the year, making sure that we had contemplated all those so we could get some of those settlement items out of the way. Think about it as both in the zone of receivables where we question the collectability, maybe a dispute with a.\nCustomer.\nOver amounts and these dating back a year or more, sometimes in terms of where they might be, sometimes with providers, also in terms of areas that we were looking at. It's really a collection of items that we came at. I wouldn't call it predominantly. I mean, there's certainly a good amount of that sitting in Optum Health too. I wouldn't call it predominant in.\nTerms of those amounts.\n\nStephen Hemsley\n\nChairman and CEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThat gives you a little flavor.\n\nJohn Rex\n\nPresident and CFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nFor some of the items that we're trying to.\n\nStephen Hemsley\n\nChairman and CEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nCan we just generally split them so they get some idea what they're overcoming?\n\nJohn Rex\n\nPresident and CFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah, I would say kind of within Optum Health. Think of that kind of in the zone of, if I take the full amount, of probably about half a billion or so sitting within Optum Health.\nWe called on the call, Tim called out on the call $850 million within UnitedHealthcare, and then a couple hundred million in Optum Insight, and a little under $100 million in that zone in OptumRx, and then a smattering of a few other items, probably accounting for about $100 million or so. That would be, I'd call corporate items and such, that across the enterprise.\n\nStephen Hemsley\n\nChairman and CEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThat should give you the granularity you need. Okay, next question please.\n\nMatthew Gillmor\n\nDirector and Senior Research Analyst, KeyBanc\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Jessica Tassan with Piper Sandler.\n\nJessica Tassan\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nHi. Thanks so much for taking the question and for the detail this morning. When we think about the Medicare margin recovery, can you help us understand the split and timing between kind of MLR improvement and then incremental operating leverage, if any, and your updated MA margin targets? Kind of fully contemplate the benefit of efficiencies you might harvest from AI at UHC? Thanks.\n\nBobby Hunter\n\nCEO of Government Programs, UnitedHealthcare\n\nYeah, good morning, Jessica. Thanks for the question. You know, obviously when we've outlined the number of actions that we're taking to pursue the margin recovery this morning, they've really been items oriented around what we're doing with optimizing our plan design, ensuring that we're investing in durable and plans that are designed around care management, enabling care management. We've made meaningful benefit adjustments.\nAll the kind of levers that are in our control related to the product design, operational cost efficiency is absolutely something that we will continue to drive.\nWe are partnered incredibly closely with Sandeep and the team at Optum around different use cases of how AI can not only drive efficiency, but also help inform the forecasting, help inform the early insights, and help us make decisions faster in terms of both kind of how we respond to headwinds or challenges, as well as kind of how we identify solutions and can bring those to stakeholders. Think about kind of all of those really in the mix as we think about opportunities to leverage those efficiencies, drive margins, and certainly will be supportive of our 2027 and beyond kind of range that I've talked about where we'll be at the midpoint or above in that 2% to 4% guidance.\n\nStephen Hemsley\n\nChairman and CEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nOkay, we have time for one more question, so please, next.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from Ben Hendrix with RBC Capital Markets.\n\nBen Hendrix\n\nStock Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat, thank you for squeezing me in. In light of your business line review, your reorientation of some businesses, and balancing that with a sustained commitment to value-based care, I'm wondering if there's any changes to how you're thinking about the breadth and scale of care capabilities that you want to add to support VBC. Specifically, I'm thinking about commitment to assets like the pending Amedisys acquisition and the expected closing there.\nThanks.\n\nStephen Hemsley\n\nChairman and CEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nSure. Do you want to comment on Amedisys, and then Patrick, maybe comment about kind of the broader question there. Yeah.\n\nJohn Rex\n\nPresident and CFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nBen, John Rex. Yeah, we're looking forward to closing the Amedisys transaction here as we work through the process. We are still working through that process, though, as I mentioned in my capital comments on the call earlier. I mentioned that's one of the items in our minds as we think about the rest of the year, but we continue to work through that process with the regulators.\nAnd.\nProductive way but committed to those kind of assets and certainly very committed to capabilities where we can serve people in the home. Super important in terms of foundational part of value-based care in terms of how we actually serve them and serve them well. Gives us a lot more reach into serving other people also. I'll have Patrick maybe comment a bit.\n\nPatrick Conway\n\nCEO, Optum\n\nYeah, thanks for the question. I'll hit on the clinical rationale, then pass it off to Chris to hit some clinical operational points. As many of you know, I'm a practicing physician. It's about patient need for value-based care. We need clinical assets, we need assets in the home, and capabilities and clinicians in the home. We need mental and behavioral, we need specialty care, we need ambulatory surgical centers, you need serious illness care, you need the Brett, Brett.\nWe have those component parts in Optum Health, and those allow us to serve people's physical, mental, social, and financial needs. To broaden it out to Optum Insight as well, that platform for value-based care is distinctive. It has huge growth potential, as John described earlier, and Steve, and importantly, it's a pathway to a better performing US health system that achieves better health outcomes, better experience, and lower costs for the people we serve. I would like Krista to just talk briefly, because then you have to execute on that, you know, with fidelity everywhere, about some of the work there.\n\nKrista Nelson\n\nCOO, Optum Health\n\nSure, yeah. Thank you so much for the question. I think what I'll just add, Patrick commented a lot on the work we're doing across our value-based care platform to stabilize the business and provide meaningful growth in the future. Maybe just a couple comments on some of the other care delivery services that we offer that really enable that integrated delivery system to come to life. Whether that is, you know, investments in ancillary services, whether that's growth in home health, whether that's growth in our ASC platform, those will be things that we consider.\nMost urgently and importantly, the team is really focused on how do we make sure we drive the best productivity, the best performance, the best payment yields, and some of the near term opportunities we have to deliver on our services businesses in the short term while we enable further growth for the long term. Thanks for the question.\n\nStephen Hemsley\n\nChairman and CEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThanks Krista. That's all we have time for today. I would thank you all for joining us. We look forward to speaking with you again in a few months. I think you'll find those discussions will.\nBe.\nEven more specific and detailed, but as well, a little deeper from a strategic point of view as we continue to progress through our review here.\nWe look forward to those engagements and the engagements with you that we'll have in the meantime before our next quarterly review. Thank you for joining us. We appreciate your interest and attention. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

Here's some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under US federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.\nThis call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial and earnings reports section of the company's investor relations page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated 17 April 2025, which may be accessed from the investor relations page of the company's website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. UnitedHealth Group started 2025 in two seemingly disparate ways. One: continued strong growth across our businesses. Our people are providing more health benefits and services to more members and patients as the market responds to our distinct offerings. The other way, however, was an overall performance that was frankly unusual and unacceptable. As you saw in our release, we're revising our Adjusted Earnings Per Share outlook for the year to $26 to 26.50. This morning, we'll detail for you the factors driving our revised outlook and how we plan to address them. I'll start with performance, which was impacted by two broad factors in our Medicare businesses: Care Activity and member profiles. It's important to recognize UnitedHealthcare and Optum are distinct businesses with different models, markets, and products.\nIn addition, Optum's Medicare business is multi-payer and not limited to just UnitedHealthcare members. Given these differences, changes in care activity and member profiles do not always follow the same patterns and can result in different impacts to each business. The respective teams are urgently responding to our performance challenges. Starting with care activity. In UnitedHealthcare's Medicare Advantage business, we had planned for 2025 care activity to increase at a rate consistent with the utilization trend we saw in 2024. Instead, though, Q1 2025 indications suggest care activity increased at twice that rate. Increases in physician and outpatient services were most notable, and inpatient to a lesser extent. This increase in care activity was limited to our MA business and was not a factor in our commercial or Medicaid businesses. Care activity trends in those areas were as expected.\nTurning to member profile, unanticipated changes in our Optum Medicare membership is impacting 2025 revenue. We added more new Medicare patients to Optum Health, a portion of whom were covered by plans that were exiting markets. They experienced a surprising lack of engagement last year, which led to 2025 reimbursement levels well below what we would expect, and likely not reflective of their actual health status. Additionally, many of the current and new complex patients we serve are more affected by the CMS risk model changes that we are in the process of implementing.\nTo be sure, it is complicated, but we're not executing on the model transition as well as we should. We must and will work to better anticipate and address these factors. Here, still early in 2025, we believe they are highly addressable as we look ahead to 2026.\nLet me now talk specifically about what we're doing. First, we're ensuring the complex patients most impacted by the previous administration's Medicare funding cuts engage in clinical and value-based programs. Second, we're consistently engaging with members in their homes and in post-discharge settings. Engagement remains the key. Third, we're appropriately assessing and updating the health status of new patients, especially those at high risk levels. Fourth, to more effectively transition to the new CMS risk model, we're investing significantly in improving physician-clinical workflow to help ensure better care and timely insights on when and where care is most efficient and effective.\nFinally, our Medicare Advantage plan designs and pricing for 2026 will be fully informed by these trends. While we are decidedly unsatisfied with these results, our growth and foundation for improvement remain solid. UnitedHealthcare's Medicare Advantage business is on pace to serve an additional 800,000 people this year.\nOptum Health is on track to add 650,000 net new patients to value-based care arrangements. In Medicaid, we are growing and continue to see positive momentum in closing the gap between people's health status and state rates, and we are very appreciative of our state customers for the ongoing productive discussions. Within Optum, so far this year, Optum Rx is off to a strong selling season, characterized by new wins as well as high retention of long-term customers. The growth of Optum Rx underscores the vital role that PBMs play in helping to reduce the price of drugs for consumers and the value that sophisticated purchasers of healthcare, the employers, unions, and governments see in our efforts to counter the high prices set by drug manufacturers and to ensure that people have convenient access to high-quality, affordable drugs.\nThat's more important than ever as drug manufacturers continue to increase what they charge Americans, in some cases 10 times what they charge people in Europe. The growth at UnitedHealthcare and Optum reflects the efforts of our 400,000 colleagues who come to work every day, thinking differently about what is possible, advancing new products and ideas while constantly refining existing programs, working to make things better for the people we are privileged to serve. Our team continues to innovate to make accessing care easier. For example, our newest tools have sparked a more than 40% increase in digital engagement among our senior members through Q1. We see evidence of this in sharply higher and earlier wellness visits to their primary care physicians, with total visits in Q1 running far above the year-ago period.\nThis will help members better manage their health and promote early detection of emerging issues. Further, Medicare Advantage also costs taxpayers less and delivers more to seniors than fee-for-service Medicare, especially in value-based care arrangements. An essential approach in achieving both health outcomes and lowered costs is ensuring people get the care they need when and where they need it. A good place to understand those needs better is in a senior's home. Our House Calls program does just that. House Calls, which is only available in Medicare Advantage, provides a thorough in-home clinical visit at no cost to seniors. Following CMS's best practices for such care, our clinicians review a patient's medical history and current medications, conduct comprehensive physical exams, provide lab tests and screenings, and coordinate necessary follow-on care.\nHouse Calls clinicians closed millions of care gaps last year, helping people stay out of the hospital and the emergency department and referring those in need to appropriate social services to help them live healthier at home. This is Medicare Advantage innovation and value in action, helping drive proactive, preventive engagement with the health system rather than more expensive, reactive acute care.\nThese benefits, innovations, and their value to seniors and taxpayers were put at unnecessary risk by funding cuts in recent years to the Medicare Advantage program. While we continue to navigate those funding cuts to seniors' benefits, it is significant that the recently released 2026 rate notice begins to reflect the accelerating care cost trends we have experienced for some time. This will provide much-needed relief to seniors and reflects policymakers' understanding of the importance and the popularity of Medicare Advantage.\nOur work to deliver a better experience for people and lower costs spans our enterprise, as it always has. Just within the last few weeks, we've introduced several initiatives that will help people in their healthcare journeys. Optum Rx will remove prior authorizations on 80 drugs, accounting for more than 10% of our pharmaceutical prior authorizations. Optum Rx has aligned payment models to pharmacies more closely to their cost for drugs.\nThis helps pharmacies manage the ever-increasing prices charged by drug manufacturers, enabling pharmacies to stock more medicines and ensuring more consistent pricing, and access to medicine for consumers. 26 million consumer calls were more accurately directed to the right advocate by an AI agent, improving the consumer experience and reducing wait times. We expect AI will direct over half of our calls to the best resource during 2025.\nAll of these efforts are making things simpler and easier for consumers and providers, a goal we share with all healthcare stakeholders. Yet, we all have to contend with the stubborn fact that healthcare costs more in the US than it should, even beyond the widely recognized disparities in drug prices. Common procedures such as heart bypass surgery, spinal fusions, and heart stents are four times as expensive in the US as they are in Germany, Australia, and the UK.\nTotal hip replacements are twice as much. It's simply not sustainable. As we have made clear, we are as committed as ever to continuing down the path of transparency and affordability, ensuring that Americans get the health system they deserve. With that, I'll turn it over to John, who will discuss Q1 performance and full-year outlook in more detail. John?\n\nJohn Rex\n\nCFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThank you, Andrew. I'll start by walking through several updates to our 2025 outlook and then elaborate on the reasons for them. As Andrew said, we now expect adjusted earnings of $26 to 26.50 per share. It's an outlook that I'm extremely disappointed to share with you. This reflects the profile of patients served at Optum Health. It also reflects significantly increased care activity across the UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage plans. Within that outlook, we expect about 50% to come in the first half of the year. We're affirming the consolidated revenue outlook of $450 to 455 billion we shared with you in December. Within this, we expect revenues for both UnitedHealthcare and Optum Rx to be better than our initial view. I'll set a reduced outlook at Optum Health.\nThe full-year medical care ratio is now expected to be 87.5% ± 50 basis points, reflecting higher utilization across senior populations, the patient mix, and revenue profile of Optum Health. Within this range, we expect the first half of the year to be below the midpoint and the second half to be above. At Optum Health, our revenue outlook is $106 to 107 billion, and operating earnings is $6.2 to 6.4 billion, based on the factors discussed and which I'll get into more deeply in a moment.\nOver half of the $10 billion revenue change is the result of transitioning some legacy risk-based arrangements to fee-based, and is neutral to earnings. We expect about half of Optum Health's operating earnings to be in the first half. At UnitedHealthcare, the operating earnings outlook is updated to $16 to 16.5 billion and reflects the higher care activity we're seeing.\nWithin UnitedHealthcare, pressure was largely contained within the senior business, where we saw a sharp increase in care activities that became apparent as we closed out the quarter. As noted, this was most significant for both physician and outpatient care and, to a lesser extent, inpatient care. In years past, this is an insight we may not have picked up until the Q2, so it is useful to have the information with ample time to incorporate into our '26 planning. In the quarter, we experienced percentage increases in care activity about double last year's level.\nUnit prices behaved as expected. Let me start with the obvious fact that it is early in the year, and we don't know everything that might be driving our experience or how long the increase in care activity might last. But care activity was broad-based across our senior, individual, and group populations.\nOne example, in Group MA, member retention was about 98%, and as a result, serves well as a same-member metric. Here, we observed significant increases in elective care activity in Q1. Of note, in this population, we believe the behavior may have been impacted by the meaningfully higher member premiums, which were driven by the Medicare funding cuts. Another example across senior populations was the earlier and higher wellness visit activity we saw, which, of course, drives specialty and outpatient utilization. Some of this may be a seasonal shift in consumption patterns as wellness visits happen once a year. Turning to Optum Health, as it relates to the patient profile, we experienced a couple of key elements here. First, growth in certain markets where there were meaningful plan exits.\nThese new patients had not been engaged by their prior plans for most of last year, and we're seeing revenues associated with the patient profiles meaningfully below expected and normal levels. This is very addressable. Second, the ongoing execution to the new CMS risk model, while complicated given the multi-year phase-in, has not been to our operational standards. Transitioning to a new model and concurrently running two distinct versions has been more operationally complex than anticipated. But no question, we need to execute better, and we will. Across the enterprise, we continue to focus on operating costs to help mitigate external pressures while ensuring our workforce aligns to the areas of greatest opportunities and customer needs.\nLooking ahead, we see a long runway for further technology advances that will translate to more and sustained operating efficiency, which in turn drives opportunity for further innovation and advancements in the company and across the industry. Before we get to Q&A, I want to provide a few business highlights. At UnitedHealthcare, we still expect to serve up to 800,000 more people in Medicare Advantage this year across our individual, group, and dual special needs offerings. This underscores our long-standing commitment to stability and differentiated value. Our growth demonstrates UHC's deep relationship with our members. People served by our Community and State business increased to 7.6 million. We continue to have growth momentum with recent service expansions in Kentucky, New York, and Florida.\nWe're also encouraged by the updated Medicaid rates so far in 2025 that more closely align with underlying member acuity, but funding remains insufficient to meet the health needs of patients. Commercial self-funded membership increased by approximately $700,000 in the Q1, a result of our continued strong product innovation. Commercial insured membership was impacted by the individual exchange products. Our disciplined pricing approach remains consistent, and as a result, we experience some member attrition.\nOverall, in our commercial book, we are encouraged by the early 2026 selling season indications, which are showing strong retention rates. Turning to Optum. At Optum Health, we continue to expect to add 650,000 new value-based care patients this year. We're working to engage with these new members ever more rapidly. By the end of 2025, we expect to have about 5.4 million value-based care patients.\nAt Optum Insight, we have a pipeline of new products coming to market this year with exceptional customer interest. For example, in Q1, we launched AI-powered claims efficiency tools that increased productivity by over 20% for our revenue cycle management customers. Lastly, Optum Rx revenues grew 14%, exceeding $35 billion for the quarter. Both customer retention and new customer wins contributed to script growth of 3%. As Andrew noted, performance in the quarter was below the standards we expect. But with disciplined and urgent execution and attention to detail, we expect a return to form in the quarters ahead. With that, I'll hand it back to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThanks, John. Even with the growth our people generated this quarter, this was far from the performance we expect of ourselves. We're acutely aware it's a privilege to be a part of an organization with the capabilities to make a meaningful contribution to modernizing and simplifying the health system. And we're committed to improving our performance in the rest of 2025 and into 2026, and in doing so, to delivering consistent positive results for you and returning to our long-term earnings per share growth target of 13 to 16%. With that, we can now turn to your questions, operator.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The floor is now open for questions. At this time, if you have a question or comment, please press star one on your touch-tone phone. You may remove yourself from the queue by pressing star two on your touch-tone phone. We ask that you limit yourself to one question. If you ask multiple questions, we will only be answering the first question so we can respond to everyone in the queue this morning. We'll take our first question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\n\nJustin Lake\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning. My question's on Medicare Advantage cost trend. You said that you came into the year assuming trend at similar levels to 2024. Can you share with us precisely what that trend estimate was, meaning what did you expect for this year, and what are you expecting now? Can you tell us how much of that you actually saw in Q1? For instance, how much did you miss your MLR by, your own estimate of MLR, and how much you're expecting that to accelerate or how different the back three quarters is versus what you saw in Q1? Thanks. Even if this is emerging the way it did.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah. Justin, thanks so much for the question. I'm going to ask Tim Noel to respond just in a second in detail to your question. Obviously, it's still very early in the year, but we have clearly seen a pickup in trend in a specific part of the UHC business, particularly in the senior business. Tim will talk a little more about that to you in a second. It's still early. Even our Q1 is only partially complete. But unusually, we've seen this pickup, which is what's obviously influencing our position here. So let me ask Tim to give you a little bit more detail on that.\n\nTim Noel\n\nCEO of United Healthcare, UnitedHealth Group\n\nMorning, Justin. Thanks for the question. Yeah, I'll attempt to break it all down for you here. So as was mentioned in the opening remarks, in 2025, we anticipated care levels consistent with what we observed in 2024, which felt appropriate as we stepped into the year. And what we were assuming, and if you think about this as units consumed, we were assuming that in 2025, we'd see a similar increase by that metric that we observed in 2024.\nIf you break that down in the Medicare book, you can think that in total, in terms of total trend drivers, about 1/3 of that is related to increase in care activity or units consumed. And what we are seeing, and again, that's focused on physician and outpatient, but driving an overall 2x increase in that level of units consumed in Q1 of 2025.\nAgain, that metric is about 1/3 of the total trend drivers in the Medicare book. We are seeing that inside of Q1 of this year, but we are making the assumption right now that that trend will persist throughout 2025, and then also making the same assumption that it will persist into 2026, and that will shape our overall pricing assumptions. Now, some of the drivers that John mentioned behind what we're seeing, you might presume that some of those would result in a change in our seasonal consumption patterns. But at this distance, we feel like we need to make the assumption that that activity will persist throughout the year and into 2026.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nAll right. Tim, thanks so much. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.\n\nJosh Raskin\n\nResearch Analyst of Managed Care and Providers, Nephron Research\n\nHi, thanks. Good morning. Can you help us connect the higher incidence of primary care visits and the Optum Health pressure? I assume you don't have that primary care issue in Optum Health, which should also mitigate the downstream impact. So why are you expecting the higher follow-through if you control primary care? And then based on the fact that you're seeing worse performance in Optum Health or value-based care, could you remind us why you think you can control costs better in that environment? And it's probably a good time to get the refresher on why the strategy to allocate a lot more capital to VBC in the ecosystem totally is best for the long term.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah. Josh, thanks so much for the question. So I'm going to ask Tim just to address the first part of your question, then Amar to talk a little, Dr. Desai to talk a little bit around the Optum Health experience during the quarter and the differences of what we're seeing there and the like. And as I said in my commentary at the beginning, the businesses do operate very different kind of models, and it's not completely surprising to see somewhat different experiences.\nThen, I'm going to ask Heather to just do, as you kindly requested, a kind of refresher on the value-based care position. So we'll do that also for you. So bear with us. This is probably going to take a few minutes. But Tim, if I could ask you to start, and then we'll pass over to Dr. Amar Desai.\n\nTim Noel\n\nCEO of United Healthcare, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah. Thanks, Josh, for the question. So yeah, let me just dive in a little bit with a little bit more detail into some of what we're seeing that's driving the increase in care activity. Not only start with our fee-for-service, so kind of our non-capitated community MA members, we have seen an increase in physician outpatient care activity in that population. And one of the dynamics that we're seeing is they are generally seeking more preventative care, which is a good thing. And that also includes more in-home visits, more in-home clinical assessments. And that in and of itself really not the trend driver, but it's the follow-on care that is more than what we have anticipated, and that constitutes specialist visits, physician specialist visits, as well as some other outpatient services.\nA dynamic at play in our group Medicare Advantage business is we're seeing a significant and disproportionate increase in utilization, largely within our public sector group retiree business. This is a population that experienced the greatest year-over-year premium increases. While we've seen a similar dynamic play out historically in our individual Medicare Advantage business when premium increases have been in play, we've really never seen this dynamic before in the group MA business.\nWe're seeing it because of the pressures related to the Medicare funding cuts that are really driving up premiums in the group retiree business like they really never had before. Kind of think groups with premiums going from $50 to 200. We did assume that we would see some care activity level increases in this population, but what we're seeing far surpasses what we would have reasonably anticipated. In that population as well, we are seeing more preventive care, more annual wellness visits, more in-home clinical assessments. Again, the driver there also being really the follow-on care that results from that.\n\nAmar Desai\n\nPresident, Optum\n\nHey, thanks for the question, Josh. So the results for Optum Health, to be clear, were impacted by the profile of new value-based patients in Optum Health and the second year of the V28 phase. We're taking actions to proactively address these issues. Our patient profile post-AEP included many new to Medicare as well as new to Optum Health who were meaningfully less engaged by their prior health plans and providers. We believe that market-specific plan exits driven by V28 caused this dynamic. Because of the strength and stability of our provider network, those patients chose Optum Health. Member profile challenges were not specific to any single Medicare Advantage carrier and occurred in multi-payer geographies like Texas and Washington.\nAdditionally, we underestimated the impact of V28, in particular as it relates to the higher acuity structure of our patient population, which is more impacted by the risk model change. Our planned actions around operating cost containment and medical expense management were not able to offset the cumulative impacts of V28 and the new member profiles. As it relates to care patterns for Optum Health, in general, in Q1, we see as a busier time for our physicians as we are engaging our patients.\nWe've already engaged over 50% of all members and 75% of our complex members. This year, it's particularly important given the member profile of new Medicare and new Optum Health patients. Also within Optum Health, we're seeing some elevation in outpatient behavioral utilizations. Again, we're taking incremental actions above and beyond what we've planned for any year to improve performance.\nFirst, enhancing access for employee-to-network PCPs, especially around new patients to diagnose, document, and treat conditions. We're expanding home-based visits and wraparound services, particularly as it relates to post-discharge visits after inpatient care. And as Andrew alluded to, we've accelerated EMR unification, deploying smarter clinical workflows and point-of-care tools to better adapt to the V28-related changes. Thanks for the question.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nGreat, Amar. Thanks so much. And let me ask Heather to maybe just take an overview of the value-based care proposition and why we continue to believe so strongly in it.\n\nHeather Cianfrocco\n\nEVP of Governance, Compliance and Information Security, UnitedHealth Group\n\nSure. And just, I think what you're seeing here is, as Andrew said, you've got two different business models here, and it's important to keep that in mind. A couple of things I'll just point out. Again, in Optum Health, capitated experience, this is specific to senior populations in our experience in a unique environment, mindful of, again, what's a new risk model, a year-two risk model. And keeping in mind what Dr. Desai said, we assume and anticipate certain physician activity in the first part of the year. And that's part of our model because it drives not only that diagnosis, but the treatment so we can understand the gaps in care. So that's part of the plan, and I think that's why you don't, it's a little different story in Optum Health. But as Dr.\nDesai said, we need to be mindful of that, particularly based on two years of elevated care activity coming into this year. Now, to your point, the outcomes-based model, or what we call the value-based care model, should naturally offset some of that for a few reasons, as Dr. Desai mentioned. Number one, engagement is key. And that early engagement by a network that's aligned and activated can better identify gaps in care, manage them, and support higher preventive healthcare and reduced emergency visits and hospital visits.\nIn addition to that, what's unique about Optum Health's model is the wraparound services and the in-home services, which not only help assess our members in the home, but they're able to then kick off things like post-discharge visits, the more acute condition management programs that are critical to those transitions of care, and help reduce total cost of care and naturally offset some of trend. But in addition to that, result in a better health outcome for our patients and a better experience, and help them with a healthier life. So those are kind of the bases of our model. You then wrap the integration of our behavioral health into our model, which is increasingly more an integrated part of our care delivery systems. That's what I think is differentiated about the model.\nAnd even though, to be incredibly direct and respectful of this year, we will see the impact of the revenue through the year. But the differentiated value-based care model has meant growth for Optum Health above industry in the past, and we believe you'll continue to see that. Why is that? Because, again, a better care delivery model, a better experience for our patients. But in addition to that, we see very high retention. So these members that need the services, that have higher acuity, that need a more intensive care model, they stay with us. And so the work we do today will support the growth in 2026. And that's why we're confident in not only the growth in 2026 from a membership perspective, but because there's more members to serve out there.\nIn many cases, we're serving few of the seniors in any respective geography, and we have more capacity in our networks. But in addition to that, it supports our performance. I'll just note one last thing, and that is, I think that you're going to watch us pace that. While we're still committed to our membership growth, we're going to be looking at particular geographies, pacing through that to ensure that we're focusing on the new membership with our PCP network and with our in-home services.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThanks, Heather. I think, Josh, I really appreciate the question, and thanks, everybody, for allowing us to respond to that, so all of us fully as we can. I mean, just maybe add a couple of comments to that. To that last set of comments from Heather, when we look into, and you've often heard us talk previously about cohorts of members who choose to join Optum Health value-based care. What we're seeing in those earlier cohorts, going back to, say, 2023, for example, those folks who first came in and started to benefit from our value-based care approach, we're seeing, on basically all metrics, outperformance in terms of the way in which that cohort and cohorts before them have performed.\nSo what we're seeing here is not really a challenge to the underlying principle of value-based care. What we're seeing is how to adjust to a very dramatic price cutting regime that's been implemented over the last couple of years by the administration. It's important to recognize that that was, across the average of the industry, independent analysis would say that was about a 9% price cut across the industry. Now, that's a significant downdraft in terms of pressure.\nObviously, that affects participants, whether you're a payer or a provider in the marketplace. You've seen that effect over the last first year. We're now well into the second year of all of this. What we're seeing during this second year is some of the, I would call them, second-order derivative effects. So I'll give you just a couple of examples of that. You've heard one very explicitly, and we've mentioned the other already on the call.\nSo second-order effect would be, for example, as this pricing pressure has continued to press down alongside a series of underfunded rate increases, you've seen premiums and benefits start to be affected in the marketplace. Group premiums have gone up because of these price cuts. That is now driving a different behavior from group members. And that's what we've picked up in this area. And we need to do a better job of being able to predict and anticipate these second and third-order effects when they come, but they are direct consequences of this transition. A second one, which we referred to and is really important within the Optum Health story for 2025, is plan exits.\nSo we saw a very significant increase in the number of plan exits across the country last year as plans chose to respond to the price cutting pressure by essentially withdrawing their offer in multiple geographies across the country. And what we've seen is unusually complete vacation of offers by certain plans. So to put it a different way, 100% of participants in a particular payer's plan had to find a new home. They had no way of staying in their old home. They had to find a new home. And what we saw when they came to us, where we were still offering a plan option, we saw those members had not had the level of engagement in the prior six, eight months before they vacated that plan at the level you would have expected.\nThat has a direct consequence on how they are understood in terms of the reimbursement model of the system. That's what's driving a lot of our issues in Optum Health this year. But again, that is a temporary phenomenon which gets fixed during 2025. But it is simply an example of one of these second-order derivative effects of the transition of absorbing this 9% or more decrease in pricing.\nNone of that really speaks to the value of value-based care. Value-based care delivers a completely different approach of trying to ensure people have more years of health and less years of healthcare acute treatment, trying to get ahead of the illness, trying to avoid the high-cost consequences of late diagnosis, and tries to make sure that we are encouraging people to think about healthy lifestyle, early engagement, making sure that we're heading off problems before they arrive.\nWe know that works based on multiple cohorts of patients that we've been privileged to have the right to manage. What we're going through, like the rest of the industry, is a dramatic, really never seen before adjustment in pricing for this marketplace. And what we're seeing this year is two or three areas where the pressure that that has created across the market is creating new dynamics we haven't seen. That's exactly what we're responding to here. And we believe that they are largely addressable as we go through the rest of this year and in no way undermine our confidence in the value-based care strategy of the company. Josh, thanks so much for the question, and I'll move on to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from AJ Rice with UBS.\n\nAJ Rice\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks. Hi, everybody. Just to put a finer point on some of this discussion around, especially what's happening at the MA side, it sounds like you're saying most of the elevated care that you're seeing is on the group side. And it sounds like you're putting more of that on the benefit and premium changes that have occurred rather than just an underlying uptick in utilization. I want to make sure I understood that. Also, on the competitive exits and the impact of that, it doesn't sound like you're calling that out on the insurance side. You're just calling that out on the Optum side. And then finally, on Part D, you had been cautious about that coming into the year, but you're not mentioning that at all. So is that playing out about as expected?\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nAJ, excuse me. Thank you so much for the question. Let me ask Tim to respond.\n\nTim Noel\n\nSVP, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYes. Good morning, AJ. Thanks for the question. Yeah. So I'll hit those last two pieces first. So yeah, you're correct. We are really seeing this focused on our community Medicare Advantage and group Medicare Advantage books. So we're not seeing it on our chronic special needs population or our dually eligible population. Also, not seeing this care activity pattern in our newer members, either new to Medicare or new to United. And the care activity items that we talked about last year, provider upcoding, and some of the pressures on specialty drugs, I'm not seeing that play into this either. Those elements are both tracking very much in line with how we've planned. And when you think about the split, it is slightly more pronounced on our group business.\nBut if you think about our overall Fee-For-Service business, it's just, I would say, just slightly more than the contribution that you'd expect on the group side. And while we certainly do see trends that suggest that where the premiums have increased and members are paying a high portion of that, that that is where we're seeing this pointed pressure on Care Activity on the group business. However, it's very likely that some of the same underlying trends that are generating higher Care Activity patterns in individual community MA are also at play in the group business.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.\n\nLisa Gill\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nVery much and good morning. Andrew, I just want to go back to the path to the long-term growth rate. You reiterated that you feel confident you can get back there. With the 2026 rates looking better, we're going to move into the final year of V28. How do I think about what the key elements are to get back to that long-term growth rate?\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah. Lisa, thanks so much for the question. So yeah, so clearly, we were pleased to see the beginning of recognition of rate increases, which actually reflect reality, which we haven't seen for the last couple of years. But hopefully, that will continue to be the stance, and the data will drive that in the way we saw this year. So very, very pleased to see that. Also pleased to see in the Medicaid books of business, continue to see great engagement with states as they also adjust to make sure that those rates are appropriate for what we're seeing. So those are important. Obviously, next year, there will be a further step down in terms of pricing from the V28 model. So we can't ignore that. That's clearly a reality.\nBut the way we'd look at this, Lisa, is that we are very, very much we see very much the end of this transition period in terms of having to absorb the amount of pressure. I mean, clearly, we're a leader in all of this marketplace. We're taking almost certainly a bigger fraction, if you will, of the pressure because of our market leadership position here. We feel like we're very much getting through this. We, obviously, this year have picked up these two or three second-order derivative effects, which we're going to do a much better job of anticipating and managing for as we go into 2026. And we think that an awful lot of the issue that we're seeing early in 2025, we can fix in 2025 and help us deliver stronger performance for 2026.\nWe expect that to then be a kind of ramp into reacquiring our target growth rate momentum that we aspire to as an organization. Thank you very much. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.\n\nStephen Baxter\n\nSenior Digital Health and Health Care Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Hi, thanks. Just to follow up on the trend discussion, could you talk about where MA margins are now expected to shake out inside your 2025 guidance, and what you think is a reasonable timeline for recovering the target margins, and whether there's any change to what you're thinking is as a reasonable long-term margin target in this business post V28 and some of the issues you've had adapting to it? And then again, confidence level you can improve MA margins in 2026 if trend stays at this level. Thank you.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nSteven, thanks so much. I'll ask Tim to respond to that.\n\nTim Noel\n\nCEO of United Healthcare, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThanks, Stephen, for the question. So the margins that we're anticipating, consistent with the changes we've announced today, are still within our targeted margin range for Medicare Advantage for 2025. As we look forward to 2026 and we include the increases in care activity that we're seeing both in the 2025 portion of our bid and also pricing for 2026, at this distance, we can accommodate those care activity levels and return to the historical planning target levels that we've always historically assumed.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nGreat. Thanks so much, Tim. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.\n\nErin Wright\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. So on the policy front, I guess, what is your latest thinking in terms of just PBM reform? Your model has obviously evolved on that front, but also Medicaid funding cuts and what sort of permutations you could anticipate there and your ability to navigate that. Thanks.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah, Erin, thanks so much. Let me ask Patrick Conway to respond to you on the PBM side, and then Krista, maybe make a couple of comments on Medicaid, if that's okay. So Patrick?\n\nPatrick Conway\n\nCEO, Optum Rx\n\nYeah. Thanks, Erin, for the question. So first, in terms of policy, we're leading in the marketplace with transparency, choice, and affordability. And we've had three major announcements that I think both help drive the policy environment, but also are a reason we've had significant market growth. One, 100% commercial rebate pass-through. First large PBM to do that. And you're seeing that drive positive reaction in the marketplace. And it's removing any lingering doubt about our incentives.\nWe want lower list prices and lower net prices, as Andrew said. Second, removing 25% of prior authorizations over 10% of reauthorizations over 10% of prior authorizations, making the system simpler, better, easier for consumers and clinicians. And then third, cost-based reimbursement for pharmacies. And it's really important to know this is for all pharmacies, all drugs, all clients rolling out. Already started and rolling out and put across the entire book.\nYou heard from independent and community pharmacies, their support of these changes. The last thing I just call out, just because it's new and it concerns us significantly, is the Arkansas legislation that the governor signed yesterday around PBM and pharmacy ownership. We're honestly not sure what problem they're trying to solve, but let me be clear on the impact on patients.\nWhen you do that, we have Optum pharmacies in the state providing integrated mental and behavioral healthcare. This could cut off access for those patients with things like schizophrenia, severe depression. You have specialty medicine where we may have been serving a patient with cancer for years. And imagine that patient now not getting their medicine in their home. You have home infusions for elderly Americans where they may not be able to get out of their home, and we're providing their medication.\nYou have home delivery for people in rural parts of Arkansas. We're significantly concerned about this. We'll work with the state in the regulatory process post-legislation to try to address those populations and maintain access. But we want you to hear clearly from us that our concern is about patients and maintaining access to patients across the nation to these medicines.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nAll right. Patrick, thank you. Krista?\n\nKrista Nelson\n\nCEO, UnitedHealthcare Community & State\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question. On the Medicaid side, I think we won't speculate on any really specifics. But what I do want to emphasize is just regardless of any changes, our priority remains the health of our members and ensuring that they have access to high-quality coverage. As it relates to our business, we have a really broad footprint across 32 states. We have a variety of programs, products, and really decades of experience. We remain confident in the value that managed care can provide to our state partners and our ability to support our states as they really navigate through any changes.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThanks for the question. Krista, thanks so much. Just looping back to the pharmacy section, I think Patrick laid things out very well there, Erin, for you. But I also would just, I was encouraged to see in the president's executive order earlier in the week a kind of an interest in really looking at multiple elements of the pharmacy value chain. I think one of the things that has been honestly most disappointing over the last year or two is the obsession with the role of the PBM versus everybody else in the system. And if you read the EO carefully, what you'll see in there are quite good, sensible questions to explore what's going on either side of the PBM in terms of the manufacturers and also ultimately many of the providers in the network.\nAnd I think what you'll see from that is the PBM plays a unique role in trying to bring down drug prices for Americans. It does that at very, very narrow margins, oftentimes taking very significant risk in the process, and is really the only participant in the system that has that. The way a PBM wins more business is by successfully bringing down drug costs for its clients, and that's how it wins more accounts. That is not how the rest of the system operates.\nI'm hopeful as the administration explores the questions that the EO raises, that this will become a much more thoughtful review of how to reform the whole value chain, and not simply one component where I think you can make very, very serious mistakes which could really damage patient access. So I was encouraged to see that from the administration. Erin, thanks so much for the question. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Andrew Mok with Barclays.\n\nAndrew Mok\n\nDirector, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning. I was hoping to get your thoughts on the risks and implications of tariffs, particularly around the impact of pharmaceutical tariffs that are currently being contemplated by the administration. Thanks.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah, Andrew, thanks so much for the question. Obviously, it's a dynamic situation in terms of what may happen around pharmaceutical tariffs. Obviously, it's going to be a process now where the administration goes through its analysis and investigation. So we obviously don't know what may or may not come from that.\nBut when we look at our potential exposure to that, we feel pretty good. In fact, I'd say better than pretty good in terms of the degrees of price protection mechanisms we have in pre-existing contracts and also various pieces of legislation which also limit the ability of manufacturers to pass price increases down through the system. So at this point, and again, given that we don't know what any tariff may or may not be, but when you look at the structure of the marketplace, we feel pretty well positioned for that, Andrew. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies.\n\nDave Windley\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question, Andrew. I appreciate your comments about kind of the macro cost of healthcare in the United States. We have an administration that seems more focused on budget deficit reduction, which entails cutting to healthcare. I guess my philosophical question here is, why isn't modest, persistent underfunding of the system the right way to get those costs more in balance and to force innovation in the system? And how does United operate in an environment that might bring that without having the snafus or whatever that a V28 model brings?\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group",
    "content2": "So Dave, thanks so much for the question. And I think it's a good and deep question, actually. So there's no question that what I think we need is continued strong innovation in new approaches of how to bring together different elements of the system to have a more patient-centered impact on healthcare. One of the characteristics, I think, of all healthcare marketplaces, but perhaps particularly the US, is there is no shortage of innovation, but it tends to be point solutions.\nWhether it's a new device or a new drug or a new model of care, these things tend to show up in very isolated ways. So we spend a lot of money on innovation in America, but we don't see the yield of that innovation. And I would argue that's because it's not brought together. We don't align incentives. We don't really rethink workflows.\nWe don't try and center everything around what gives you the best outcome for the patient over the lifetime of the patient, not just this encounter or even this year. How do you make that patient or how do you give that patient the opportunity for maximum numbers of great health years? That, for me, should be the guiding principle. And that's what Value-Based Care is about, and it's what UnitedHealth Group is committed to innovate and drive behind. And I think we have made extraordinary progress in that. Now, unfortunately, what we've seen through V28 is almost focus the price cut where the most innovation is going on.\nSo you've seen this pressure come exactly into the program where historically the government has funded Medicare Advantage and created a very thoughtful system which incentivizes participants. To the only way a participant can win in Medicare Advantage is to incentivize, be able to deliver a great care experience and access experience for the member, release enough costs through efficiencies to provide benefits to members, and then pay a rebate back to the government, right? So everybody wins in that system. That was a very cleverly designed system by the government many years ago. It's been supported by multiple administrations of both directions since then. What we saw through V28 was really a kind of blunt instrument approach to just take money out of that system. That's what's causing the disruption here.\nSo I don't think anybody would never have any anxiety about saying, \"Look, we want to see the healthcare budget grow by less each year.\" But then we should look at the whole budget. We should look at the whole system, and we should look at how we can use tools to do that. What we know is that Medicare Advantage costs less than traditional Medicare.\nWe know that when a Medicare Advantage patient is in a fully delegated value-based care managed clinic like Optum Health, they will save even more money for the system, and they will have better personal experience. They have better clinical outcomes, and the government spends less money. It's those sorts of integrated approaches which we think are the response. And it's a bit I made that comment about the president's executive order on pharmacy, and I kind of invite the same.\nWe should be thinking about the whole system and how we align the whole system, not simply looking at these kind of individual component approaches which we've seen over the last few years. And I hope very much that just like the pharmacy agenda that the president is laying out for understanding, that we might have a similar one here. And that would be very positive because the answer to your question is yes. We should be able to deliver great healthcare at lower cost with better experience, better clinical outcome for people and for the government. And that is what the mission of UHG is, and that is what the goal of value-based care and Optum Care is also. Next question.\n\nDave Windley\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ben Hendrix with RBC Capital Markets.\n\nBen Hendrix\n\nHealthcare Services and Managed Care Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHi, thank you very much. I wonder if we could touch briefly on Medicaid. Just wanted to get an update on what you're seeing from state renewals through April and if we're still on track to close that rate acuity gap by the end of the year. Thanks.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nBen, thanks so much for the question. I'm going to ask Krista to answer that for you.\n\nKrista Nelson\n\nCEO, UnitedHealthcare Community & State\n\nYeah, thanks for the question. We were encouraged with the progress that we made on rates in the second half of 2024, which really continued into our one-to-one rate cycle. And as John and Andrew both mentioned, overall, the gap between acuity of the population and the rate funding is really narrowing with each cycle, as well as through some off-cycle adjustments that we have seen. We have, it's really too early to call the rates on 7/1, but about 35% of our revenue renews in that 7/1 cycle. And with each cycle, that base data continues to reflect more recent experience. And so we remain optimistic with the collaborative relationships we have with our states that over the course of the year, this gap will continue to narrow.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nGreat. Krista, thanks so much. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.\n\nLance Wilkes\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nGreat. Thanks. Could you talk a little bit about the Q1 NLR impacts and maybe breaking out the impacts that were driven by the premium increase that you described and maybe any sort of deductible increases? But also, were there impacts as a result of the way in which you're approaching prior authorization, any changes in that? And then do you have a sense as to maybe increased follow-through from your House Calls and primary care actions as far as getting follow-up visits tied to risk-adjustment activity? And lastly, were there any one-time good guys in the Q1 which perhaps supported medical loss ratio and caused the distinction between Q1 versus guidance? Thanks.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThanks so much, Lance. John Rex.\n\nJohn Rex\n\nCFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nGood morning, Lance. Just to your last part, no, there were no one-time good guys in the quarter that would have supported that. So a few things just to point out that. So to your first point on any shifts on pre-authorization procedures or any element like that impacting, no, nothing from that element there. Tim noted that certainly we had a much higher in addition to the group, which was a big factor, we had a much higher level of wellness business in the quarter. Those aren't the factor, though. They're super effective. They're not costly. They do drive specialty care, however, a lot of follow-on specialty care. And that's what we don't know is was that something seasonal then? Is it a slightly altered seasonal pattern that we saw so much activity in wellness visit.\nSome populations, frankly, certain populations just had 2x the year-ago levels of wellness visits. Others stopped 50%. But it was broad-based in terms of that activity. So that was certainly an element in there, an element well-known to all of you. Also, just the change in seasonality due to the IRA-driven Part D changes.\nThink of that as about roughly 90 basis points of impact or so in the quarter also. So that would have been an element versus kind of what you would have typically seen. And I think I know you were well aware that was kind of be a factor as we moved into this. I'm not sure that was a factor that was well-anticipated in kind of all the analyst models out there for a lot of good reasons, but those IRA impacts in that zone.\nCertainly, kind of the Medicare funding reductions, you go into that second year of V28, also impactful of that. Think of that as roughly in the 60 basis points zone. Just so that I can go through a lot of elements here, but those are kind of the key factors. But far and away, the increased utilization and the member profile elements that we've highlighted throughout the course of this call being by far the most impactful things in the quarter.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThanks, John. Thanks so much. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald.\n\nSarah James\n\nManaging Director, Equity Analyst of Healthcare Service, and HCIT, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nThank you. I just want to circle back to the tariff question quickly. Are the penalties under the IRA for pharma manufacturers who raise price above inflation enough to protect you from tariff pass-through on Medicare? And I'm not sure if that applies to exchanges as well, but with those bids due earlier, like April to June, do you have to assume that tariffs are in place, or do you think the states will give you some flexibility to submit two versions of bids with and without tariffs?\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nListen, Sarah, thanks so much for the question. So as I said earlier, obviously, like you, we don't know yet what, if, when might happen in this territory. So like you, we're watchfully waiting. As you allude to, there's many kind of layers of government protection, if you will, within the regulations that sit over the drug companies in terms of their ability to increase price above inflation. There are things like Medicaid best price protections, specifically in the Medicaid area, which would also have potential applications here. And then, of course, we have our various Optum Rx, where relevant in this conversation, have their own contractual price protections. So there are multiple layers of that.\nObviously, we're going to be very carefully making sure that we bid in the context of that kind of mesh of protection and make sure that we do that as thoughtfully as we possibly can. But I just also just want to reiterate, like everybody else, we don't know yet what the reality of this is, but we're very attuned to it. And I think I've tried to share with you our sense that it should not be a significant exposure for us, but certainly not this year. And we'll be working very thoughtfully about bids and the rest, as you suggest, for next year. We have time for just one last question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from Jessica Tassan with Piper Sandler.\n\nJessica Tassan\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nHi guys. Thank you so much for the question. I wanted to ask about, so UHC has achieved really phenomenal growth in MA year to date, up 521,000 members through April. Almost half of that growth has come from C-SNP plans. So just wondering if you all can elaborate on UHC's dominance in the C-SNP market. What do these plans offer the beneficiary? Why has UHC been so successful in this segment? And what does C-SNP enrollment mean from an economic perspective for UHC in 2025 and then over the long term? Thanks.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah, Jessica, thanks so much. I'll ask Bobby Hunter, who looks after our M&R business, to respond to that, Bobby.\n\nBobby Hunter\n\nCEO of Government Programs, UnitedHealthcare\n\nYeah, thanks, Jessica, for the question. So I would say really just overall, we're very pleased with our year-to-date growth in Medicare Advantage. As you know, we continue to be on track to deliver on the full-year growth target of up to 800,000 members. The momentum we had in AEP carried over really nicely into OEP, including notably strong retention of our existing members, and then really diversified growth across our community HMO plans, full dual plans, and the plans you mentioned that are designed for members with chronic conditions. So really, both from a mixed volume standpoint, we feel really good about where we sit in 2025 and the outlook that that gives us around the membership growth.\nI would just note really that the Medicare Advantage plans that we offer, the great work that we do from a value-based care integration standpoint with a collection of our providers, both internal and external, really position us well to manage these members with chronic complex conditions. And we're very proud to continue to get to serve more of those members as we progress throughout the year. Thanks so much for the question.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nBobby, thanks so much. And I'd like to thank everybody for all of your questions. We appreciate your engagement very much today. While we're not satisfied with our performance to the start of 2025, I hope you've heard today our determination to improve and our enthusiasm about the path forward. We remain deeply committed to the value-based care strategy of the company, and we believe that that is the way to solve many of America's healthcare problems, both from a cost, but most importantly, from a patient experience and outcome perspective. And I think many of you who know United well will also know and recognize that when we encounter an issue, we figure out how to work it and how to deal with it.\nRest assured, we all at United are going to work our issues that we've encountered in Q1, solve them, and you should count on us to continue to strive towards delivering for everybody we serve and to make sure that the growth of this company returns to the kind of ranges that you would expect of us. With that, I'd like to thank everybody for your time today, and we appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day."

I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nJennifer, thank you very much, and good morning everyone. I'd like to start by expressing a sincere thank you from my colleagues and from me for the overwhelming expressions of condolence and support following the murder of our friend Brian Thompson. Many of you knew Brian personally. You knew how much he meant to all of us and how he devoted his time to help him make the health system work better for all of the people we're privileged to serve. He would dive in with passion and caring to find solutions to improve experiences, whether for an individual consumer, an employer, or a public health agency.\nRight now there are 400,000 nurses, doctors, caseworkers, customer service specialists, pharmacists, technologists, and so many others in this organization who share that commitment and are determined to advance that work.\nThe task in front of us, all of us healthcare providers, payers, employers, drug companies, and policymakers, is to continue improving quality and health outcomes for individuals and their families while lowering costs for everyone.\nWe need to build on the unique foundational strengths of healthcare in America, address the areas we can make work better among those strengths. World-leading innovation: the U.S. has developed the most advanced clinical approaches and patient-centric care at a pace not seen anywhere else. It's why, if provided with the option, people from all over the world come here to seek care for the most complex conditions.\nYet the health system needs to function better. Through decades of federal and state policymaking and private sector innovation, we have a variety of program structures and processes. There are strong merits to that variety as they can be more tailored to meet the specific needs of individuals at various stages of life and health status and provide extra help for those who need it. It avoids a one-size-fits-all approach, but it needs to be less confusing, less complex, and less costly. America faces the same fundamental health care dynamic as the rest of the world. The resources available to pay for health care are limited while demand for health care is unlimited.\nEvery society wrestles with that issue and approaches it in various ways. We have incredible opportunities here to improve system performance both from a care and a cost perspective, while building upon the foundational strengths I just mentioned.\nThe mission of this company, why we exist, is to improve this system for everybody and help people live healthier lives.\nThat means getting more people into high-quality value-based care and keeping them healthy in the first place so fewer Americans find themselves with a chronic and, in many cases, preventable disease. It means continuing to invest in programs like Medicare Advantage, which, by providing coordinated care to seniors, is proven to deliver better health outcomes at lower cost to consumers and taxpayers compared to fee-for-service Medicare. Seniors recognize that value, which is why the majority of them choose Medicare Advantage. It means making healthcare easier to navigate.\nWe're enhancing digital tools for consumers, harnessing data, and using AI so they can find the best value care option and decide what is best for themselves and their families. People's health interactions should be as intuitive and seamless as every other aspect of their lives: banking, shopping, streaming.\nThis past year we saw an extraordinary increase in the use of these modern channels. We know there is still a large gap there, and we intend to keep at it until it is closed.\nIt means making coverage and cost easier to understand. Just one example where we already have advanced plans. We are eager to work with policy leaders to use standardization and technology to speed up turnaround times for approval of procedures and services for Medicare Advantage patients and to materially reduce the overall number of prior authorizations used for certain MA services. Some of this work we can do on our own, and we're doing it. But we're encouraged also by industry and policy maker interest in solving for this particular friction across the whole system.\nUltimately, improving health care means addressing the root cause of health care costs.\nFundamentally, healthcare costs more in the U.S. because the price of a single procedure, visit, or prescription is higher here than it is in other countries. The core fact is that price more than utilization drives system costs higher. Tackling that problem will require all parts of the system, policymakers, to come together.\nYet there are participants in the system who benefit from these high prices. Lower cost, equivalent quality sites of service, for example, can be good for consumers and patients, but threaten revenue streams for organizations that depend on charging more for care.\nAnother example is the persistently high cost of drugs in the U.S., leaving American consumers, employers, and public agencies to pay disproportionately more than people in other countries.\nJust look at GLP-1 prices. One drug which costs $900 in the U.S. costs about 1/10 of that in Europe.\nPharmacy benefit managers play a vital role in holding those prices down, which is why drug companies and their allies have spent the past several years attacking them. OptumRx alone delivers many tens of billions of dollars in savings annually versus the pricing set by the manufacturers, including on the GLP-1s. That sharply reduces the gap versus other countries, but even then, prices in the U.S. are still multiples of what the rest of the world pays for the same drugs.\nLast year our PBM passed through more than 98% of the rebate discounts we negotiated with drug companies to our clients. While we offer customers 100% pass-through options, a small number have historically elected other models. We're committed to fully phasing out those remaining arrangements so that 100% of rebates will go to customers by 2028 the latest.\nWe will continue to encourage all of our clients to fully pass these savings directly to patients at the point of sale, as we already do for all of the people we serve in our fully insured employer offerings. This will help make more transparent who is really responsible for drug pricing in this country? The drug companies themselves.\nHealthcare in every country is complex and the solutions are not simple. But you should expect this company to continue to work at it, finding what is needed, developing solutions, bringing those solutions to scale, making a positive impact on the lives of millions of people.\nWe deliver on our commitments to the people we serve, including our investors. Even in highly challenging periods like 2024, our results bear out that we find a way, even if it's not always how we may have initially envisioned the path.\nAmong some of the formidable challenges we navigated over the course of the year were the first year of the three-year CMS, Medicare rate cuts, the effects of the state-driven Medicaid member redeterminations, and the Change Healthcare cyberattack.\nOur people found a way to deliver solidly within the range we first offered back in November of 2023, all while improving patient and consumer health outcomes and experiences.\nFocusing on quality and expanding upon our potential to help make the health system work better for everyone.\nWe're invigorated by the path ahead. There are so many areas that can be enhanced, reworked, re-engineered, or even scrapped to make the health system work better as we know it needs to. That is both our responsibility and it's our passion. We begin 2025 with a strong outlook for the year as we continue to deliver on our commitments and excel for those we serve in all of our key growth pillars. Now John will walk you through this performance in a little more detail.\n\nJohn Rex\n\nCFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThank you, Andrew, and I'll add my deep gratitude for the enormous outpouring of support over the past few weeks. Brian helped build this company and forge deep, trusted relationships for over 20 years, and the positive impact he had on people will be felt for years to come.\nThis morning I'll discuss both 2024 results and our performance expectations for 2025, including some of what we had planned to discuss with you in December 2024. Revenues of over $400 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $27.66 were well within the outlook ranges we set out over a year ago. To be sure, things played out differently than initially anticipated, but it is an enduring trait of this enterprise that we deliver on our commitments to the people we serve and to you, even amid unforeseen circumstances.\nOver the course of 2024 we undertook initiatives and made investments to strengthen us for the future. Initiatives to improve consumer experience and bring new innovations to market more quickly drive the most compelling ways to further our mission to help make the health system work better for everyone.\nContinue to optimize and refine our offerings and business portfolio to enhance future growth potential, whether that meant moving into new opportunities, reconfiguring or moving out of areas which contribute historically but may no longer be core, all with an eye to unlocking value.\nWe know you have a number of questions that we were not able to discuss last month, so today I'll start by stepping through a couple you have indicated are top of mind.\nThe first one is why our 2024 Medical Care Ratio was 150 basis points above our original outlook.\nIt's important to frame up the challenges of 2024 to offer some perspectives on the commitment and response of our people.\nCompared to the midpoint of the care ratio range we stepped out with over a year ago. That alone created a nearly $5 billion gap we needed to overcome. That's before we get to the nearly $1 billion in business disruption impact due to the cyberattack.\nSo we start with about $6 billion in unanticipated impacts just from these two examples, in addition to managing through the already known multibillion-dollar impact of the Medicare rate cuts, as we sought to preserve as much benefit stability for seniors as possible.\nRegarding the elements impacting our 2024 care ratio, we've spoken about the key factors on prior earnings calls, so no surprises here. The first comprise about 70% of the total impact and are comparable in magnitude to each other. First, the mix of people served. We ended up with a different profile of consumer than expected. This is because of one factor we didn't grow as anticipated due to the unusual Medicare Advantage benefit designs in the marketplace in 2024.\nNext, the timing mismatch between the health status of the remaining people being served by Medicaid and the lagging state rate updates.\nThere were the costs related to the cyberattack and our South America business impacts.\nThe remaining two elements comprise about 30% of the impact and are evenly split. These include a more rapid than expected acceleration in the prescribing of certain high cost medications as drug companies took early advantage of the Inflation Reduction Act, and an aggressive upshift in hospital coding intensity. This is incorporated into our outlook even as we work to get it back in line. Those are the four care ratio elements.\nNext question. Given all that, are we confident in the adequacy of our pricing for 2025? The answer is yes and here's why. To start, for 2025 the outlook we shared in December incorporates a view of care activity commensurate with what we saw in 2024, even the care activity we experienced as we exited the year.\nI'll break that down with some business line perspectives.\nIn Medicaid, we see the gap between people's health status and state rates narrowing over the course of the year. Our outlook assumes a measured pacing of that process. Actions to date, including the important 1 January renewal cycle, support this view.\nIn commercial, pricing for 2025 is appropriately capturing the care activity we are seeing. This is evidenced by growth heavily weighted toward self-funded offerings. We will continue our disciplined approach.\nIn Medicare we had strong AEP results, which included winning back people we had served previously and near record retention. These are a direct result of our long history of offering sustainable benefits for seniors.\nWith strong retention and the many returning consumers, we start the year with highly informed insights into the care needs of the people we will be serving.\nIn addition, this year we have seen a notable uptake of our more managed offerings, think HMO-style, which provides strong value for consumers, effective care tools for doctors, and more predictable performance.\nWe expect a 2025 full year Medical Care Ratio of 86.5% ±50 basis points, 100 basis points above the 2024 result. In addition to factors discussed earlier, the increase is driven by IRA impacts, the second year of the Medicare funding cuts, a continued mix shift toward public sector offerings, and a respectful view of care activity.\nOur 2024 Operating Cost Ratio improved about 150 basis points over the prior year. Roughly half of the change was driven by contributions from the business portfolio initiatives mentioned earlier. The other half was due to accelerating our efforts to realize operating efficiencies even as we improve consumer experiences.\nSome of these advances are a result of the very early stage impacts we are beginning to realize from AI-driven initiatives to help our customer service representatives respond to consumers' needs more effectively and quickly. And we see continuing opportunities both in the near term with operating costs for 2025 improving still further, well beyond, given the rapidly expanding scope and impact of these initiatives.\nThese actions and the resourcefulness of our people helped deliver upon the objectives set out over one year ago and helped to partially balance the multiple billions of unanticipated impacts.\nWith that, I'll run through our businesses offering some key points for each, starting with Optum Health where revenues grew to about $105 billion in 2024 and are expected to approach $117 billion in 2025.\nOur care delivery business continues to deepen its presence in existing areas while expanding into new geographies and services.\nIn 2025 we expect Optum Health will serve about 5.4 million value-based care patients, growth of 650,000 over 2024.\nWhile our current position provides a solid footing, it's a small fraction of the hundreds of millions of patients who can ultimately benefit from value-based care.\nWe see value-based care as foundational. It is perhaps the fullest expression of our mission. As Andrew noted, the outdated activity-based fee-for-service system won't help the health system work better for people. Value-based care is outcomes-based, aligning processes, actions, and incentives helping keep people healthy in the first place rather than just seeing them when they are sick.\nOptum Health is an integrated multi-payer care delivery company helping to lead the transition to a truly sustainable value-based care system. As we move into 2025, we will continue to enhance access and care integration through the home, a much-needed area to help people with their health. More than three quarters of our in-home patient visits result in a primary care visit within 90 days. Medicare Advantage patients with chronic conditions who receive a home care visit have a lower rate of ER visits, fewer inpatient stays, stronger health outcomes, and a better experience, all while saving the health system billions.\nTurning to OptumRx, revenues in 2024 grew to over $130 billion and will be about $146 billion in 2025.\nOur pharmacy benefits management team again had customer retention exceeding 98% while welcoming a record 750 new clients. Further proof of the value sophisticated employers, health plans, and labor unions see in OptumRx's ability to negotiate lower drug prices for consumers.\nOptumRx's pharmacy care services support the entire system in the delivery of clinically driven pharmacy care, serving the highest need and hardest to reach patients. These offerings include community pharmacies, specialty and infusion drug services, all large, strongly growing areas. With our current presence quite small.\nOptum Insight revenues were $19 billion in 2024 and in 2025 we'll approach $22 billion with a backlog of $35 billion as sales of new products begin to take hold and the customer clearinghouse business continues to rebuild.\nThe solutions offered through Optum Insight and our health technology growth pillar, delivered at scale, will improve consumer experience and payment and claims flows, enable access to the next best action guidance in a doctor's workflow, and help life sciences customers more rapidly bring innovations to market, and there will be much more to follow.\nShifting to UnitedHealthcare full year revenues in 2024 approach $300 billion and for 2025 will approach $340 billion as we grow to serve upwards of an additional 1.9 million people balanced across both the commercial and public sectors. Within our domestic commercial offerings we grew to serve 2.4 million more people in 2024 and expect to continue to grow strongly in 2025, especially in our self-funded offerings which serve some of the most sophisticated buyers of health care, large employers.\nThe fact that so many more people are choosing UnitedHealthcare is a direct result of our bringing much needed innovation to these more mature markets through consumer-centric offerings.\nAs noted earlier, UnitedHealthcare's 2024 Medicare Advantage growth was impacted by the unusual benefit designs in the market. Our focus has always been on providing consumer stability and sustainable value, a factor that has built confidence and trust over the long term.\nAs a result, in 2025 we expect growth of up to 800,000 people in individual, group, and special needs offerings, and the growth outlook for the years ahead remains strong. With nearly half of American seniors still in outdated Medicare fee-for-service offerings, which provide less value to them and cost taxpayers more.\nIn Medicaid, we expect to serve more people in 2025. With redetermination activities now concluded, UnitedHealthcare's value proposition is resonating with state customers, consumers, and provider partners, and we are participating in a substantial number of expansion proposals. Most recently we were honored to have been awarded a new opportunity in Georgia.\nOur growing businesses support and are supported by substantial financial capacities and a strong balance sheet. In 2024 we deployed nearly $17 billion in growth capital to help build for the future, further strengthening our capabilities to serve more people more comprehensively. We also returned over $16 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase.\nIn 2025 we expect cash flow from operations will approach $33 billion or 1.2 times net income. We will continue to deploy growth capital and remain committed to returning to shareholders as outlined in December. Our growth capital deployment efforts deliver their greatest benefits over the course of two, four, or even six years, and as new capabilities are scaled and deployed across the enterprise and beyond.\nTo summarize, our strong start to the year reinforces the growth objectives we shared last month and is underpinned by the broad growth drivers, operational excellence, and strategic capital deployment you have come to expect from us.\nNow I'll turn it back to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nJohn, thank you.\nThe strength of this organization lies in the resilience of our people and the fundamental belief that there is no higher calling than helping other people and nothing more vital to the human condition than healthcare. Looking ahead to 2025 and beyond, we're confident in our ability to continue to add value to the health system through our focus on value-based care and consumer-oriented efforts to help build the health system America deserves. That's also why we remain solidly committed to our long-term 13% to 16% growth objective, a goal that reflects both the opportunities and the capabilities that we have now. Operator, we'll open it up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThe floor is now open for questions. At this time, if you have a question or comment, please press star one on your touchtone phone. You may remove yourself from the queue by pressing star two on your touchtone phone. We ask you to limit yourself to one question. If you ask multiple questions, we will only be answering the first question so we can respond to everyone in the queue this morning.\nWe'll go first to AJ Rice with UBS.\n\nAJ Rice\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nHello, everybody, and I appreciate the words about Brian.\nHe's missed by all of us.\nJust maybe to focus in on the comments about cost trends and the MLR. Obviously in the fourth quarter there's variance relative to consensus expectations. It was probably a little greater than what we thought. It sounds like the cost items you're calling out are similar to the things.\nYou had seen all year long.\nWas there anything that changed in those, the intensity of any of those trends, and anything, any unusual items in there that impacted the results? It sounds like you're still confident in your 2025 MLR outlook. So nothing you saw in the fourth quarter changes your view on 2025?\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nAJ, thanks so much for your question. I'm going to ask John in a sec to obviously go much deeper in response to your question, but just to the last part of your question. Yeah, you're totally right. Nothing we saw there that changes our view of 2025. We feel very good about how we priced into 2025. We feel really good about how the mix has come in in terms of that growth. That's a huge difference to 2024. We really didn't see anything in Q4 that we believe represents a challenge to that view going to 2025. But I'd love John to go deeper for you on the Q. Thanks.\n\nJohn Rex\n\nCFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nGood morning, AJ. So a few things on this. So in terms of the items that we called out on the Q3 call, so hospital coding intensity and the specialty prescribing trends that we were seeing, they very much in line with what we saw in the Q3 in terms of that ran into the Q4. So in line with the view on that, we weren't seeing acceleration; that we're seeing stabilization in those trends. I would tell you at the levels we saw before, and we expect that to continue, that specialty prescribing.\nThose trends were something we anticipated in our 2025 outlook, and as we had noted it back in the third quarter, that was something that just moved faster in 2024 than we expected. But in terms of the levels we're seeing and how we anticipated that in our 2025, we feel very good about that. Those coding intensity levels staying at the levels that we saw we had seen.\nAlso, then the other elements that we talked about mix kind of important element in terms of the improvement we see as we move into 2025, and those elements. For to call out kind of things in the Q4, a couple of things I'd say. So first of all, the move was mostly driven by seasonality, typical seasonality, you see normal deductible wear-offs. Those elements a move sequentially that was similar in terms of the basis point move that we saw a year ago, also Q3 to Q4 on that. But I call out a couple of things, AJ's to your point here. So in the sequential move I'd call out probably 80 to 90 basis points I put in the revenue effect category here.\nSo in that, think about some elements that might have been coming in, such as group MA refunds and elements there where our performance, which was strong over the course of the year, and those hitting in the quarter, just some elements like that that I put in the non-recurring revenue or non-run-rate revenue category in terms of impacts, and that was probably about 80 to 90 basis points of the impact Q3 to Q4, the flu, RSV impact, that typical seasonal that was kind of a, I'd say in the quarter 50 to 60 basis points, that's kind of a normal move, and then think of the rest of that move being in the zone of pretty much expected seasonal impact.\nSo the one element I'd call out there is the revenue effects that probably would be, would probably be having some impact. Thank you.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThanks so much, John. Thanks again, AJ for your question. Next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Josh Raskin with Nephron.\n\nJosh Raskin\n\nResearch Analyst, Nephron\n\nHi. Thanks. Question on the Optum Health segment, I guess, and I apologize if I missed this, but did you comment on the change in the consumers? I know you talked about portfolio changes and things like that, but the consumer count dropped about four million, and then sort of a noticeable drop in margins. I'm wondering if some of that is related to the MA rebates that you just mentioned in terms of the impact on the UHC side as well.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah. Josh, thanks so much for your question. Let me ask John to start and then ask Dr. Desai to pick up a few details on that, please. Thanks.\n\nJohn Rex\n\nCFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nGood morning, Josh. So in terms of the consumer count and impacts on that, so that would go into the category of some of the strategic initiatives that have been ongoing here. So think about some elements where we may have just been de-emphasizing in terms of our focus on that. So an area that we de-emphasized and that would go in that category is urgent care. We're approaching that a bit differently. There was a time when standalone urgent care was an important element here as you start developing more geographic density. However, in a marketplace you can probably better serve those patients by just having one of your clinics have.\nAfter-hours presence and focus on that. So one area that we have diminished in terms that emphasis is urgent is urgent care. And that's one of the areas we got out of. So really those counts were driven by somewhat narrow offerings typically that we have been diminishing and that were part of kind of some of the strategic initiatives that we talked about in terms of kind of some of the broader margin impacts you're seeing and some of the emphasis and where Optum Health was headed was headed in terms of in the Q4 and where their focus was. I'll turn that to Dr. Amar Desai to comment on.\n\nAmar Desai\n\nCEO, Optum Health\n\nThanks, Josh. Hi Josh.\nSo to take a step back, look post V28, we've been executing on our multiple year plan to reshape the business, including efforts around direct patient engagement and medical management, as well as integrating our business to deliver on operating cost efficiencies. So as we look at the quarter, we took a number of planned actions including restructuring and refining some of our legacy contracts which had a one time impact of the year. We had some membership mix changes which has been noted, and then we did make some investments in the quarter around clinical quality and the Stars program as well as onboarding for new membership coming on for 2025.\nThat being said, we feel very good about our position. Stepping into 2025, our AEP growth was strong.\nWe've also had very strong retention across our care delivery organ, again reflecting the strength of our provider network and the differentiated care they provide. We also have a better understanding of V28 as we're in the second year of it, and with this progression our payer relationships and contracts have evolved into the year. As we step into 2025 we're in a more favorable spot and then the impact of our engagement efforts. In 2024, 85% of our value-based patients were engaged, at 90% among our highest risk patients. And again this is best ever patient engagement for us and is the foundation for the maturation of our value-based cohorts over time.\nSo overall our operating model for Optum Health is stronger.\nIt's underpinned by significant momentum around these engagement and affordability as well as operating efficiencies, and we're confident in delivering against our long-term margin targets. Thanks for the question, Josh.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThanks so much. And maybe just, you know, finish off that response. Josh, if I might, by really reiterating something you heard me say just a month ago, that even in a very challenging year of 2024, with a lot of changes coming from the outside world in terms of funding reductions and the like from the administration.\nAlongside our commitment to perform, we are also relentless around how we continue to modernize and shape the company for the longer term. You know what you heard John just talk about and you just heard Amar refer to. Really, there is within Optum Health, and alongside strengthening our core business, we recognize some parts of that business aren't necessarily as important in the future as they were in the past. We're not going to shy away from making the choices to ensure that we have real clarity and focus on what we know supports our business and most importantly gives us the highest chance of giving the best possible service to patients and members who we serve.\nI think during 2024 you saw the organization be very focused not just on the year, but on the shape of how we want the company to develop over the next several years. That's really what you're seeing reflected in the commentary that John and Amar just touched on, Josh. Thanks so much for your question. If we go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.\n\nLisa Gill\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nThanks very much for taking my question, Andrew. I want to talk about PBM reform. There seems to be a very large drumbeat right now that we'll see reform at some point in 2025. Really two things here. One, what do you think that means to your business? And then secondly, you know, you talked about educating those in the marketplace to better understand what you actually bring to the market. From a PBM perspective, are there incremental ways that you can potentially maybe educate Congress? Because it seems to be a very big disconnect versus how Congress is viewing this versus what PBMs actually do.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nLisa, thanks so much for your question. And you know, this is obviously a topic of a lot of people's interest, and that's not surprising because pharmaceutical prices in the U.S. are too high. And I just made that super clear in my comments. And it's not the first time you've heard any of us at United make those comments over the last several years. As you think about that, the issue really is that you have a situation where the PBMs are really the only effective mechanism across the system which really holds the pharmaceutical company to account once it chooses to set its price.\nAnd, by the way, also has the freedom to inflate that price every single year, which is what we see happen.\nThe PBM is there to try and hold that to account, to negotiate on behalf of employers, union states, and others to try and bring down those prices. But within that, Lisa, is the very first thing that people really need to truly understand. The PBM acts on behalf of the ultimate payer, the employer, the union, the state, and such. It acts on their behalf because they're ultimately the ones who are typically underwriting the ultimate cost of the medicine for the patients, the consumers who are beneficiaries of their plans that are supported by those organizations. That is often lost in terms of how this mechanism works, and it's critical to understand it.\nWhat's important, therefore, is that we and you heard me make a couple of references this, and I hope alongside others across the sector, really focus on the facts of the situation.\nPrices in America are de novo set too high relative to any other price in the world, first off. Secondly, they're inflated every year, which is pretty unusual when you compare that to the rest of the world. Thirdly, as we negotiate to bring those prices down, the benefit of that negotiation, those rebates which are achieved, are very significant and are passed back to the employers, unions, and states. They choose what to do with those rebates.\nNow, in the case of UnitedHealthcare, where in the population of employer benefits that we manage, where we have essentially control over that decision, we pass those all the way through to the consumer and the patient who receives the drug so they see the benefit of that rebate. We'd like to see others do the same.\nWithin that overall system, there is also opportunity for people to lose a thread of where the money goes in the system. That is often what you hear policymakers be concerned about. That is why this morning we are committing to a full 100% pass-through of all rebates that we negotiate at the PBM and back to the payer, the state, or the union. Right now, we already passed 98% of that through. But unfortunately, even that, just that small residual that we retain because those clients want to pay us that way, is enough to give people the excuse to argue that the system is not working properly. We're taking that excuse off the table today.\nWe are committed to full transparency. We are committed to full pass-through to clients. We believe that takes away the excuse of who really is setting the price.\nAnd we would like to work with others across the system to relentlessly achieve the lowest net cost for everybody in the system. We'd like to see patients see the benefits of that, and we'd like to work with anybody who wants to work with us to make it happen. And that's how we're going to engage this year with policymakers and others across the country.\nWith that, Lisa, thanks so much for the question. Let me go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext is Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.\n\nStephen Baxter\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. Thanks. To stay on the policy front, I was wondering if you had any early perspective to share on the Medicare Advantage Advance Notice for 2026. I guess anything you see as encouraging or any potential areas of concern as you progress from advance to final. And then I guess as a related point, it seems like many would think that the reimbursement that's embedded in these rates is still not reflective of the elevated cost trend that we saw in 2024, even if taking a step in the right direction. Is that a company perspective that you share?\nThank you.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nHey, Stephen, thanks so much for the question. I'm going to ask Tim Noel to comment on that, please.\n\nTim Noel\n\nCEO, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement\n\nYeah, thanks for the question, Stephen. You know, as you know, these rates are preliminary at this point in time and won't be finalized until April. And so, you know, therefore, probably not super productive to start speculating on elements of that. I will say we are looking forward very much to engaging the new administration on this item and also a host of other items as it relates to the Medicare Advantage program. Thanks.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nGreat. Thanks so much, Tim. And you know, as you suggest, Stephen, you know what's most important is that this is all rational, right? So you know, it's not difficult to figure out in retrospect what trend was. And we'd like to hope that over the next few cycles we see that reflected in a, that it hasn't been over the last several years. And that for us is really the important element of what we hope will come. And it's simply just rational. And you know, it's interesting when you look at the states in Medicaid you see that kind of rational behavior. We've seen that improve, and we've been super clear that there's been historic offset lag, if you will, to that.\nThat's not surprising. That can create some discontinuity as we saw this year in 2024.\nBut underneath all of that, we see rational understanding and engagement from the states. We super appreciate that it's important, and that's what we want to hope to see, a return around the MA rate setting in a way that we have not seen over the last several years. Okay, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\n\nJustin Lake\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks.\nGood morning. Got a question here. But first I wanted to ask a quick question. Follow up on this Medicare Advantage revenue adjustment. Given the MLR for the quarter came in higher than expected, it appears this might have come as a surprise. And given that the employers, you know, the size of the employer segment feels like this adjustment's pretty large, like maybe 5% or more of annual revenue. So just trying to understand, can you give us more color here? How did the mechanics work of what's going on? Maybe you could tell us why this would have been a surprise. And what periods do they relate to? Is it all 2024?\nAnd then my actual question is more on MA growth. Curious what you saw during AEP. Going in terms of what proportion of your 8% growth expectation do you expect to come from AEP?\nDo you still see industry growth at mid single digits?\nThanks.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nHey Justin, thanks so much for the question. That was an impressive way of sneaking two instead of one. I'll let you get away with it just this time. So John, if you wouldn't mind taking the first part of Justin's good question and then I'm going to ask Bobby Hunter to take the second. Bobby leads our business in Medicare. So please go ahead.\n\nJohn Rex\n\nCFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nJustin, good morning. So yeah, in terms of those elements. So MA group customer refunds was one element of it, and certainly these are, and there were a few other adjustments running through that. We're putting all the non run rate revenue impacts here in terms of surprise or not, so perhaps not anticipated a year ago when we set out kind of in terms of our expectation for Medical Care Ratio and revenues and such.\nNot a surprise in terms of where we've been the last while though in terms of understanding these things because as they develop and you see, okay, better performance in certain group MA plans, there's going to be a refund that's given to those employers as we do, as we're performing well.\nAnd then some of the other elements, I wouldn't call them surprises, certainly relative to a year ago we didn't have those incorporated in our view, in terms of relative to months ago it would have been something we would have understood in those elements, and that was one of those. Trying to give an example, but there were a few, and they totaled up to that 80 to 90 basis points.\nGroup MA refunds being one of them. But I wouldn't call it a surprise to where our view has been the last few months here on this. And then I'll go to Tim\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nNo, to Bobby.\n\nBobby Hunter\n\nPresident, UnitedHealthcare Medicare\n\nThanks John, and thanks Justin for the question. So in terms of AEP results, we were very pleased with how things played out for us. They're very much aligned to our expectations, and it puts us on track to achieve the full year MA growth target of up to 800,000 that we've communicated. Really important to remember that with the selling changes for 2025, we do expect more than 50% of our full year growth to come in AEP. Also worth noting, this level of growth is not something we're unfamiliar with, and I'm really proud of our teams and the 1/1 readiness activities we've executed on to ensure a smooth transition for our new and returning customers.\nMaybe to offer a few highlights on the growth itself.\nSeeing really balanced and diversified growth across our products and our geographies, in particular, some really nice strength within our HMO and full dual plan offerings. John also mentioned, you know, retention performing at near record levels. A great testament to the value that we're offering to consumers and maybe last of the members who have left us in prior years. We are seeing about three times as many return to UHC this year as compared to last year. I really view that as a testament to the service models and experiences we offer. And folks clearly put a lot of value in that when they're making their decisions.\nAnd I'm really proud to see those individuals coming back to us this year. In terms of the growth rate, we certainly still continue to believe in a long-term growth rate of seven to nine%.\nAcknowledging that in certain years you can see fluctuations based on benefit changes and other factors. You know, some of that was present in 2024 and you know, similar dynamics will play out here in 2025. So we expect 2025 to generally pace, you know, in line with 2024 from a growth standpoint. You know, that said, more confident than ever in the value that MA offers to consumers and the path that we're on for MA to surpass 70% penetration over time.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nBobby, thanks so much. I just want to acknowledge Bobby personally because he, over the last couple of years, he's really led the strategizing of how to navigate through the very many external changes which have played out through V28 and the like. You know, I think you've always heard us talk about playing a multi-year strategy here, and I think that's really coming to fruition. Bobby owns a ton of the credit associated with that, and I'm delighted to see that reflected in the growth performance in the cycle we're in right now that you've just heard described.\nIt's that mix improvement that you just heard in Bobby's answer which completely differentiates 2025 from 2024 for UnitedHealthcare. Super important.\nAll of those elements you just heard described are essentially what makes up that very important mix improvement which we've been aiming for, and we feel very, very good about. Let me go to the next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.\n\nLance Wilkes\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nGreat, thanks so much, and really appreciate your comments at the beginning of the call. Could you talk a little bit about one of the things I think is hanging over long-term investors out there, which is levels of customer satisfaction. I know that's difficult to measure, but I know NPS and other metrics are things you guys look at. Can you talk a little bit about what you perceive to be the major sources of dissatisfaction in those sorts of measures? And then what are some of your strategies and priorities, and does it have.\nAny impacts on long-term algorithms for?\nThe company, as far as economic algorithms, growth algorithms, or just where you prioritize your capabilities?\nThanks.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah, Lance, thanks so much for the question. And listen, I mean, at the core of the company, and if you look at the mission of the company, it's all about trying to improve the health system for everybody. And by that, it means not just reducing the cost of that, making it more affordable, but it's also about trying to make it easier to access, less complex, less confusing. And as I said in my opening comments, we recognize there's still a lot of work to be done in that regard.\nYou know, some of the areas, like, you know, obviously claims, where people get frustrated about how long it takes for a claim to process or maybe some confusion that goes on in that, those are key areas for us to continue to work hard at to improve.\nI can tell you when you look across claims, less than half of 1% of claims are ultimately rejected for a clinical reason because for whatever reason they're not deemed to be a safe or effective treatment option. We all know there are other claims which get held up in the process before you get to that stage. Now, the overwhelming majority of those claims which are held up are held up because they were either sent to the wrong company, they didn't have the right information on them, the patient didn't have the right benefits, all of those things. Now that could all be dealt with through technology and a more standardized approach across the industry.\nI'm very, very pleased to say that we are experiencing and engaged with a much heightened energy across the organization to solve this across the whole sector for everybody.\nIn my view, probably 85% or more of all of those claims, which end up going to the wrong place and then having to be resubmitted, could all be avoided with the adoption of real-time processing, a standardized approach, a standardized intake mechanism. That's a key area for us to focus on, and that we've alluded to, that I mentioned an effort.\nWe're very close to around Medicare Advantage improvement. That's just one of the first steps. All of this sits very much in line with the work that Brian frankly led over last several years to really reduce overall activity around PAs and the like. The company will continue to do that. But I just want to emphasize the criticality of collaboration here to try and design something not just for one company, but for all companies, not just for one patient, but for all patients. That's what we've got to work toward. Really looking forward to opportunities to engage with the administration on this because they can also be an important aid to help catalyze those sorts of changes.\nThe second area of consumer improvement opportunity, where I believe we really are making great progress, is just around that consumer experience.\nSo there's no reason in the world why engaging with the healthcare system should feel any different or any less easy than any other walk, any other engagement you have in your life. And that's why we've been focused over the last several years on this move toward a consumer.\nCapability for the whole company. And that I really believe we're making breakthroughs on in terms of how we're operating. If you just look at Q1 of this year, so January of this year, and you just look at a couple of examples, our UHC mobile app visits were up 66% year-over-year. That's another record year of growth. The UHC app remains the number one healthcare app in the Google and Apple app stores across the whole of UnitedHealthcare. Our consumers are choosing to increase their digital engagement with us by about 1/3 a year. So the app is 2/3 up. Everything across the whole of UHC is up by about 1/3.\nOur app registrations are up nearly 100% year-over-year. This is, this is us moving to where American consumers want to be. They want to talk to us digitally.\nThey want to use their phone to be able to access us. They don't want to make a phone call. It's been an extraordinary shift. We continue to work that way through. We're able to talk to members now about 10% less every year of our members are making phone calls. They're getting what they need without needing to pick up the phone and make the call. All of those are fantastic metrics. You go to OptumRx, the other big consumer engagement point. The most common interaction point across American healthcare is in pharmacy. You look at the first of January; you heard already today from John, we enrolled 750 new clients.\nThey represented 1.6 million new American consumers who are now using OptumRx. We're privileged to serve those people. We were able to bring them on board at 1/3 less cost than in the prior year.\nThat is entirely due to the adoption of digital technology and other modern capabilities. Our digital engagement registrations across OptumRx themselves are up 16%. Those are all examples of how this company has been investing relentlessly, first and foremost to understand what American consumers want and then build it. We are committed to continuing to build those capabilities and deliver the very best, most convenient experience possible, not just in the insurance business, but also in the Optum service business, led by OptumRx. That's where we're going. We're committed to this agenda, Lance. We always have been and you should continue to see us make substantial improvements to make the experience of engaging with the healthcare system easier tomorrow than it was yesterday. I appreciate the question. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to David Windley with Jefferies.\n\nDavid Windley\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nThank you for taking my questions. And Andrew, thank you. I want to give you kudos for your emphasis on price. I feel like that's underappreciated in the United States. My question is around SG&A. If I extract, if I ignore the portfolio changes, the what you might call normal course, SG&A improvement, efficiency improvement in 2024 was still substantial. You need another step down in 2025, per your guidance. Both of those are, you know, significant relative to historical norms. Could you talk about the sources of that efficiency?\nPerhaps a nod to AI and some of the technology that you've talked about, but the sources of those savings and the durability of the savings that you're extracting.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group",
    "content2": "Thank you. Yeah, David, thanks so much. I'm going to ask John to give you a kind of overview, and then I'm going to ask our Chief Technology Officer to give you a few examples or a little insight into our ambitious modern, I'm going to call it, modernization agenda of technology, because it's not just AI, all of the different aspects. But I think it'd be good for you to hear from Sandeep. But John, would you mind starting off?\n\nJohn Rex\n\nCFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nGood morning, David. So the source of those savings, along the lines of the commentary that Andrew was offering a few moments ago, led by digital adoption. So we serve roughly almost 150 million people across the breadth of UnitedHealth Group. As we seek to make those experiences smoother, simpler, faster.\nThat's being led by digital adoption. It's being led by.\nHaving our customer service representatives much more informed when they do pick up the phone if the customer needs to call. Much deeper insight into frustrations or any kind of experience the customer may be having or had, so they can get to the root cause much more quickly. So you're seeing those elements just accelerate. Look, I said it a little bit in my commentary. It feels very early stage to us in terms of what we're actually doing here. And I work with the technology team, Sandeep and the teams, and what they're hitting here, these are. We're just kind of scratching the surface of the opportunity.\nSo when you ask the important questions about durability, super early stage in terms of what we see as the opportunity, I would tell you these.\nWhat we're doing right now feels like just kind of the initial scratching the surface that we'd be doing in terms of where we believe we can take this and the opportunities that we're seeing. So one of the things we're most excited about is a team. As we sit together and we think about the experience that consumers are going to have, how we're going to be able to make these much smoother, simpler, and satisfying for everyone, including our employees who work with our customers. And Sandeep, maybe you could offer a few comments.\n\nSandeep Dadlani\n\nChief Digital and Technology Officer and EVP, UnitedHealth Group\n\nSure. Thank you, John, and thanks, David, for the question. Our AI, digital automation, and, in general, our modernization agenda has focused largely on removing administrative menial tasks in the system and improving consumer experiences. Some examples earlier that you have noticed has been around our call center efforts.\nAndrew just mentioned we received 10% less calls for the same consumer base compared to last year, and we haven't even scaled this fully. By the end of 2025 we will be scaling this fully, and that's one of hundreds of use cases that we are scaling. Last quarter we talked about clinical summaries for nurses that helps our nurses focus on healthcare, and that's getting scaled fully as we focus in 2025.\nWe actually are excited about more compelling consumer experiences, helping providers and clinicians with documentations and summaries, and frankly digitizing all the paperwork in the entire healthcare experience: things, benefits, documents, facilities, provider contracts, helping drive much more automated, seamless, frictionless claims processing as well. So we're excited about the agenda. Thank you.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nSandeep. Thanks so much, David. I appreciate the question. If we could move on to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Scott Fidel with Stephens.\n\nScott Fidel\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Stephens\n\nHi, thanks. Good morning. Was hoping just given some of the unusual patterns that we saw in 2024 and that then will have effects on 2025 when thinking about the sequencing of Medicaid margins, MLRs, and some of the utilization patterns, if you would help us maybe in thinking about, you know, any comments on EPS seasonality that may be different in 2025 relative to 2024 and then similarly, you know, MLR sequencing that you're thinking maybe having a bit of a different pattern around that guidance that you gave for the full year.\nThanks.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nScott. Thanks so much, John.\n\nJohn Rex\n\nCFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nGood morning, Scott. So I'd say in terms of seasonality, first half, second half, think of that as relatively balanced in terms of seasonality for earnings progression in terms of Medical Care Ratio and thinking about kind of those elements. You start, first of course, with the view that at the midpoint the full year care ratio will be 86.5%. So as we noted earlier, about 100 basis points above the elevated 2024 level. And I just had discussed 2024 included a number of discrete items.\nWithin that. You know, the quarterly pattern will look familiar, with the first quarter below the midpoint of that, and the fourth quarter above the midpoint, trending up to the middle of the year, and then, within the year, the pattern familiar. So those would be the elements we'd kind of think about as that patterns through slope a little impacted, of course, by some of the Part D changes that are out there also, that I think you're well aware of already because those have been out for a while. So the slope of that will be impacted a bit by that also. Those would be the key elements.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nGreat John, thanks so much. Appreciate it. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nNext to Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald.\n\nSarah James\n\nManaging Director, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nThank you. I'll stick on MLR. John, could you help us bridge 2024 to 2025 by sizing some of the impact of the components that you've called out like your assumptions on core trend versus IRA and any offsets like rates or non repeat of the MA group refunds.\nThanks.\n\nJohn Rex\n\nCFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah, good morning Sarah. Certainly so kind of big elements that we'd call out here. Certainly the IRA impacts mix of our, the people we're serving, we're serving more people than public sector plans. Of course that's kind of a normal course element. And then of course a second year of the CMS funding rate reductions here.\nElements kind of probably going the other direction here would be certainly the cyber and South America impacts. We'd size those. Think about that as about 30 basis points in our 2024, some of the trend, affordability, and other initiatives that we have in there also. And then, as I mentioned, also just taking an appropriately respectful view of the care activity environment as we step out.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThank you.\nThanks so much, John. We just have time for one last question. Operator.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Joanna Gajuk with Bank of America.\n\nJoanna Gajuk\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning.\nThanks for squeezing me in.\nSo I guess something that maybe didn't come up during the discussion of MLR 2024, but also the outlook for 2025.\nCan you talk about the margins in?\nYour Medicare Advantage business to appreciate, you know, second year or V28 and such.\nJust, you know, can you explain?\nFor us, you know, the margin in that particular business was in 2024.\nVersus your target margins, and do you expect the margins to improve year-over-year in 2025?\nThank you.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nJoanna, thanks so much. Let me ask Tim Noel to respond to that.\n\nTim Noel\n\nCEO, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement\n\nThanks, Joanna, for the question. You know, as we think about our long-term planning approach to Medicare Advantage. We remain consistent in our view of targeted margins, and that doesn't change as we were thinking about 2025 like any other year, which is good because then as we think about our forward view in any sequential year, not a lot of pricing catch up that we need to engage in and can really focus on stability for people, the people we serve, and the prospects who may want to choose us in the future. So really not a lot of change here. Very consistent with how we thought about it previously.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nTim, thanks so much and Joanna, thanks so much for the question. Unfortunately, that's all the time we have this morning and I want to thank you all for a robust and productive discussion. I hope that during our session today you heard a team that is very focused on both effectively navigating the challenges and distinguishing distinct growth opportunities ahead for UnitedHealth Group. A team leading an enterprise with the capabilities and energy to help each day to make healthcare better for the people we are privileged and proud to serve. Thanks so much for your time.\n\nOperator\n\nThis does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation."

A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under US federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the Financial and Earnings Reports section of the company's Investor Relations page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com.\nInformation presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated 16 July 2024, which may be accessed from the Investor Relations page of the company's website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThank you, Jennifer. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. The Q2 results we reported today reflect diversified and durable growth and a commitment to ensuring high-quality care is available to every person we're privileged to serve. In the first half of the year, revenues grew by nearly $14 billion, with strong contributions from across the enterprise led by double-digit growth at Optum. UnitedHealth Group enters the second half of the year with continuing and broad-based growth momentum. As a result, we are affirming our full-year adjusted earnings outlook, even as we absorb $0.60 to 0.70 per share in business disruption impacts related to the cyber attack. These results come from the sustained focus of the 400,000 people of UnitedHealth Group on adding value for patients, consumers, and customers through the fundamental execution of our key priorities. We're also well-positioned for growth in 2025.\nIn the selling season to date, the most sophisticated, thoughtful buyers of health benefits and services in the US, such as large employers, unions, states, and seniors, all continue to choose the offerings of UnitedHealth Group when they're looking for managed care, pharmacy services, or a Medicare Advantage plan that provides the best value. This consistent growth reflects customers' recognition of the need for a company like ours. As you know, UnitedHealth Group strives to help reduce the fragmentation and lack of coordination that drives up costs and erodes care outcomes in the $5 trillion US healthcare marketplace. We aim to better coordinate and align incentives among caregivers, payers, and pharmacy, enabling us to focus on the whole patient throughout their health journey. We believe this increases value for customers and consumers, improves people's experience and health, reduces redundancies and waste, and ultimately leads to a more sustainable health system.\nFor example, the proven health and economic value to consumers and taxpayers of Medicare Advantage. A recent study by Milliman found that the cost to taxpayers of Medicare Advantage is 4% less than traditional fee-for-service Medicare. At the same time, Medicare Advantage provides seniors well over $2,000 per year in additional value through lower out-of-pocket costs and important services like dental, vision, and hearing, none of which fee-for-service Medicare covers. That means a lot to the majority of the people Medicare Advantage serves, who have limited economic resources and otherwise would lack access to such services. The home visits we offer seniors further illustrate the value of MA. Last year, our medical professionals made more than 2.5 million home visits. As a direct result, our clinicians identified 300,000 seniors with emergent health needs that may otherwise have gone undiagnosed.\nThey connected more than 500,000 seniors to essential resources to help them with unaddressed needs such as food insecurity, medication affordability, transportation, and financial support. They also identified and helped close more than 3 million gaps in care that made a real difference in people's lives. Within 90 days of one of our home visits, 75% of patients receive follow-up in a clinical setting. Additionally, Medicare Advantage patients with chronic conditions who receive these home visits end up with better-managed and more stable health outcomes, as evidenced by spending measurably less time than fee-for-service patients in emergency room and other hospital settings. The bottom line: our home visit programs help patients live healthier lives and save taxpayers money. It is only Medicare Advantage that makes programs and results like this possible.\nSimilarly, Optum Rx clients continue to appreciate the efforts we make to ensure delivery of the lowest-cost drugs in the face of drug companies' sole ability to set prices. They also recognize the importance of the comprehensive pharmacy services we provide to people, that's driving our momentum this year and bodes well for 2025. We also continue to bring practical innovation to people through new products and services and by using new and emerging technologies to improve our own operating efficiency. For example, Surest continues to differentiate itself in the marketplace, which is why more and more customers are offering it to their employees and why the offering continues to grow substantially. Additionally, investments in modernization of legacy technology and new emerging technologies are enabling our consumer-centric advancement of healthcare.\nFor example, our growing AI portfolio made up of hundreds of practical use cases will generate billions of dollars of efficiencies over the next several years. These investments enable us to improve consumer experience, enhance provider-find and price-care capabilities to meet people's needs, and improve clinical back-office execution. We expect technology innovation to become an increasingly core driver of our growth over the next two to five years. And now, I'll turn it over to our President and Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\n\nJohn Rex\n\nPresident and CFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThank you, Andrew. I'll start this morning by providing context on some of the unique items in the quarter. Then I'll follow with perspectives on care activity and general business updates. The overarching theme I hope you leave with today is that UnitedHealth Group continues to deliver broadly diversified growth with expanding opportunities, work that positions us for continued strong performance in 2025 and beyond. Now, to update on Change Healthcare. Our focus has centered on the patients, care providers, and customers who rely on us to keep the health system running. Payment and claim slows for most care providers are back to normal, but we know that is not the case for some. So we continue to work with those who are not there yet.\nUnitedHealth Group has provided more than $9 billion in loans and advance payments to help providers mitigate the impact of the attack, all at no cost to them. Cyber impacts in the quarter totaled $0.92 per share, and we now estimate the full-year impact will be $1.90 to 2.05 per share. Let me break that down a couple of steps further for you. Of the total in the quarter, $0.64 per share were direct costs incurred in restoring the clearinghouse platform and other response efforts. These included higher medical expenses directly stemming from the temporary pause of some care management activities. For the full year, we now estimate these direct costs at $1.30 to 1.35 per share.\nThe $0.40 to 0.45 per share increase in this estimate is primarily related to care provider financial support and costs for producing and mailing the consumer notifications that will begin later this month. As a reminder, these direct costs are included in net earnings but are excluded from adjusted earnings per share. The other component affecting our results relates to disruption of the ongoing Change Healthcare business. This largely encompasses the loss of revenues combined with the costs of keeping these capabilities fully ready to serve. Notably, these effects are not excluded from adjusted earnings. In Q2, this impact was $0.28 per share. For the full year, we now estimate the business disruption impacts at $0.60 to 0.70 per share, compared to the $0.30 to 0.40 we estimated last quarter.\nMost of the service functionality is now restored, and revenues are rebuilding, even as the pacing of this process varies. These important services are now more modern, secure, and capable, and continuing to advance rapidly. Our ambition continues to be to return to baseline performance in 2025 and to grow strongly from there. Turning to international. Following the sale last quarter of our much larger Brazil operations, we classified the remaining South American businesses as held for sale. This is a natural step following the Brazil sale. We highly value the relationships we have built with our dedicated colleagues over the last several years and wish them continued success. In a diverse enterprise with a strong growth record and capabilities such as ours, such portfolio evolutions enable us to keep our focus on the many compelling growth opportunities before us.\nQ2 includes a total of $1.3 billion in South American impacts, the majority of which is non-cash and largely due to foreign currency translation losses accumulated over the years. About $220 million of this stems from a regulatory action in Chile affecting all health plans. You'll see that as a component in the supplemental financial tables we provided this morning. The action relates to industry premium increases dating back to 2020, but as configured, will be reflected in consumer premium credits to be issued in future years. As a result, the entire $220 million was recorded as a reduction to premium revenue in Q2, increasing our reported medical care ratio by about 25 basis points.\nTurning to the Q2 medical care ratio, it was also impacted by about 40 basis points, or $290 million, due to the suspension of some care management activities after the cyber attack. That makes for a total of about 65 basis points of non-repeating impacts, including South America. Beyond these effects, the care ratio in the quarter was also modestly affected by three other factors, one being member mix within Medicare Advantage and Dual Special Needs plans, which this year has been shaped by the unusual competitive benefit configurations in the marketplace. A second being the timing mismatch between the current health status of remaining Medicaid members and the state rate updates, a timing mismatch we expect to realign in the months ahead. And third, the lingering upshift in provider coding intensity, which we believe was spurred by the temporary suspension of our care review activities and carried past.\nThis impact is not reflected in our cyber attack direct response costs, and we have been addressing it. Nonetheless, we continue to expect our full-year medical care ratio, excluding 30 basis points of cyber and South American effects, to be within the range we offered in November, albeit at the upper end. For our 2025 Medicare Advantage planning process, we assumed care patterns and mix at the levels we are seeing today, in addition to fully incorporating the second of the three-year phased funding cuts. We have been fully attuned to how the Inflation Reduction Act will affect Medicare Part D offerings in 2025. Also, as noted, we expect the Medicaid timing mismatch to subside as rates are updated throughout the remainder of this year and into next, appropriately reflecting current member health status. Turning to the performance of our businesses.\nAt UnitedHealthcare, revenues of $74 billion grew by $3.6 billion. UHC domestic commercial membership grew 2.3 million in the first half of this year as employers and consumers responded to our distinctive offerings. And while the '25 selling season is ongoing, we are encouraged by the continued momentum we see. Our recently filed Medicare Advantage bid for '25 again took a balanced approach to provide as much stability for seniors as possible while factoring in the realities of the funding cuts and current care patterns. You can expect us to continue to prioritize balanced and durable performance over transitory market share gains. In Medicaid, we expect membership levels to stabilize as we head into the second half of the year, and our teams are executing well with both renewals and expansions. Optum Health's revenues grew by 13% to $27 billion, and the operating margin expanded over last year.\nWe are on track to approach 5 million patients in value-based care by the end of this year and are progressing strongly on our earlier and deeper engagement with patients, with a purposeful focus on our newer regions to more rapidly improve health outcomes and experiences. Optum Rx revenues grew 13% to over $32 billion, driven by strong customer response to the differentiated value, consumer experience, and clinical expertise we offer. At Optum Insight, for the services beyond Change Healthcare, we see strong performance in line with our expectations. The revenue backlog increased to nearly $33 billion, growth of over $1 billion from a year ago, driven by business process and information technology services for health systems. A few additional items of note.\nAs we highlighted in April, we established an additional $800 million in medical reserves in Q1 to reflect the potential for the cyber attack to have affected claims receipt timing. With claims now flowing at more normalized levels, we continue to prudently analyze these trends. Similar to last quarter, the Q2 results do not reflect any favorable earnings impacting medical reserve development. Days in claims payable at 45.2, compared to 47.1 in Q1. The change was due primarily to the return to more normal claim submission patterns from providers and, to a lesser extent, some impact from reclassifying the remaining South American operations to held for sale. Cash flows from operations in the quarter were $6.7 billion, or 1.5x net income, even with the accelerated funding for care providers.\nIn June, our board of directors increased the dividend by 12%, marking the 15th consecutive year of double-digit dividend increases to shareholders. During the quarter, as I mentioned earlier, we prioritized devoting resources to support care providers in the wake of the cyber attack over some activities such as share repurchase. It was the right thing to do, devoting all our efforts to provide stability for the health system. Still, with our ongoing strong capital capacities and with support needs abating, we expect to achieve the full-year repurchase objective we shared with you last November.\nIn summary, it is the confidence we have in the performance of our diversified businesses that allows us to affirm full-year adjusted EPS in the range of $27.50 to 28, the objective we established last year, even as we have absorbed the unanticipated $0.60 to 0.70 cents in business disruption impacts. Within this, we expect a balanced pacing in the second half. Now, I'll turn it back to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nJohn, thank you. As I said in November at our investor conference, we operate in an environment where change is constant. What you've come to see is that when changes happen, foreseen or unforeseen, we just deal with it. UnitedHealth Group is a nimble and adaptable enterprise, well-suited to meet the challenges that come our way and the opportunities we pursue with the many and diverse capabilities available to us. In this first half, as we've done before, we navigated a complex external environment while managing through a significant business disruption. We continue to deliver on our growth objectives and are committed to delivering on our 13% to 16% long-term growth target. We'll now answer any questions you might have. Operator, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The floor is now open for questions. At this time, if you have a question or comment, please press star one on your touch-tone phone. You may remove yourself from the queue by pressing star two on your touch-tone phone. We ask you to limit yourself to one question. If you ask multiple questions, we will only be answering the first question, so we can respond to everyone in queue this morning. We'll go first to A.J. Rice with UBS.\n\nA.J. Rice\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, UBS\n\nHi, thanks for the question. Just to make sure, expanding on John's comments, if we're thinking about your thinking on MLR overall for the rest of the year, it sounds like beyond Change, beyond Latin America, there's two items you're calling out. One is the Medicaid timing mismatch, which sounds like you think it's short-term, and then this upcoding, coding intensity comment. And I assume that's mainly in the insurance business, but maybe it's in Optum Health as well. Can you just give us a sense of how much those are impacting your thinking and how much is Q2 versus the impact in the back half on those?\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah, AJ, thanks for the question. Let me ask John to get right to it.\n\nJohn Rex\n\nPresident and CFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nGood morning, AJ. Yeah, and really kind of three items that we're talking to in addition to those two here, also the member mix component here, when you bring it all together, those additional items that we're looking at in terms of versus where we were and how we're thinking about it. I would say they're kind of roughly equivalent in roughly equivalent zone in terms of their impact here and then how they flow throughout the year, the rest of year. Really, you'll see some of those elements. So as it relates to Medicaid impacts, pricing goes on over a period of, say, kind of 12 months or so. So there's pricing that occurs over the rest of this year into next year. So those elements in terms of catching up, that mismatch catching up with the acuity that we have in the remaining population occurs over a period.\nCertainly, we are addressing the elements we talked about in terms of what we're seeing in the coding upshift, and we're well underway in addressing those elements, but we'll continue to address them throughout the course of the year. The member mix is kind of the member mix we have now at this point. And that really pertains to just the elements that I mentioned, my prepared comments about some of the benefit design impacts and how that impacted both our growth and also the type of membership that we were left with as we saw our full configuration. That really lasts with us throughout the year. But that was an element we also incorporated into our view for 2025 as we approached our bid for '25. Thank you.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nWell said, John. And maybe just to reiterate one thing John said and then maybe add a further point, AJ. Super important just to hear what he said in terms of that member mix. Obviously, we deal with it during this year, but we obviously had the opportunity to incorporate it into our 2025 planning and bid. So feel very good about that. And then secondly, maybe just to reflect, step back just a little bit on, as we think about MLR, really the biggest incoming dynamic on MLR at the beginning of this year was the funding reduction in MA, the V28, significant reduction in funding. And you can see that we are fundamentally navigating that, I think, extremely well. And yes, there are a couple of areas of pressure at the margin.\nI think, as you just heard from John, they're primarily boxed off in terms of they're going to work their way through the pricing cycle with Medicaid or, in the case of concerns around coding activity, we're very focused on that, confident we'll be able to we are addressing that. So those things feel transitory. Most importantly, we feel good about the way our response to the V28 funding cut is playing out for us in the overall business. And really, as we started the year, that was the much bigger thing to make sure we got right. And I'm feeling like we're well on the way through the first year of this three-year cycle, and we've talked to you repeatedly about how critical it is to make sure we navigate that over the long run, and we feel good about that. So thanks, AJ. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, we'll go next to Lisa Gill with J.P. Morgan.\n\nLisa Gill\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nThanks very much and good morning. I wanted to focus for a minute on SG&A, which came in much better than expected. Can you maybe talk about the key components of where you're seeing cost savings, the durability? And Andrew, you touched a little bit about AI efficiencies there. Are you starting to see that in this quarter, and how much opportunity is there from an SG&A perspective when we think about AI?\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nLisa, thanks so much for the question. I'm going to ask John to comment a little bit. Let me make a couple of kind of upfront comments and then maybe a couple of examples more specifically to help you a little bit on this. So to get your last point, we are running now hundreds of AI use case deployments. I'd say the first wave of those are essentially allowing us to do things much more quickly, much more reliably, much more efficiently than humans can do them. So an ability to navigate complexity, to find answers within complex data sets. And it's super important, and I'll give you a couple of examples of how that begins to help us as we go on.\nI think we are now. You will also start to see as we roll through the end of this year and next year, those same kind of tools begin to be deployed in fundamental reimagination of business process. So one is essentially allowing an existing process to run more efficiently. The second is, can we actually take steps out of a process and really start to change things? I'd call out payment integrity as a front-runner in that particular regard. And you'll start to see a lot of movement there over the next year or so, Lisa. And it's going to be, I think, Optum Insight 2025, 2026, 2027 in terms of deployment of technology to change many of the processes that we've been used to for decades is coming. And that's going to be a very exciting phase.\nIf you look in the short run, I'll give you a couple of examples. This plays a little bit around technology. I certainly wouldn't say these are all generative AI examples, but they're certainly digitization examples. They are certainly technology-enabled examples. So, for example, we've brought on this year at Optum Rx a record number of clients. You've seen the growth. You can imagine the number of folks who've been signed up into our Rx platforms. We actually spent 9% less this year in the onboarding of that record volume than we did the prior year. 9% entirely due to digitization, technology efficiency deployed through the organization. Let me take you into another part of the organization, Optum Health. We've more or less increased our number of fully risk-delegated lives within Optum Health by about 40% over the last two years.\nBy the way, that's in excess of a million, almost a million and a half more lives over that period with zero increase in personnel headcount in the risk-based businesses. So zero increase in headcount in a business which has increased its served members by close to 40%. So those are just a couple of examples. You're seeing that show up in those two examples, Optum. That's why you're starting to see that leverage flow through the Optum business line. And it's something we obviously expect to continue to sustain over many, many quarters and years. And John, I'd love you to go a little deeper.\n\nJohn Rex\n\nPresident and CFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah, good morning, Lisa. I guess I'd start by it is early in that journey in terms of the potential and opportunity for what we can do. And yes, it was a very strong quarter in terms of cost management. But let me just step back a moment here. As you can imagine, given how some of these businesses were built and the fragmentation of the system, there are duplicative functions and uneven consumer experiences throughout that we're addressing. And as our businesses begin to scale, our ability to produce efficiency accelerates. While at the same time, we can improve those customer experiences and expand the best practice across the broader base. The comments that Andrew was offering in his answer to your question. It's just really a natural outgrowth as these businesses begin to move beyond what we have viewed the earliest phases to a more adolescent phase.\nThat's what we're seeing. Very strong this quarter. Over the longer term, we can expect advancement. I wouldn't expect it to remain at this level consistently as we look ahead over the next few quarters, though. It was a super strong quarter, but we are going to look to invest in many of these items that Andrew just articulated here, getting to a more modern streamlined experience as these businesses evolve further. So I wouldn't expect it to persist right at this level as we make those investments. And we're anxious and ambitious to make those investments.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nGreat. So, Lisa, thanks for raising it. You can tell it's a big focus for us. We laid out when V28 first was announced that one of the three ways that we would respond to this is we would double down on our own cost management, efficiency, and productivity. You're absolutely seeing that. And that coincides with an extraordinarily exciting moment around technological innovation, whether that's generative AI, digitization, all wrapped together in our march toward a greater consumer focus within the organization. All of that really hangs together. It's very much the core focus of how we think about things going forward. Thanks, Lisa. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.\n\nJosh Raskin\n\nPartner, Nephron Research\n\nHi, thanks. Good morning. Looking at your bids that you submitted for MA for 2025, I'd be curious if you could tell us if you were bidding to improve MA margins in 2025 or if you're still within that target range in light of the G&A savings. And then more importantly, maybe just some early thoughts on what sort of growth assumptions you included in those bids, both your assumption for the market as well as any potential market share gains.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nHey, Josh, thanks so much. I'm going to ask Tim Noel to address the first part of your question. On the second part, you're not going to be surprised that I'm going to defer from making any predictions about next year. Still a little early. We'd like to see where everybody else plays out in this cycle. I think we also all saw in the 2024 cycle, ultimately, the way growth plays out in the marketplace depends on how everybody bids, not just on how you bid. And it only takes one bid to be kind of out of expectation to completely distort your view of how things could play out. So just going to defer a little bit on that one, but on the first point, Tim, I'd love you to make a few comments.\n\nTim Noel\n\nCEO of UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah. Thanks, Josh, for the question. So as we think about margins in the MA business and as it relates to our bid, I think we've talked about the consistent approach to how we plan margins. And we continue to maintain that, and we're operating comfortably within that margin range as we have in the past and as we're planning in 2025. And then when I think about our pricing approach for 2025, as Andrew mentioned, too early to get into a lot of specifics as CMS is reviewing those bids right now. But we're in a posture in how we've priced those products as we'll be comfortable with whatever growth is the outcome of the products that we bring to marketplace in 2025.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nGreat. Thanks so much, Tim. Josh, appreciate the question. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.\n\nStephen Baxter\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Hi, thanks. Can you speak in a little greater detail about your expectation that the Medicaid pressure starts to subside in the second half of the year? I guess specifically, can you maybe speak to what you actually know about rates today, either draft or finalized, versus perhaps speaking to a general reliance on actuarially sound rates playing out over a reasonable period of time? Just trying to understand the level of visibility that you have a bit better. Thank you.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nOkay. Hey, Stephen, thanks for the question. I'm going to ask Krista Nelson, who leads our Medicaid business, to respond to that, Krista.\n\nKrista Nelson\n\nCEO of UnitedHealthcare Community and State, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah, thanks so much for the question. So as it relates to visibility, we've got visibility into the majority of our rates for 2024. And while there's just a slight gap in the Q2, we really like how our 7-1 rates are shaping up and continue to work with state partners to influence key assumptions before those rates become final in the future. And while we might see a little bit of dislocation rest of year, states have really committed to accurately reflecting the change in acuity from redeterminations into current and future adjustments, and really expect this to even out as we pace through the remainder of 2024 and early 2025. Thanks for the question.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nKristen, thanks so much. So I mean, listen, Stephen, I think you heard there why we're confident that this is really a kind of time-fenced issue. And in the grand scheme of things, I would characterize this as at the margin. It's a part of what you've seen in this small deviation in Q2, but we don't really see it as a sustainably structural issue. And you heard exactly why just there. So thanks, Kristen. Stephen, thanks for your question. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\n\nJustin Lake\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning. Just a quick clarification and then a question about second half MLR. So first, a clarification on the MLR. It sounded like, John, you're guiding to a core MLR at the high end of the range or 84.5. And then I would add 30 basis points of the one-timers for the full year that you've seen in the first half. That would leave GAAP MLR at 84.8. Is this correct? And to be clear, is there any expectation for further one-timers in the second half of the year, or should the third and Q4 kind of be clean?\nAnd then my question is just around core MLR in the Q1 ex one-timers was 84.2. Sounds like it'll be 84.8 in the second half. Maybe you could help us think about Q3 versus Q4 just to make sure expectations are set correctly given how much focus there is here. Thanks.\n\nJohn Rex\n\nPresident and CFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nGood morning, Justin. I'd say first, yes, the way you described our assumptions around core at full year MLR are consistent with our expectations. So how you describe that is quite consistent. As it relates to just looking at toward Q3 and such, I'd expect that to be in the neighborhood of 84%, very likely a few tens of basis points higher than that, though. So kind of a little bit above that in that zone. As it relates to kind of other elements that we've pulled out here, no, they shouldn't be material. Those cyber effects should continue to abate. As we mentioned, we're not adjusting for the elements we talked about, the provider and coding intensity. So that kind of pulls through a little bit. But there shouldn't be any material other impacts that we're thinking about. Thank you.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThanks, John. Thanks, Justin. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Scott Fidel with Stephens.\n\nScott Fidel\n\nManaging Director, Stephens\n\nHi, thanks, John. Good morning. Actually, I was hoping we could maybe do a similar exercise as Justin just asked about with MLR for Optum Health margins. And maybe first, if you can talk about how the OH margins came in in Q2 relative to your expectations, and then how you're thinking about OH margins progressing in Q3 and Q4, and then how comfortable you are with getting into the full-year target range that you had provided. And, John, I thought it might be helpful too, as we think about the sort of pacing in the back half of the year, in particular, how you're thinking about an exit rate for Optum Health margins as we're exiting 2024, would be helpful. Thanks.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nScott, thanks so much for your question. I'm going to ask Dr. Amar Desai, who leads Optum Health, to give you a few comments there. I mean, let me just preface that by saying, look, we feel good, very good about the continued progression, and in particular, the way in which Optum Health has adjusted to deal with the new funding environment. I'm also very, very encouraged by the degree of external payer engagement with our Optum Health platform as they deal with the environment themselves and look at Optum Health as a part of that solution. I think the performance of the business you see is it continues to improve over last year. You continue to see decent progression. Let me ask Amar to give you a little bit of a sense of how he sees the second half of the year playing out.\n\nAmar Desai\n\nCEO of Optum Health, UnitedHealth Group\n\nHi, Scott. Thanks for the question. So as Andrew said, we're in the middle of the first year of a large rate reduction over the next three years, effectively being a price cut. And as we think about the initiatives, we're pleased with the early success mitigating the impact of that changing rate environment. In 2023, we developed a three-year plan to manage through V28. Medical cost management and affordability initiatives was at the center of it. Proactive clinical engagement that impacts member experience and total cost of care is obviously core to that, including better prevention and chronic disease management. And then disciplined operating cost management, more efficient ways to work, improvements and productivity, driving consistency in our workflows and systems, which Andrew and John alluded to. We're executing very well on this plan, seeing solid progress across each of these areas.\nAs an example, at this time last year, we had engaged 62% of all members. Year to date, we've engaged 3/4 of all members and above that for our highest-risk membership. We're also focused on coordination of care, particularly at transition points in care, where we've increased post-discharge visits for patients who have been hospitalized. That has, in fact, reduced readmission rates by 10% in our most mature markets. So as we pace through the balance of the year, we expect to continue to build on this momentum across engagement, affordability, and operating cost management, and we're confident in the 7.78% target for the year.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nGreat. Amar, thanks so much. Scott, thanks again for the question. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.\n\nKevin Fischbeck\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thanks. Just wanted to clarify, I guess, something and ask another question. It wasn't clear to me what you were saying about no favorable reserve development. Does that mean the $800 million that you mentioned previously is still somehow in the numbers, or has that kind of worked its way through at the end of Q2? And then I guess just trying to understand better where the outperformance is, because obviously you guys have assumed $0.60 to 0.70 of change costs in your guidance, but reaffirmed the numbers. And it doesn't sound like Medicare's the answer. It doesn't sound like Medicaid's the answer. Change isn't the answer. So where has the outperformance come in that's allowed you to maintain guidance? Thanks.\n\nJohn Rex\n\nPresident and CFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah. Good morning, Kevin. It's John. So yeah, so exactly what we said, there was nothing material there going on in development. No favorable P&L impacting development in the quarter. Very similar to last quarter in terms of there was just no impacting there. And in terms of just the comments or questions regarding outperformance, well, maybe across the number of the businesses in terms of where we're seeing very strong growth, certainly in our commercial health benefits business, we're seeing strong growth. We're seeing margin progression in Optum Health. So we're seeing advancement.\nReally, the strong approach that the team at M&R took into how they looked at 2024 in terms of overcoming the headwinds of V28 and the very disciplined approach they took to how they stepped out into the marketplace with the products that they took, even with some of the elements that we talked about that we're overcoming there, but certainly all those creating a good impact from us. Clearly, just across the company, the strong operating efficiencies that the company is driving, strong and sustained. They said, \"Look, we will continue to make investments, but really significant progress on that.\"\nStill feel very early stage, as Andrew commented, in terms of the potential we have as we look over the next five years and this impact. We're just getting some of these businesses to a maturity level where we think we can really harness that. Thank you.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah. Thanks, John. And let me just also reiterate that point. I mean, part of what you're seeing here, Kevin, is obviously the big change this year was the V28 funding cut price reduction, which obviously focuses primarily on our Medicare Advantage business that Tim runs and the Optum Health business that Amar runs, both of whom are responding super well. But let's be clear. While those pricing cuts are focused on two businesses, Team UHG is responding, right? The entire corporation is engaged in how it manages itself better, reduces cost across the company, leverages technology, accelerates our consumer agenda, all designed to play our part across the board in how we offset the pressure that's been inflicted on those two important businesses. It's why we're confident we can navigate this. I think you're seeing that in the performance of the business, and we're going to continue.\nIt's why I said what I said earlier today. We're going to continue to focus on every aspect of our business to make sure that the model we've laid out and we believe is the right one for delivering best value care for patients is the one that prospers. And we're super confident in that. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Andrew Mok with Barclays.\n\nAndrew Mok\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning. The Optum Insight backlog was down about $200 million sequentially. Can you give us color on the drivers of that and the nature of conversations you're having with providers following the cyber attack? Do you expect further declines in the backlog this year? Thanks.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nAndrew, thanks so much for that. Let me ask Roger Connor to address that. It's pretty straightforward, but let me ask Roger to answer that and maybe give you a little bit more flavor on what he's seen.\n\nRoger Connor\n\nCEO of Optum Insight and EVP of Enterprise Operations and Services Optum, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah. Andrew, thanks very much for the question. Just in terms of backlog, obviously an important measure, and there has been some impact from the Change event within that. What it doesn't include, obviously, is what we're doing in terms of bringing in new clients and what we're doing in our whole innovation space. But fundamentally, we're very confident in terms of the performance going into next year. The cyber event, certainly from an impact on the overall health system, is now absolutely minimal. When you look at our overall focus, it's now on driving that business recovery. And that's all about bringing volume back into the system. And we're seeing that actually really ramping up and seeing momentum and acceleration. We're not only trying to bring volume back into our current customers. We're also working to bring new clients in.\nAnd that's exciting because this event has really transformed the marketplace. They're looking for, again, access to innovation, access to security in the system. And that's what we've brought back. We've brought back a very secure system, and that is resonating. We're seeing that momentum. You add that to the underlying strength of the Optum Insight business. Again, Change Healthcare is only 15% of our overall business. Performance this year was planned. That's why we're confident in terms of getting back to our baseline performance in 2025.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nGreat. Thanks so much, Roger. Thanks, Andrew. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.\n\nNathan Rich\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to go back to the provider coding activity that you called out and ask, maybe, what you saw kind of change in the quarter, and what actions you're taking to address this change. Is this pressure something that you accounted for in bids for next year? Then, if I could just ask a very quick clarification on the Change impact on EPS. You talked about the return to baseline performance in 2025. Does that mean you would expect to recover the $0.60 to 0.70 that is in earnings this year? Thank you.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nOkay. Thanks so much for the question, Nathan. Brian, if you'd like to go first.\n\nBrian Thompson\n\nCEO of UnitedHealthcare Unit, UnitedHealth Group\n\nSure. I'll answer that first part on the upshift that we saw in provider level of care coding patterns. We actually believe that was largely induced by our level of care waivers that we did during the cyber disruption. The reason we believe that is we really saw a higher level of mix to inpatient versus observation after we went back to turning on our utilization management protocols. Pretty distinct on 15 April and thereafter. So that's why we see that. Certainly aware of that activity as we plan for 2025 in our bids. So really no concerns with respect to that. Feel like it's an anomaly tied to what we saw during our waiver. And we have reinforced our utilization management protocols and believe that these impacts will dampen as we pace through the remainder of the year.\n\nJohn Rex\n\nPresident and CFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah. And regarding Change, yes, as we mentioned in our comments and Roger mentioned, our ambition is to get back to baseline expectations performance for that business in 2025. So those baseline expectations being what we would have expected prior to any of this happening. And clearly, this quarter, we increased the impact of the business disruption here. So as we bring those back, there's the pacing of those revenues coming back, taking sometimes a little bit more time to bring in. But that is our ambition, actually, as we look ahead.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThanks, John, Brian. I mean, again, just on this business interruption piece, I mean, I think in all honesty, we were a little optimistic in hindsight at the pace at which we thought people would come back in terms of putting their flow through the system once it was reconnected. I think as we've looked at the last several weeks, that momentum and pace, and particularly as we look at new clients coming in as well as returning clients, feel good about where we are now. So I think probably a little over-optimistic three months ago. I think now I feel like we have this now, and we're in good position, and the rest of the year we've got a clear path how this plays out. And I think the platform that we've rebuilt is going to serve people extremely well. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.\n\nErin Wright\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks. So on the earlier topic of potential offsets, I wanted to ask on Optum Rx and with the recent level of industry attention kind of on the PBM business as well as kind of specialty pharmacy, how should we think about how those drivers are playing out relative to your expectations, whether it's biosimilars or GLP-1s in terms of that therapeutic category? How should we think about those near-term drivers across Optum Rx? Thanks.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nErin, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Heather, who runs Optum for us, to make a couple of comments on that, if you don't mind, Heather.\n\nHeather Cianfrocco\n\nEVP of Governance, Compliance and Information Security, UnitedHealth Group\n\nSure. Just basically, I think you can see in the quarter just strong performance. Maybe a couple of things I would just highlight for that. We've talked for a few years about the investments we've been making in Optum Rx on both the PBM side, but also on the pharmacy side. On the PBM side, you've seen the growth there in client and just in volume, sort of same with respect to volume within our existing clients as well. We take that as a sign of strong retention of existing clients and continuing to perform with them. I think the thing I'd highlight on the PBM side is, I've said this before, the modular effect of the PBM business. We serve at the privilege of our clients. So what they need, we serve.\nThat is we administer their benefit, and we offer the programs, the services to drive affordability of medications for them in the best interest of their members. We've brought a lot of products and services in the last year, two or three new products this market that are leading, differentiating in the marketplace that we are seeing our health plans and our employers take advantage of this year that are really market differentiating. We're seeing that drive not just growth with health plans, but growth in products and services. So I think you're seeing that show up. The other thing you're seeing is the cost efficiency show up in the business. One thing Andrew brought up an example, and you're seeing some of the timing of supply chain efficiency. On the services side of the business, you mentioned specialty.\nI'd call out the diversification of the pharmacies in general. Remember, we've got the integrated behavioral health business, which continues to grow and expand. It's a very differentiated business in that it's co-located, and it's specifically directed at those behavioral health members to ensure access, affordability, and holistic care to individuals with mental health conditions. And then our frontier and our infusion services that really drive those specialty medications in home. We're seeing continued need for that from our PBM clients, but also non-PBM clients. And so that's why we're really seeing that diversified growth. So you're just seeing that show up in continued consistent performance in that business through the quarter.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nHeather, thank you. Aaron, thanks so much for the question. We have time for one final question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.\n\nLance Wilkes\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nGreat. Thanks. For Optum Health, could you talk a little bit about what pricing has been like there? And yesterday, it seemed like you may have seen some improved pricing as far as global cap rates and likewise given higher global cap rates of the M&A business. I was wondering if in 2025 we should be expecting continued improvement in that or whether there needs to be a retrenchment or a retracing of that to kind of make up for what was given. And also, are you starting to exclude things from global cap as you look at 2025? Thanks.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nHey, Lance. Thanks for the question. Love the cheeky attempt at the end of the call to predict, give you some numbers for '25. We're going to refrain from that, but well done on the last-ditch effort. I'm going to ask Amar to give you a little bit more of a kind of general sense of how we're seeing that. Please go ahead, Amar.\n\nAmar Desai\n\nCEO of Optum Health, UnitedHealth Group",
    "content2": "Thanks for the question, Lance. Look, we continue to have very strong relationships across our over 100 plan partners. In fact, in a pretty dynamic rate and benefit environment, we've seen increased outreach from payers looking for an enduring partner that's very adept at operating within fully capitated value-based arrangements. In particular, the discussions have been productive around benefit design, funding, market-level planning, and we're confident in the position as we go into 2025. We're down the path in adding plan partners as well as adding geographies for 2025. Foundational within that to those relationships and as we think about those arrangements is quality. Quality of care of our providers that are anchored in the community, our strong ability to drive clinical outcomes, improvements, and achievement in Star measures, and of course, strong documentation and diagnosis.\nWe also are seeing that the strength of our network that's aligned in geographies is an important focus area for plan partners. And of course, continued focus on clinical engagement, which I mentioned previously. So when you take that together, great momentum across those areas gives us confidence as we drive value for our plan partners and as we pace through the next two years of the risk model changes and grow.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nAmar, thank you very much. As I think you could probably sense from those couple of answers that Amar has given you over the course of the call, Amar leads a very, very special team of people running a very, very special business in terms of what it's able to do on behalf of patients and the way it's able to provide great work experience for the healthcare professionals and colleagues who work in that business. Very pleased with how the continuation of that business progresses. We're coming toward the end of the call. I'd like to thank you all for your questions this morning.\nAs you've heard, our focus on fundamental execution, our restless spirit, and our ability to adapt to changing environments gives us great confidence as we look ahead and is a testament to the hard work and discipline of the people of UnitedHealth Group who work every day to serve patients, consumers, and care providers, customers efficiently and effectively. We appreciate your time this morning. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.\nHere are some introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.\nThis call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial and earnings reports section of the company's Investor Relations page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated April 16, 2024, which may be accessed from the Investor Relations page of the company's website.\nI will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty.\n\nAndrew Philip Witty\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Executive Officer-Optum, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today. We have a lot to cover. First, we'll discuss the status and impact of the Change Healthcare cyberattack. Then we'll turn to the performance of our businesses, which continue to grow and perform well.\nIt's important to underscore at the outset that even as we have devoted significant attention to addressing the Change Healthcare attack, the vast majority of the 400,000 people of this enterprise have remained as usual, intensely focused on delivering for all those we serve. That dedication is reflected in our overall performance this quarter.\nDirectly as a result of their hard work and the broad performance of our diversified businesses, we're able to reconfirm our full year adjusted earnings outlook even as we absorb $0.30 to $0.40 per share in business disruption impacts related to Change Healthcare.\nNow turning to Change Healthcare. This was an unprecedented attack by a malicious actor on the U.S. health system. We promptly disconnected the affected services and turned our focus to two main areas: Restoration and support. The attack disrupted the ability of care providers to file claims and be paid for their work. We moved quickly to fill this gap.\nFortunately, we were able to bring to bear the substantial resources of UnitedHealth Group to drive the recovery and begin to mitigate the impact. Resources, which are stand-alone Change Healthcare would not have had access to on its own. These are the resources and the philosophy that underpinned our remediation of healthcare.gov back in 2013 and our distribution of CMS COVID emergency relief fund to care providers in 2020. Here, we assisted care providers in financial need, providing over $6 billion in funding, all at no cost to them.\nWe rapidly deployed resources to develop alternative solutions and move promptly to restore claims and payment services. We've made substantial progress, and we will not rest until care providers connectivity needs are met. And to help care providers mitigate workflow disruptions and help ensure the uninterrupted delivery of care, for a period of time, we suspended some care management activities.\nI'm immensely grateful for our colleagues who continue to work tirelessly day and night to restore services, free up funds for providers and protect the broader health system.\nLet me touch on two more items we know are of interest to you. First is care activity. The central point is that overall care patterns are consistent with what we anticipated last year heading into 2024 and within the outlook we shared with you in November. The second item is the essential value of Medicare Advantage to seniors.\nHere are what we see are some of the core facts regarding Medicare Advantage: It drives better health outcomes; provides a higher value, significantly more comprehensive benefit for people, all at a lower cost of beneficiaries and taxpayers and is more popular with and valuable to seniors than traditional Medicare.\nMedicare Advantage consumers spend on average, 45% less on premiums and out-of-pocket costs than those in traditional Medicare. That translates into nearly $2,400 in savings annually, and several times more for the country's most underserved and medically challenged populations. That's one of the many reasons why more than half of seniors choose Medicare Advantage today versus 30% 10 years ago and why we believe these offerings will continue to grow strongly for years to come.\n2025 is the second year of the significant 3-year phased funding reductions to Medicare Advantage introduced by CMS last year. Here, in early 2024, we're at the beginning of our thoughtful, responsible 3-year plan we developed last year to adapt to those changes. Our strategy continues to focus on providing as much -- as possible in the reduced funding environment, improving outcomes and experiences for the consumers we're privileged to serve and delivering the performance you expect from us. We believe our long-term perspective and the deliberate multiyear approach we began last year is serving us well, putting us into a position of sustainable competitive strength.\nAmong a handful of notable business developments to share, UnitedHealthcare was honored to secure major Medicaid wins in Virginia, Texas and Michigan. While we were disappointed in the outcome in Florida, we'll be seeking to better understand the process and considerations there. There is a substantial pipeline of Medicaid RFPs, and we're confident that our offerings will resonate in other states as well.\nUnitedHealthcare's commercial benefits continued their momentum for last year, growing to serve 2 million more people in the first quarter, the largest increase in years. This growth was across UHC's commercial customer segments from individuals up through the largest of employers. This is further evidence of our innovative and consumer-centric products have established a footing for sustained growth.\nWe also see continued momentum at OptumRx coming off last year's record selling season with a recent win in Hawaii and the renewal of our contract with the Department of Veteran Affairs. We're grateful for the opportunity to support them. And OptumHealth is tracking well to achieve its objective of growing to serve another 750,000 patients in value-based arrangements this year in partnership with many payers.\nBefore I turn it over to John Rex, our President and Chief Financial Officer, I want to acknowledge Dirk McMahon, recently retired after more than 20 years of service. I'd like to thank him for his leadership and partnership. Dirk has left an indelible mark on this company through the example he set and the many of our leaders he has mentored, John?\n\nJohn F. Rex\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC\n\nThank you, Andrew. This morning, I'll first provide color on some of the unique items in the quarter directly related to the Change Healthcare cyberattack, followed by care activity trends, business updates and finally, thoughts on the remainder of '24. But first, let me start at the most fundamental level. The UnitedHealth Group businesses continued to grow and performed well during the quarter, and we are encouraged by the momentum and the many opportunities to serve we're seeing across the enterprise.\nOn the Change Healthcare cyberattack. As Andrew noted, our guiding focus throughout has been to make sure patient care is delivered and care providers access to funding is secured as we work to bring back services fully. The cyber impacts in the quarter totaled about $870 million or $0.74 per share. At this distance, we estimate the full year impact will be $1.15 to $1.35 per share.\nLet me break that down into its key components. Of the $870 million, about $595 million were direct costs due to the clearinghouse platform restoration and other response efforts, including medical expenses directly relating to the temporary suspension of some care management activity. For the full year, we estimate these direct costs at $1 billion to $1.15 billion or $0.85 to $0.95 per share. It's important to note these direct costs are included in net earnings, but are excluded from adjusted earnings per share.\nThe other components affecting our results relates to the disruption of ongoing Change Healthcare business. This is driven by the loss of revenues associated with the affected services, all while incurring the support and costs to keep these capabilities fully ready to return to service. Notably, these effects are not excluded from adjusted earnings.\nIn the first quarter, this impact was about $280 million or $0.25 per share. At this distance, we currently estimate the business disruption at $350 million to $450 million or $0.30 to $0.40 per share for the year. This, of course, will depend on the ultimate timing of service and transaction volume restoration.\nThese elements are broken out for you in the supplemental tables provided with our press release this morning. Of course, we will provide regular updates on our progress and outlook throughout the course of the year.\nWhile much of Change Healthcare's functionality and services have been restored, we are working hard to restore more. And the objective we all share is for an even stronger Change Healthcare to be fully returned to expected performance levels next year. I'll come back to some of these elements in more detail in just a moment.\nTurning to underlying care patterns. The headline is that these continue within our expectations. Outpatient care activity among seniors remains consistent with the elevated levels we began seeing in the first half of '23 and for which we planned. So we continue to be comfortable with the outlook we established last June when we filed our 2024 Medicare Advantage benefit offerings.\nThe winter seasonal activity we discussed with you in January, particularly related to strong vaccine uptake, higher respiratory illness incidents and related physician office visits has subsided. Overall inpatient care activity also remains within our expectations.\nThe first quarter medical care ratio at 84.3% included roughly 40 basis points or about $340 million related to the temporary suspension of some care management activities. These have been recently reinstated. The majority of the remaining $325 million of full year medical expense impact included in our outlook will land in the second quarter. Notably, we did not reflect any favorable earnings impacting medical reserve development in the quarter.\nOut of prudence, due to the potential for the cyberattack to affect claims receipt timing, we reflected an additional $800 million of claims reserves. We'll continue with a judicious view as we progress over the next several quarters.\nTurning to the performance of our businesses. The most important takeaway is they are growing and performing at a level which allows us to maintain the adjusted earnings per share objectives we established last November, even while taking on the business disruption impacts of the Change Healthcare attack.\nAt UnitedHealthcare, revenues of $75.4 billion grew nearly $5 billion. Within our domestic commercial membership, we're off to a strong start, powered by disciplined growth, serving 2.1 million new consumers in the first quarter. We are encouraged by the momentum and positive customer response to our differentiated offerings and look forward to building further upon that momentum heading into '25.\nFor Medicare Advantage, as you would anticipate, we are deeply into our '25 planning activities. As we finalize our '25 benefit designs over the next several weeks, we will build competitive offerings that once again, appropriately reflect the funding and cost environment. We approached this last year with a deliberate 3-year plan, which continues firmly on track and positions us well going into '25.\nOur Medicaid business ended the first quarter with 7.7 million members. As Andrew noted, key wins in Texas, Virginia and Michigan demonstrate the value state customers see in our offerings. In Virginia, UHC was the highest scoring plan with particular strength in members and care, benefits and service delivery, quality and value-based payments. In Texas, UHC was awarded the maximum number of possible service areas, expanding the number of people we will have the opportunity to serve. And in Michigan, UHC achieved perfect scores in such critical consumer-centric areas as social determinants of health and health equity, further solidifying our value proposition.\nOptumHealth revenues grew by 16% to $26.7 billion as we increased the number of patients served and are on track to approach 5 million patients in value-based care by year-end. For the most complex patients that OptumHealth serves, we have engaged 75% through the first quarter this year, a significant increase in the number of patients engaged over last year. This reflects progressively earlier connectivity with patients and the ability to improve their health outcomes and experiences more rapidly.\nOptumRx revenues grew 12% to $30.8 billion, driven by new planned starts, continued expansion within existing partnerships and growth within pharmacy services.\nOptumInsight, as you know, is where the Change Healthcare business resides. In the quarter, about $500 million of the $870 million total impact is within OptumInsight. Just under half of this are direct response costs, think clearinghouse restoration activities, which we have excluded from adjusted earnings. And slightly over half are the business disruption effects, which are not excluded from adjusted earnings.\nFor many of the impacted Change Healthcare services, transaction volume drives revenues. So the effect of the attack in the period is one of keeping all the lights brightly burning at full readiness to resume services, while revenue production was essentially suspended. To be clear, the OptumInsight team did the critical and right thing, promptly shutting off services and finding any method possible to keep the care system working, including helping clients find alternative solutions.\nComing out of this incident, the team will be working tirelessly with customers to recover transaction volumes and demonstrate that Change Healthcare is ready to serve and is more valuable than ever.\nBeyond Change Healthcare, the OptumInsight revenue backlog increased to nearly $33 billion, growth of over $2 billion from a year ago driven by health system partnerships to provide business process and information technology services.\nA couple of other items of note that were affected by the cyberattack. Days claims payable in the first quarter were 47.1 compared to the 47.9 in the fourth quarter '23 and 47.8 a year ago. The accelerated payments to care providers and the Brazil sale reduced what would have been our reported measure for the quarter by about 3 days. The medical cost payable balance increased $1.6 billion from year-end '23 to $34 billion. The change reflects a $3 billion increase in the incurred, but not yet reported component or IBNR. This is the result of the prudent ongoing claims receipt assessment, offset by a $1.6 billion reduction in the fully processed claims component due to care provider payments acceleration.\nCash flows from operations in the quarter were $1.1 billion, impacted by about $3 billion due to the funding acceleration to care providers and collection extensions to affected customers and were additionally impacted by the timing of some public sector receipts.\nTo summarize, a continued focus on better serving patients and the health system underpins our mission and growth drivers, which remain strong. And as we move further into this year, the broadly strong performance across our enterprise allows us to continue to expect full year adjusted earnings per share in the range of $27.50 to $28 even as we incorporate the $0.30 to $0.40 per share of business disruption impacts.\nNow I'll turn it back to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Philip Witty\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Executive Officer-Optum, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, John. As we look out over the next several years, we, like many others, see a health care environment in need of improvements in quality, value, simplification and consumer responsiveness. While we're a comparatively small part of the $5 trillion U.S. health system, UnitedHealth Group's strategy is focused on helping to meet those very needs, and we're well positioned to do so.\nOur focus on understanding opportunities to align incentives, notably led via our value-based care offerings demonstrates what can be achieved through partnership and realignment of ways of working. Our commitment to improving all we do for consumers stimulates our drive to help bring care to patients where they need and want it at prices and with an experience worthy of the 2020s. We have a proven commitment to making available our insights and innovations widely and quickly throughout the market alongside our relentless multipayer orientation at Optum. We remain committed to partnering with others throughout health care to help make the health system more modern and responsive. Our success depends on enabling partners and customers outside our company to succeed.\nThe combination of this strategic design, strengths and behaviors underpins our high confidence in our ability to navigate the inevitable environmental change and challenge, and it reinforces our confidence in our ability to perform and grow strongly as you have come to expect from us.\nWith that, operator, we'll turn to questions.",

A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under US federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations.\nA description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.

I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThank you. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. As we conclude 2023 and embark on a new year, I'd like to express my gratitude to our more than 400,000 talented colleagues who really are UnitedHealth Group. It's directly due to their tireless efforts over the past year that we expanded our opportunities to serve more people more comprehensively.\nAs I reflect on our 2023 performance, certainly the shift in care activity among seniors was an important element for us to manage effectively, and the reduced Medicare Advantage funding outlook was a significant influence on how we prepared for 2024 and all the way through to 2026. Despite the shift in care patterns and the commensurate pressure felt during 2023, we've been able to both deliver on our growth commitments and invest and prepare for a reduced MA funding cycle over the next three years.\nEven considering these factors, 2023 marked a year of balanced, sustainable growth for UnitedHealth Group. Importantly, we also strengthened the foundations from which we will continue to grow in 2024 and beyond. To illustrate briefly, during 2023, Optum Health approached growth of 900,000 more patients under value-based care. UnitedHealthcare added over 1.7 million new consumers in its Medicare and commercial offerings. Optum Rx managed an additional 100 million prescriptions for people. Optum Financial handled more than $500 billion in consumer payer and care provider payments, and OptumInsight facilitated more than 23 billion electronic transactions.\nThe increasingly impactful ways we can engage with patients, consumers, care providers, and customers resulted in revenue growth of over $47 billion and adjusted earnings per share growth of over 13% in 2023. Looking to 2024, 2025, and beyond, we will continue to drive quality, simplicity, affordability, and accessibility to help improve healthcare system-wide.\nAnd we remain confident in and committed to our long-term 13% to 16% adjusted earnings per share growth rate. Having held our investor conference just six weeks ago, I'll take only a few minutes this morning to recap what you should expect from us this year, starting with our work in value-based care. Value-based care for us is a proven way of overcoming many of the widely recognized shortcomings of a fee-for-service-based health system, such as fragmented consumer experiences and incentives that can emphasize volume over quality.\nOur value-based offerings empower physicians to provide more connected, coordinated, and comprehensive care, align incentives among consumers, care providers, and health plans, deliver better health outcomes, and improve costs. At the end of 2023, Optum Health served more than 4 million patients in fully accountable value-based arrangements in partnership with many dozens of health plans.\nBy the end of this year, Optum Health will grow to serve at least another 750,000 patients under such arrangements, for a total of more than twice the number of people we served just two years ago. Yet, even with the strong growth and significant investments we've made, our market presence is still quite modest and the opportunity expansive. 4 million patients served, just a small fraction of the many more people whose health ultimately will benefit from these models of care.\nAnd a total Optum Health revenue base, which today represents only 2% of the $5 trillion US healthcare system spend. We have a considerable distance to go to achieve the broad, positive, system-wide impact for people's health we believe we can help drive.\nTurning to our consumer focus, we're working hard to help consumers more easily find, experience, and pay for healthcare, and that includes using their health benefits. One example of our progress can be seen in the results of UnitedHealthcare's commercial benefits business. The most recently completed selling season was among our strongest in recent years.\nThe majority of this growth will come from our relationships with large employers, among the most sophisticated buyers of health benefits. Our customers tell us we are focused on what their employees value most: lower cost, simpler experiences, and adaptable benefits that meet their unique needs and circumstances. And the consumer MPS for these new innovative products is some 20-plus points higher than traditional health plans. But we have more to do.\nOur goal is to become the trusted source for healthcare information and advice, a go-to marketplace for health services, payments, and benefits, all through a few simple taps on a consumer's phone. One of our larger consumer offerings is Medicare Advantage, which I'd like to touch on briefly. We're proud of our long-track record of growth and of delivering for the people who choose our offerings.\nDuring the recently completed annual enrollment period, we added about 100,000 more consumers, and we remain committed to our full-year goal of 450,000 to 550,000. We believe our assumptions of ongoing care activity and approach to supplemental-benefit management are entirely appropriate for the environment we are planning for and feel positive about our positioning for growth entering this three-year period.\nOne additional item as we close out the year: to achieve our enterprise-wide long-term goals, we must consistently ensure best use of our resources, both time and capital, to enable us to serve people more effectively and deliver value for our shareholders. As you likely saw, we recently agreed to the sale of our Brazil operations, where our dedicated colleagues serve people with care and compassion. We highly value the relationships we've developed over more than a decade in Brazil.\nAfter carefully evaluating our best course, we ultimately determined a sale was the right step for the people we serve and for us to best focus our energies on the many compelling growth opportunities that we consistently discuss with you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dirk McMahon, UnitedHealth Group's President and Chief Operating Officer. Dirk?\n\nDirk McMahon\n\nPresident and COO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThanks, Andrew. Our growth is rooted in innovation and our intense desire always to do better. We're investing heavily in ways to accomplish that, increasing digital engagement and using AI to be more efficient, and then measuring our performance through net promoter scores to be sure we're hitting the mark. The impact of our digital engagement efforts was evident in our one-on-one performance metrics.\nAs Andrew noted, we brought on one of our biggest cohorts of new people served via our commercial offerings, and our technology played an important role in making the process work well. Since last month, the UHC Mobile App consistently ranked number one or number two in the Apple App Store medical category and on Google Play.\nFor the first week of the year, mobile app installs were up over more than 100% year over year, and our chat volume was more than twice our historical average. At Optum Rx, digital investments enabled us to bring on a record number of new clients, who brought with them more than 3 million new consumers, onboarded with improved customer service scores, and at an overall cost 8% lower than last year. More consumers served, higher satisfaction, and lower costs.\nOur investments in AI and other advanced technology play an important role in improving customer service and productivity throughout the enterprise. For example, we are removing repetitive tasks from our workflows by using AI to help with tasks such as responses to consumer inquiries, updating provider directories, and summarizing interactions with customers and patients.\nThis frees up our service staff and clinicians to focus on solving more complicated tasks for the people we serve. Recently, we launched a new capability where we use real-time admissions and discharge data to engage high-risk MA members immediately after an emergency-department visit, connecting them to follow-up care to ensure higher-quality post-admit outcomes and avoid readmissions. This rapid response, driven by timely clinical data, has improved member engagement rates by over 300% and has an NPS of 83.\nNPS remains a vital way to measure how we're performing for our customers and consumers and how our digital initiatives and other efforts are impacting those measures and leading to improved retention. A couple of examples: through digital optimization, we're providing consumers with on-demand access to care, highly personalized benefits information, real-time support, and integrated pharmacy capabilities.\nThis is translating into significant NPS improvements in many of our businesses. And we've removed friction from the system through expanded access to 24/7 virtual visits and UnitedHealthcare's efforts to eliminate nearly 20% of prior authorizations. Throughout 2024, you should expect to see an even greater investment in our digital capabilities as we continue to identify opportunities to leverage technology to reduce administrative costs, improve productivity, and further enhance the consumer experience at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. And now, I'll turn it over to John Rex, UnitedHealth Group's Chief Financial Officer. John?\n\nJohn Rex\n\nCFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThank you, Dirk. Our colleagues' ongoing focus on further expanding and strengthening the foundations which underpin our growth pillars is paving the way for consistent growth in 2024 and beyond. Revenue in 2023 of $372 billion grew by over 14%, with double-digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Q4, adjusted earnings per share of $6.16 grew 15% and brought full-year adjusted earnings per share to $25.12, growth of 13%.\nAs Andrew noted earlier, at the end of December, we entered into an agreement to sell our Brazil operations and expect to close in the first half of this year. Upon closing, we expect to record a charge of approximately $7 billion, the majority of which is non-cash and largely due to foreign currency translation losses accumulated over several years. The impact of this one-time charge will be excluded from our 2024 adjusted earnings per share measure.\nFor your modeling purposes, the full-year 2024 outlook incorporated about $6 billion of revenue for Brazil, or about 1.5% of consolidated revenue. Before reviewing our business results, I'll offer some brief comments on care activity. Care patterns remain consistent with those we shared with you in the first half of 2023. Activity levels continue to be led by outpatient care for seniors, with orthopedic and cardiac procedure categories among the more prominent.\nAs we've noted, our benefit design approach assumed these activity levels persist throughout 2024, and the care patterns we observed exiting 2023 reconfirmed that decision. On the margin, we saw some modest late-year seasonal activity, such as strong and welcome response from seniors to schedule physician visits to receive RSV vaccinations.\nIn some cases, these were accompanied by additional necessary care being obtained, especially for people that had not seen a physician in some time, a positive outcome for people's health. In some, though, as we reflect on full-year 2023 results, overall care activity was broadly in line with the views we've shared earlier. And as we enter 2024, we're confident in the response of pricing and benefit design actions we undertook, with care patterns continuing to be supportive of our care ratio outlook of 84% ± 50 basis points.\nTurning to the performance of our businesses in 2023, Optum Health's revenues grew by 34% to over $95 billion as we increased the number of patients served under value-based care arrangements by about 900,000 to more than 4.1 million, expanded services in the home, and broadened and deepened the levels and types of care we offer.\nOptum Insight revenues grew 30% to $18.9 billion. We concluded the year with a revenue backlog of $32.1 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion over last year. This growth was driven by our diverse and expanding product portfolio, which connects many of the key stakeholders across healthcare, whether it's launching new decision support solutions for providers, claims editing software for payers, or simplifying the payment process for all.\nOur continued investments are fostering the next phase of Optum Insight growth. Optum Rx revenues grew 16% to over $116 billion, driven by the continued addition of new clients, expansion within existing relationships, and organic growth of our pharmacy services businesses. In 2023, both customer retention and new wins were among the best Optum Rx has delivered. At UnitedHealthcare, full-year revenues of over $281 billion grew nearly 13%.\nAdding to Andrew's earlier comments, within Medicare Advantage, we expect a majority of our full-year growth outlook to be realized outside the annual enrollment period, with the growth patterns consistent with those we have experienced over more recent years. Our Medicaid enrollment outlook for 2024 balances two key elements. First is that state redetermination activities will be largely completed by mid-year. Second, that growth within existing states, such as North Carolina, and other new opportunities, will partially offset these impacts.\nWithin our domestic commercial offerings, we expect to serve about 1.5 million additional people in 2024, a strong result. We are encouraged by the continued positive customer response we are experiencing as we look ahead. Our ample capital capacities continue to underpin our long-term growth objectives. Cash flow from operations in 2023 was $29 billion, or 1.3 times net income.\nWe returned nearly $15 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends and deployed over $10 billion in growth capital to build for the future. To summarize our 2023 performance and start to the new year, further solidifies and reinforces our confidence in both the 2024 and long-term growth objectives we shared with you at the end of November. Now, I'll turn it back to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThanks, John, and thank you, Dirk. Heading into 2024, I hope you all sense our confidence. We have talented people who are committed to our effort to help build a simpler, more consumer-friendly health system for the people we serve. We're well positioned to continue to deliver on the well-established commitments we've made. Operator, let's open it up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The floor is now open for questions. At this time, if you have a question or comment, please press star one on your touch-tone phone. You may remove yourself from the queue by pressing star two on your touch-tone phone. We ask you limit yourself to one question. If you ask multiple questions, we will only be answering the first question so we can respond to everyone in the queue this morning. We'll go first to Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\n\nJustin Lake\n\nHealthcare Services Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning. Wanted to touch on the cost trend commentary, specifically between the investor day and the end of the year. Looks like the MLR was a little bit higher. Can you tell us what you saw there over that last month? Maybe give us some color. John, I know you guys did a great job in the Q2 of getting ahead of cost trend and utilizing some of those facility kind of insights that you have on scheduling, etc. We're trying to figure out whether this is just seasonality or a further pickup in utilization given the Q3 to Q4 that you saw. So maybe you could tell us what you're seeing into January. Tell us where you think the Q1 comes in versus the full year. Thanks.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nHey, Justin. Thanks so much for the question. Let me just make a couple of comments, and I'm going to ask John Rex to give you a little bit more detail on the area you just talked about. So I think overall, as we look at 2023, overall, it came in very much in the sort of zone we expected, toward the top end of that zone, but very much within the zone of what we were expecting for the full year. And we signaled back in the middle of the year. And the bulk of that story is driven by the outpatient shift in behavior around seniors that we talked about back in June. You're right, though.\nPost the investor conference, what we certainly saw was an uptick in some seasonal activity, each of which individually are kind of pretty small, but added together just made a bit of a difference in that last run-out of the quarter around things like RSV vaccination, which has brought with it, dragged with it, if you will, some extra utilization of services from seniors who've come in for their vaccine. Listen, to be clear, all of that is good news for healthcare, right? So these are seniors, many of whom have not been to the office for a long time. They've come back in. They've now got vaccinated. The physicians have picked up other things while they've been there.\nSo a little bit of that going on, combined with a little bit of heightened COVID activity just as we rolled out of the year, none of which we really think is durably impacting our outlook for 2024. We feel very solid around our 2024 guidance point of 84% ± 50 basis points. Maybe I ask John just to give you a little bit more drill-down kind of insight into all of that. Go ahead, John.\n\nJohn Rex\n\nCFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah. Good morning, Justin. You're absolutely right. So the prime factor here, when we think about the full-year view and where we ended up being, what we talked about much earlier in the year in terms of the outpatient care activity among senior populations, and that continuing consistent with what we saw back much earlier in the year and very supportive of what we staked out in terms of the benefit design that we stepped into 2024 with, in particular for senior populations and our Medicare Advantage products.\nSo all those elements very much supportive of that view and the activities we undertook earlier in the year. As it relates to kind of where we landed the full year, so 10 basis points really above kind of what we indicated at the investor conference back in November of differential. And Andrew hit on those items.\nLet me just kind of take it a little bit deep here. So definitely some typical seasonality involved in there. And the incremental elements were; I'd point out a couple of items. Seniors did really respond strongly to RSV vaccinations and scheduled physician visits. Sometimes those physician visits, what we noted, were driving other care activity around that.\nSo in some cases, seniors that hadn't perhaps been to a physician in a little while, and so they visited their PCP, got an RSV vaccine. And then in the meantime, their PCPs were able to close some additional care gaps as they were there, which is a great thing because some of these seniors hadn't been in for a while. So important activity to occur there in Q4. So that was one of the elements that we saw there.\nAs it relates to kind of what we were seeing with elevated care costs for COVID, what we saw in the Q4, and particularly in December, overall, what we've been noticing is that COVID admits for inpatient stays are running a higher cost per case than we traditionally saw. That actually kind of makes some sense.\nThey're more intense cases typically that are going into inpatient stays. I will say we did notice in December that the total level of COVID admits were probably 50% to 60% above the October-November average that we had seen. So that was kind of the highest part of the year in terms of COVID inpatient admits.\nIf I take those elements and sum together, that more than accounts for the 10 basis points differential in our full-year view, Justin, as that pertains to your second question as we look out into the next year and what we see in terms of patterns. I would call it patterns commensurate kind of with what we saw this year in terms of just the movement with this kind of 84% view that we view for the full year. As I step back and reflect and just kind of thinking about broadly where the analyst consensus is, you picked particularly the Q1. It's kind of in the right it looks like an appropriate zone in terms of staked out there for what one would expect. So thank you, Justin.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah, John, thank you. Justin, thanks for the question. Appreciate that. Next question, please, Operator.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.\n\nJosh Raskin\n\nAnalyst, Nephron Research\n\nHi, thanks. Can you describe the competitive environment for Medicare Advantage? And I'm specifically thinking about how you've adjusted benefits in 2024 as part of a three-year process. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it sounds like you're trying to adjust for the majority of the risk model changes in one fell swoop. And I'm curious how you think that plays out and positions you not just for 2024, but then for 2025 and 2026 as well.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nHey, Josh, thank you so much. Before I ask Tim Noel to give you more detail on your question, I mean, listen, I think the way we've looked at the shift in the rate notice is a three-year set of adjustments. That's why we've been very thoughtful about how we've planned, not just, frankly, benefit design, but how we've continued to accelerate our management of OpEx through the organization, how we've continued to focus on eliminating unnecessary care and waste within the system through our various medical management capabilities. It's really a three-pronged set of agendas, which we're going to be focused on over the next three years.\nAnd we've been very, very thoughtful about making sure that we are setting those tables in a way which we can be sustainable on through this cycle so that we're not taking sharp left turns or right turns halfway through the period. With that kind of overall perspective, maybe ask Tim to give you a little bit more deep dive on the competitive environment and how he's very specifically planning for this.\n\nTim Noel\n\nCEO, UnitedHealthcare\n\nYeah, thanks, Josh, for the question. So yeah, I agree with Andrew's comments. And a couple of things to start with is there's been a number of changes to the Medicare Advantage and Part D programs over the last 18 months to two years that are really phasing in over multiple years. And as we plan for 2024, we once again took a very rational view to the environment and also a long-term view, with always our overarching goal being benefit stability for our members.\nAnd as we step into benefit planning in future years, we really feel like we have got a very thoughtful way to respond to all of those changes that will be encountered by the Medicare Advantage and Part D programs into 2025 and beyond.\nCertainly, as we look forward, we don't believe that we have any material pricing catch-up to do in future periods and feel like we've got a very thoughtful response to the changes that will be encountered by the program into 2025 and 2026. We think the forward view of our competitive outlook is quite solid and quite strong as we think about growth over the long-term.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThank you very much. Next question, please, Operator.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to AJ Rice with UBS.\n\nAJ Rice\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nHi, everybody. Just apologize. It's sort of granular, but we're getting asked a lot of questions about it. The two metrics, Days Claims Payable down a couple of days year to year sequentially, some from Q3. And then the prior period development being down $100 million maybe accounts for some of the variance on MLR, I'm guessing. I don't know if that's what you were guiding for when you updated, last updated your outlook, but any comment on that as well?\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nLet me ask John to address that, AJ. Thank you.\n\nJohn Rex\n\nCFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah, good morning, AJ. So first on the Days Claims Payable, so 2.8-day sequential decline, two days year-over-year. So primarily, the single largest factor would be exactly what you pointed to, the change in Prior Period Development. So that has a significant impact if you look about the year ago where we were in Prior Period Development and where we were even in the Q3. So the significant impact on that part, that'd be the main factor. In terms of other contributing factors that we saw, we did see in the Q4 some modest acceleration in provider claim submission timing.\nSo just speed up in terms of those submissions, how quickly we're receiving them from date of service in terms of receipt. We also noted that as it related to the Q4, some higher claims intensity in the first part of the quarter, particularly October.\nSo that's a factor that impacts the denominator, members per day in the days claims payable metric. That was a piece that was in that also. As it relates to the $100 million of unfavorable medical development in the quarter, I put that mostly at the items that we were talking about in my response to Justin's question. So the respiratory-related activity that we saw in there, the modestly higher cost per case for inpatient COVID admits, really kind of those were the main factors that we had in there in terms of contributing to the unfavorable development. Thank you.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nAnd, it's a good question, AJ. And as John just said, even back in the sort of second half of Q3, we've seen subsequently that this RSV pickup and this phenomenon of more services being delivered around the vaccination was already starting as we were rolling out through Q3, which is really what explains that. So in many ways, this kind of Q3 issue of negative development and then this slight pressure at the end of the year, it's kind of the same story, which is why we don't feel it has any real direct relevance in terms of thinking through 2024. Thanks for the question, though. Appreciate that. Next question, please, Operator.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Lisa Gill with JP Morgan.\n\nLisa Gill\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nThanks very much. Good morning. I want to go to Optum Health and just maybe talk about the medical cost trend there. John, just going specifically to the comments that you made, did you see something similar in Optum Health? Are we seeing anything different there? And then also, I just want to understand the claim lag there. We've heard from some others that there can be a pretty big claim lag when we think about the providers versus the payers.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nSo let me ask John to start, and then maybe ask Heather to make a couple of comments on the claim dynamic. Go ahead, John.\n\nJohn Rex\n\nCFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYes, Lisa. So definitely kind of seeing seniors obtaining RSV vaccinations and kind of some of the respiratory activity that was going on in the quarter. So some broadly similar features. For Optum Health, one of the comments that we've made throughout the year, though, also has to do with the progression here of taking on a large block of new membership. So we took on about 900,000 new members as we started the year. And one of the comments we've made throughout the year is engaging with these members.\nBecause the most important thing we need to do is have a clinical engagement with these members in terms of starting to improve their health outcomes, getting them into see physicians, having our clinicians interacting with them. And it's a comment we've made throughout the years. We've seen the Optum Health margin progression.\nSo one of the great things, we probably started the year kind of roughly at 20% engagement level with that 900,000 member block. We exit the year having engaged with about 80% of these members. Super important factor as we think about Optum Health, as we think about 2024 and that progression. And that's been a big focus of the team at Optum Health all year long of getting that engagement in so we can have impact on their health. But far and away, especially given what this population is like, they typically have complex needs. That's important.\nAnother really important market as it relates to the new membership patients that we're bringing into Optum Health for 2024, again. So I talked about that 20% engagement level we started 2023 with. For 2024, we're going to start at a 50% engagement level with that new membership. We're making advances in that. That's exactly what you should expect from the team. Their efforts have been really strong.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nGreat. Thanks, John. Maybe Heather, you could comment on Lisa's question around claims. And then I'd like to ask Amar also to follow up on your perspective on engagement and what's driving that. Please go ahead, Heather.\n\nHeather Cianfrocco\n\nPresident, Optum\n\nSure. So the only thing I would add, too, so appreciate on top of John's point. When you think about engaging the patient early, then it's really in the clinician's hands. And I think about the way we think of our clinicians is that importance to your point about visibility, then to kind of action. And the way we think about our clinicians is once we get that engagement, and as John said, early engagement is so important, then our clinicians having the tools.\nAnd I think what's really essential for us is those 130,000 clinicians having visibility early, what to do next. And the first thing is that they've got the technology, they've got solutions around them, they've got referral management practices that they can engage with high-quality specialists when they need to, for outpatient procedures.\nAnd then that they've got the supports in behavioral health and the home and community-based home and community services that we've been investing heavily in over the last year. The last thing I would point to is the contract protections that we've been focused on with our payers to be sure that the structures are in place so that our clinicians can practice in a responsible way. They've got visibility into the dynamics that are happening with the patients, and then they've got the supports in place with the payers.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nAmar?\n\nAmar Desai\n\nCEO of Optum Health, Optum\n\nYeah, thanks for that question. Look, I think I'd reiterate the point around our highest risk complex members where we're engaging at a two times higher rate than the same time last year. And within engagement and our clinical programs, I'd focus around referral management and high-value evidence-based medicine programs, including our\nOptimal Care program, where a majority of our clinicians are engaged with these evidence-based programs, are able to get patients the care that they need. And importantly, get the support with the provision of wraparound services, including specifically home-based services, so that the highest risk groups have their care connected from the primary care setting into the home. Thanks for the question.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nAmar, thanks. And John, maybe just to tie up the whole question.\n\nJohn Rex\n\nCFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah. And Lisa, tying up just on the last part of your question here regarding visibility into care activity claims like, etc., no, that's not a factor. Just given the model of Optum's business and how those groups run, frankly, it's one of the areas where we get probably early sensing mechanisms in terms of the care activity that's going on. It's one of the early sensing mechanisms from much earlier in the year when we were able to talk about what we were seeing in these senior populations and the care activity within these orthopedic and other procedures. So that's not a factor. In fact, if anything, it's probably a strength of the organization.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah. Thanks, John. And Lisa, thanks so much for the question. And we obviously just spent a couple of minutes there talking about engagement, and I hope that gave you a strong sense of some of the progress we've made over the last 12 months in this area. I would say we're night and day in a different position today than we were a year ago in terms of our ability to be engaged with these complex patients, making sure our physicians are ready to go. That's a really important aspect of what's building our confidence for 2024.\nI make no apology for just spending a couple more minutes making sure you hear some of the great work that's gone on over the last year to ensure that we've got these very high levels of engagement and real substance behind that engagement so that these patients will be supported and managed really positively going through 2024. That's what then underpins and unlocks the whole opportunity of value-based care for Optum Health. Lisa, thank you for your question, and I will move on to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.\n\nStephen Baxter\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Hi. Thank you. I was hoping you could talk a little about what you're seeing for cost performance in the group commercial or exchange or Medicaid businesses. When you step back, is this still appropriate to attribute all the pressure really you've seen in 2023 to seniors, or should we be mindful of anything else there? Thank you.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nStephen, thanks so much. Maybe ask Brian just to give you a kind of overarching summary of what UHC seen in its different books of business. Brian?\n\nBrian Thompson\n\nCEO, UnitedHealthcare\n\nYeah, appreciate that. Thanks, Stephen, for the question. I think I'll just lead with I feel really good not only about how we finished the year in UnitedHealthcare, 2023, growth at the top end of our ranges, performance, run-in positions across the board, but also as we step into the businesses for 2024. I feel very good about the key assumptions that underpin our plan and very optimistic. You mentioned a couple of areas. You're right. As we've discussed some of these elements with respect to cost trend, they are centered in our senior community. I think the message around those other businesses, nothing to see here, and really aligned with our expectations.\nSo good stability and durability in the underlying elements, both utilization and unit cost of our trend outlook, and obviously feel very confident in how we're showing up competitively when you look at our growth outlook. So very optimistic about UnitedHealthcare, durability in those other lines that you're suggesting, and a lot to look forward to here in the year.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nGreat. Thanks, Brian. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.\n\nLance Wilkes\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nGreat. Thanks. Can you talk a little bit about Optum Rx, the drivers of growth in the quarter, in particular top line? And then if you could comment a little on revenue per Rx. And do you have any programs that either in the Q4 or in 2024 that you've been rolling out that are capturing some of the increased demand on topics like GLP-1s that might be contributors to some of the strong performance? Thanks.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nHey, Lance, thanks so much for the question. Before I ask Patrick to start the response on Optum Rx, first off, I just want to note a super strong selling year for us in Optum Rx, probably our best ever, extraordinary, and across a wide range of categories, plans, public service, states, as well as obviously commercial. Really, really pleased with the differentiated product offering, really built on transparency, choice, and of course, cost. So we feel we've built a strong momentum in 2023 rolling into 2024. Patrick, you may want to go a little deeper, maybe share a little detail on Weight Engaged, specifically around the question that Lance raised around GLPs.\n\nPatrick Conway\n\nCEO, Optum\n\nYeah. Thanks, Lance, for the question. So as Andrew said, really diverse growth, both new business and high retention rates. So one of our best-selling years ever. I'd also call out the pharmacy services expansion, the organic growth there across the diverse set of pharmacy services, cost management. And then last, as you mentioned, new products and services. Just to call out one, Weight Engaged. So comprehensive management, medication, provider support, client support, lifestyle modification, digital.\nSo a comprehensive solution across Optum, not just Optum Rx, partnering with Optum Health and OptumInsight, already live with clients and robust interest in the marketplace because patients, members, and employers want comprehensive solutions that demonstrate better health outcomes at lower total cost of care.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThanks so much, Patrick. Lance, thanks for the question. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.\n\nKevin Fischbeck\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thanks. I guess I'm still just struggling with the concept of 2023 coming in worse, but this having no impact on the 2024 outlook. I mean, are you saying that the incremental pressure is really just like through RSV and therefore unlikely to replicate at these levels next year? Because the negative development speaks to costs earlier in the year also coming in worse, which implies that the core baseline is also higher.\nSo can you just help me reconcile why this isn't raising the base for next year? And I guess within that, you may feel comfortable with the guidance range for MLR, but is there a reason to be at the higher end of the range to start the year, or is the midpoint still where you're orienting? Thanks.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nSo I'll ask John to go a little deeper. Obviously, as you know, Kevin, we've set an MLR target next year, which is in fact higher than the actual closeout for this year in any case, which takes into consideration some of that kind of elevation which we've seen throughout the year. So I'm going to call it the core elevation associated with the outpatient senior behaviors that we've been talking about now for several quarters. And then as we've talked a little bit already, this end of Q4 type of small seasonality variation, we don't think is really durable or relevant to the rest of the year. But John, maybe go a little deeper on that.\n\nJohn Rex\n\nCFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nSure. Good morning, Kevin. So yes, so the elements that contributed to the unfavorable development being around respiratory activity that was going on as seniors came in to get vaccines and other care was being delivered and such, and that higher inpatient cost per case for the COVID admissions that we were seeing. So those would largely be the prime contributors of the elements that we are seeing here in terms of that unfavorable development.\nSo you're absolutely correct in your assumption. That doesn't impact our run rate assumption as we think about our outlook for 2024, which keeps us right squarely in where we thought we'd be as we were at our investor conference and taking out the 84% ± 50 basis points.\nReally, as we look across the scope of our businesses and we think reflect on how we performed in 2023, the scope of it being very much with what we saw back in mid-year of 2023. That the run-in factors are about outpatient care activity among senior populations, which we incorporate into our bid. The elements that you're appropriately referring to and forward to you, again, not factors impacting our view at all in terms of how we staked out 2024 and how we expect to perform in 2024. So really good question.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah. And I'd also just add, I mean, as you would fully expect, Kevin, we're reviewing the leading indicators of care activity, frankly, daily, weekly, monthly, and have been all year. And we've also been investing significantly in increasing numbers of early warning signals, if I can put it that way, to strengthen our radar capability to see this. And I can tell you, we're really not seeing any deviation from what we've been telling you all year in terms of the core activities across the system.\nThese seasonal bumps at the end of the year, obviously a little different, but in terms of outpatient utilizations, all of those lines of activity that we've been discussing at different times with you, the patterns there are very supportive of how we've stepped out for 2024. Thanks for the question. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Scott Fidel with Stephens.\n\nScott Fidel\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst of Healthcare Services, Stephens\n\nHi, thanks. I was hoping to just hop back over to Optum Health for a second. Just as it relates to the margin targets that you gave us at Investor Day for 7.7% to 8%, just want to see if those are still the appropriate targets for 2024. Then maybe if we could walk through the sort of pacing exercise with OH margins, given the expected step up from the exit rate in Q4, how you think about those OH margins for Q1 and then sort of pacing over the course of the year. Thanks.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nScott, thanks so much for the question. I'm going to ask Dr. Desai to make a couple of comments, and then I'm going to loop back to John just to talk through some of the phasing of the year around margin on that. But bottom line, no change in our guidance for Optum Health. We feel good about where we've staked out for Optum Health next year. A ton of work done during 2023 to strengthen the business.\nYou saw that beginning to show through as we roll through the second half. We continue to expect that to be a very strong driver of improvement as we go into 2024. A lot of that work we talked about already today around engagement is a key element of our confidence in being able to build our profile of that business. Amar, maybe you could go a little deeper, and then John can close out with discussing on the progression.\n\nAmar Desai\n\nCEO of Optum Health, Optum\n\nThanks for the question, Scott. We're confident in our 7.7% to 8% target for 2024. We've discussed engagement in detail. The second important piece is our medical management programs, which we've scaled effectively. I talked a little bit about Optimal Care and evidence-based guidelines. What I would reiterate is the work we're doing across our network with payment integrity, again, with the idea of being able to provide the right support services across our network.\nThe last piece I would also hit on is our initiatives around OpEx, which have been progressing well and are on track with different driven operating efficiencies and G&A discipline across the organization. And it really with focus on more consistency in our systems and unification of our operating platform. So we feel very good about the 7.7% to 8% as we go into 2024.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nGreat. Thanks so much, Amar. John?\n\nJohn Rex\n\nCFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah, Scott, good morning. So as Amar said, I feel very good about where we established our margin objectives for 2024. The elements super important here is, again, how these new patient cohorts progress as they come into our business and we're able to engage with them clinically, improve their health outcomes, make sure we're able to close care gaps.\nAnd the progress that Amar and teams accomplished during 2023 in terms of getting those engagement levels will assist a lot in terms of the health of the people that we're serving here, and then particularly this cohort from 2023, the 900,000 new patients that we're able to serve and how that business performs over the course of the year. So that's a big step into it. Another big step into it is this group of 750,000 new patients that came on to the business.\nThe fact that we're able to get engagement levels significantly higher than we were at last year with the new cohort will help also. So it gives us a lot of confidence in where we're stepping out in terms of serving these people throughout the course of the coming year. In terms of your comment, you'd expect typical, then seasonality factors to weigh into how the quarters perform. So, much more, think about that as seasonality factors that are probably having impact here. So typical in terms of seasonal factors that we would have experienced this year, starting with a stronger base that sets us up well to reach our targets.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nGreat. Thanks, John. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.\n\nErin Wright\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for taking my question. So a question on Optum Rx. Over the past year, there's been some evolving dynamics in news flow around the regulatory changes for PBMs, unbundling. There was some news flow there as well as pharmacy reimbursement model changes such as cost-plus type of approach. I guess how are you thinking about the potential implications of some of these dynamics, if any at all? And do these dynamics have a material impact on Optum Rx, or how are you thinking about those profit drivers remaining intact kind of going forward for the PBM? Thanks.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nErin, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Heather to give you some comments. As you know, Heather's been very, very involved with the various legislative processes, and it'd be good to get her perspective on that.\n\nHeather Cianfrocco\n\nPresident, Optum\n\nSure. Thanks. So maybe just quickly, I'll say completely respectful of the evolving dynamic and just make the headline that our business is incredibly dynamic. I'd be remiss if I don't say, again, at this juncture that we continue to engage because it's incredibly important to note that in a space where affordable drugs, affordable prescription drugs to consumers is on everybody's mind, including ours, and that's what the PBM is built to do, we are really pressing to make sure that policymakers understand that it's important to preserve choice for clients.\nIt's important to make sure that we preserve value-based structures because we know that value-based is the way to ensure that we deliver lower price, lower cost drugs, and we can't break that alignment of incentives where PBMs work with payers to reduce costs.\nIt is incredibly important that discounts remain because there's no indication that rebates drive less costs or lift prices up. The PBMs work as a counterweight against high drug costs. That being said, you've seen in our model how diverse the business is. Across Optum Rx, across the PBM, across the pharmacy services, it's a multitude of businesses. We really listen to our clients. We exist on behalf of our clients, and we compete in a highly competitive market.\nWe win because our model translates. It translates in transparency. It translates in innovation, and it translates in partnership to our clients. We'll follow the client. We'll be incredibly respectful of the legislation. But I feel really good that we act quickly. We act responsibly, and we work towards value. You see that in the results. You see that in the growth. But most importantly, you see that in the client validation of the model. So I feel good about where we're positioned. I feel good about the experience in 2023 as a guide to that, but feel really confident in the growth in 2024.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group",
    "content2": "Heather, thanks so much. Erin, thanks very much for the question. I'm sure there'll continue to be debate around this area. High drug cost, of course, is a big issue for everybody. First and foremost, we need to see less prices come down. That's the most important thing that can make a big difference here. I would say that as you look at all the different ideas which float up from time to time around reform in this area, there really isn't anything that we don't offer in some form or fashion to our clients and our customers.\nThe reality is we think that's the right position. We think we should be offering a portfolio of different tools, different product designs, which allows people to choose what's right for them because what a state wants, what a union wants, and what a corporation wants differs. It's super important that their views are taken into account here. We believe we do that well in the diversity of our product offering, and that's what's underpinning our record growth, and it underpins our confidence for 2024. Appreciate that, Erin. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.\n\nNathan Rich\n\nVP of Global Investment Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask on the Medicare AEP enrollment that you talked about, the 100,000 lives that you added. I guess, were there any differences in terms of what consumers responded to this year or differences in the retention rate relative to what you're expecting? And just can you help us think about the drivers of membership growth over the year as you needed to get to the guidance that you gave for the full year?\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah, Nathan, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Tim Noel to give you that.\n\nTim Noel\n\nCEO, UnitedHealthcare\n\nYeah, thanks for the question, Nathan. So once again, the Medicare environment, selling environment is highly competitive, and we probably saw one of the more aggressive years of pricing than we've ever seen in the 2024 session. We guided that investor conference to growth of 450,000 to 550,000 lives, which is a little bit more modest than we have grown in past years, but it's reflective of our response to the new risk model changes, what we saw in outpatient utilization patterns early in 2023, and reflecting that into 2024 pricing. And as we close out AEP, I would say that we were a little bit light against what we were thinking kind of end of November.\nMost of that actually in the group business, some of the very aggressive benefits, a little bit more switching, drove some of our term rates a bit higher in AEP than we were initially thinking. But we still feel like we're going to have a much heavier weighting of our growth outside of the annual enrollment period from February to December. And this is really just a continuation of a trend that we have seen play out over the last five years, really. And in fact, last year, we drove 430,000 lives of growth or about 60% of our total growth in the period from February to December.\nThis is a portion of the selling season that we really do well in, given our large dual footprint and also the fact that some of the selling in AEP tends to be focused on some of those headline benefits that have been really aggressively positioned. And throughout the remainder of the year, there tends to be some switching back as folks think more deeply about things like network, the fulfillment of supplemental benefits, overall service, and delivery of product. So I guess the headline is it is a very aggressive marketplace this year.\nWe feel like we're positioned really well for 2025 and 2026 in how we've priced and very pleased with what we've done so far and excited about our opportunity once again to have a really great growth and selling period from February to December of 2024.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nGreat. Tim, thanks so much. Last question, please, operator.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Gary Taylor with Cowen.\n\nGary Taylor\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Cowen\n\nHi, good morning. Most of my questions been asked. I'll throw this one at you. We've been seeing more articles about health systems dropping their MA contracts, some of those articles cite United. I know historically, most of these types of contracts, the conflicts that make the press, historically ultimately come to terms. So I'm just wondering, is this just a media thread, or do you think there's something more measurable happening here with your health system partners?\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nHey, Gary, thanks so much. Let me ask Brian to respond to that.\n\nBrian Thompson\n\nCEO, UnitedHealthcare\n\nHey, Gary, thanks for the question. I would say overall, the disruptions that we see in the market this year are, I would say, at or even lower than historical comparisons on average, leaving 2023. I will say, though, that any disruption for our consumers is too much. They come to rely on an in-network provider relationship. They have a coverage expectation from their health plan.\nSo we obviously want to avoid that type of network disruption. And we, however, do need to balance that ambition with affordability. Now, as we speak specifically to the Medicare Advantage space, we did have some deals that came down to the wire. And I do think that had some impact on AEP. And again, going to Tim's commentary around our confidence February forward, where we have those deals intact, I think you'll see that response in our growth as well. But again, on average, really not much change overall compared to historical periods on disruptions.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah, no, that's well said, Brian. And I think, obviously, Gary, what you're seeing here is we're working really hard on behalf of our clients, on behalf of patients, on behalf of government to make sure that we're getting the very best cost associated for the care delivered. And it's important that that negotiation is robust. And the good news is that the overwhelming majority get resolved.\nWe really don't like to see disruption happen. Unfortunately, occasionally it does. But rest assured, we're making good progress in this area, as Brian said. No real kind of difference in outcome to what we've seen in previous years. With all of that, let me say thank you for all of your questions. Very much appreciated.\nAs you've heard, we're confident in our mission, focused on our growth pillars, delivering innovation that matters, and disciplined in our operations and in our approach to the market. We look forward to delivering on our commitments in 2024 to our customers, patients, and shareholders. Very much appreciate your attention this morning. Thank you, and look forward to talking with you between calls. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThat will conclude today's call. We appreciate your participation."

A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under US federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the Financial and Earnings Reports section of the company's Investor Relations page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com.\nInformation presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated 13 October 2023, which may be accessed from the Investor Relations page of the company's website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. The Q3 results we reported today reflect well-balanced and durable growth supported by disciplined execution and a steadfast commitment to ensure high-quality, comprehensive care is well within reach for every person we're privileged to serve. Evolution in our marketplace, including regulatory changes, means agility and adaptability must continue to be defining characteristics of our company. The people of Optum and UnitedHealthcare continuously strive to find new ways to innovate, serve, and grow. As a direct result of their mission-driven focus, this year, we'll serve even more people more comprehensively than anticipated in the outlook we offered at the end of 2022.\nBy the close of this year, we will serve nearly 900,000 additional patients under value-based care arrangements at Optum Health, almost 1 million new consumers across UnitedHealthcare's Medicare Advantage offerings, and a total of more than 1.5 billion scripts to the people who rely on Optum Rx. Based on this performance, we're strengthening our 2023 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $24.85 to 25 per share. The confidence we have in our sustained long-term growth outlook is exemplified by the 14% Q3 revenue increase we reported this morning, more than $11 billion above last year. The sources of this growth will drive many more years of strong performance. Value-based care is the centerpiece of our long-term strategy, precisely because it delivers on the promise of high-quality clinical outcomes and experiences at lower cost than traditional models.\nThis year, we expect Optum Health will serve more than 4 million people in fully accountable relationships, almost twice as many people as we served just two years ago. Many of these patients have serious health challenges, few economic resources, and until now, often had limited access to care or the type of care they truly need. Ramping up to engage these patients requires significant upfront investment and high-touch reach. These early efforts ensure we can address patients' unique needs and design personalized care plans that drive better health outcomes, increase quality of life, and deliver cost savings throughout the health system. Making the investments to serve people who have endured far too many barriers to care is an easy choice for us all.\nIn 2023, you have seen both our commitment and financial capacity to invest to further enable our ability to serve and to grow far into the future. In recent years, we've invested significant resources in building our capabilities to care for people most effectively for the life or health stage they find themselves in, whether they need preventative or palliative care, or are best served in a clinic, at home, or virtually. In particular, we're advancing our ability to care for people in their homes and integrating that physical care with our pharmacy and behavioral offerings. This work means developing an even more versatile clinical workforce to serve consumers in more ways through clinic-based Optum care delivery capabilities and extending our reach to consumers who may not have ready access to physical clinics.\nMedicare Advantage continues to be a powerful force in driving superior health outcomes for consumers and in helping to lower costs at the system level. Today, about half of all seniors in the US have chosen Medicare Advantage over traditional Medicare, and that number will continue to expand for very good reasons. The results are well documented. Medicare Advantage outperforms traditional fee-for-service for seniors on many measures, including lower rates of hospitalization, and they spend up to 45% less out of pocket, compared to those in Medicare fee-for-service. Importantly, this high value for consumers is delivered at a lower cost to the health system. UnitedHealthcare serves more people in high-quality four-star and higher Medicare Advantage plans than any other organization. Looking to the 2024 enrollment period, which begins Sunday, we're confident our offerings will again resonate with consumers as they prioritize high-quality care and stable benefits.\nIn the reduced funding environment health plans face, I credit our teams for investing in the areas consumers value most, including zero-dollar premium plans, no copays for primary, virtual, and preventative care, and no copays for hundreds of the most commonly prescribed drugs. I want to highlight one more aspect of our growth story: the consistently strong performance of our pharmacy businesses. Pharmacy, as you know, is the most common consumer touchpoint in healthcare. What consumers and employers want more than anything is access to the most effective treatments in the moment they need them for the lowest possible cost. Optum Rx is delivering on those expectations. This most recent selling season is on track to be among our strongest, reflecting a combination of new clients and retention rates in the very high 90s. As the coming season for 2025 develops, we're expecting another year of robust growth.\nOur clients tell us they value the enhancements we are making to our pharmacy offerings, providing them transparency and choice while also integrating new tools and capabilities. Notably, our pharmacy service offerings go far beyond the foundational benefit management capabilities and now account for about half of all Optum Rx revenues. We continue to expand the reach of our community pharmacies, and our diverse specialty and infusion offerings are growing double digits. Driving this expanding market demand is the enormous pressure facing employers, health plans, governments, and others to manage and respond to manufacturer list pricing. The services offered by Optum Rx and others are the only counterbalance to drug company pricing. The foundational business objectives for PBMs are to lower costs and make medicines more affordable and accessible for individuals and families.\nPBMs are the only entities in the drug supply chain with that exclusive focus and incentive, and we're honored to play this critical role. These pillars of our growth, value-based care, pharmacy, and our innovative benefits businesses, alongside our health technology and financial service capabilities, underpin our ability to develop ever-stronger value propositions for the people who receive and those who pay for care and support our confidence in a future of growth. With that, I'll pass it to Dirk McMahon, our President and COO.\n\nDirk McMahon\n\nPresident and COO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThanks, Andrew. I recently hosted UnitedHealthcare's National Accounts Forum, where we bring together client leaders twice a year to share ideas and gather feedback. These are some of the biggest and most sophisticated companies in America that collectively employ and sponsor coverage for millions of people. To no surprise, healthcare costs top their list of concerns, especially the rising cost of drugs. In addition, they want innovation, new tools to help their employees take full advantage of their benefits, achieve better health outcomes, and save money. Of course, it has to be digital. Let me offer a few examples of innovation that have fueled our growth outlook, starting with our mobile platform, the primary access point for millions of UHC members.\nEach year, we add new capabilities to provide consumers with increased on-demand care access, highly personalized information about their benefits, real-time support, cost estimation tools, integrated pharmacy capabilities, and enhanced rewards. Another example: our newest and fastest-growing commercial offerings, which feature no annual deductibles and incentivize people to make good healthcare choices by offering an unprecedented view into quality and cost.\nWhen seeking care options, consumers see potential care providers' latest reviews and quality designations, and they see what they will actually pay for their care, which will help them make the most informed decisions. UnitedHealthcare members in these offerings are receiving more preventative care while paying about 50% less out of pocket compared to people enrolled in traditional offerings, and their employers can reduce the total cost of care with an average savings of 11%. These results are why such new offerings are among our fastest-growing.\nBeyond these consumer-facing innovations, we're leveraging the latest technologies to create greater operational capacity and productivity so we can better serve consumers and focus on the highest-value work. Our teams are significantly improving how quickly we respond to the millions of benefit questions we receive each year. We are using AI and natural language processing to expedite call documentation to rapidly generate accurate summaries of consumer interactions with our contact centers, saving millions of dollars in administrative work and freeing up capacity for our people to prioritize engagement. We're also utilizing these technologies to translate and interpret unstructured data such as physician notes, which will help, for example, provide deeper insights for life sciences customers so they can better assess the efficacy of their treatments.\nOf course, these are just a few of the hundreds of AI applications powered by Optum Insight we are actively developing, testing, and deploying today to further elevate the consumer and care provider experience while driving increased quality and lower costs. With that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, John Rex.\n\nJohn Rex\n\nCFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThank you, Dirk. The growth we reported today is a direct result of investments made over many years to develop and connect the diverse health capabilities needed to serve the people who rely on us each day while also creating the foundational capacity to serve millions more in the years ahead. This capability development has long been in the making and is still very much underway as the opportunities to serve more people more deeply continue to expand. Before reviewing our business results, I'll offer a few brief comments on care activity.\nCare patterns remain consistent with the view we shared during Q2, with activity levels still led by outpatient care for seniors and still most notably in the orthopedic and cardiac procedure categories. These trends remain stable at the levels we previously described. As we've noted, our outlook assumes these activity levels persist throughout next year.\nWe continuously monitor a broad spectrum of patient acuity levels and have yet to see any other notable changes. For example, within oncology, the average stage at which we are first seeing cancer diagnoses remains consistent with historical patterns. As always, we remain diligent in looking for changes to the underlying health of patients. With that, let's turn to our third-quarter results. Revenues of $92.4 billion grew by 14% over the prior year, with double-digit growth again at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare.\nOptum Health revenues grew by 29%, approaching $24 billion, driven by an increase in the number of care services we offer and patients we serve, especially for those with complex care needs. Operating margins continue to reflect the initial clinical engagement activities that support the strong growth in patients we have realized this year, as well as the higher care activity patterns we have discussed.\nOptum Rx revenues grew by 14%, approaching $29 billion, driven by the strength in our pharmacy care services offerings as well as new customer wins. Script growth of nearly 7% reflects customer response to our innovative solutions, which focus on choice and lowest net cost. Optum Insight revenues grew by 35% to $5 billion. Revenue backlog of over $31 billion increased by more than $7 billion, in part due to the Change Healthcare combination.\nIn addition, we recently announced a partnership to provide revenue cycle analytics and information technology services to a health system serving more than 400,000 people in the Midwest. Turning to UnitedHealthcare, our commercial business added nearly 700,000 people through the Q3. Further, selling season indications are tracking favorably, particularly in national accounts. So as 2024 begins, we expect to grow to serve an additional 1 million people with commercial benefits.\nWithin our public sector programs, we expect growth of nearly one million Medicare Advantage members this year. Looking to the year ahead, we're encouraged by the consumer value, stability, and breadth of our offerings. As always, we start with an expectation that we will outpace overall market growth. Our Medicaid performance remains strong as we support people and families through the redeterminations process. Our teams are really leaning in, speaking with thousands of consumers each day.\nThrough a comprehensive outreach program, we are helping people navigate the process and connecting them with the resources they need to retain or reinstate their health benefits or to help them find other affordable coverages. A significant majority of the people we engage with are able to retain or reinstate their coverage. Our capital capacities remain strong.\nFor the first nine months of the year, adjusted cash flows from operations were at $22.4 billion, or 1.3x net income. In that same timeframe, we returned over $11.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As noted, given the strength of our business performance, this morning we have updated our 2023 outlook for adjusted earnings to $24.85 to 25 per share. As we finish strongly in 2023 and look forward to 2024, we're intensely focused on execution while further expanding our capacity to serve more people more deeply and building the foundations to support our growth objectives for years to come. Now I'll turn it back to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThanks, John. Before opening up for questions, I'll offer some preliminary observations about next year, while reserving most of this conversation for our investor conference on 29 November. Our businesses continue to build momentum while maintaining flexibility and adaptability for an ever-changing landscape, even as we invest for the future. We're focused on our strategic growth pillars and driving efficiencies throughout the enterprise at an accelerated pace. At this distance, analyst earnings estimates for 2024 reasonably reflect the performance view we expect to offer in November, with consensus near the upper end of our likely initial outlook range. Importantly, the growth we're realizing today and our expanding capacity serve to further reinforce the confidence we have in our long-term 13% to 16% growth objective. With that, I'll now ask the operator to open up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThe floor is now open for questions. At this time, if you have a question or a comment, please press star one on your touch-tone phone. You may remove yourself from the queue by pressing star two on your touch-tone phone. We ask you to limit yourself to one question. If you ask multiple questions, we will only be answering the first question so we can respond to everyone in the queue this morning. We'll go first to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.\n\nLisa Gill\n\nManaging Direcrtor, JPMorgan\n\nGood morning, and thanks for the comments. I wanted to start with GLP-1s and really understand from two sides. One, when we think about rates for 2024, can you talk about what you've incorporated in rates around GLP-1s, especially around weight loss as we have new products coming to the market? And how do I think about that from the PBM side when we think about the services that you can wrap around that and sell from a PBM perspective?\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nLisa, thanks so much for the question. In a second, I'll ask Brian Thompson from UHC and Dr. Patrick Conway to respond to your comments in a little more detail. But let me just preface all of that. The thing we're most overall focused on in GLP-1 space is, honestly, the pricing. We're very positive about the potential for another tool in the toolbox to help folks manage their weight. We recognize that has potential benefits, but we're struggling, and frankly, our clients are struggling with the list prices which have been demanded of these products in the US, which are running at about 10 times the level of price which have been paid in Western Europe. So overall, I'd say that is our focus, is to try and find a way to make this a sustainable and affordable space for our clients to support.\nWith that said, let me ask Brian to give you a perspective from UHC and how they've incorporated this in their forward view.\n\nBrian Thompson\n\nCEO, UHC\n\nSure. Thanks for the question there, Lisa. But first, to put in context, GLP-1s, over 80% on the diabetic side. So as we think about weight loss, up to maybe 20% of our total spend, and it's largely performing in line with what we had planned as we went into 2023, and we feel very confident and comfortable about how we're looking at that going forward into 2024. As you think about it, keep in mind the vast majority of the coverage here is in our fee-based business. That's our self-employed customers, and that's still at less than 1/3, around 30% of our book. As we look forward, are our customers considering to cover more or less? I would say it's a mixed bag. Some are seeking coverage, albeit dissatisfied with the price points.\nSome are backing off given the cost, but I wouldn't really be directional one way or the other on whether or not we're seeing more or less coverage on the weight loss side as we look forward. But again, to Andrew's point, beyond just getting to the obvious lower price points, we're really trying to work with manufacturers to get to some aligned value-based constructs, getting pricing to a point where it's based on outcomes and adherence levels all the way to outright risk on utilization levels, and pairing those with therapies and programs that can put less reliance on lifelong adherence requirements like these drugs currently have. We're not there yet. We're optimistic that we can get there, but clearly, price point is a key barrier.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nBrian, thanks so much. And Patrick, maybe from the Optum Rx perspective, you could talk a little bit about the broader approaches we take.\n\nPatrick Conway\n\nCEO, Optum Rx\n\nThank you. As Andrew said, our customers, payers, employers, and people we serve are concerned about the prices of GLP-1s as set by manufacturers. Optum Rx will continue to negotiate lower prices through discounts over time, be transparent with our customers, and implement clinical evidence-based guidelines so the right people get appropriate medicines. As you alluded to, Lisa, obesity and cardiometabolic disease is a major public issue, health issue in the US. Across all of Optum, we are developing and implementing comprehensive solutions of which medicines are only a part of on behalf of our clients and people we serve to drive better health outcomes for all and value to the health system.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThanks, Patrick. Lisa, thanks so much for the question. Next question, please, Jennifer.\n\nOperator\n\nYes. We'll go next to AJ Rice with UBS.\n\nAJ Rice\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nHi, everybody. Thanks for the question. It's similar to last quarter. The trend in margin in Optum Health and Optum Insight has been down year to year. I know you've called out Change, particularly with Optum Insight, but I wondered if there's any ability to discuss unusual items, non-recurring items. I know you said you had some cost reduction programs you were implementing this quarter in Optum Health. Did those impact the results? And is there any change as you look ahead to 2024 in your margin expectations or targets for those two businesses?\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nAJ, thanks so much for the question. Appreciate it. So let me just make a few comments, particularly as it speaks to the Optum Health part of the question that you raised. So as you look at 2023, essentially what we've seen, and we refer to this in Q2, greater growth in the number of people, patients that we've been privileged to serve this year, particularly the more complex patients. So very strong, and you heard in our opening commentary, very strong growth in the number of fully accountable lives, running at about 900,000, substantial fraction of that coming in the more complex cases. As I said back in the last call, we're very, very pleased to have that growth. We believe that is really foundational or key foundation for future long-term growth of the business.\nHowever, within that, the mix of that population, a little different to what we expected. That takes time to then build the engagement capabilities that we need to be able to work with those people and their care providers to ensure the very best care is delivered at the most efficient and effective way. And that's really the bulk of the investment that we're talking about. It's really taking the time, looking after those folks in the way they need to be looked after right now in advance of us being able to engage with them fully and deliver then the various interventions and advices that we can provide that we're really building throughout Optum to ensure that not just in one year, but over multiple years, those folks get increasingly better care delivery and better outcomes.\nRecall that these patients, in many cases, have really been somewhat not necessarily looked after as well as they could have been by the system because of their very complexity. In some cases, they're not able to get to clinics, which is why we've been building up our home care capabilities and other wraparound services to the classic clinic approach. That's really the driving force. Now, as that speaks to the future, two things really, AJ. One is we're super confident around our ability to continue to grow the number of patients who we're able to look after. Number two, as those capabilities that have been accelerated during this year begin to affect both the quality positively and the cost of how these patients' care is delivered, you're going to see that shine through in improved economic performance of Optum Health.\nAnd as we look forward, we're very confident about continued strengthening of that business. Make no mistake, Optum Health is having a very strong growth year, and we're taking the opportunity this year to really ready ourselves and build strength for the next many years of that business. AJ, thanks so much for the question. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nYes. We'll go next to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.\n\nJosh Raskin\n\nAnalyst, Nephron Research\n\nHi. Thanks. Good morning. Understanding that you expect Medicare Advantage to grow at a healthy pace, I think you said above market again in 2024, could you speak to that progress expected at Optum Health? I know we'll get details at the investor day, but how are you thinking about the transition of patients from sort of fee-for-service to these fully risk engagements and then maybe general levels of investment for growth in light of the risk model and reimbursement model changes?\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nSo, Josh, thanks so much for the question. I mean, obviously, we'll leave very much the detail of the elements of the growth model for when we meet with you all in November. I mean, having said that, we would have no reason not to expect a continued healthy momentum in our move toward value-based care next year with continued high expectations for our ability to deliver that. To your broader question, maybe just reflect a little bit again on 2023. So this has been a year which essentially has been obviously very heavily influenced by the change in the funding environment that was announced earlier in the year for Medicare Advantage. And we're very appreciative of the three-year phasing of the changes which CMS ultimately decided to make.\nObviously, those changes are essentially the equivalent to a price cut phased in over three years for the Medicare Advantage program. We're appreciative of the fact that we've had essentially seven, eight, nine months' warning of that in terms of when that was announced before we go into the 2024 year. That's allowed us, and we've taken full advantage of it, to really focus on how we ready ourselves, not just for 2024, but for the next 36 months.\n2023 has all, for us, been about ensuring that we re-engineer our cost base, that we refocus our benefit strategies to those things that matter most to patients, that we strengthen and invest in our abilities to manage affordability of care going forward into the system, and that we're taking full advantage of building the capabilities we have already begun to construct around our consumer engagement, our technology, digital-first capabilities, and ultimately doubling down on our commitment to value-based care.\nThat has really been the story behind the investments of 2023 in response to the changes that have been signaled by CMS so that we go into 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027 feeling strong, feeling that we've taken advantage of these last several months to ensure that we've adjusted and adapted our strategy and business in readiness for the change in the funding environment, which gives us strong confidence for next year and underpins our commitment to the signal I just gave you in terms of our potential for 2024. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\n\nJustin Lake\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning. Wanted to ask about UHC performance. First, your MLR was better than our expectations, but curious how it compared to your internal estimates. Maybe you could share how that might have come across in the three main business segments. Then, quickly, on the Q3 UHC margins, I found it interesting that while the MLR deteriorated by 50 basis points year over year in the quarter, overall UHC margins actually improved by 50 basis points. Curious what might have drove that. Thanks.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nJustin, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask John Rex to respond to the first part and then Brian Thompson the second.\n\nJohn Rex\n\nCFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nGood morning, Justin. So overall, I'd call it broadly consistent with our expectations in terms of Q3. So a few things I'd like to highlight, though. So care patterns were, as we discussed, focused again on outpatients, outpatient activity with seniors. Those continue at the levels we described during Q2. And that's what really drove a lot of kind of the activity throughout the quarter. It's still in those categories that we have been focused on. The sequential move that you see from Q2 to Q3 is largely a seasonal factor. As you know well, there's always less care activity in a Q3.\nThat has to do just with vacations, a lot of the elements that go in there in terms of certain types of discretionary care, seasonal illnesses, so typical patterns, and also Part D patterns that you see on a regular basis. In fact, if you go back to the years prior to 2020, Q3 would typically be the lowest care ratio quarter. So I'd say it's probably more typical than not, just getting back to periods that were more normalized in terms of the activities that we saw going on there. We continue to expect our full-year medical care ratio to be toward the upper end of our initial 82.6 ± 50 basis points range. So very consistent with the level that we set out there back again in the two quarters that would be toward the upper end of that outlook.\nAnd then the seasonal factors in Q3, some of those things influencing where you'd expect to be in a Q4, the final quarter of the calendar year, certainly utilization, Part D impacts, they move the other direction in a Q4. And so typical in that. That's amplified, of course, very much by the deductible wear-off features that you see in a Q4, influenza, RSV, all those patterns that come in. So we'd expect that to move the other direction here as we go into Q4.\n\nDavid Windley\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Thanks, John. And Brian?\n\nBrian Thompson\n\nCEO, UHC\n\nYeah. John, I think you did a good job of explaining sort of the sequencing of the medical care ratio. What I don't want to lose sight of is I think the key point is all of our businesses in UnitedHealthcare right now are really demonstrating innovation and market success at the same time. And you're seeing that come through in these margins, whether that's our complex care and health equity strategy in Medicaid, how we're showing up with broader service offerings and conveniences like UCard and URide in MA to complement strong, stable core benefits, or some of the innovations you heard around our commercial benefits in Dirk's opening remarks. This is really translating the type of growth and performance that I think you've come to expect from UnitedHealthcare.\nI think it sets up a really nice baseline that I remain optimistic about as we look forward to 2024.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThanks so much, Brian, John. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.\n\nStephen Baxter\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask about the PBM business. Obviously, interest in alternative or maybe even experimental models has been a big area of debate the past quarter or so. I guess, what are you hearing from your health plan and employer clients on their degree of interest in doing something totally transformational in terms of how they manage those benefits? Thanks.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nStephen, thanks so much. Let me ask Patrick Conway to respond to that.\n\nPatrick Conway\n\nCEO, Optum Rx\n\nYeah. So as we interact with our clients, employers, payers, and others on this, first, I'll note a recent survey came out. Approximately 90% of those clients are satisfied with their PBM. They're also satisfied with the level of transparency. Specifically for Optum Rx, we will continue to innovate and provide additional solutions to our clients that are comprehensive, integrated, and transparent. I'll call out one other area: transparency to the consumer. This has been a journey for us that we continue to drive transparency to the consumer.\nTo call out one example with PriceEdge, a product recently launched that's providing consumers the most affordable medicine at the point of care. We are seeing millions of consumers access, use this tool as we provide it to them. And so you'll continue to see us to drive consumer transparency and innovative solutions to our clients.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nGreat. Patrick, thanks so much. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.\n\nNathan Rich\n\nVP in Global Investment Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to go back to the GLP-1 class. And I guess, as we're starting to see more outcomes data for these drugs, do you see that changing employers' willingness to cover this class given the potential long-term benefits? And how are you helping them think about potential ways to design the benefit to be able to manage that cost, which you guys talked about earlier being so much in focus for employers?\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah. Nathan, thanks so much for the question. I mean, there's an old adage which I quite like in this context, which is that innovation that is not affordable is not innovative. That's really the key to all of this. Though I have no argument, I don't think anybody at UnitedHealth Group has any argument with the prospects and possibility for the future of this drug class. We recognize the need, and nothing would make us happier, honestly, to be able to lean forward and see more and more folks take advantage of these sorts of opportunities. But ultimately, it has to be affordable. What we're hearing from our clients is they are really struggling to see how they embark on that journey of what they regard as a kind of open-ended financial risk.\nNow, that's exactly why Brian earlier made the comments he did about we're trying to put forward to various manufacturers a variety of different options, but we need the manufacturers to move. It's as simple as that. We remain extremely open-minded to any model that works. We're working with our clients to ensure that they understand the various options. But they are giving us very, very clear signals. They need our help to make this a more affordable proposition for their employees and their members. We'll continue to lean into that. Thanks for the question, Nathan. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Scott Fidel with Stephens.\n\nScott Fidel\n\nManaging Director, Stephens\n\nHi, thanks. Good morning. Curious if you can give us your updated thoughts from this vantage point, what you're thinking about the trajectory of just overall wage inflation in healthcare and how you're sort of planning for that. We have been seeing sort of moderation from the COVID peaks, but there certainly seems to be some pro-inflationary risks out there when thinking about some of the federal policy proposals, state proposals, and then obviously some of these union actions too. So just curious on how you're thinking about wage inflation in healthcare moving forward and risks to that inflecting back upwards. Thanks.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah. Absolutely. Thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Dirk to give you a few comments on that.\n\nDirk McMahon\n\nPresident and COO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah. Well, to start, what I would say is as we go out and we negotiate with various health systems for prices as we move forward, one of the key things involved in those discussions is what wage inflation is and how it's impacting their costs. As we sit here today, it's lucky that we sort of have three-year contracts, so it's muted a little bit. But what I would also say is we see a little bit of upward pressure on unit costs related to wages. But as I sit here today, it's not something that we haven't planned for and priced about. As I think about our own business, we haven't had trouble recruiting people such as nurses, clinicians. Actually, people really want to work for us.\nFrom a capacity perspective, one of the things, as we've talked about our growth so far, we have to make sure we have the appropriate labor capacity to manage all the risk that we take. And as a consequence, we do spend a lot of time looking at the market. And as I said, people want to come to work for us. They like the mission. They like the ability to transform healthcare. And we're pretty pleased with our ability to hire and manage our operations going forward.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThanks, Dirk. Thank you very much for the question. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Kevin Fishbeck with Bank of America.\n\nKevin Fischbeck\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thanks. Wanted to ask about Optum Health. I understand the commentary about membership coming in better, which creates a margin drag, but it feels like a couple hundred thousand people, maybe low to mid-single digit more membership than you expected, causing margins to drop from 8% to 7% or 12%, essentially. Seems like a pretty big delta. So I assume there's other things going on in there beyond just digesting new membership growth.\nIf not, then I guess we would know what the margin is on those new members. But is there anything else you would spike out there? And how do we think about building back from where we are today to that 8% to 10% margin target? Is it simply about getting today's membership to target margins, or is there a cost side? It seems like you're adjusting the labor force to some degree. Is there an MLR side? Is there a rate side? Any other color to kind of help us give visibility into the eight to 10 over time? Thanks.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nKevin, thanks so much for the question. So listen, by far and away, the most important phenomena here are the things we've talked about to you already. So just to reiterate a little bit of what we said to you back in Q2. So we've seen, obviously, the elevation in MLR, which has stabilized, hasn't really come down, isn't accelerating up, but definitely is a phenomenon year over year, number one. Number two, increased behavioral care costs. Remember that within Optum Health, our behavioral businesses, that's where our behavioral business sits. And that has also seen significant increase year over year.\nWe're very positive about that because it's a signal that people are engaging in seeking help for their behavioral conditions. And we know that that intertwines very importantly with their ongoing medical costs. But nonetheless, it's an element of elevation.\nThen, as you rightly reiterate, a piece of it is the growth in our value-based lives and the mix of those lives. By mix, that means complexity mix as well as geographic mix. It takes, as I said already today, a little bit of time to build up the capabilities to allow us to engage properly with those folks at the level we want to. We have not held back on doing that, Kevin. That's really the bulk of the investment during this cycle where we've really lent into building those capabilities in readiness for the next, we hope, many years of serving these individuals higher and higher capability. Of course, I made a comment earlier about re-engineering our cost base.\nOf course, there are changes going on in our cost base across the whole organization, including Optum Health, in response to the changing pricing signals from CMS. But I would put those very much kind of secondary to the core elements I've just described. We're in a position, obviously, where we know exactly what these populations are that we're now looking after. That's been very much the basis of our forward views in terms of how we're starting to lay out for 2024, 2025, 2026. And we feel very confident about our ability not only to grow as an organization, but to continue to strengthen margins back into the zone that you've historically been used to. Thanks so much, Kevin, for that. And next question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald.\n\nSarah James\n\nManaging Director, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nThank you. I wanted to circle back to your comments on the strength in commercial growth in national accounts for next year. Can you give us a little bit of color on the pricing environment, given all the comments you've made on the moving pieces and cost trends, and then help us put into context that and the broader economy with how your clients are thinking about product selection, either in breadth or the type of products that they're purchasing from you in 2024?\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nSarah, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Dan Kueter, who looks after our commercial insurance business, to answer that.\n\nDan Kueter\n\nCEO of Commercial Business, UnitedHealthcare\n\nYeah. Thanks, Andrew. Hi, Sarah. Thanks for the question. The growth that John mentioned in his comments is settled business in our national accounts fee-based segment. So we're very happy with how that's completed. We're pricing and negotiating our fully insured business for January right now, and we're comfortable with how that's materializing as well. Employers continue to focus on both affordability and innovation, and our innovative products continue to resonate significantly in the market, as Dirk highlighted in his comments. Thanks, Sarah.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThanks so much, Dan. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to David Windley with Jefferies.\n\nDavid Windley\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to pivot to Optum Insight. You had commented in previous calls about a fairly heavy level of spending to integrate Change and invest in that platform. I wondered if you could update us on any ongoing spend in that regard, what we should expect in terms of implementation on ProHealth Care, and kind of trajectory of margin in Optum Insight. Thank you.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nDavid, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Roger Connor, who's our new CEO of Optum Insight, to respond. Roger.\n\nRoger Connor\n\nCEO, Optum Insight\n\nThank you. And David, thank you for the question. First of all, just to say I'm delighted to be taking over the leadership of Insight. This is a pretty unique and special business. And getting to know the people, the products, and the offerings, I think we're going to make a real difference to healthcare. So excited about that future. Just specifically, David, on your question, the Change integration has gone really well, to be honest. You'll see in the Q3 margin that we had the tail end of some of that spend to integrate, but the Q3 margin is in line with our expectations. I think it is worth understanding the longer-term outlook for Optum Insight margin. We still believe that's in the region of 18% to 22%. That's really driven by the mix of the businesses. As you know, we're a business that has software.\nWe have services. So there are different margins in there. But when you take what we've created with Change and you look at the overall portfolio that we have, we have this incredible portfolio that is addressing everything from clinical decision support. We've got products for admin efficiency. We've got other products for payment optimization. You add that growth engine, plus our innovation, plus that margin profile, we're very confident about the future performance of Insight.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThat's great. I wonder whether Dan Schumacher, who's been very heavily involved in our various health systems partnerships, might just want to reflect a little bit on the question, obviously, was around ProHealth. But rather than talking specifically, maybe just share a few thoughts about the overall evolution of those health system profiles and how they play out over the first couple of years.\n\nDan Schumacher\n\nChief Strategy and Growth Officer, UnitedHealth Group\n\nSure. Thanks, Andrew. David, appreciate the question. Certainly, our health system partnerships, you mentioned one that we've announced recently. It's a growing portfolio for us. Obviously, at the health system level, there's a lot of pressures. We've talked in earlier questions about wage inflation and so forth. We have a unique opportunity to really be able to address some of those near-term challenges while at the same time provide some capacity for future evolution of the system as they think about more digital capacities, greater outpatient catchment, and further engagement.\nSo those are some of the things that we can help unlock for them and their migration to value-based care. So we're encouraged by the portfolio. It continues to grow. Actually, from the initial scope, nine out of 10 have expanded from their initial scope. So continuing to grow. We're in the early days, and we see a lot of opportunity ahead of us.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nDan, appreciate it. Thanks so much for the question. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities.\n\nAnn Hynes\n\nSenior Healthcare Services Equity Analyst and Managing Director, Mizuho Securities\n\nHi, good morning. I would like to ask the GLP question more on the medical side. It sounds like right now, price appears to be the greatest barrier for widespread adoption, assuming the outcome data continues to be positive. If pricing gets to a point that you view and your clients view as affordable, what do you think would be the long-term impact on care on the medical side? Are you seeing any near-term effects right now on MLR, I should say, an MLR benefit? And do you think it would be reasonable to assume overall MLRs should decline with greater adoption of these drugs? And maybe what categories of health spend do you think or do you view would be the biggest opportunity going forward? Thanks.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThanks so much for the question. I mean, I think, honestly, it's just way too early for us to be able to see anything like that, just in terms of, obviously, the weight loss indications are only just really coming into play. We haven't really been able to see, I'd say, anything from that perspective yet. And as I said earlier, the real focus for us right now is to try and figure out a way in which we can get to a position where the affordability of this class puts it in a zone where the people who need it can get it and can afford it. Nothing more to say on that, honestly. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to John Ransom with Raymond James.\n\nJohn Ransom\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nHey, good morning. On your fully accountable lives, what's the expectation where you'll end up in a year with a number of Medicare fully accountable lives? And just looking at the eliminations, is it fair to assume that a lot of those fully accountable lives are coming out of the UHC book? Thanks.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nSo thanks very much for the question. I'll ask Dr. Amar Desai, who leads our Optum Health organization, just to comment a little bit on the kind of shape of the folks we look after there and the degree to which they come from both UHC and, obviously, many of our external partners. Amar.\n\nAmar Desai\n\nCEO, Optum Health\n\nJohn, thanks very much for the question. We've had great growth in fully accountable membership, as we mentioned earlier, adding over 900,000 patients for the year. That growth is diverse across a number of payers. We have over 100 payer partners spanning both national and regional payers. And as we think about that growth, of course, UnitedHealthcare is a core partner to us, but we continue to have the strength of our medical groups and physician networks being incredibly attractive to other payers regionally and nationally to be able to grow in their own value-based arrangements to drive outcomes and total cost of care. So we look forward to continued growth in a broad-based, diverse way. Thank you very much.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nAmar, thank you. Thank you for the question. Jennifer, would you say the last question now, please?\n\nOperator\n\nOkay. We'll go last to Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.\n\nLance Wilkes\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. On Medicaid and Medicaid redetermination, could you comment a little bit on the margin and implications of the members that are getting redetermined off? Are you seeing a lot of double coverage or zero MCR on that? And then just in general, are disenrollment trends kind of consistent with your expectations? And do you see where those members are going to as far as individual, employer, or uninsured? Thanks.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nHey, Lance, thanks so much for the question. I'm going to ask Tim Spilker, who leads our community and state business, to respond to that, Tim.\n\nTim Spilker\n\nCEO of Community and State, UnitedHealthcare",
    "content2": "Yeah. Thank you, Lance, for the question. Maybe I'll start with just the enrollment trends because I think that really informs a whole number of factors. So first off, what we're seeing, I think, consistent with what states have reported, is significant disenrollment for procedural reasons. And what's more, a lot of variability, frankly, across states in terms of the pacing and re-enrollment, and even states now that are suspending terminations or re-enrolling members based on guidance.\nSo those stops and starts certainly have an impact on our membership as well as membership mix. But frankly, that's why we continue to develop even more ways to engage members and support our states. Our goal really is to help individuals find coverage. And so a couple of points on that. Our retention rate for the programs that we've implemented exceeds that of our traditional programs.\nWe're seeing strong re-enrollment rates between 15% and 20%, depending on the state. So as a result, as John mentioned in his comments, we're retaining a significant majority of the members we engage with, certainly more to do. Then second, in terms of your question around just kind of outlook, again, I think the factors around the re-enrollment have an impact on just how we think about mix. But I think it's also important to consider the rate environment. States are taking into account a thoughtful and data-driven approach to rate setting. And with visibility now into around 45% of our revenue for 2024, I'm really appreciative of the approach that states are taking. So all in all, I would say both membership as well as our outlook is in line with what we expected at this point, with a lot of variability.\nI think our membership looks good in terms of the outlook that we set at the beginning of the year. At this point, I feel all of this is manageable.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nDan, thanks so much. Thank all of you for your time this morning. I hope what you heard during today's call only reinforces what you've come to expect from UnitedHealth Group, an organization that's just as nimble and agile as it is focused and disciplined, always growing, always innovating, ceaselessly committed to our mission, and deeply devoted to those we share. Thank you for your attention today, and we appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nThis does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation."

A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under US federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the Financial and Earnings Reports section of the company's Investor Relations page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com.\nInformation presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated 14 July 2023, which may be accessed from the Investor Relations page of the company's website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThank you. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. As we discussed a number of weeks ago, during the quarter, we saw a somewhat higher-than-usual range of movement in certain areas of care activity. As you'd expect, this inevitably impacted some elements of our business, but we overcame these dynamics with strength in other areas. Our Q2 performance reflects the capabilities, agility, and dedication of our people as they responded to the changes. As a team, we're confident in our ability to robustly grow in this fluid healthcare environment. Indeed, as I hope you saw in our release today, revenue growth in the quarter was strong and well-balanced across our enterprise, increasing by more than $12 billion to nearly $93 billion. Let me provide a few highlights of our growth.\nFirst, the number of patients served by Optum Health under fully accountable value-based care arrangements grew by more than 900,000 over this time last year. Among the new patients we welcomed, a significant number have complex needs. These people have serious health challenges, limited economic resources, and often live in communities where it can be difficult to access high-quality care. Our ability to support their needs is distinctive and a direct result of the investments we have made to provide coordinated and comprehensive medical, pharmacy, and behavioral care. Foundational capabilities that will help the patients we serve live healthier lives and drive growth far into the future. Optum Rx and Optum Insight revenue grew double digits on expanded capabilities and products that are generating new sales and opportunities. UnitedHealthcare's growth was strong and diversified as well.\nToday, we're serving nearly 1.6 million more people in our commercial and public sector program offerings than we did last year. This durable growth, driven by our colleagues' relentless focus on quality and execution, enabled us to achieve Q2 adjusted earnings per share of $6.14 and to strengthen our full-year outlook to between $24.70 to 25 per share. We know there is great interest in understanding the recent care activity I just mentioned, so I'll give you an overview of how we're seeing care patterns progress and how we're responding. I do want to underscore the most critical point first. Making high-quality care more affordable and accessible is at the core of our mission. Having more people obtaining the care they need is a positive trend for individuals, our health system, and society.\nAs we discussed several weeks ago, during the Q2, we observed increased care patterns, notably in outpatient surgeries for seniors and especially with certain orthopedic procedures which may have been postponed. John will provide some additional detail on this later. As we look to 2024, we have developed compelling Medicare Advantage offerings. Our teams were, of course, thoughtful both in our response to the CMS rate notice and in incorporating these care activity trends into our June benefit filings. Even in this challenging funding environment, we continue to prioritize the stability and affordability our members have come to rely on from UnitedHealthcare. We're confident that next year we will once again grow at a pace exceeding that of the broader market. While of a much lesser impact than senior outpatient care, we also are seeing increased care activity in behavioral.\nOver the past few years, behavioral care patterns have been accelerating as people increasingly feel comfortable seeking services. Just since last year, the percentage of people who are accessing behavioral care has increased by double digits. From our perspective, it's an encouraging sign that more people are seeking help, yet the ongoing shortage of qualified care providers has caused significant access challenges. To address the issue, Optum Health has expanded its network by tens of thousands of care professionals this year, and we are developing our benefit offerings, assuming demand for behavioral care services will continue to rise. Optum Health's value-based care models are continuing to deliver especially strong and measurable results for people, today serving more than 4 million patients and dozens of payers.\nOptum Health and the patients and payers it serves share a common desire to seek improved health outcomes and experiences while ultimately lowering the cost of care. We're pleased to see more evidence supporting the efficacy of value-based care. Last month, researchers at Yale Medicine, working in collaboration with Optum, published a peer-reviewed study about in-home visits, an important element in our value-based care approach. The study found patients who received our in-home preventative wellness assessments compared with those who hadn't made fewer emergency department visits and spent fewer nights in hospitals across four common conditions: depression, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and type 2 diabetes. They also experienced reduced wait times for follow-up primary care. Yale Medicine's research follows another peer-reviewed study published in JAMA in December, which found Medicare Advantage patients in Optum's fully accountable care model showed significantly better health outcomes compared to people in Medicare Fee-for-Service.\nOptum Health patients fared better on each of eight key metrics, including hospital readmissions and emergency department visits. We see these results as compelling validation of the value-based care approach and signal more strongly its promise and potential as we expand these care models to many millions more patients in the years ahead. I'll now turn it over to UnitedHealth Group President and Chief Operating Officer, Dirk McMahon, to elaborate on how we're focusing on affordability, transparency, and simplicity for the people we serve. Dirk?\n\nDirk McMahon\n\nPresident and COO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThanks, Andrew. Making high-quality care more affordable and more accessible is what we do, so it is really great to see people getting the care they need, especially as our teams are working to build more capacity in our benefit networks and care delivery resources to accommodate consumers' evolving needs. Affordability is vital. For far too many people, cost remains the most significant barrier to high-quality care. We are leaning in hard on behalf of consumers, employers, and health plans to lower out-of-pocket costs and drive greater affordability throughout the system. As you heard from Andrew, recently we've seen an uptick in outpatient surgeries. Finding the most appropriate site of service is crucial because the cost of those procedures can differ dramatically depending upon where they are performed.\nOverall, evidence shows that comparable procedures performed in ambulatory surgery centers cost about half as much as traditional settings with comparable outcomes. For consumers, that translates into many hundreds of dollars in out-of-pocket cost savings for just a single procedure, and the patient satisfaction levels at our centers are among the highest in healthcare, with NPS approaching 90. Also high on our affordability agenda is continuing to lower the cost of prescription drugs. Our customers, including employers, unions, health plans, and governments, count on us to help them access the most effective medicines at the lowest possible cost. In fact, pharmacy benefit managers like ours are the only link in the drug supply chain whose main purpose is to improve affordability for everyone. We go further by recommending benefit designs and providing tools to help consumers navigate their options and find the best value for their prescriptions.\nA recently launched feature called Price Edge, which provides the lowest cost option for a patient's medication, already has delivered millions of dollars in consumer out-of-pocket savings. Specialty drug costs continue to be a focus of every customer Optum Rx works with. Our differentiated approach to specialty is designed to serve the unique needs of patients, payers, providers, and pharma partners and has allowed us to greatly expand our access to limited distribution drugs. We work to tailor our programs with individualized, single-point-of-contact care for rare disease and clinical excellence programs for conditions such as MS, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. Clients working with Optum Rx who implement all our specialty medication management programs can save up to 20% on their specialty drug costs. Closely related to specialty, biosimilars are another area where we are helping drive affordability and consumer choice.\nEarlier this year, we began offering Amjevita, a biosimilar to Humira, at parity, ensuring patients and their doctors have more options to choose from when deciding on a course of care. Recently, Optum Rx and UnitedHealthcare announced the addition of two new Humira biosimilars, Cyltezo and Hyrimoz, to our standard prescription drug list also at parity. This increased competition for the innovator drug will result in double-digit savings for our customers. You might also recall that a year ago we announced our initiative to offer life-saving drugs at no cost to our customers. This benefit is available to everyone in UnitedHealthcare's group fully insured commercial plans and has been adopted by more than 500 of our self-funded customers, increasing adherence and saving people millions of dollars.\nFinally, another important customer innovation that is making the health system simpler is Optum Financial's Integrated Card, which enables seamless access to benefits, programs, and rewards for more than 13 million consumers who have been issued the card since we broadly rolled it out at the start of the year. Adoption and satisfaction levels have been very strong, making it much simpler for seniors to navigate the system and understand their benefits and creating a more satisfying consumer experience. These and many other results are validating our strategic approach to healthcare. I know from my many meetings with customers that these affordability, transparency, and simplicity initiatives are resonating. They are a key reason for our continued growth in a highly competitive environment and for our confidence in maintaining our momentum as we look ahead. With that, let me hand it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\n\nJohn Rex\n\nCFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThank you, Dirk. Adaptability and delivering greater value for the people we serve continue as foundational elements for our enterprise. These last few months are a good example. Identifying evolving market trends, moving quickly to help people get the care they need, incorporating our broad and multifaceted insights into planning, and importantly, delivering on our commitments to you, our shareholders. These traits underpin our confidence not only in achieving our goals for 2023, but also as we look toward 2024 and beyond. Before reviewing our business results, let me elaborate on the care patterns Andrew described earlier. To illustrate, in Q2, outpatient care activity among seniors was a few hundred basis points above our expectations. As we've highlighted, specific orthopedic and cardiac procedures had increases far above that level of variation.\nAs we developed and filed our 2024 Medicare Advantage offerings, we assume that these levels of heightened care activity will persist throughout next year. Overall, care activity among our Medicaid and commercial populations is consistent with our expectations. As always, we continue to intensely analyze trends that may indicate more severe disease progression, which could point to rising acuity, for example, in areas such as cancer or cardiovascular disease. We see no such evidence while continuing to monitor closely. With that, let's turn to our Q2 results. Revenue of $92.9 billion grew by nearly $12.6 billion, or 16%, over the prior year, with double-digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Optum Health revenues grew by 36% to $23.9 billion, driven by an increase in the number of patients served, a growing mix of patients with more complex needs, and the expanding scope of care services we can offer.\nOperating margins reflect the higher care activity patterns we have discussed, with seniors comprising a significant majority of value-based patients served. Optum Rx revenues grew by 15%, surpassing $28 billion, driven by continued new customer wins and strong double-digit growth across our specialty infusion and community pharmacies. Rx growth of nearly 7% reflects continued demand for our affordable solutions that give customers choice and simplify the pharmacy experience, such as biosimilar access and digital pharmacy tools. Partway into the 2024 selling season, this momentum continues with strong client additions. Optum Insight revenues grew 42% to nearly $4.7 billion. The revenue backlog reached over $31 billion, an increase of $8 billion over last year, in part due to the addition of Change Healthcare. The integration and investment activities discussed on previous calls have gone well and are setting the stage for the next phase of growth for Optum Insight.\nTurning to UnitedHealthcare, our commercial business added nearly 500,000 people in the first half and continues its growth, with the 2024 selling season indications tracking favorably. Within our public sector programs, we continue to expect growth of over 900,000 Medicare Advantage members this year, and our Medicaid performance remains strong as we continue to support states as they initiate redeterminations. Comprehensive outreach efforts to help individuals retain coverage are underway, though it is still early as most states began this work only recently. Our capital capacities are strong. Adjusted cash flows from operations were $10.4 billion, or nearly 2x net income in the Q2, and $15.6 billion, or nearly 1.4x net income in the first half.\nIn the first six months of this year, we returned $8.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and in June, our board of directors increased the dividend by 14%. As Andrew mentioned, based upon our growth outlook and the trends discussed, today we were able to strengthen and narrow our full-year 2023 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $24.70 to 25 per share. Within this, we expect a relatively balanced pacing in the second half. Now I'll turn it back to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nJohn, thank you. Overall, for UnitedHealth Group, looking to the second half of the year and into 2024 and beyond, we're confident that we're capturing the current landscape in our planning decisions, which in turn gives us confidence in our ability to sustain the growth momentum shown in our first half and continue to demonstrate the adaptability, performance, and mission-driven purpose of this enterprise, especially in evolving environments. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions. One per caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe floor is now open for questions at this time. If you have a question or comment, please press star one on your touch-tone phone. You may remove yourself from the queue by pressing star two on your touch-tone phone. We ask you to limit yourself to one question. If you ask multiple questions, we will only be answering the first question so we can respond to everyone in the queue this morning. We'll take our first question from AJ Rice with Credit Suisse.\n\nA.J. Rice\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Credit Suisse\n\nThanks. Hi, everybody. I appreciate the comments about what you're seeing in the care demand. On the Optum Health side, you guys, obviously, top line continues to be very strong there. There's a little bit of margin degradation from Q1 to Q2. How much of that relates to what you're describing around senior utilization? I know you've got a capitated component and you've got a fee-for-service component, but I think last quarter you also said that the growth in membership would be something that would pressure margin short-term, but obviously be a long-term positive. And then there's a lot of other things in Optum Health. Are they helping or hurting margin? Give us a little bit of flavor for what's happening underneath the aggregate number.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nAJ, thanks so much for the question. So first off, let me start off. I'm super pleased with the performance of Optum Health overall. And when you look at the growth of that business and particularly the expansion of the number of patients who we're now looking after in value-based arrangements, now about 4 million folks, not just from UHC, but of course from many other payers as well. Really strong validation of the model that we've been building, and you can continue to see us extend that. In terms of the margin compression during the Q, really I'd say there are a couple of dynamics to that.\nOne is trend, and you very much echoing the senior trend comments you've heard us make earlier in the quarter, and I think is well understood. A second element of that, which specifically affects Optum Health, is the behavioral growth. And I mentioned that in my prepared comments, AJ, around continued strong growth in behavioral. That certainly has played its part within Q2 for Optum Health. And then the third area is a kind of good news story, but with short-term implications. So that's really the growth of the membership that's come in this year. As you know, we've grown very strongly this year, actually a little ahead of our expectations.\nWe've also brought in a very significant number of complex patients. As we invest in helping those folks manage their care better, that puts a little pressure on the margin in the short run. But that's really laying super strong foundation stones, not just for as we move through the year, but into 2024, 2025, 2026. So those three elements, the senior trend piece, the behavioral piece, and then the effect of the strong growth is really what explains what goes on. We're going to continue to lean into that growth very assertively. AJ, thanks so much.\n\nA.J. Rice\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Credit Suisse\n\nAll right.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.\n\nLisa Gill\n\nSenior Analyst of Healthcare Technology, JPMorgan\n\nHi, thanks very much. Good morning. I just want to understand when I think about the guide to the upper end for the full-year MLR, how much of that is driven by this MA outpatient trend versus behavioral? And when I think about behavioral utilization, is that being driven by a particular population, or is it more broad-based? And how do I just think about behavioral as a percentage of your cost?\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nSo Lisa, thanks so very much for that. Let me ask John to just contextualize for you a little bit the balance between the senior and behavioral, and then maybe ask Dr. Decker to just give you a little bit of commentary around the type of constellation that we're dealing with in terms of the growth.\n\nJohn Rex\n\nCFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nLisa, good morning. It's John. So, in terms of your question, the majority of the guide to the upper end for the full year is driven by what we've described in terms of the activity, the care activity we're seeing among seniors in outpatient. So that's a core there. In terms of behavioral, what we've noticed in behavioral is an increase in the number of people accessing care. Andrew had this in his comments, but a very, very significant increase, even just since a year ago, in terms of the number of people that are looking to access care. It's a great thing. We are planning on that continuing. We don't see why that trend slows down. So we're designing your benefits for that to continue. As you recall, I know, Lisa, behavioral resides within Optum Health.\nAnd so that's the kind of an impact that we'd see in that component. And Wyatt, maybe some other commentary?\n\nWyatt W. Decker\n\nEVP and Chief Physician for Value-Based Care and Innovation, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah, absolutely. Thank you, Lisa. So you asked about the types of consultations and care being provided within behavioral, and we're seeing across the board increasing utilization. But what's encouraging from a public health perspective is it isn't strictly young people. It's across the board. We're seeing 30-, 40-, and 50-year-olds accessing behavioral healthcare for needed care for conditions like anxiety, depression, and substance use disorder. And our commitment is to make sure that they have access to that care. So as you heard from Andrew earlier, we've expanded our behavioral healthcare network, and we also, a couple of years ago, very thoughtfully launched behavioral care provider services. And we now have ambulatory services available in 37 states, and we have self-paced modules for things like anxiety and depression, and we add a therapist as appropriate.\nSo you'll see us continuing to make sure our members have access as well as providing innovative, scalable solutions for behavioral healthcare needs across the age spectrum. Thank you.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah, Wyatt, thank you so much. So Lisa, I think you got it there. Overall, it's very much around the senior trend phenomena. Within Optum Health, the behavioral piece plays its part. We see that very much as an area where we will continue to step up and make sure that we're delivering the care in the way that Wyatt just described to you. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.\n\nNathan Rich\n\nUS Managed Care Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for the question. John, you mentioned the backloading of EPS in the back half of the year between Q3 and Q4. Could you talk about your expectations for MCR specifically between the two quarters? And how are you thinking about the trend of care activity as we head into the back half of the year, given what you're seeing with respect to demand, as well as some of the supply bottlenecks to care being delivered, maybe being removed? And do those factors differ significantly between Medicare and the commercial or Medicaid lines of business? Thank you.\n\nJohn Rex\n\nCFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nNate, good morning. Thanks for the question. Yeah, in terms of the balance pacing, the way I described that is in MCR and how that feeds in. We'd expect the MCR to be a little bit lower in Q3 than we saw in Q2. Some of that seasonality is you would fully expect. So within the context of balancing, expect earnings to be a little bit higher marginally in Q3 than Q4 because of that typical factor in there. And thinking of an MCR somewhere in the zone between kind of what we saw in Q1 and Q2, just a seasonality factor. Important in that is we expect the kind of general pacing of care activity to remain consistent. That's what we've actually been seeing here.\nSo since we've talked about this and as we've looked at the level of care activity across the company, these elements we talked about in terms of senior outpatient care are really remaining stable at the levels we talked to. And our expectation is it continues in that level. So as you looked out to the second half of this year, our expectation it continues at those levels that we've been seeing with the, like I mentioned, a few hundred basis points above our expectations in the senior business. That continues. The only underlying factor is a little bit of seasonality that you would see occurring there.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nGreat. Thanks so much, John. And thanks, Nate. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\n\nJustin Lake\n\nAnalyst of Healthcare Services, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning. My question's on commercial trend. You mentioned it's in line with expectations. Wanted to delve a little bit deeper. I think you might have said previously that you'd priced for commercial trend to be above normal this year. So some conservatism. So does that mean that it's running above normal, but in line with your pricing at this point? And if it's above normal, can you tell us how Q2 emerged versus Q4, Q1, meaning did it uptick versus in Q2 versus Q1 or Q4? And then just lastly, any insight on the commercial components as outpatient or pressure here as well? Thanks.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nJustin, thanks so much for the question. I mean, so really not much to see here, in all honesty, first off. Where we came into the year, as you alluded to, we priced for some anticipation of unit cost inflation. We've seen some of that come through. Within that, everything is tracking very much within our expectations. So we set the year anticipating a little bit of price, cost growth, if you will. But beyond that, really nothing to note. And we feel good about where we sit here. Thanks so much. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.\n\nJosh Raskin\n\nPartner of Managed Care & Providers, Nephron Research\n\nHi, thanks. Good morning. Do you think any of the increased utilization you're seeing on the MA side was self-inflicted in the sense that you've really augmented benefits dramatically in the last year, really last two years? And perhaps that's encouraged or even catalyzed sort of an over-utilization of trends relative to historical patterns and expectations. And then how did you address the utilization trends in your benefit designs for 2024? I know there's sensitivity about saying something on a public call, but maybe just broad changes that you'd expected.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nJosh, thanks so much for the question. I'm going to ask Tim Noel to give you a little bit more commentary. But I think bottom line, I don't really think the benefits are driving this. I think this is when you look at the concentration of what we're seeing in terms of the outpatient, the orthopedics in particular, those sorts of areas, it looks very much more like a kind of deferment of care. Super interesting when you look at maybe what's changed a little bit within that. We've seen a shift in the fraction of people who, once they have been essentially recommended for surgery, actually go through and complete the procedure. Arguably, what might drive that change is, one, more supply. So actually, it's more possible to go get it done.\nBut two, maybe a little less reticent from an individual to go into a facility in a post-COVID environment versus a COVID environment. That feels like the thing that's shifted. And maybe ask Tim to just add a little bit to that as well, Tim.\n\nTim Noel\n\nCEO of Medicare and Retirement, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah, thanks, Josh. Consistent with what Andrew said, when we look at potential drivers, everything from acuity to benefits added to mix of membership, everything is really tracking very normally and in line with what we would expect. So nothing to call out there, but certainly something that we look at closely and carefully each and every year, and this year being no different. With respect to your question regarding benefits, so I think one thing to keep in mind is that the more important driver to our benefit decisions this year were the changes to the risk model. Certainly, we've been talking a lot about care patterns, but that has far less of an impact on the benefits filed and is really one of many assumptions that we make inside of our bids.\nBut we feel very confident in our ability to provide stability to the benefits that seniors value most, things like zero copays for primary care visits, zero copays for tier one drugs, keeping zero monthly plan premiums where we had them in the past, and keeping level out-of-pocket maximums. Very important things for benefits for stability, and we were able to preserve those. So we're really happy about that. So on balance, combined with the great momentum we see in our value proposition, the great partnerships we have, and confidence from the broker community, we feel really good about the benefits we filed. And also, as we talked about in open remarks, really confident in seeing that momentum pull through into some great growth results next year.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nTim, thanks so much. Josh, thanks very much for the question. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.\n\nLance Wilkes\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nYeah, a question on the commercial side of the business. Can you talk a little bit about membership in the fee-based business being down? And also maybe related to that and your outlook going forward in Medicaid redetermination, are you seeing any trends with respect to recapture of those sorts of members or anything that's driving the opportunity for either growth in membership or maybe you're seeing in-the-count attrition due to weakness in the economy? Thanks.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nLance, thanks so much for the question. Before I hand it to Dan Kueter, who looks after our E&I business, I just want to make a couple of kind of high-level comments. We're seeing overall a very strong performance from our commercial business this year and also setting up, it feels like, very well for the 2024 season. We've seen fantastic overall growth, as I mentioned, in terms of membership. And that's been led very much by a lot of the product innovation that the team have been putting together and into the marketplace. And we see that continuing pretty assertively as we roll into 2024. Just with that kind of backdrop, maybe, Dan, if you could respond to Lance's specific questions, that'd be great.\n\nDan Kueter\n\nCEO of UnitedHealthcare Employer and Individual, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah, Lance, thanks for the question. Growth is on track for the full year. What you see in Q2 really is represented by the contraction of one large customer in our fee-based business. Your question about attrition and redeterminations, the outcome of those, which will be some puts and takes, will probably determine where within our range we will fall. The punchline is we're on track to hit our range for this year. Thanks for the question, Lance.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThanks, Dan. Thanks so much, Lance, for the question. And just to be super clear as well, that client loss that Dan just referred to, we knew about that about a year ago, very much within our expectations and forecast plan. It was something we were anticipating and makes no impact at all to our full-year expectation. But thanks so much for the question. And next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Kevin Fishbeck with Bank of America.\n\nKevin Fishbeck\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat, thanks. I just want to follow up on the Optum Health because the margin there was obviously pressured in the quarter. And I just want to understand how the margin normalization, how should we think about that over the next couple of years? I mean, on the MA side, you can reprice for things. It sounds like you saw it in time for your bids, and costs have come in line with the way that you price. Maybe just confirm that piece first. But then since within Optum Health, you're also relying on other providers and how they price for 2024, how are you thinking about the market progression? If you're below target this year, is this something you can get back to next year, or is this a multi-year thing depending on how others price or the leverage within your control, or is this kind of a longer-term normalization? Thanks.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nHey, Kevin, thanks so much for the question. So first off, as I mentioned earlier, the pressure's really coming from those three sources: the senior trend phenomena that we've talked a lot about, the very specific Optum piece around behavioral, and then the growth in the book. And within that, very much the complex care patient, which, as I'm going to repeat again, is an extremely positive element of our growth going forward. That's going to be an extraordinarily important foundation stone for the future of the company. We're going to continue to lean into that growth first and foremost. We do expect to see margins continue to strengthen, particularly as you roll through into 2024. You're absolutely right. We believe we've caught this in our pricing for next year.\nBut more importantly, the longer time we have to look after folks and wrap around care, we can deliver much better outcomes for them, as we talked about earlier. And we can also make the economic proposition better. It really builds much more sustainable capability. So all of that will kick in as well as we roll through subsequent quarters and years. This is going to be a continuing building pressure. I feel very good about that range we've laid out for Optum Health over the next several years. And actually, I think if I had the choice on a slightly suppressed margin in Q2 or the very significant growth that we've taken in, I'll take the growth all day long. And I'll take that growth because it's going to underpin years of growth going forward. Appreciate the question, Kevin. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Gary Taylor with Cowen.\n\nGary Taylor\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Cowen\n\nHi, good morning. I just want to talk about some of the or ask about some of the levers and offset because it is a little counterintuitive to hear the commentary intra-quarter about higher MLR and then seeing your largest profit segment, Optum Health, with lower margins. And so this quarter, obviously, investment income was far stronger. The street was looking for, at least versus our model, G&A was better. But I know moving into the back half, I think you believe there's more time potentially to pull some of those G&A levers. So could you just talk about investment income, G&A, or what other offsets there might be in the back half and how much of that is carrying forward into your 2024 thinking at this point?\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah, very much appreciate the question, Gary. Let me ask John to make some comments for that. John.\n\nJohn Rex\n\nCFO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nGood morning, Gary. It's John. So yes, you're right. So investment income has, frankly, been growing strongly over the past number of quarters and continues to grow. Some of that is the backdrop of the rising interest rate environment, as you know very well. Some of that is also a result of very active management by our treasury teams in terms of deploying more and more cash balances into interest-bearing accounts and such. They've been working hard at that over the past few quarters in advancing the productivity of that cash after coming off of a period of many years of a zero-interest rate environment. So a lot of elements in that. In any given quarter, we can experience some gains in our investment portfolio. So that can be gains from anything from our regular fixed-income investments to anything from our diverse venture holdings.\nAnd so those come in, just they come in at different points in time. Perhaps sometimes they're a little bit less predictable, but kind of are typically in a similar zone, frankly, not outside. I don't expect those kind of things. I don't count on those kind of things, frankly, every quarter. That's not a thing we look at. But they are elements that we've seen over time and kind of the zones and kind of the zones that we're experiencing even now too. So yeah, thanks, Gary.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nThanks, John. Maybe ask Dirk to also comment a little bit. As you think about the G&A side of the equation going forward, Dirk, maybe reflect a little bit on the work you're leading around technology and other interventions as we look to drive down our overall costs.\n\nDirk McMahon\n\nPresident and COO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah, Gary, what I would say is much of the focus we've really been applying a lot of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing. Long term, we think there's great hope for those. And some of the short-term things that we're working on in those areas, like using generative AI to help more efficiently write medical appeal letters, things like optimizing our provider search and all of our digital properties with natural language processing and AI, doing a lot of work, improving our payment integrity models using AI to detect waste, fraud, and abuse.\nAnd then a lot in the G&A world to answer basic questions in our call centers, like leveraging our benefit bots to reduce the number of calls and the labor associated with that for simple questions like, \"Is X, Y, or Z disease covered?\" or, \"Have I met my deductible?\" From a long-range perspective, however, I'm really optimistic about our significant data sets. Our ability to take advantage of whatever new technology comes down the pike to improve healthcare, I'm really excited about it. So thanks for the question.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah, Dirk, thanks so much. And I think, Gary, overall, and I think I tried to allude at the very beginning, obviously, when you see a movement in care activity like we saw in the quarter, it's been great to see the range of levers that we have within the organization to respond. And you've seen what we've been able to do in the very short run. And as you would expect, we have more and more of those levers as you roll through into the medium and longer-term outlooks, as both John and Dirk have described, both in the financial side of the company, but also critically in the core operating cost structure of the company, which we're going to continue to bear down on very, very assertively.\nConsequence of all of that is that even with the backdrop of some of the fluidity we've seen, we're able to continue to commit to the investment behind growth and the investment behind looking after patients as well as we possibly can and giving people a fantastic experience, which is what we think builds super sustainable shareholder value. So that's very much the priority that we're focused on. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to George Hill with Deutsche Bank.\n\nGeorge Hill\n\nResearch Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, John, I want to talk a little bit more about your expectations for the senior book in 2024. You guys kind of talked about that you expect the current elevated trend to continue and price for it when you think about the MA bids. I guess kind of talk about what drives the visibility there from what you see now overall looking all the way out to 2024? And should we think of the pricing as just kind of conservatism on UNH's part? Or I'm kind of interested in the data that drives the visibility. Thank you.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nHey, George, thanks for the question. I'm actually going to ask Tim Noel, who leads the Medicare business, to respond to that, Tim.\n\nTim Noel\n\nCEO of Medicare and Retirement, UnitedHealth Group\n\nYeah, thanks, George, for the question. So I'll start by reiterating one thing because it's an important point. The biggest item that was shaping this year's bid thinking was around the risk model changes. The outpatient care patterns play a far smaller role there. But that said, having the ability to incorporate the latest data, anything we've learned recently into our Medicare Advantage bids is extremely important in each and every year, especially given how we see both key revenue and medical elements firm up inside of Q2. Being able to incorporate the latest thinking that we have in our bid filings is really, really important. Because of that, we've designed a bid process that is very nimble and able to accommodate late changes.\nThis year, out of a respect for a developing trend, we made the assumption that some of these early indications that we were seeing in the outpatient care patterns we have talked about would remain durable. And as we sit here today, as John has talked about, these assumptions have validated, and they've also stabilized. And we feel confident that we've made the appropriate accommodations inside of our 2024 bids for all of this. Thank you.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nTim, thanks so much. Jennifer, we have time for one last question. So let's take the last question. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our last question from Scott Fidel with Stephens.\n\nScott Fidel\n\nManaging Director of Healthcare Services, Stephens\n\nHi, thanks. Was hoping maybe you could drill a little bit just into the announcement of the Amedisys acquisition and maybe in particular just talk about sort of strategy for ramping up the exposure here given the tough near-term reimbursement environment for home health, and then maybe some early thoughts around some of the integrations or synergies that you could generate from integrating Amedisys and LHCG together. Thanks.\n\nAndrew Witty\n\nCEO, UnitedHealth Group\n\nScott, thanks so much for the question. Well, first of all, we're obviously very pleased to have come to an agreement on the transaction with Amedisys. So we appreciate that. But as you'd expect, we're now in the very early stages of that process. It wouldn't be appropriate to talk about anything specific in that regard. If I just take it maybe a level higher, it's no secret that we're very strong believers in the value of home health, and it's no secret that we believe that home health capabilities, when combined with other activities in terms of wrapping care around patients, is a really important element of future value-based care, particularly as you speak towards complex patients, many of whom maybe struggle to get out of the home, maybe don't have quite the same kind of relationship with the clinic as you might often expect.\nSo we do think that the general area is an important area. As I said, as far as the specifics are concerned, I think we'll go through the regular kind of process, and we'll update you as appropriate, but probably not much more to say today. Thanks so much, Scott, for the question. Thank you, everybody, for joining us this morning. We very much appreciate your time. We hope you take away from this call our confidence in our ability to continue to perform and grow strongly while we pursue our mission and build the foundations for continued growth in 2024 and beyond. We are very much looking forward to sharing more on our progress with you again in October. Thanks so much for your time this morning.\n\nOperator\n\nThis does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.\nHere is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements including -- included in our current and periodic filings.\nThis call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial and earning reports section of the company's Investor Relations page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and Form 8-K dated April 14, 2023, which may be accessed from the Investor Relations page of the company's website.\nI will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty.\n\nAndrew Philip Witty\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Executive Officer-Optum, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. Growth in the quarter was strong and well balanced across Optum and UnitedHealthcare with revenue increasing 15% to $92 billion. This broad-based growth, combined with the continued focus of our colleagues on tight execution, helped us deliver first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $6.26, up 14% over last year.\nYear-to-date, UnitedHealthcare increased the number of people served in the U.S. by 1.2 million, about half of this total within our commercial offerings. At OptumHealth, we're now serving nearly 700,000 more patients under fully accountable value-based arrangements compared to just December 2022.\nGiven the strength of these results, we're increasing our adjusted earnings per share outlook for the full year to a range of $24.50 to $25 per share.\nI know one topic is front of mind for you this morning. So I'll start with Medicare Advantage. With the 2024 Medicare Advantage notice in hand, we now have greater clarity for the short- to midterm evolution of this important program. Our teams are working through the implications of the changes for 2024 and we'll be ready to submit bids in just a few weeks.\nWhile we remain concerned about some of the potential unintended consequences of the changes of the risk adjustment model, particularly around adequate diagnosis and support for people with diabetes, complex behavioral needs and more, we do appreciate CMS' decision to phase-in the changes. This phase-in will allow for more time to minimize the impacts on beneficiaries as we lean on the multiple levers available to us, including our ability to manage costs and our relentless focus on member and patient needs.\nWe expect the many years of work and investment our teams have put into products and value differentiation as well as quality measures such as Star scores will enable us to continue to offer leading value to Medicare beneficiaries and to grow strongly for years to come. We're committed to working with CMS as stewards of the MA program, especially with its long-stated goal of promoting value-based care, which remains the best solution to promote equitable access, better health care outcomes, exceptional experiences and lower cost for the system.\nAnd importantly, it best supports people who have historically been underserved and who face fragmented, less effective care under traditional fee-for-service.\nSeniors know that with MA versus fee-for-service, they can access a more integrated and comprehensive suite of critical health benefits, including prescription medicines, vision, dental and hearing care. They can seek care in more convenient settings. They experience better health outcomes, such as an over 40% lower rate of avoidable hospitalizations and consistently derive much greater value. In fact, the typical Medicare Advantage senior spent about $2,000 a year less out of pocket compared to seniors in traditional Medicare. And well over 90% of seniors in Medicare Advantage report they are highly satisfied with their coverage and care. That's why more than 30 million Americans, fully half of all seniors, choose Medicare Advantage today.\nOver the past year, we focused on improving the consumer experience across our company. This consumer orientation is foundational in support of each of our growth priorities, including our approach to value-based care. For example, this year, we expect to serve more than 4 million patients in fully accountable value-based care arrangements through Optum, about double where we were at the end of 2021. These patients will be members of UnitedHealthcare benefit plans or one of the many other plans served by Optum. Many of them are in Medicare Advantage. And increasingly, we are serving people with Medicaid or commercial benefits, an important growth focus for the coming years.\nWe spent well more than a decade investing in essential infrastructure and offering extensive practice transition support to enable tens of thousands of care providers to participate in this comprehensive value-based approach. By integrating traditional ambulatory care with specialty, behavioral and pharmacy care across in-clinic, virtual and in-home settings, we're delivering measurably better health outcomes for patients, all while improving access and lowering costs for people and the health care system overall.\nOur focus on consumers is helping to drive growth within health benefits, including strong growth in our commercial offerings and our early indications are for continued robust commercial growth in 2024. From our employee-centered Surest insurance offer, to our innovative financial services for both members and care providers, to our improved pharmacy home delivery services and 0 co-pays on life-saving drugs, through all of these initiatives and more, we are firmly on track to put the member, patient and consumer at the very heart of what we do.\nOne last note on UnitedHealthcare benefits and the resumption of Medicaid redeterminations. Now that the process has started, we're working with our state partners and others to provide as much information and support as possible so people can understand and access their best coverage options. And we expect to be serving more people in our benefit programs when this process is completed.\nAnd now I'll turn it over to UnitedHealth Group President and Chief Operating Officer, Dirk McMahon. Dirk?\n\nDirk C. McMahon\n\nCEO, UnitedHealthcare, Inc.\n\nThanks, Andrew. Picking up on redeterminations. For many months, we have been preparing to help people when this activity resumes, as it now has in over 20 states. We are working closely with Medicaid members to navigate eligibility guidelines and help find alternative coverage options if they are no longer Medicaid-eligible. This effort includes live outreach calls to educate and assist members with renewal process to ensure they retain their existing coverage or can transition to other plans.\nWe are also engaged with employers to extend annual enrollment periods and drive awareness for employees who are eligible for coverage. With extended eligibility and increased subsidies, many people will qualify for other plans, some with no monthly premium. UnitedHealthcare is executing our detailed plans to ensure as many people as possible have uninterrupted access to coverage and care if they are no longer eligible for Medicaid.\nLet me now turn to the opportunity we have to more deeply and effectively serve people in their homes. Nearly all of the patients we'll add this year in fully accountable value-based relationships will have access to support through our home-based platform. Consumers value and benefit from services delivered in the home and we have expanded our capabilities to serve that need. I'll highlight 4 of our key capabilities in this important area.\nFirst, patient assessments, in-home clinical visits designed to identify care needs and help patients with other physical and social needs. This year, we expect to make more than 2.5 million visits to patients' homes and we continue to expand the scope of the clinical services offered in that setting.\nNext, care transitions. This entails supporting patients into and through post-acute settings, helping people to avoid hospital readmissions after an inpatient stay. This year, we will manage nearly 12 million care transitions, about twice as many as just 3 years ago. This plays an important role in helping people return safely home and in connecting patients with additional in-home support.\nThird area, senior community care. This is clinical care for seniors who live in skilled nursing and assisted living facilities and dedicated senior housing. Our clinical teams provide additional layers of care and on-call resources. And they coordinate among patients and their primary care provider, facility staff and caregivers, all contributing to strong quality of care and outcomes.\nAnd the fourth area of clinical capability is individual care and coordination for Medicare dual and chronic special needs patients. These patients frequently require a more individualized approach to care. On average, these patients are managing 9 different chronic conditions and taking multiple medications. Our high-touch approach leads to better outcomes, including an over 15% reduction in hospitalizations, high patient satisfaction with an NPS of nearly 80 with 99% of our patients in a 4-star or higher plan.\nOur recent combination with LHC Group expands in-home capabilities. LHC provides high-quality, compassionate home health, hospice and post-acute care services with over 12 million patient encounters each year. We will learn from and build upon LHC's capabilities, expanding the scope and acuity of the care we can provide in a patient's health.\nAnd finally, shifting to pharmacy care services. OptumRx just completed another strong growth season. We are winning new relationships by offering the lowest cost and strong service across a wide variety of customers from health plans, to labor and governments and to commercial employers. We help customers obtain the best net cost and we use our clinical expertise to help treat conditions that call for specialty medications.\nIn addition, consumers are benefiting from efforts such as Price Edge, which gives them the best-price option whether on or off benefit; UnitedHealthcare's introduction last year of 0-cost life-saving drugs; and our ability to manage the introduction of biosimilars on equal footing with the existing branded product. In short, we have consumers' backs.\nWith that, let me hand it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\n\nJohn F. Rex\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC\n\nThank you, Dirk. Fundamental execution has long been an essential aspect of UnitedHealth Group's ability to deliver for all those we serve. We know that if we meet or exceed our commitments and strive to live up to our potential, we will continue to generate high-quality durable growth.\nOur first quarter performance was highlighted by the strong and accelerating growth achieved across the businesses of UHC and Optum. We accomplished this while continuing to expand upon the foundation, which will drive the future growth you have come to expect from us.\nRevenue in the first quarter of $92 billion grew by nearly $12 billion or 15% over the prior year with double-digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. This growth was achieved by serving more people across all our businesses and importantly, by serving them more comprehensively. UnitedHealth Group served -- UnitedHealthcare served about 1.2 million more people in the first 3 months of the year with strong growth across commercial, Medicare and Medicaid. Optum revenues grew 25% to $54 billion.\nCare patterns remain largely consistent with recent trends. For example, inpatient trends continue to reflect the growing long-term movement towards ambulatory sites of care. Today, nearly 2/3 of orthopedic procedures are performed in outpatient and other ambulatory settings compared to under 1/4 just 5 years ago. Physician office activity continues to trend toward historic levels, while a few categories such as pediatrics remain lower. Emergency room visits remain modestly lower than historical levels with consumers seemingly more comfortable with virtual and walk-in care. Cancer and cardiac screenings are occurring at roughly pre-pandemic levels, helped in part by focused efforts to ensure people are obtaining appropriate preventive care. As always, we continue to closely analyze data for indications which could signal increasing acuity but have yet to see those emerge.\nLooking now at the performance of the individual businesses in the first quarter. OptumHealth revenues grew by 38% to $23 billion as we expanded the number of patients served under value-based care arrangements. Revenue per consumer served grew by 34% driven by the increase in value-based care patients and in the levels of care we can offer. OptumInsight revenues grew 40% to $4.5 billion. The revenue backlog reached $30.7 billion, an increase of nearly $8 billion over last year, in part due to the addition of Change Healthcare.\nAs we have discussed before, in the first half, we expect to continue to increase our integration and investment activities, which were a component in the first quarter results and we expect they will accelerate into the second quarter.\nOptumRx revenues grew 15%, surpassing $27 billion, driven by strong double-digit growth across the businesses, including in our community and home delivery pharmacies. Script growth of 26 million over last year was driven by exceptional customer retention as well as new customer adds.\nWe continue to see strong growth in NPS for our specialty businesses, up nearly 10 points since last year. At UnitedHealthcare, revenues of over $70 billion grew 13% with growth in the number of people served across all of our major benefit categories. For example, in commercial, we set out to serve up to 1 million more people this year and are pacing well to that objective given our first quarter performance. Offerings for large employers led the gains as did our newer and more affordable offerings serving both employers and individuals.\nWithin Medicare Advantage, we shared with you in November our intention to add 800,000 to 900,000 new members in this year and we now expect to exceed the upper end of that range. The consistent consumer receptivity to our offerings underscores the product stability and value we provide for seniors.\nMedicaid membership grew 570,000 over the year ago quarter. We continue to have momentum in Medicaid with recent wins in Indiana and Texas. And we are honored to advance our existing service to the people of North Carolina, as the state moves towards expanding managed Medicaid offerings.\nOur capital capacities remain strong. Cash flows from operations in the quarter at $16.3 billion reflected an additional CMS payment. Adjusting for this effect, first quarter cash flows from operations were consistent with our outlook and we continue to track well with our full year view to approach $28 billion, about 1.2x net income.\nIn the quarter, we returned over $3.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and deployed about $8 billion of growth capital to expand our capabilities to serve more people and grow far into the future.\nAs Andrew mentioned, based upon this growth outlook, today, we increased our full year 2023 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $24.50 to $25 per share. We expect the first half, second half earnings progression to be broadly consistent with our longer-term historical patterns with the second half comprising just slightly more than half of the full year.\nNow I'll turn it back to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Philip Witty\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Executive Officer-Optum, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, John. Our comments on this call gives us a flavor of why we're confident in our outlook for the year and our long-term 13% to 16% earnings per share growth target. Our growth is broad-based and it's driven within and increasingly across our businesses, bolstered, as always, by an enterprise focus on execution on behalf of those we serve.\nWith that, operator, let's open it up for questions.

A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.\nHere are some important introductory information.

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. Over the course of the past year, the extraordinary and dedicated people of Optum and UnitedHealthcare delivered strong, well-balanced growth, progress in developing our consumer-orientated capabilities and strengthened the many ways in which we deliver value-based care in multiple settings. Each of the five growth pillars we discussed with you at our November investor conference are powerful sources of opportunities on their own within large and expanding addressable markets. Yet what really unlocks the potential value we can provide to those we serve is the connectivity of capabilities across our enterprise.\nFor example, this year, we expect 4 million people will participate in fully accountable value-based care provided by Optum Health, almost 1.8 million more than we served as we enter 2022. We're achieving this by connecting benefits, care and other services to support our patients. Many of these patients will have a Medicare Advantage plan offered by UnitedHealthcare, or one of the many other payers who are accessing Optum's expertise and capabilities in delivering this kind of comprehensive care. We will serve these patients in clinic settings, in their homes, integrating behavioral care, supported by our data-driven clinical incidents and next best actions, and all coordinated to provide the right care when and where they need it.\nPharmacy is another area in which we are more deeply connecting consumers with our services. We engage 1 million people every day, finding the lowest cost options, managing their specialty drugs, offering vital in-person clinical advice at our community pharmacies, providing complex medication treatments right in their homes, or simplifying access through digital solutions in order to make the process uneventful for them. We believe this connectivity is a path to better outcomes for people and lower costs.\nIt's also driving growth. By the end of 2023, we expect to have more than 750 community pharmacies, nearly 200 more than we had at the beginning of 2020. We continue to see the impact these services have at a very local and personal level, helping providers deliver more complete care and better outcomes including medication adherence rates, which are about 90% compared to the 50% U.S. average. Our pharmacists are able to take the time to get to know their patients' treatment plans and support their medication management, collaborating with other care providers.\nWe're guided in pharmacy by the principle of getting to the lowest cost for patients and clients. A good example, as more biosimilars come to market, we're positioned to offer patients their care providers and payers significantly more choices in how to secure the best prices for the therapies they need. In addition to biosimilars, we're driving affordability and prescription benefits by combining formulary and cash market pricing to ensure consumers will always get the best economics.\nOur life-saving drugs program has made very significant progress since our announcements last year. This program offers $0 out-of-pocket cost to consumers for drugs such as insulin and epinephrine. Our goal has been to make this available throughout the U.S. And as of today, we've been approved in 48 states for our fully insured business. Moreover, 1/4 of our self-funded employers have now chosen to add this offering for their employees, and we expect that number to rise.\nGetting to this point in such a short period of time was only possible through the work not just of our teams, but of state officials and others in the broader health care community and we're grateful for their support.\nLooking to the year ahead, let me focus you on a couple of themes you can expect to hear from us. One is continued scaling of our commitment to American consumers. You should and will have -- who should and will have an increasing influence over their care experience. Through our core innovations, product design, enhanced digital offerings and partnerships such as RVO Health and Walmart, you will see us driving this more broadly across the enterprise, becoming closer to the consumer, helping simplify their experiences and empowering their decision-making with greater transparency speed, convenience and support.\nYou will also hear how we are amplifying our technology capabilities. 2023 will see the emergence of an enhanced OptumInsight, bringing to life the opportunities that the legacy organizations from Optum and change creates, an acceleration of how technology can be used to health care providers and ultimately patients within the overall health system. We start this year well prepared to deliver upon the objectives we shared with you in late November, and with a deep sense of responsibility to do so on behalf of the people we are privileged to serve.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to President and Chief Operating Officer, Dirk McMahon.\n\nDirk C. McMahon\n\nPresident & COO, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated\n\nThank you, Andrew. While the calendar shows we are two weeks into the new year, our team's 2023 started many months ago and, in some cases, years ago. We have been laying the groundwork necessary to execute on our growth strategy and sustain our momentum heading into this year and beyond.\nTo give you a sense of how this develops, I'll step through some of the work that has been [longer to way] to ready our organization to serve even more patients and customers in this new year and provide greater value for consumers across a broad range of initiatives.\nTake the many new patients we will serve under value-based care arrangements in 2023, deepening our presence in existing areas and adding new regions. Our team's preparations are extensive. That's because the transition to fully accountable care is not simply a matter of downloading a new app. The preparations include significant investments in clinical training, technology, network coordination and other activities to make certain we are ready to serve. These critical investments help us support both our current year needs and 9establish foundations for the growth into 2024 and beyond.\nOur ability to serve people effectively has expanded beyond the four walls of the clinic with the rapid development of our in-home clinical capabilities. These services complement our clinic-based and digital offerings and bring high-quality care access to some of the most challenged and often underserved patients in this country.\nFor instance, for value-based patients, our in-home services have reduced hospital visits by 15% versus fee-for-service, delivering comparable health outcomes and achieving an NPS of approximately 80%. Within health benefits, you've heard us discuss how our innovation and commercial products is adding new growth opportunities. One of those is Surest, a unique solution to employers and employees who are looking for first dollar coverage and high transparency into quality and cost. The momentum behind Surest is strong and building. Just two years ago, 1 in 25 national accounts offered Surest as an option to more traditional plans. Thus far in 2023, it is 1 in 9, and we expect it will continue to rise.\nOur offerings for seniors are another area in which we plan, invest and build capabilities to provide new and valuable offerings for an extended period. For example, we continue to expand the range of clinical services we provide via our HouseCalls initiative. In 2023, we will increase the types of vaccinations offered, expand testing services and deploy even more real-time resources to address social determinants of health. Seniors place high value on being able to get care in their home. It comes with an NPS of 75 and is helping to drive improving retention levels as we head into 2023.\nIn addition, our advocacy service solutions help members achieve better health. Our solutions led to a 42% increase in closing gaps in care, up to 15% lower ER visits and an over 10% increase in clinical program enrollment compared to customers who utilize standard offerings.\nTurning to health technology, let me offer a few early observations on our progress and long-term growth opportunities we see in this area. With the completed change health care combination, we are accelerating our investments to bring this vision of a more intelligent and simpler health system to market as rapidly as possible. We will continue to innovate in and deliver the software, data analytics, technology-enabled services, revenue cycle management and advisory services our customers expect. And we are executing on the synergies of this combination with most of the financial benefit coming from complementary growth.\nOptumInsight is uniquely positioned to offer integrated, end-to-end technology analytics and services across the entire health care value chain. Along these lines, we recently reached 2 new comprehensive health system partnerships, with Northern Light Health in Maine and with Owensboro Health in Kentucky. The services we provide typically feature a full breadth of our advanced solutions, including information technology, revenue cycle management, analytics and supply chain tools. The key here is that our comprehensive technology solutions are resonating in the market, and we expect to see increasing momentum across all of OptumInsight as we invest in and finalize our integration activities.\nWith that, now I'll turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\n\nJohn F. Rex\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated\n\nThank you, Dirk. The investments and innovations Andrew and Dirk described and that we shared with you in November, speak to a company that has tremendous growth potential as we head into '23 and well beyond. The opportunities to serve people more deeply are tangible and accelerating, building upon a foundation of strong growth in recent years, including our 2022 performance.\nRevenue in '22 of $324 billion grew by more than $36 billion or 13% over the prior year, with well-balanced double-digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $5.34 grew 19% and brought full year adjusted earnings per share to $22.19, growth of 17%. Our capital capacities remain strong. Cash flow from operations in '22 was $26.2 billion or 1.3x net income. We returned $13 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends, and deployed over $20 billion in growth capital to expand our capabilities for years to come.\nTurning to the performance of our businesses. OptumHealth's revenues grew by 32% in '22 to $71 billion as we expanded the number of patients served under value-based care arrangements by about 1 million. Revenue per consumer grew by 29%, driven by the increase in value-based care patients and in the levels of care we are able to offer.\nConsistent with our comments in November, OptumHealth is off to a strong start in '23 and will organically grow to serve an additional 750,000 value-based patients this year. OptumInsights revenues grew 20% to $14.6 billion in '22. We concluded the year with a revenue backlog of $30 billion, an increase of $7.6 billion over last year. As Dirk noted, we are advancing our investments to more rapidly unlock the positive impact OptumInsight can have for care providers and patients. We expect to make a significant portion of these important investments in the first half of the year.\nOptumRx revenues grew 9%, approaching $100 billion for the year, driven by continued strong sales and the expansion of our pharmacy services businesses. Both customer retention and new customer wins were among the highest OptumRx has ever delivered, laying a strong foundation for continued market-leading growth.\nAt UnitedHealthcare, full year revenues of nearly $250 billion grew 12%. Our strong 2023 Medicare Advantage member outlook is consistent with the objectives we shared with you in November. We expect to serve up to 900,000 more people in '23 across our individual, group and dual special needs offerings, our 8th consecutive year of above-market growth. This consistent performance underscores the product innovation, benefit stability and high-value seniors have come to rely on from us.\nOur Medicaid growth outlook for '23 incorporates an expectation that states will resume eligibility redeterminations early in the second quarter. Our objective is to ensure that people will have continuous access to benefits. And when all redetermination activities are eventually completed, we expect to serve even more people than we do today across our state-based commercial and exchange-based offerings.\nWithin our commercial offerings, we expect to serve about 1 million additional people in 2023. Our new and innovative products continue to gain momentum with employers and their employees, which will lead to increasing growth in this market over the next several years.\nIn sum, while this year is just getting started, the early performance we are seeing across our businesses further validates our confidence in the 2023 growth and performance objectives we shared with you just 6 weeks ago.\nNow I'll turn it back to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Philip Witty\n\nCEO & Director, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated\n\nThanks, John. As we head into 2023, we're determined to build upon the momentum we've just described this morning, further advancing our mission and delivering sustainable earnings growth of 13% to 16% over the long term.\nAnd with that, operator, let's open it up for questions. One per caller, please.",

This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. Federal Securities Laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations.

I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty. Please go ahead.\n\nAndrew Philip Witty\n\nCEO & Director, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated\n\nThank you. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. As we approach the final stretch of 2022, let me start by recognizing our colleagues, the people of Optum and UnitedHealthcare who continue to work diligently day in and day out for those we serve. Their efforts allow us to deliver durable and balanced growth and to increase our 2022 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $21.85 to $22.05 per share.\nAs an enterprise, we remain focused on our mission and on advancing our growth strategies. Our aim is to serve more people through value-based care and expanded health benefits offerings, a robust foundation on which to consistently drive strong growth into 2023 and beyond. Consumers want value, especially in the current economic environment, and that means high quality care that is more accessible, more affordable and more responsive to their individual needs. In the past quarter, we've accelerated efforts to deliver on this critical consumer proposition, launching several initiatives to reach more people in more communities while deepening relationships with those we already serve. For example, in September, we announced a long-term collaboration with Walmart to provide Optum technology and expertise that will enable America's largest retailer to provide value-based care to consumers in its clinics.\nStarting in 2023, we will jointly develop 15 Walmart health clinics in Florida and Georgia and will extend into additional geographies over time. As we expand the collaboration, there will be broad opportunities to address social determinants of health by improving access to benefits such as healthy foods, medications, dental and vision services and more.\nWe also launched a distinctive partnership with Red Ventures, a digital media company connecting tens of millions of consumers each month to its clients' products and services through a broad portfolio of proprietary digital content platforms. This partnership called RVO Health combines Red Ventures popular health and wellness platforms, including health line and health grades, with Optum's consumer marketplace, the Optum Store and the Optum Perks prescription discount card.\nRVO Health will enable us to engage with more than 100 million active monthly visitors seeking the health advice and insights they need introducing them to relevant products and services through a customized end-to-end digital platform. Affordability is an essential component of value in health care, especially when it determines access to the life-saving medicines people need for themselves and their families.\nIn July, we announced 0 consumer cost share on drugs for diabetes, severe allergic reactions and other emergency situations starting in January for those we serve with commercial insured benefits. Now we are working with self-funded employers who are exploring how they can provide these vital medications for 0 co-pay. So far, this benefit will be available to more than 1 million additional people.\nAnd we are actively engaging with many additional employers. We're also improving access to essential medicines for those even without health benefits coverage. For example, Optum Store launched a new partnership with Sanofi to help consumers without insurance obtain insulin for $35 a month, and they will be able to have it delivered to their home.\nTurning to health benefits. Today, nearly half of American seniors are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans compared to about 25% a decade ago. And MA plays a vital role in serving those consumers who are significantly more diverse, have lower incomes and more complex care needs than the average senior. There are compelling reasons why seniors increasingly choose MA.\nThrough Medicare Advantage, people are experiencing better health outcomes than in traditional fee-for-service Medicare across a wide spectrum of measures. For example, MA members with diabetes have over 50% lower rates of any category of complication and over 70% lower rates of serious complication. This is due to our ability to provide deeper, more coordinated levels of care.\nAnd this is accomplished at lower cost. People served by MA spend as much as 40% less compared to those in Medicare Fee-for-Service and this high value for people is delivered at a lower net cost to the government. We are confident our differentiated offerings will once again this year resonate with consumers who are even more focused on affordability, value and simplicity given the rising cost of daily life.\nToday, in The United States, more people than ever have access to health benefits, an important milestone on the path towards universal coverage, an objective we have long supported. Much of this expanded coverage has occurred in Medicaid. Looking to 2023 and given the potential resumption of eligibility redeterminations next year, a high priority for our team is assuring continuity of access and care for those we serve.\nThe initiatives our team is pursuing to help assure continuous coverage include launching direct outreach and partnering with states and community organizations to identify those at risk and help them retain their benefit coverage. Partnering with national retailers and pharmacies to educate consumers about available coverage options and assistance while they are shopping in store and engaging with employers to extend annual enrollment periods and drive education efforts to employees who are eligible for coverage.\nUnderpinning our growing consumer agenda is an ambitious multiyear effort to deepen and expand our enterprise technology capabilities. The recent combination of OptumInsight and Change Healthcare reflects our accelerating efforts to help create more effective and simple experiences for consumers, payers and care providers while lowering costs across the health system.\nI want to formally welcome our newest colleagues, the talented and compassionate team at Change Healthcare, with whom we have just started working to build upon our shared vision for a more effective and adaptive health system for all participants.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to President and Chief Operating Officer, Dirk McMahon.\n\nDirk C. McMahon\n\nPresident & COO, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated\n\nThank you, Andrew. As Andrew just mentioned, we are very excited about the recent combination of Change Healthcare and OptumInsight. With a grand total of 11 days of integration work behind us, I thought I would provide a bit more commentary on how together we can make the health system simpler and more efficient.\nOverall, Change brings a robust transaction network built on strong payer and provider connectivity. Together, our focus areas include: first, improving the quality of health care delivery by offering critical point-of-care insights aligned to evidence-based medical standards within the workflow of physicians. Second, simplifying administration by fully automating claims transactions, including editing in the EDI stream, improving claim accuracy.\nLastly, we are reducing friction in the payment process by providing patient benefits and payment obligations at point of service and applying payment integrity at its upfront. Our teams have started out of the gate working intensively together to make these visions a reality and to create the next era of growth for OptumInsight.\nWe are very confident that our combined capabilities will enable us to better serve all health care constituents. Beyond OptumInsight, as you might imagine, I spend a lot of time engaging customers of all sizes, operating in almost every sector and representing diverse employee populations. Across these customers, no matter the person or the industry, I hear the same consistent message. The need for deeper levels of support and more resources to comprehensively meet health needs in both a traditional but also increasingly focused on behavioral health.\nCompanies want to provide a broader range of resources and deeper levels of support for their employees and their families and the groundwork we have been building is resonating in this rapidly evolving area. Here's what we're doing about it. First, we're tackling access. We have expanded our behavioral health network by 25% over the last couple of years including a growing complement of behavioral clinical practices owned and operated by Optum.\nAnd as many of you know, behavioral health is a 24/7 challenge. So we are continuing to expand our portfolio of digital offerings supporting a range of needs, allowing patients to get resources when they need them. We have also made significant improvements to help consumers access vital information more easily through improved navigation tools, guiding consumers to the appropriate condition-specific level of behavioral health is a challenge we are prioritizing.\nThese new experiences have improved customer satisfaction, and we are getting people to the right care more quickly. Behavioral health plays an integral role of the overall health and well-being of the people we serve. So you will all continue to -- so you will continue to see us increasing access, quality and affordability in this clinically important and sensitive area.\nAnother tenet of our consumer focus is meeting people where they are, which includes expanding our clinical capabilities to care for people, more holistically, in their homes. We know that at home care settings, especially for people with mobility challenges and highly complex health needs can improve outcomes, elevate patient experience and result in better care.\nSo we bring together teams with medical, behavioral and palliative experience in addition to our home infusion capabilities of OptumRx. By doing so, we help patients and their families keep multiple chronic conditions in check while significantly reducing the need for care in acute and post-acute settings, a real positive for them. The expanding clinical breadth and deepening integration of our value-based care offerings are moving us beyond the conscience of traditional clinical settings, creating an opportunity for us to serve more people more effectively.\nWith that, now I'll turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\n\nJohn F. Rex\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated\n\nThank you, Dirk. As those of you listening know well, numbers can tell a story, and the story our numbers tell is one of broad-based growth and substantial near- and long-term potential. So let me walk through some of those numbers with you. In the third quarter, UnitedHealth Group revenues of $81 billion grew 12% or $8.6 billion, highlighted by broad-based double-digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare.\nCare patterns in the quarter remained similar to those of the second quarter, and our planning for next year anticipates care patterns continue to normalize. We're encouraged to see people obtaining preventive screenings at levels broadly consistent with longer-term norms. And we are maintaining our focus on getting people the care they need.\nAnd acuity patterns remain stable, but as always, we are highly respectful of and watchful for evolving medical cost trends. Looking now at the performance of our specific businesses. OptumHealth's third quarter revenue increased 34% year-over-year as revenue per consumer grew 31%. The growth continues to be led by the increasing number of patients served under value-based care relationships and the expanding types of care settings offered by Optum from meeting behavioral needs to comprehensively serving people in their homes, to higher acuity ambulatory surgery.\nOptumInsight's revenue grew 18% in the quarter, led by continued market growth across payer and provider services. And the revenue backlog increased by $1.8 billion year-over-year to $24.1 billion. OptumRx revenue grew 8% reflecting growth in people served and continued expansion of the pharmacy care businesses, including specialty, home delivery and community pharmacies.\nPharmacy care services revenue growth continues to show momentum growing double digits in the quarter compared to the prior year. And new customer sales and retention have been strong. Turning to UnitedHealthcare. Revenue grew by 11% with all businesses contributing. The number of people served domestically by our commercial insured offerings increased by more than 100,000 over the past half year, as we continue to experience strong growth in our newer, more affordable consumer-centric offerings.\nProduct such as Surest, which provides consumers with greater certainty and choice over their health benefits and also our virtual first health offerings. People served by our Medicare Advantage offerings continue to grow strongly, increasing 800,000 so far this year. The recently released 2024 plan year star ratings were consistent with our long-term planning expectations with 81% of our members in 4-star or better plans, a level we expect will rise as plan refinements are finalized. UnitedHealthcare enters 2023 serving more people in 4- and 5-star plans than any other health plan.\nThe number of people we serve through our Medicaid offerings has grown by 350,000 year-to-date. Most recently, we were awarded the opportunity to continue to serve the people of Nebraska in TANF, CHIP and long-term care programs. UnitedHealthcare achieved the highest score both overall and in each of the individual categories, reflecting our ability to deliver differentiated solutions aligned to our state customers' needs.\nAnd we continue to see strength in our dual special needs offerings with exceptional consumer satisfaction, demonstrated by a Net Promoter Score of 80. Our capital capacities remain strong. Year-to-date, adjusted cash flows from operations were $21 billion or 1.3x net income. We ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 38% providing ample ability to continue to further build upon vital capabilities, which benefit both the people we serve and the broader health system.\nAnd we have returned $10.5 billion to shareholders in the first 9 months of the year through dividends and share repurchases. As noted earlier, given the strength of our business performance, this morning, we updated our 2022 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $21.85 to $22.05 per share. So we think these numbers are telling the story of an enterprise striving to conclude a strong 2022, a year broadly featuring diversified growth today and making foundational investments for our long-term future. Now I'll turn it back to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Philip Witty\n\nCEO & Director, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated\n\nThanks, John. As is customary with the close of a third quarter, we will offer early observations about next year while reserving most of this conversation for our November 29 investor conference. Our businesses are growing and operating well with strong momentum and a keen enterprise focus on executing on our strategic growth priorities.\nAmong a few highlights. The Optum Health care delivery businesses are rapidly advancing their value-based capacities, expanding the scope and settings of care offered and creating a long runway for growth. And we see our innovative and consistently highly valued Medicare Advantage plans as well positioned to grow strongly again next year.\nAt this distance, we view a majority of the 2023 analyst estimates as reasonably reflecting performance levels we would expect to offer in November with the current consensus at the top end of our likely initial earnings outlook range. And as you have come to expect, we continue to strive toward our long-term 13% to 16% earnings per share growth goal.\nWe look forward to discussing this with you in much greater detail in person at our investor conference in New York. I hope you're getting a sense of an organization that has long been the case is focused sharply on executing with excellence in all we do, so that we can meet and exceed our commitments to our customers, clinicians, consumers, and the communities we serve and, of course, to our employees and to you, our shareholders.\nWith that, operator, let's open it up for questions, one per caller please.",

A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.\nHere are some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under the U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.\nThis call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the Financial & Earnings Reports section of the company's Investor Relations page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated July 15, 2022, which may be accessed from the Investor Relations page of the company's website.\nI will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty.\n\nAndrew Philip Witty\n\nCEO & Director, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated\n\nKaty, thank you, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us today.\nUnitedHealth Group ended the second half of the year with sustained momentum as we execute on our objective to serve more people more effectively with connected high-quality care. For that, I want to thank our 360,000 colleagues. It's their unwavering commitment to our mission and their hard work and support of the people we serve that makes all of this possible.\nAs a result of the strong performance at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share outlook for the year to a range of $21.40 to $21.90 per share. Comprehensive value-based care is a central theme of our growth strategy, helping more patients and care providers transition from traditional fee-for-service to a value-based orientation. We aim to drive better and more consistent care outcomes at lower overall cost, often for people who are among society's most vulnerable with multiple chronic conditions, limited income and unmet social needs.\nOptum Health and Optum Rx's clinical platforms span a continuum of care settings, from virtual to post-acute, in-clinic and at home, enabling our care teams to meet patients' unique needs by providing personalized connected care. Our approach helps patients stick with their prescribed care programs, allowing them to spend more time in the comfort of their own homes. The high consumer satisfaction with this comprehensive and consumer-focused approach is evidenced, for example, by a Net Promoter Score of 80 for the 1.5 million people served by our Dual Special Needs Plans.\nWe again delivered growth across our health benefits offerings this quarter. As you might expect, right now, our Medicare teams are finalizing offerings for this fall's open enrollment, focused, as always, on delivering more value, stability and predictability for seniors. Throughout the year, we gather extensive consumer broker and market feedback to continually improve our products. Our approach is grounded in providing deep customer engagement, high-touch service and access to the best care.\nThe benefits of this approach are striking. People served by Medicare Advantage spend about 40% less out of pocket than those participating in Fee-for-Service, which translates into savings of about $2,000 each year for seniors, most of whom are on limited income. And compared to traditional Fee-for-Service, Medicare Advantage plans devote up to 30% more in resources to primary care and perform up to 50% more preventative screening and testing services for their seniors. The response among seniors in our plans is positive. Plan satisfaction ratings have risen by 450 basis points over the past 5 years, nearly twice that of the industry.\nConsumer satisfaction is best demonstrated by the almost 3.4 million additional seniors who have chosen our plans over the same period. Meanwhile, in our domestic commercial health benefits business, over the past 12 months, we have grown to serve over 250,000 more people as a result of innovation in and expansion of our products, including our digital first offerings.\nTo continue driving affordability in areas of greatest need, we are announcing today an important initiative from UnitedHealthcare supported by Optum Rx. Starting in 2023, there will be no co-pay , $0 out of pocket for several critical medicines on our preferred drug list for UnitedHealthcare Group fully insured members. Included are medicines such as insulin, epinephrine for severe allergic reactions, and albuterol for acute asthma attacks. While this is an important step for vulnerable people's health, the larger and longer term cost containment of drugs depends upon manufacturers restraining and lowering the list price of their products, which is a fundamental driver of costs. We will continue to use our capabilities to do everything we can to lower out-of-pocket costs for consumers, building on past actions, including point-of-sale discounts.\nStepping back and looking across each of our 5 growth areas, you'll see a common theme: The deepening of our relationships with the consumers served by Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Throughout 2022, we've been rapidly expanding and accelerating investments in capabilities to reach and serve a broader base of consumers ever more effectively. This includes further enhancing our digital experiences to help consumers find trusted, health-related information and drive greater engagement with our direct-to-consumer platforms.\nNow I'd like to turn it over to Dirk McMahon, our President and Chief Operating Officer, to share more about these efforts. Dirk?\n\nDirk C. McMahon\n\nPresident & COO, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated\n\nThank you, Andrew.\nPicking off on Andrew's comments, I want to provide you with a little more color on the progress we have been making on our growth strategies. This progress is evidenced by -- is evidenced in our work to serve more people through value-based arrangements and to deliver better care. We are well along in our goals for the year.\nThis expansion has significant implications for clinical quality and consistency. MA patients in value-based arrangements with Optum Care physicians are more engaged in their care, with adherence to wellness checks running 5 points higher than Medicare Fee-for-Service patients, helping to deliver a nearly 20% lower hospitalization rate. Further, Optum Care COPD patients served in our value-based arrangements had 80% higher medication adherence rates than Medicare Fee-for-Service patients, contributing to about 60% fewer respiratory complications, enabling people to avoid emergency room visits. Clinical results like these are a small part of the track record we have built in delivering value-based care at a substantial scale for years now, and what gives real urgency to our work to expand access to such care.\nWe also remain committed as an organization to improving access by driving down the cost of health care through applied technology. For example, we are investing hundreds of millions of dollars to enhance the technology backbone of health care. Areas such as platform rationalization to reduce unnecessary complexities, greater end-to-end eligibility management for a more seamless customer experience, and a common platform to facilitate a consistent clinical experience for our consumers and providers. These investments will ultimately lead to an enhanced end-to-end service experience, lower overall operating cost and greater value for people we serve.\nA simpler experience is at the center of our work on the integrated consumer card developed by our Optum financial services team. We have seen great consumer response within our initial pilot groups. The simplicity of combining all benefits, even healthy food purchases onto a single widely-accepted card has been a differentiator with consumers. Based on this initial work, we intend to introduce the card to all our individual Medicare Advantage members in 2023.\nAnother key element of our work to improve experience is the optimization of consumer transactions. We know members need and expect timely information at their fingertips, and I'm pleased to report they are responding well to our digital offerings for everything from understanding their coverage to completing a virtual visit. Digital engagement has jumped 170% among Medicare members during the last couple of years.\nLastly, in pharmacy services, we are very focused on improving quality of care and access for consumers by driving pharmacist-led offerings. We are on track to have nearly 700 community pharmacies by the end of the year and continue to increase the integrated community pharmacy footprint in our clinical locations.\nWith that, now I'll turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\n\nJohn F. Rex\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated\n\nThank you, Dirk.\nAs Andrew noted, we entered the second half of this year with strong growth momentum. First half revenues of over $160 billion grew 13% compared to last year. Performance is well balanced, with double-digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare.\nTo begin, let me touch briefly on the care patterns we have observed so far this year. Principally, we have seen what had been a balanced relationship between COVID and non-COVID care activity over the past couple of years diverge modestly, with the latter not returning quite as rapidly with lower levels of COVID care. We also continue to see some variation in underlying care patterns, with certain areas remaining below historical levels. For example, pediatrics and emergency department.\nAnd others coming back more fully, such as the levels at which seniors are obtaining important preventative care. In recent weeks, we are seeing rising COVID-related hospital admissions but with a lower average length of stay compared with earlier periods. As always, we watch closely for longer term health impacts on people due to care, which might have been deferred during earlier periods. Thus far, we are still not seeing patterns, which indicate shifting acuity.\nThere are, of course, many reasonable theories about what is driving the current environment, and they are all no doubt interesting. But here is what we are actually doing. Consistent with the long-standing practice at UnitedHealth Group, our primary intent is to ensure people are getting the care they need and to help them in that process as much as we can. We remain, as always, highly respectful of medical cost trends and how they can evolve rapidly, and we will continue to position our offerings accordingly.\nMoving now to the businesses. Optum Health revenue grew by over $4 billion or 32% in the second quarter. Revenue per consumer increased 30%, led by growth in patients served under value-based arrangements. Earnings from operations rose 24% even as we accelerated investments in our care delivery practices to support value-based expansions. We also saw strong contributions from Optum's ambulatory surgery centers, which continue to advance the scope and complexity of procedures performed in these optimal settings, all while delivering a superior patient and surgeon experience and high-quality clinical outcomes.\nOur centers have nearly tripled the number of high-acuity joint, spine and cardiovascular procedures performed compared to just 2 years ago. Care providers increasingly recognize the benefits these centers offer, and consumers place high value on the care quality and experience, with an NPS consistently in excess of 90.\nOptum Insight revenue grew 11% year-over-year. The revenue backlog was $23.6 billion, growth of $2.3 billion compared to last year. We continue to drive technological advancements, applying artificial intelligence and machine learning more deeply in high-value knowledge-based services, including an expanding suite of information technology and data analytics offerings.\nOptum Rx revenues grew 10% to nearly $25 billion, reflecting continued strong sales results and execution in the core PBM as well as our growth in our pharmacy care services. These vital and expanding care offerings serve and improve the health of people, including in such areas as our high-touch specialty services where we tightly monitor and track the effectiveness of complex treatments.\nTurning to UnitedHealthcare. Revenue grew by a strong $6.6 billion or 12%, with contributions from all our businesses. In our offerings for seniors, we continue to expect to serve up to 800,000 additional people within Medicare Advantage this year. About 3/4 will be in individual and group Medicare Advantage and the remainder in Dual Special Needs Plans. This puts us on track for our seventh consecutive year of share gaining growth in Medicare Advantage.\nPeople served by our Medicaid offerings grew by 180,000 in the second quarter. At this point, we anticipate the impact to Medicaid enrollment as a result of state redetermination activities will be experienced next year. We continue to prepare resources to help people find uninterrupted access to appropriate coverage as this transition occurs.\nWe added 80,000 new people in domestic commercial plans during the quarter. Within that, fully-insured commercial offerings grew by 60,000 from the first quarter of this year, with balanced growth across group and individual fully-insured offerings. Of note, some 90% of the growth within our individual and family plans was among people who chose a plan featuring convenient and cost-effective access to virtual visits.\nOur capital capacities remain strong. Second quarter cash flows from operations were $6.9 billion or 1.3x net income, and we continue to expect full year cash flows of about $24 billion. In the first half of this year, we returned nearly $8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. In June, our Board increased the dividend by 14%, and we deployed more than $7 billion in capital to enhance our care delivery capacities and consumer strategies to improve outcomes and experiences for the people we serve and for the benefit of the broader health system.\nAs noted earlier, based on this growth outlook, today, we increased our adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $21.40 to $21.90 per share.\nNow, I'll turn it back to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Philip Witty\n\nCEO & Director, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated\n\nThanks, John.\nBefore the Q&A, let me underscore a few key points. First, the strong momentum throughout our business. The people we serve are continually seeking value, high-quality care at fair cost, and our colleagues across Optum and UnitedHealthcare are raising the bar every day. You see that manifested in our business performance and the strong growth in our core platforms, double-digit growth across the Benefits businesses, a growing revenue backlog in Optum Insight, robust growth in our pharmacy services and expansion across Optum Health. We see tremendous opportunity ahead, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver our long-term 13% to 16% earnings per share growth objective and further advance our mission to help people live healthier lives and to help make the health system work better for everyone.\nWith that, operator, let's open it up for questions.

Coming into this quarter, we set clear objectives for the year to drive strong execution of our long-term strategy and deliver high-quality diversified growth. pursue excellence in every consumer experience and at every touch point and apply technology to help all stakeholders to improve access, affordability, outcomes and experiences. As our results show, we're delivering on these objectives.\nI would like to start this morning's call by thanking my colleagues, the 350,000 people of Optum and United Healthcare. Their dedicated work gives us the confidence today to increase our 2022 adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $21.20 to $21.70 per share.\nAt our November investor conference, we described 5 key areas to drive our long-term 13% to 16% earnings per share growth rate. In the first area, value-based care delivery. Optum Health continued its robust momentum into the first quarter, characterized by its integrated approach and high clinical quality.\nAfter a strong start to the year, we now expect to add 600,000 patients under value-based arrangements during 2022 compared to our initial estimate of $500,000. Our approach focuses on providing quality care in the setting that makes most sense for the patients we serve. Our pending combination with LHC Group will reinforce our ability to deliver care and support in the home as well as in other ambulatory locations.\nWithin the second growth area, health benefits, we're rapidly advancing the quality, innovation and consumer appeal of our plan offerings and bringing value-based care to scale. In Medicare Advantage, our strategic balance of benefit stability and enhancements once again helped to deliver strong growth. We remain well on track to serve an additional 800,000 people in 2022, consistent with the expectations we set last November.\nIn the commercial benefits market, our innovative offerings such as physician-led and virtual first plans have grown to serve 350,000 more people over the past year. This underscores the consumer appeal for these high-quality primary care-based coverage options. Nearly 90% of newly enrolled people in our individual exchange offerings, selected plans with significant virtual components in the most recent open enrollment period and nearly 30% selected a virtual-first offering. You'll see us expand such offerings as we look forward to 2023.\nIn our third growth area, Health Technology, we continue to execute on the major new health system partnerships initiated last year, including a broad relationship with SSM Health and its 11,000 providers caring for people throughout the Midwest. We are helping our health system partners alleviate administrative burdens and create an operational capacity for these organizations to focus on delivering high-quality patient care and experiences. These partnerships move far beyond traditional revenue cycle management with both clinical and technology features becoming important.\nFourth, our developing efforts in health financial services, streamlining and simplifying payments for providers, payers and consumers while reducing friction and increasing speed and convenience, consider our new integrated consumer card, which we introduced in January. Many people typically have separate cards for clinical care, pharmacy benefits, food assistance programs, fitness, rewards programs and more. We've combined these benefits into a single card vastly simplifying the experience for consumers and providers, and we plan to do even more in the future.\nAnd finally, pharmacy services. The high cost of specialty drugs is one of the most pressing issues for our health plan partners. Drawing upon all of Optum's advanced analytical capabilities, we're collaborating with health plans to provide clinicians access to real-time medical and pharmacy analytics, which are coordinated with a patient-specific benefit plan design, enabling clinicians to determine the most effective and appropriate therapies at the point of care.\nOur initial results are highly positive, helping to lower specialty costs by over 15%. Overall, OptumRx's performance in the quarter, healthy retention rates and strong sales pipeline provide a great foundation for growth. These efforts from expanding in-home and broad value-based care offerings to enhancements to Medicare Advantage to simplifying how to finance care are designed to create greater value for consumers and more broadly, have a profound impact on the lives of families and individuals and communities with all levels of need across America, which is a powerful motivation for all of us at this company each and every day.\nDirk McMahon, our President and Chief Operating Officer, will now share more about these efforts. Dirk?\n\nDirk C. McMahon\n\nPresident & COO, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated\n\nThank you, Andrew. There is no more important aspect of the consumer experience in health care than convenient access to quality care, not theoretical access but care when and where people need it. Testing, for instance, is an area where we see significant opportunity to improve the consumer experience. It can be a burden for people to test for conditions such as colorectal cancer. As a result, too often, people just won't deal with the hassle early-stage condition, and as a result, early-stage conditions go undiagnosed and people don't get the care they need until things get really serious, which is bad for their health and results in unnecessarily higher intensity treatments and costs in the future.\nLike many of you, we have observed more willingness by patients for trial and adoption of in-home testing for many types of chronic conditions. However, it can be challenging for people to first, find test and then make sure the results get back into a doctor's workflow. Patients need to call providers for a prescription, go to disparate locations to pick up the test and then somehow get the piece of paper with a test result into an already busy clinic operation.\nAt UnitedHealthcare, we've introduced an integrated solution that addresses all of the tasks that need to occur sequentially for test results to get into a clinic system. This digitally enabled solution is resulting in nearly 10% increase in people obtaining necessary screening versus a multistep process. We are expanding this vital capability to more people and making additional types of tests available as well.\nAs many of you know, the first quarter tends to be the most impactful in setting us up for operational success for the remainder of the year. The ease of that initial experience for people has a lasting impact on consumer and customer perceptions and buying decisions, not just for the next 3 months, but often for years to come. So we thought it would be timely and helpful to provide a bit of a performance report card for the quarter. A short version, this is where we owe a great thank you to the people of Optum and UnitedHealthcare.\nPerhaps nowhere was this more apparent than in the onboarding of the many new people served under value-based arrangements within OptumHealth. Investing in the preparation of systems and training in physicians and staff was critical in laying the groundwork to provide high-quality care for these new patients and expanding into new geographies.\nFor example, in Ohio and New York, we are observing early improvements in post-acute trends such as skilled nursing facility admits declining 25% in just the first quarter of operation. It's a testament to the deep integration of our post-acute capabilities for transitioning patients to the most appropriate setting for their needs as well as a patient-centric orientation of our local care delivery organizations and their vigilance on care continuity.\nAt UnitedHealthcare, our digital investments are continuing to serve our care providers and helping advance our efforts to move to a paperless experience. In the first quarter, visits to our digital portal continued to increase, while provider support costs declined about 12% from historical averages. Importantly, we have driven a 38% increase in providers using digital documents instead of paper in just this first quarter compared to last year.\nWe expect the efforts we have taken in this quarter will save 80 tonnes of paper over the next 5 years. Before handing off to John, let me briefly -- let me turn briefly to our pending combination with Change Healthcare. By now, it should be clear we are deeply committed to helping achieve a simpler, more intelligent an adaptive health system for patients, payers and providers. The combination of Optum and Change Healthcare will connect and simplify core clinical, administrative and payment processes, health care providers and payers depend on to serve patients.\nIncreasing efficiency and reducing friction will benefit the entire health system, resulting in lower costs and a better experience for all stakeholders. Our extended agreement with Change Healthcare reflects our firm belief in the potential benefits of this combination to improve health care and in our ability to successfully overcome the challenge to this merger.\nWith that, now I'll turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\n\nJohn F. Rex\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated\n\nThank you, Dirk, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter 2022 performance positions us well to deliver on our full year financial and growth objectives. Revenues grew by $10 billion or 14% to $80 billion over the year ago first quarter, with double-digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. This strong diversified growth was largely organic with balanced contributions from across both our services and benefits operating platforms. Compared to a year ago, we are adding over 1 million more people to OptumHealth, supporting 30% more patients in value-based relationships, providing over 20 million more prescriptions and serving 1.5 million more people across our health benefit offerings.\nI'll start by providing a little color on care patterns over the course of the quarter and then turn to our individual businesses. As you'd expect, there was considerable variation in care patterns due to the COVID incidence peak early in the quarter. For example, in January, we had about 40,000 COVID-related hospitalizations, the highest of any month since the onset of the pandemic. By March, these had declined to around 2,000.\nOverall, care in the quarter was about at baseline levels, though we observe pockets that are modestly below historical baseline, such as emergency department and pediatric visits. However, we are not assuming this is a permanent shift in consumer behavior.\nAs it relates to potential longer-term health impacts on people due to care which was deferred during the height of the pandemic, thus far, we are not seeing the increasing acuity that many expected. For example, initial oncology-related diagnoses levels are consistent with historical averages. Of course, our core focus remains on getting people the care they need, and we are encouraged that critical screens are occuring at normalized levels.\nMoving now to business performance. OptumHealth revenue grew 34% in the first quarter, and earnings from operations rose over 40%. Revenue per consumer grew 33%. This was driven primarily by the increasing number of patients served under value-based arrangements. Continued augmentation of our value-based care offerings, such as expanding digital care and our services into the home, the opportunity to serve more people, much more broadly and deeply. And we expect to grow strongly for years to come.\nOptumInsight revenue grew 13% year-over-year. The revenue backlog was $22.8 billion, growth of $2 billion or 10% over the prior year. Our expanding health system partnerships are contributing to this growth, and we expect the number and breadth of these partnerships to continue to grow. OptumRx revenues grew 11% to $24 billion, reflecting the strength of new business relationships secured over the course of last year. We typically incur significant investments in the early months of these expansions to assure strong performance and value for our customers.\nTurning to UnitedHealthcare. Revenue growth of 14% was driven across the businesses. Our Medicare Advantage offerings remain on track to add up to 800,000 people. About 3/4 will be an individual and group Medicare Advantage and the remainder in dual special needs plans. New seniors aging into Medicare are increasingly selecting Medicare Advantage based on the value it offers and the 5-star quality plan performance we achieved this year enables us to enroll people in our plan offerings through the year.\nPeople served by our Medicaid offerings grew by over 150,000 in the first quarter and is now approaching $8 million. Our growth outlook for the remainder of the year continues to incorporate an expectation that states will resume eligibility redeterminations when the public health emergency lapses, resulting in modest net attrition.\nFirst quarter commercial enrollment was in line with our expectations. The decline in people served under fee-based arrangements was driven by 3 previously known customer transitions, which were offset by core growth. We see the number of people served overall increasing as we progress through '22, driven by the strong market response to our more recently introduced innovative offerings as well as the continued recovery in the total number of people covered by employer health benefits, which typically lags reported job growth.\nOur capital capacities remain strong. First quarter cash flows from operations of $5.3 billion or 1x net income were consistent with our expectations. And we continue to expect full year cash flows of about $24 billion or 1.2x net income. We returned nearly $4 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases, and ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 38%.\nAnd as we look toward completing both the LHC and change combinations this year, we will continue to have ample capacities to expand upon the ways we can serve people and help them to live healthier lives. As noted earlier, based on this growth outlook, today, we increased our adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $2.20 to $21.70 per share. And we continue to expect the seasonal pattern to be more consistent with our historical experience with just under 50% of the full year earnings in the first half. Now I'll turn it back to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Philip Witty\n\nCEO & Director, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated\n\nThank you, John. I hope that you will recognize the consistent themes that we laid out last year as our guidepost for sustainable growth. Our focus on execution and continuous improvement across our businesses is a characteristic that we're going to sustain as we build upon this strong start to 2022. And with that, operator, let's open it up for questions. One per caller, please.",

A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.\nHere are some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.\nThis call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial and earnings reports section of the company's Investor Relations page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated January 19, 2022, which may be accessed from the Investor Relations page of the company's website.\nI will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty.\n\nAndrew Philip Witty\n\nCEO & Director, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated\n\nThank you. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. I'd like to start by recognizing our colleagues, the people of Optum and UnitedHealthcare for delivering strong results throughout 2021 and creating the momentum that is carrying us through as we enter into this year. For example, performance in two key elements of our growth strategy, accelerating the transition of patients to Optum-led value-based care and strong United Healthcare growth in serving Medicare Advantage consumers are both tracking well with the expectations we shared with you at our recent investor conference. These, and the broader performance across the enterprise, confirm our comfort in our ability to advance our stated growth strategies and to support our long-term 13% to 16% EPS growth rate.\nWhen you look back at the prevailing themes for 2021, you see a story of accelerating growth, strong collaboration between Optum and UnitedHealthcare and with our many external partners helped us grow in serving both commercial and government markets, unlock new innovation, introduce integrated products and services to the marketplace and significantly increase the number of people benefiting from value-based models of care.\nLast year, we leveraged our technology capabilities to help physician and hospital systems better serve their patients and communities. And we sharpened our focus on the consumer working to elevate and improve the end-to-end experience. Taken together, these efforts helped us add more than $30 billion in revenue for the year, about $10 billion above our initial outlook.\nAnd you should expect similar growth in the year ahead. We see an even greater demand for integration to bring together the fragmented pieces of the health system, to harness the tremendous innovation occurring in the marketplace, to help better align the incentives for providers, payers and consumers and to organize the system around value. A health care system that is more connected, more informed, more human and more responsive to every person's unique needs.\nAt our investor conference, we shared five key areas for growth and for differentiated experiences across our portfolio. These growth opportunities will guide our strategy this year and for many years to come. First is care delivery. More specifically, value-based care. For UnitedHealth Group, this is more than a primary care strategy. It's a comprehensive clinical strategy encompassing our growing behavioral, home, ambulatory and virtual care capabilities.\nOur second growth area is health benefits, advancing the quality, innovation and consumer appeal of our benefit offerings and bringing our value-based strategy to life. We enter '22 having generated strong consumer growth in Medicare Advantage and saw further progress in Medicaid and growing momentum in our commercial business.\nNext, health technology. Our major partnerships across the country help health systems improve their performance and returns, all to better support their missions. We're energized by the potential to bring these comprehensive tailored solutions to a greater number of system partners in 2022 and beyond.\nFourth, health financial services, vastly improved in the health payment sector, streamlining and simplifying payments for providers, payers and consumers while reducing friction and increasing speed and convenience.\nAnd finally, pharmacy services, where people interact most often with the health care system. We can better use the significant breadth, volume and value of our foundational pharmacy services and data capabilities and integrate our medical pharmacy and behavioral capabilities. All of this to provide whole person care, support the discovery of new drugs and treatments and support value-based models of care.\nIn sum, we enter 2022 with heightened confidence in our ability to execute upon the objectives we set forth in late November.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to President and Chief Operating Officer, Dirk McMahon.\n\nDirk C. McMahon\n\nPresident & COO, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated\n\nThank you, Andrew. I thought I would take a few minutes providing you with some additional details on our first growth priority, value-based care. How we have prepared for it, the investments we have made and how we see it working in the near future. This has been something we have been working on and building over the course of a decade. .\nFor example, there was significant operational groundwork and investment that went into supporting the 0.5 million new patients for whom OptumHealth will become accountable in 2022. Successful execution requires a lot of detailed planning, investing and building. It has become a distinctive competency of our enterprise, which we can now increasingly apply at scale.\nSo what does it take to prepare for moving to a fully accountable arrangement? Investments can be significant. As an example, in '21, we incurred over $100 million in preparation expense. Within this, there are three major work streams involved: Clinical training and staff preparation, technology and data enhancement, and third, is network coordination.\nThe first work stream focuses on physician education. It begins well more than a year prior. It's important to -- the resources and knowledge for physicians to begin approaching their patients differently. They engage in their patient's whole help well ahead of taking on greater accountability. We find it to be an essential and sometimes complex shift in what our long-held fee-for-service practices. Beyond education, we ramp up our capacity in the form of physicians, nurses and other clinicians to meet the requirements of our business.\nThe second area focuses on the technology systems and information needed to support patient care and effective clinical management. This includes things like patient portals and utilization management systems as well as reporting systems for teams to effectively manage.\nFinally, is the planning and network coordination work to support clinical oversight beyond primary care and ensure true continuity of care. This planning and coordination includes initiatives such as identifying the patients most in need and ensuring a seamless transition to high-touch clinical care services that improve health and quickly pairing patients with a personal care navigator to assist in supporting complex health needs, appointment scheduling and timely medication support on day 1.\nThese foundational preparations and investments have been critical in creating strong results across a variety of geographies and practices we have transitioned. We expect this expertise will serve us well as we transition even larger groups of patients in the years to come.\nBefore handing it over to John, I'd like to update you on how COVID has impacted our operations. Like other businesses, we have experienced moderately higher levels of attrition and more unplanned absences. We had prepared for this situation through increased recruiting capacity as well as meaningfully upgraded digital capabilities to improve customer experience and reduce call volumes. As a result, in the first 2 weeks of '22, traditionally, our most demanding period, we were able to service the needs of our patients and customers.\nAt the same time, we responded swiftly to the federal mandate for cash-free COVID test for consumers, a highly complex undertaking. With 4 days notice, UnitedHealthcare created a customer digital experience for ease of reimbursement and established a partnership with Walmart and now Rite Aid that eliminates cash outlays by consumers at point of purchase. We expect more partnerships in the days ahead.\nAs we look forward, we believe we have the right capacity in place to execute our business priorities and meet our customers' expectations.\nWith that, now I'll turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\n\nJohn F. Rex\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated\n\nThank you, Dirk, and Happy New Year, everyone. I'll start by expanding a bit on Dirk's comments on the COVID impacts we're seeing. In the most recent weeks, inpatient hospitalization levels for our members are similar to the January 2021 levels, even with national COVID case rates about 4x higher. For those people needing inpatient care, severity is seemingly lower as we are seeing shorter lengths of stay compared to that earlier period. .\nAt the same time, we are observing familiar correlations of care activity patterns to other periods of elevated infection rates experienced over the past 2 years. For example, in these early weeks of January, we are seeing slowing in primary care, elective visit and procedural volumes. Activity over the past several weeks shows primary care visits having declined about 10% and an even higher rate of decline in specialist visits. As always, our prime focus is on helping people get the care they need when they need it.\nMoving now to our specific business performance. OptumHealth's revenue per consumer grew by over 30% in '21, driven by the increasing number of our patients served under value-based arrangements. Consistent with the expectations we shared in late November, we had a strong start to the year and continue to expect to add 500,000 new patients in accountable value-based relationships, benefiting from the groundwork laid over the past many years.\nOptumInsight earnings grew 25% in '21, with operating margins approaching 28% for the year. We ended the year with a revenue backlog of $22.4 billion, an increase of $2.2 billion over the prior year. Our expanding relationships serving health systems has been a key factor driving this growth, and we expect these partnerships to continue to grow in '22 and beyond.\nOptumRx earnings grew 6% for the year, driven by the continued expansion of our pharmacy services businesses, supply chain initiatives and strong cost management activity and benefiting from strong customer retention. In addition, we continue to see the impact of OptumRx' movement to a higher value pharmacy care and specialty services orientation.\nTurning to UnitedHealthcare. Full year revenues of $223 billion grew 11%. As noted, our 2022 Medicare Advantage member growth outlook is very positive and consistent with the objectives we established at our November investor conference. Within the up to 800,000 new members we will serve in '22, about 3/4 will be in individual and group Medicare Advantage and the remainder in dual special needs plans. And given the steady strides we've made in quality performance, we have the opportunity to enroll people in our newly rated 5-star plans throughout the entirety of this year.\nOur Medicaid membership outlook for '22 continues to incorporate an expectation that states resume eligibility redeterminations, resulting in modest net attrition. In January, we began serving the citizens of Minnesota and continue to support the Missouri expansion this year as well as renewed relationships with Ohio, Tennessee and Nevada. Over the course of the year, we will look to continue to expand upon the nearly 8 million individuals we serve across 31 states.\nWe concluded '21 with commercial membership, about 200,000 people ahead of the original outlook provided. Creating this momentum is the strong response we are seeing to the new innovative products you have heard us discuss. Products such as Navigate Now, which use the Optum virtual network as a first option.\nOur capital capacities remain strong. Full year '21 cash flow from operations was $22.3 billion or 1.3x net income, about $2 billion above the initial outlook we shared a year ago. We continue to expect our 2022 cash flow to approach $24 billion, about 1.2x net income. And we ended '21 with a debt-to-total capital ratio of 38%. These ample capital capacities allow us to continue to accelerate our investments, while remaining committed to an advancing shareholder dividend and supporting our expected repurchase of between $5 billion and $6 billion of stock in '22.\nOur 2022 adjusted earnings per share outlook of $21.10 to $21.60 is consistent with the view we offered 7 weeks ago. From this distance in contrast to the past 2 years, we expect the seasonal pattern to be more consistent with our historical experience with just under 50% of full year earnings in the first half and the first 2 quarters comparably even.\nNow I'll turn it back to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Philip Witty\n\nCEO & Director, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated\n\nBefore we transition to the Q&A portion of the call, I hope you've already taken away the strong sense of confidence John, Dirk and I share in the growth potential of this company, rooted in the growing number of people we're serving in value-based models, the depth of relationships we're building with local health systems, our pharmacy capabilities and the innovation and consumer focus that's driving growth across our government programs, individual and commercial businesses. .\nAs demand for innovation and integrated solutions, products and services only continues to grow, we've never been in a better position to help bring together the fragmented pieces of health care and create more value for the people we try to serve.\nWith that, operator, let's open it up for questions. One per caller, please.",

I would like to introduce your speaker, Robert Mitchell. Please go ahead.\n\nRobert Mitchell\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Our third quarter 2025 results, news release, MD&A, financial statements and detailed supplemental investor information were posted on our website earlier this morning. On our call today, we'll begin with remarks by Darren and Doug. For the Q&A portion, we will be joined by Zainul, Navin, Jason, Tobias, Hesham. Briefly prepared remarks, slides and answers to questions contain forward-looking statements. Actual results could vary from these statements. The assumptions on which they are based and material risks that could cause them to differ are outlined in our public filings with securities commissions in Canada and the U.S. including in our third quarter 2025 and our annual 2024 MD&A. With that, over to you, Darren.\n\nDarren Entwistle\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Robbie, and hello, everyone. In the third quarter of 2025, TELUS delivered another period of strong customer growth and financial performance powered by our team's relentless focus on operational excellence. Our results showcase the compelling value of our comprehensive bundled services across mobile and home solutions. And we're doing that in a complementary fashion with the strategic rollout of TELUS PureFibre connectivity to homes and businesses nationwide. We are delivering far more than connectivity We're empowering Canadians with transformative digital experiences, including AI-powered smart home energy solutions, including cutting-edge tech-enabled health care and well-being services and as well comprehensive security offerings at the dispositions of our clients. These offerings are revolutionizing productivity and enhancing quality of life for our customers.\nIndeed, this quarter, we achieved an industry-best 288,000 total mobile and fixed customer additions. A close to 21 million customer connections reflects an industry-leading 5% growth as compared to the same period a year ago. Furthermore, our sustained focus on delivering exceptional client experiences continues to drive leading customer loyalty metrics. This was demonstrated by our industry-best postpaid mobile phone churn of 0.91% this quarter as we progress through our 12th consecutive year below the 1% level, truly a hallmark of this organization and our culture.\nLooking at our financial results, we achieved solid and resilient TTEC EBITDA growth of 3%. In mobile, we drove healthy phone net additions of 82,000 and leading connected device net additions of $169,000. These results were supported by our ongoing focus on profitable margin-accretive customer growth. This is once again evidenced by our consistent industry-leading customer lifetime revenue underpinned by our industry best churn result, which remains clearly the hallmark of the TELUS organization and the financial results that we derive from it.\nLet's turn now and take a look at wireline. TELUS delivered another quarter of industry-leading total fixed customer additions. Indeed, we have consistently delivered positive wireline net additions every year since the third quarter of 2010. This is a remarkable 15-year track record in that regard. This included an industry-best 40,000 Internet net additions underpinned by our leading PureFibre offering. Our consistent strategy of leveraging our superior and growing portfolio of bundled products and services on a national basis continues to differentiate us from the competition in a way that is relevant to customers.\nTurning to TELUS Health. We continue to execute against our global growth strategy, generating revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth of 18% and 24%, respectively. Moreover, we've now extended our reach to over 160 million lives covered on a worldwide basis. This global scale of our TELUS Health footprint stems from a variety of factors, including smart, targeted strategic investments, it comes from continuous product innovation with a digital and AI thesis, it comes from broadening our sales channels with strong cross-selling execution that is paying off for us, and it comes from disciplined cost optimization through technology integration and synergy realization.\nImportantly, these factors are all solidly anchored in our customers' first promise. Our LifeWorks integration has now delivered $417 million in combined annualized synergies, $329 million from cost efficiencies and $88 million from successful cross-selling strategies. Notably, this is nearly 3x above our initial target of $150 million that we set when we first acquired LifeWorks in September of 2022.\nAcross our B2B portfolio, we have a potent story of differentiation and diversification. We are the market leader in Canada in respect of IoT, private wireless networking and 5G solutions. Moreover, we have a leading cybersecurity practice that is at the forefront of how AI is changing the cyber threat and cyber protection landscape.\nOver the years, through a thoughtful and cohesive data-centric strategy, we have significantly and successfully built high-value diversified lines of business. These global business verticals include TELUS Health, TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods and of course, TELUS Digital. This is enabled business resiliency through the diversified portfolio approach whilst providing global scale and diverse sources of revenue and EBITDA.\nNotably, at the end of October, we completed the acquisition of TELUS Digital, making a significant upward move on our data and AI competency set and this marks a significant milestone in the strategic evolution of our organization. We expect this integration to generate approximately $150 million to $200 million in annualized cash synergies and will deliver the $150 million within the 2026 financial year, and that will be driven predominantly through operational efficiencies.\nLet's make sure we can do here what we did on the LifeWorks synergy realization front. The synergies coming from the privatization of TELUS Digital include accelerated digital and AI transformation, they include smart business simplification strategies, and they include strategic cross-promotion of our industry-leading product portfolio and services. This will further strengthen our financial performance and yield significant shareholder value creation.\nOur well-established AI-enabling capabilities across TELUS will continue to be an integral part of our business and increasingly critical to our success. These capabilities are driving materially better outcomes within our organization and in turn, TELUS can be leveraged as an innovation lab as a product creator as a testimonial to commercialize these capabilities to support our external customers on their own AI journey to win in their respective markets. Indeed, the opportunity at TELUS is substantial. Combined across TELUS, our AI-enabling capabilities are approaching $800 million in revenue in 2025. This is expected to increase to approximately $2 billion by 2028, representing an annualized growth rate north of 30%. Notably, this is composed of solely external client revenue, and it excludes other parts of our global B2B portfolio such as health and agriculture and consumer goods.\nSupporting this growth, our 4,000 dedicated professionals and AI engineers delivering digital products and solutions that help clients transform their businesses and to do that transformation at scale. One component of this growth is our September launch of Canada's first sovereign AI factory. This firmly establishes TELUS' leadership position in this space as we have ready. Today, the infrastructure and compute ecosystem to help Canadian businesses broadly deploy AI.\nWe are the first North American service provider to become an official NVIDIA cloud partner, utilizing our state-of-the-art data centers to support customers and partners such as OpenText, League, EY, Accenture and Rail town, to name but a few, who immediately benefit from our sovereign AI compute solutions. TELUS is providing the secure sovereign foundation or country needs to create made in Canada solutions to accelerate growth and to advance our competitiveness in the global digital economy for generations to come.\nTo wrap up, our Q3 performance reflects the strength of our core operations and the power of our differentiated strategy. The liability of our results demonstrates our team's dedication to delivering superior customer experiences, across our industry-leading wireless and pure fiber broadband infrastructure and technology. Our substantial network investments enable positive social and economic outcomes for Canadian communities nationwide, while continuously enhancing our operational performance, our financial results and our customer satisfaction.\nMoreover, these network investments are powering Canada's digital sovereignty through our pioneering and leading AI infrastructure and technology. And as we look ahead, we are positioned for sustained success, underpinned by ongoing EBITDA expansion and disciplined capital deployment. But together, generates substantial free cash flow growth for our organization and our investors. Our strong financial foundation supports our industry-leading dividend growth program where today, we increased our quarterly dividend at a moderated rate of 4% to $41.84. This is reflective of our ongoing commitment to delivering sustainable shareholder returns.\nFurthermore, we continue to progress considerable deleveraging initiatives. Notably, we remain on track to achieve our leverage target of 3x by 2027, whilst at the same time, stepping down and importantly, eliminating our discount dividend reinvestment plan. In September, we closed our transaction with La Caisse establishing Terrion as Canada's largest dedicated wireless tower operator. This unique partnership [ would enhance ] wireless connectivity for Canadians whilst unlocking significant value for TELUS shareholders by strengthening our balance sheet, accelerating our deleveraging program and providing another growth vector for TELUS to leverage.\nThe team is working hard to quickly operationalize Terrion, which already has 3,000 wireless sites across the country. Moreover, it's begun construction of its first multi-carrier tower in the Nimo BC with more planned in the months to come. Finally, in closing, with Remembrance Day approaching, I would like to offer, on behalf of the entire TELUS organization, my heartfelt gratitude to our veterans here in Canada and around the globe. These brave individuals, including my own father Desmond, who served with the Royal Canadian Navy in the Second World War, demonstrate immense courage to preserve the rights and freedoms of all Canadians. I hope you join me and [indiscernible] copy as we pay tribute to those who serve and who continue to serve so that we and our future generations can enjoy a better life. And on that note, I'll turn the call over to Uncle Doug.\n\nDouglas French\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Darren, and hello, everyone. Mobile network decreased slightly, consistent with the second quarter at 0.6%. This performance reflects mobile phone and connected device subscriber growth, a 9% increase in IoT revenue, offset by lower mobile home revenue -- or ARPU, sorry, ARPU continues to improve, declining 2.8% in the quarter, a 50 basis point improvement sequentially. We continue to see improvements quarter-over-quarter across new activations, rate plan changes and customer renewals, reflecting our ongoing efforts to mitigate network revenue pressures. Fixed data revenue grew 1% year-over-year, making us the only provider to report positive growth and making our 19th quarter of that positive -- positivity.\nWithin Consumer, data revenue increased by 4%, driven by a 6% increase in residential Internet revenue, reflecting continued customer growth and higher ARPU alongside higher security and automation revenue. In business, fixed data decline with variability from year-over-year events and customer contract changes. This was primarily offset -- this was partially offset by continued small -- growth in small and medium businesses leveraging our differentiated and diversified portfolio of solutions. TTech adjusted EBITDA, excluding Health increased by 2%, alongside a margin expansion of 210 basis points to 43.4%. These results were driven by our consistent emphasis on profitable growth alongside our ongoing focus on cost reduction and our increased adoption of TELUS Digital solutions, resulting in meaningful competitive benefits.\nIn Telus Health, operating revenues and adjusted EBITDA grew by 18% and 24%. This growth was driven by global business acquisitions, including Workplace Options as well as organic growth in payer and provider solutions, reflecting strong performance in collaborative health records and recurring revenue in electronic medical records and virtual pharmacy solutions. TELUS Health adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 60 basis points to 17.1%, slightly lower than Q2 as we begin post acquisition and integration work associated with Workplace Options.\nLooking at TELUS Digital segment. Operating revenue grew 5% with solid performance across many industry verticals. Across the service lines, we continue to see strong performance in our AI and digital solutions. However, pressures on TELUS Digital's profitability persists with adjusted EBITDA margin at 11.1% for the third quarter. We remain focused on mitigating the operating margin pressures while making targeted investments in customer quality and planned initiatives to transform our operations through tech enablement and greater efficiencies globally.\nNear-term synergies of the TELUS Digital privatization include the elimination of public company costs, lowering borrowing costs as we leverage TELUS' stronger credit position and the operational efficiencies as referred by Darren. These digital -- TELUS Digital remain a segment presented in our financial statements to the end of 2025. We'll review TELUS Digital as a segment and provide more update when we release our Q2 results in February of 2026.\nOn a consolidated basis, net income in the quarter of $431 million and EPS of $0.32 were higher by 68% primarily driven by the gain on the purchase of long-term debt in respect of our tender process that closed in July 2025. On an adjusted basis, net income of $370 million decreased by 10%, while EPS of $0.24 was down 14%. Capital expenditures, excluding real estate, declined by $16 million or 2%, driven primarily by the elimination of certain -- by the completion of certain projects for wireless and fiber networks in addition to our continued investments in AI.\nOverall, capital intensity was 12%. That was an improvement from 13% in the prior year and continues to lead the industry. Free cash flow of $611 million increased by 8% compared to the same period a year ago, driven by TTech EBITDA growth, lower capital expenditures and lower contracted wireless volumes.\nLooking at our guidance for 2025, our target for TTech operating revenue, including our Health segment, is expected to be at the lower end of our target range of 2% to 4%, with variability on mobile handset equipment revenue as we go into a high-volume fourth quarter. Importantly, all other targets remain unchanged. These targets demonstrate the resilience of our business and the effectiveness of our operational execution.\nFollowing TELUS Digital's completion of privatization, we began to execute our integration plan. The guidance that we previously issued for TELUS Digital will no longer be relevant and will not be updated for the rest of the year.\nTurning to our balance sheet. The average term to maturity of our long-term debt stands a little over 13 years and our weighted average cost of capital is 4.61%. Our leverage ratio has improved to 3.5x, a decrease of 20 basis points sequentially from the second quarter of 2025. The improvement was driven by the cash received as a result of our partner, on Terrion, and as we -- and we did the repayment of the TELUS Digital credit facility in the third quarter. We anticipate leverage in the fourth quarter to increase slightly as we pay for the TELUS digitization -- TELUS Digital privatization. We remain on track to deliver our leverage ratio of approximately 3x by the end of 2027, while thoughtfully stepping down our discount on our dividend reinvestment program beginning in 2026 with a full removal by the end of '27.\nOur financial position will continue to strengthen and will continue to drive shareholder value throughout 2025 and beyond. We'll continue to focus on EBITDA growth, moderating capital intensity as we progress to our target of 10%, robust free cash flow generation and our active asset monetization program including securing partners when appropriate for TELUS Health and TELUS Agriculture. With that, Robert, back to you.\n\nRobert Mitchell\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Doug. Karl, we are ready for questions, please.",

I would like to introduce your speaker, Mr. Robert Mitchell. Please go ahead.\n\nRobert Mitchell\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nHello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Our second quarter 2025 results, news release, MD&A, financial statements and detailed supplemental investor information were posted to our website earlier this morning.\nOn our call today, we will begin with remarks by Darren and Doug. For the Q&A portion, we will be joined by Zainul, Navin and Tobias.\nBriefly, prepared remarks, slides and answers to questions contain forward-looking statements. Actual results could vary from these statements. The assumptions on which they are based and the material risks that could cause them to differ are outlined in our public filings with the securities commissions in Canada and the U.S., including our second quarter 2025 and our annual 2024 MD&A.\nAnd with that, over to you, Darren.\n\nDarren Entwistle\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Mitchell, and hello, everyone. In the second quarter, our team's commitment to operational excellence empowered TELUS to deliver another quarter of industry-leading customer growth and strong financial performance. These results demonstrate the strength of our leading portfolio of bundled offerings across mobile and home and the strategic expansion of TELUS PureFibre connectivity to homes and businesses, inclusive of Ontario and Quebec. We're delivering much more than just affordable Internet. We are providing Canadians with differentiated and unique competitive services, including AI-fueled smart home energy management, next-generation health care, affordable innovative security and exciting entertainment solutions.\nOur investment in Canada will be augmented by our recently announced $2 billion investment to expand broadband services in Ontario and Quebec. This will allow TELUS to prudently progress national scale through smart broadband network builds and drive product innovation, competition, investment and affordability in Canada. The CRTC's wholesale fiber decision mirrors the access granted to Eastern-based companies in the West and as well the wholesale access that TELUS is providing the cable companies on our broadband wireless network in Ontario and Quebec.\nRelative to our peers, TELUS stands out as the company committing to bold future-focused infrastructure investments, reflecting our confidence in the Canadian market over the longer term and our strategy of bundling wireless and wireline broadband services. Importantly, our track record aligns with the federal government's goals of unlocking private investment, building one Canadian economy by removing interprovincial barriers, addressing cost of living challenges for families, diversifying Canada's economy through driving innovation of Canadian IP and ensuring Canada is on the leading edge of AI, digital innovation and smart sustainability.\nTurning back to our strong second quarter performance. We achieved total mobile and fixed customer growth of 198,000 in the quarter. This was driven by mobile phone and connected device additions of 167,000 alongside fixed customer additions of 31,000. The dedication of our team in delivering customer service excellence contributed to continued strong loyalty results once again this quarter. Notably, postpaid mobile phone churn was 0.9%, consistent with Q2 of last year as we realized our 12th consecutive year below the 1% level.\nLooking at our financial results, we achieved solid and resilient TTech EBITDA growth, including TELUS Health of 4%, which is consistent with our Q1 results. In mobile, we drove phone net additions of 55,000 and connected device net additions of 112,000. These results were supported by our ongoing focus on economic margin-accretive customer growth. This is evidenced by our consistent industry-leading lifetime revenue underpinned by our industry best churn result, which, of course, is the hallmark of our organization.\nLet's turn now and take a look at our wireline business. TELUS delivered another quarter of industry-leading total fixed customer additions. Indeed, we were the only company within the industry to deliver positive net additions within the wireline sector. This included 27,000 Internet net additions alongside industry best fixed data services revenue growth of 73%. This is underpinned by our leading PureFibre offering and our consistent strategy of leveraging our superior portfolio of bundled products and services on a national basis that differentiate us meaningfully from the competition in a way that matters to customers.\nFurthermore, TELUS Health continues to demonstrate strong operating momentum globally, achieving operating revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth of 16% and 29%, respectively, and Doug will comment shortly on what the EBITDA growth looks like on a normalized basis and how consistent that growth has been historically.\nMoreover, the team drove a very strong year-over-year increase in global lives covered to almost $160 million, inclusive of workplace options alongside continued organic growth expansion. These results were fueled by product enhancements, expanded sales channels, including cross-selling and effective cost management through technology and synergy optimization. Our team's deeply rooted dedication to putting customers first serves as the foundation for this success, and we're building on it.\nSince acquiring LifeWorks, we've realized $400 million in combined annualized synergies. You may recollect that our original target in this regard was $150 million to $200 million. This $400 million includes $322 million from cost efficiencies and $78 million from successful cross-selling strategies that are continuing to grow markedly. We remain on track to meet our goal of $427 million by the end of 2025, and we will augment this materially with Workplace Options global synergies that are on the come. We are excited to accelerate TELUS Health's growth momentum through 2025 and well beyond on the path to very interesting and productive monetization strategies. The consistency of our results reflects our team's passion for delivering superior customer experiences over our world-leading wireless and PureFibre networks. Our significant broadband network investments drive extensive socioeconomic benefits for Canadians and communities from coast to coast. At the same time, they are enabling continued advancement in our operational, financial and customer experience performance.\nLooking ahead, our financial position and our operational outlook remains strong, supported by continued EBITDA growth and stable capital expenditures, resulting in a meaningful free cash flow expansion on a chronic basis prospectively. This will be enhanced by significant value creation in our growth businesses and a multiplicity of asset monetization opportunities.\nIn this regard, today, we announced a definitive agreement with La Caisse, who will acquire 49.9% interest in our newly formed Canadian wireless tower infrastructure operator, Terrion. This initiative will monetize our world-class tower infrastructure portfolio, creating long-term value and strengthening TELUS' financial flexibility. Indeed, this allows us to accelerate balance sheet deleveraging and progress towards achieving our target ratio of 3x net debt to EBITDA by 2027, whilst turning off our discounted dividend reinvestment program on a progressive basis over the same time period.\nStrategically, Terrion will focus on building new towers for TELUS, who will be its largest customer from the start, whilst also developing partnerships to expand tower access across the industry and further monetize this valuable asset. We are working with a Canadian partner in La Caisse to support broad national wireless access for the benefit of consumers and small businesses across the country. This move also aligns with TELUS' commitment to infrastructure sharing, leveraging smart partnerships to extend the reach of our technology whilst continuing to lead in network quality and services. Just as we are providing mandated wholesale access through the regulatory MVNO framework on our broadband wireless network across both our traditional operating territory and our expansion territories, and also enabling competitors to access our Fiber Infrastructure under the CRTC's pro-competition wholesale framework, we are now extending that to our wireless infrastructure across Canada. This will enable broader use of our wireless tower real estate to maximize its utility for Canadians.\nIndeed, having a single company focused on tower expansion will positively impact all wireless providers' ability to deploy acquired spectrum to enhance coverage, capacity and service improvements for their customers. Again, it's good for competition, it's good for investment and competition and investment are synergistic. Importantly, our new tower initiative mirrors our position on Internet wholesale, specifically that fair access to infrastructure can foster meaningful competition, affordability and consumer choice whilst incentivizing private investment along the way.\nI would like to thank [ Eros Spadotto ], my long-time colleague and TELUS former Executive Vice President of Technology Strategy for assuming the CEO role of Terrion. I expect that he is going to deliver an excellent performance in this assignment. My sincere thanks as well to the TELUS and the team for working diligently and innovatively to bring this important initiative to fruition. Finally, reflecting our TELUS team's long-standing commitment to putting our customers and our communities first in June, the TELUS Friendly Future Foundation held its second [ Annual Gallup ]. Notably, the foundation raised more than $2.6 million in sponsorships, cash donations and in-kind contributions to support the foundation's TELUS Student [ Bursary ] Fund. This was also complemented over and above the $2.6 million with our partnership with CIBC in this regard to expand the student bursary fund still further.\nSince its launch in 2023, the TELUS Friendly Future Foundation has provided over $4 million in TELUS student [ burversaries ], helping more than 1,000 students from underserved communities reach their dream of post-secondary education, whilst also affecting meaningful change within their communities through volunteerism.\nIn closing, I'd like to express my gratitude to our team at TELUS for their efforts, their resiliency and their grit in executing on our consistent winning strategy to meet or exceed the commitments that we have to all of our stakeholders. And on that note, let me turn the call over to [indiscernible] Doug.\n\nDouglas French\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Darren, and hi, everyone. TELUS had another very strong quarter of operating execution, financial performance and delevering activities. Mobile network revenue was down slightly as mobile phone and connected device subscriber additions as well as higher IoT revenue of 9% were offset by lower mobile phone ARPU. While the 3.3% decline in ARPU is reflective of the ongoing competitive pressures observed during the prior periods as well as lower overage and roaming revenues, we are seeing an improved operating environment as market conditions stabilize. We saw ARPU trend improvements quarter-over-quarter across new activations, rate plan changes and customer renewals, reflecting our ongoing efforts to mitigate network revenue pressures.\nFixed data services grew 3% year-over-year, our 18th quarter of positive growth, driven by subscriber ARPU growth in Internet as well as security and automation. Additionally, fixed revenue was supported by higher managed services in the business area. TTech adjusted EBITDA increased 3% alongside margin expansion of 100 basis points to 41.7%. These results were driven by our consistent emphasis on profitable customer growth and ongoing focus on cost efficiency and effectiveness and asset monetization progress.\nTELUS Health revenues and adjusted EBITDA grew 16% and 29%, respectively, and adjusted margin expanded 180 basis points to 17.5%. This growth was driven by organic growth in Employer Solutions as well as business acquisitions, including Workplace Options. TELUS Health EBITDA, excluding Workplace Options was over 20%, that is 8 quarters in a row now of over 20% EBITDA growth in TELUS Health. Growth was also supported by various other services, including our [ pay provider ] vertical. In digital, operating revenues and adjusted EBITDA were in line with expectations. Please refer to TELUS Digital's earnings release and analyst call commentary earlier today.\nAt the end of Q2, informed by TELUS Digital's most recent financial model [ Refresh ], we recorded a noncash impairment adjustment to goodwill. The key assumptions that were updated during the latest model included higher weighted average cost of capital, lower perpetual growth rate and lower cash flow forecast from pricing and margin pressures. You can find all the details of the impairment and assumptions underlying it in the notes to the financial statements of both TELUS and TELUS Digital. With this impairment, net income for TELUS was largely offset by the impairment after deducting noncontrolling interest share and basic EPS was 0. On an adjusted basis, net income was $342 million and EPS was $0.22.\nCapital expenditures, excluding real estate declined by $11 million or 2%, primarily driven by the completion of certain projects in wireless and fiber network builds and the planned transition to fiber builds and partner build model for brownfield and new market areas. Overall capital intensity was 13% and unchanged over the period. Free cash flow of $535 million increased by 11% compared to the same period a year ago, driven by higher EBITDA as well as lower capital expenditures and interest paid.\nLooking ahead, we remain focused on driving towards achieving our 2025 targets, which we reiterated today. This includes TTech, including Health operating revenues and adjusted EBITDA growth of 2% to 4% and 3% to 5%, respectively. Consolidated capital expenditures, excluding real estate of $100 million are targeted to remain stable at $2.5 billion. Lastly, consolidated free cash flow for 2025 of $2.15 billion is also confirmed.\nAs it relates to our balance sheet, the average term to maturity of our long-term debt stands at 13 years with a weighted average cost of 4.71. Additionally, our financial position remains robust and our leverage ratio declining to 3.7x, down 20 basis points sequentially since the first quarter. As we progress through 2025, we expect continued improvements to our leverage ratio, including a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio by 3x by 2027, alongside removing the discount associated with our dividend reinvestment program.\nIn June, we successfully raised $2.85 billion in hybrid securities across multiple offerings in Canada and the United States, building upon the $1.6 billion raised in April. These financings support deleveraging with 50% of the proceeds receiving equity treatment by the credit rating agencies. Subsequent to June 30, we completed our debt tender to retire $1.8 billion of securities in Canada and the United States for the repurchase in the amount of just under $1.6 billion, recapturing approximately or circa $230 million of reduced future cash flow debt obligations. Our continued organic operational growth, including EBITDA expansion, declining capital intensity and free cash flow, combined with the ongoing asset monetization initiatives will further strengthen our balance sheet.\nNotably, we monetized our wireless towers that were announced this morning, will reduce our leverage by approximately 0.17x on a pro forma basis. Including this transaction, we expect to achieve leverage ratio of 3.55x exiting 2025 as we progress towards our 2027 target of 3x. The accounting for [ Tapus Power ] transaction was an equity transaction. There will be no debt on our balance sheet. We will be consolidating the entity of Terrion. In addition, there will be no impact to EBITDA. Free cash flow in our planning period will be positive from this transaction between interest reductions and the leasing opportunities as highlighted by Darren. All the rent paid to Terrion is at fair market value lease rates that you would see in the market.\nLooking ahead through 2025 and beyond, we are well positioned to drive sustainable performance as we maintain our focus on profitable growth. Our strategic initiatives and customer expansion, product innovation and service enhancement will further strengthen our market position and drive long-term value creation.\nWith that, Robert, back to you.\n\nRobert Mitchell\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Doug. Carl, we're ready for questions, please.",

I'm Brett Feldman, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today are John Stankey, our Chairman and CEO, and Pascal Desroches, our CFO. Before we begin, I need to call your attention to our safe harbor statement. It says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking.

I appreciate everyone joining us this morning, and I'm pleased to share that we followed a strong performance in 2024 with a solid start to 2025. In Q1, we reported growth in consolidated service revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, driven by strong postpaid phone and fiber net adds. We also grew Adjusted EPS and Free Cash Flow when excluding DIRECTV, with both metrics performing consistent with the outlook we provided in March. Pascal, we'll run you through the details of our Q1 results and outlook, so I'm going to use my time to cover two topics that are top of mind for our management team. First, I'll review the core operating principles driving our strategy. This includes how our differentiated position as the largest converged provider across 5G and fiber is fueling growth in high-value customer relationships.\nAfter that, I'll discuss why we expect to deliver on our 2025 financial guidance and commence our planned share repurchases during Q2, despite operating in a macro environment with diminished visibility. So let's start with the core operating principles that are enabling us to drive our long-term strategy forward. As always, we begin with a focus on the customer. This is why we launched the AT&T Guarantee, which is a promise to our customers that we'll provide them with connectivity they can depend on, the deals they want, and the service they deserved, guaranteed or we'll make it right. AT&T is the first and only carrier that offers a guarantee for wireless and fiber networks to both consumers and small businesses.\nA key reason we can make this promise is because of the significant fiber expansion and network modernization investments we're making to be the best connectivity provider in America. A little over three years ago, we set a target of passing over 30 million total locations with our fiber network by the end of 2025. I'm proud to say that we expect to achieve that target before mid-year as we continue to ramp towards our objective of reaching 50 million-plus total locations with fiber by 2029 through a combination of our organic build, Gigapower, and other commercial open access agreements. We're also making great progress at retiring our legacy copper network as we transition to modern 5G wireless and fiber technology, and we have an opportunity to move even faster following recent FCC orders.\nWe appreciate Chairman Carr and the FCC for their leadership to advance the tech transition and update requirements to better reflect today's technology and competitive marketplace. Our customer-focused, investment-led business model has positioned AT&T as a trusted provider of critical connectivity services. As a result, we're well-positioned to drive sustainable growth through a range of market and economic cycles. Our Q1 results present further evidence that our differentiated strategy is working. We came into the year with an expectation that the wireless industry would see further normalization in net adds and overall activity levels. So far, this has played out, and to no surprise, we have seen shifts in offers and promotions as the major providers compete for a moderating pool of new customers. Despite a slow January, we were able to fine-tune our offers and competed very well against this backdrop for the balance of the quarter.\nThis was especially true within our fiber footprint, which is the largest and fastest growing in the US. As we have said before, where we have fiber, we win in fiber and 5G. This dynamic continues to drive growth, as shown by our increasing rate of converged customer penetration and significant wireless share gains within our fiber footprint. These trends continued and, in some cases, strengthened in Q1. For example, a significant portion of wireless gross adds that took our lead offers during Q1 were with converged accounts. This is a key reason why we had more converged household gross adds within our fiber footprint during Q1 compared to last year. As a result, our converged penetration continues to climb, with more than 4/10 AT&T fiber households also now subscribing to our mobility services.\nThis is a key trend because accounts with both fiber and wireless services have lifetime values that are more than 15% greater than customers with standalone services. The message here is that the primary driver of our growth is our success at executing our fiber and 5G playbook, and that our increased investments in customer acquisition and retention are driving sustained growth in high-value customer relationships. The fundamentals of our business are very strong, and we continue to feel confident that our strategy and plans for 2025 are on track. However, all companies in the US are now operating with less visibility as the administration pursues policies that are intended to facilitate its laudable goal of creating more equitable global trade and improved domestic manufacturing capabilities. Like others, we're closely monitoring this journey to rebalance global trade and its impact on the broader economy.\nThe announced tariffs could potentially increase the cost of smartphones and other devices, as well as the cost of network and technical equipment. The magnitude of any increase will depend on a variety of factors, including how much of the tariffs our vendors pass on and the impact that the tariffs have on consumer and business demand. Based on the 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs and our visibility into the supply chain, we believe we can manage the anticipated higher costs within the 2025 financial guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. Our expectations reflect our strong financial performance in the first quarter, the historical resilience of demand for our critical connectivity services across economic cycles, and our decision to reduce discretionary expenses and accelerate cost actions that we had planned for later in this year.\nThat said, this environment remains fluid and will provide further updates based on the ultimate impacts of the reciprocal tariffs. The priorities we laid out at our 2024 Analyst and Investor Day have not changed, and we continue to operate our business to achieve the financial plan and capital returns we outlined in December. As we shared during that presentation, these long-term plans are based on an outlook that assumes a macroeconomic environment with low single-digit GDP growth and moderating inflation. If we ultimately face a lower growth environment over this period, we have the option to adjust our operating posture to prioritize cash flow. This gives us confidence in our ability to execute the expanded capital returns program announced at our Analyst and Investor Day. We plan on commencing share repurchases this quarter.\nWe also continue to evaluate opportunities to deploy our financial flexibility towards strategic investments that complement our organic growth plan, additional capital returns, or further improvements to our balance sheet. So with that, I'll turn it over to Pascal. Pascal?\n\nPascal Desroches\n\nCFO, AT&T\n\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing our first quarter financial summary on slide five. At a consolidated level, total revenues were up 2%, service revenues were up 1.2%, and Adjusted EBITDA was up 4.4%. The primary driver of this solid performance was growth in our mobility and consumer wireline businesses, which continues to more than offset secular pressure on business wireline. As a reminder, beginning with our first quarter results, Adjusted EPS and Free Cash Flow exclude DIRECTV. Adjusted EPS was $0.51 in the quarter, which was $0.03 higher than the prior year when excluding DIRECTV. First quarter Free Cash Flow was $3.1 billion, which was up more than $350 million on a comparable basis.\nQ1 capital investment of $4.5 billion was slightly lower year over year due to lower vendor financing payments, reflecting the good progress made in reducing these balances for the past couple of years. For Q2, we expect capital investment in the $4.5 to 5 billion range and free cash flow of approximately $4 billion, and we continue to expect full-year free cash flow of $16 billion plus. Now, let's look at the trends we're seeing in our mobility business on slide 6. Our mobility business delivered solid results to start the year, growing both revenues and EBITDA in a wireless market that remains both healthy and competitive. Total mobility revenues were up 4.7% year over year, with service revenues up 4.1%. Service revenue growth was primarily driven by strong customer growth, including 324,000 postpaid phone net adds, as well as continued postpaid phone ARPU growth.\nPostpaid phone gross adds increased by about 13% year over year, which more than offset a normalizing trend in churn. Postpaid phone churn of 0.83% was up 11 basis points from the first quarter last year. This increase was primarily driven by the normalization of customers reaching the end of their equipment promotional financing periods in the fourth quarter, which is a trend we highlighted on our prior call. We also saw some shifts in competitive offers during the quarter that impacted churn. Importantly, involuntary churn remained low and consistent with our expectations. Based on the current market dynamic and the return to a more normalized cadence of promotional roll-offs, we expect postpaid phone churn to remain at a similar level in Q2, with typical seasonality in the back half of the year as we approach the holidays. First quarter mobility EBITDA grew 3.5% year over year.\nEBITDA margins of 43% was down 50 basis points versus last year. This was due to increased advertising and marketing spend related to the launch of the AT&T Guarantee, as well as higher spending on customer acquisition and device upgrades. We're very pleased with the uptake rate of our offers among new and existing high-quality customer cohort. This is evident in our postpaid phone ARPU, which grew 1.8% year over year and in the continued growth of our base of converged accounts. Before I discuss our Q1 consumer wireline performance, I want to provide some insights into the trends we're seeing in our mobility business so far in the Q2. Postpaid phone net adds remained solid, with both gross adds and churn broadly in line with our expectations.\nHowever, upgrades have trended higher than expected since the announcement of the reciprocal tariffs in early April, which we believe triggered an acceleration in consumer upgrade behavior. If upgrade rates remain elevated, this could represent a pull forward from the second half of the year. Now, let's move to consumer wireline results on slide seven. In the quarter, consumer wireline performance was led by solid broadband subscriber growth for both AT&T Fiber and AT&T Internet Air. We delivered 261,000 AT&T Fiber net adds, up from 252,000 in the first quarter of last year. This was driven by growth in our consumer locations served with fiber, which reached 23.8 million at the end of Q1, and growing contribution of net adds in regions served with Gigapower Fiber. We love the return profile of fiber and the lift it provides our mobility business, only makes investing in fiber more attractive.\nAT&T Internet Air net adds were 181,000 in the quarter, which is a significant improvement from a year ago, driven by broader availability across our distribution channels. Our combined success with these two services helped us deliver 137,000 total broadband net adds in the quarter. This marks our seventh straight quarter of overall broadband subscriber growth and second consecutive quarter with more than 100,000 broadband net adds. We grew consumer wireline revenue by 5.1% versus the prior year. This was driven by fiber revenue growth of 19%, reflecting subscriber gains and solid fiber ARPU growth of 6.2%. Consumer wireline EBITDA grew 18.6% for the quarter. Our first quarter results benefited from vendor settlements that positively impacted our total wireline operating expenses by approximately $100 million. Roughly $55 million of the impact was in consumer wireline, with the rest in business wireline.\nThis item has no impact on guidance as it was factored into our full-year plan. Now, let's turn to business wireline on slide eight. Starting this quarter, we're providing more detail on the revenue components within business wireline to match the disclosures and targets we provided at our Analyst and Investor Day. Business wireline revenues declined approximately 9% year over year, primarily due to continued pressures on legacy and other transitional services, which declined 17.4%. This was partially offset by growth in fiber and advanced connectivity services, which grew 4.5%. About 1/3 of these revenues are from value-added services, which are variable on a quarterly basis. The remaining 2/3, which is predominantly fiber connectivity, is growing at a faster rate and accelerated relative to Q4. Business wireline EBITDA declined less than 2% versus the prior year.\nI want to call out a few factors that contributed to this improved trend. On the top line, we benefited from pricing actions on legacy services, which helped moderate revenue declines, although we expect this benefit to diminish over the next few quarters. On the expense side, business wireline operating and support costs were down about $400 million year over year. This decrease is due to solid execution against our cost-saving initiatives, including lower force, contractor, and access costs. Lower expenses also reflect the vendor settlements I mentioned earlier, as well as the prior deconsolidation of our cybersecurity business. While I appreciate that our first quarter EBITDA performance is pacing ahead of plan, some of the favorability was non-recurring, and we are facing an operating environment with less visibility. So we expect to see a normalization in the trajectory of business wireline EBITDA during the remainder of the year.\nWe also saw solid trends across business solutions, which includes the contributions from business mobility and FirstNet. As we announced earlier this month, we now have more than 7 million FirstNet connections, which is a tremendous milestone. We continue to grow connections because FirstNet truly is in a league of its own. Let's be clear, no matter if it's New York City Police Department, the Fire Department of New York City, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or any of the nearly 30,000 public safety agencies and organizations that use FirstNet, FirstNet continues its strong momentum and remains the first responder communication solution of choice. Now, let's move to slide nine to discuss our capital allocation. Our capital investment is largely driven by our fiber deployment and wireless network modernization.\nThese remain strategic priorities, and we expect these initiatives to remain on pace with the timelines we outlined at our Analyst and Investor Day in December. We continue to expect our full-year capital investment to be in the $22 billion range. During Q1, we made further progress on strengthening our balance sheet and reduced net debt by about $1 billion. This was driven by our strong Free Cash Flow and net proceeds related to asset sales, and strategic investments, partially offset by $1.2 billion of currency headwinds related to the weakening of the US dollar. As a reminder, we fully hedge the FX impact on our debt, with the offset reported in other liabilities. We ended the quarter with net debt to Adjusted EBITDA of 2.63x versus 2.68x at the end of last year.\nWe've worked hard at strengthening our balance sheet and continue to operate the business with a net leverage target of net debt to adjusted EBITDA in the 2.5x range. Since the beginning of 2020, we have reduced our net debt by $32 billion. Based on this improvement in our balance sheet, expected proceeds from the sale of our 70% stake in DIRECTV, and our financial outlook for the remainder of the year, we are now in a position to begin executing on the incremental capital returns we outlined at our Analyst and Investor Day. We expect to begin share purchases under our $10 billion authorization this quarter, with at least $3 billion completed by year-end and the remainder during 2026. We're really pleased with the team's performance and our start to the year, and we're excited to continue to build on this progress. Brett, that's our presentation.\nWe're now ready for the Q&A.\n\nBrett Feldman\n\nSVP of Finance and Investor Relations, AT&T\n\nThank you, Pascal. Operator, we're ready to take the first question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, press star, then one. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, please press star, then two. Today's first question comes from Peter Supino with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nPeter Supino\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nHi, good morning. A question on tariffs and another on the growth environment. If tariffs increase the cost of phones, I wonder how you would envision AT&T and the industry potentially reacting to that on a sustained basis.\nAnd then with your comments on the possibility of a slower growth environment, I wonder if you could refresh us on the expense reduction opportunity outside of consumer wireline and what else you might have in mind for a slower growth marketplace. Thank you.\n\nJohn Stankey\n\nChairman and CEO, AT&T\n\nGood morning, Peter. So first of all, let's kind of start with our customer base and customers and what might happen or not happen in tariffs. As I said in my comments, the visibility is not great around what the future holds. But if I think about the dynamics of handset costs, it's probably important for us to take a step back and realize we're dealing with skew costs on handsets right now that are quite a bit more expensive than they were even four years ago or three years ago.\nWhenever those dynamics have occurred, we've come up with different solutions in the marketplace that ultimately allows the customer to manage through those things. Customers, of course, make choices from their point of view as to what they wish to do, like possibly extending life cycles of handsets. And we've done that within the context of our business model, even though we've been seeing average cost of handsets increasing over time. As you know, we've done a nice job of improving the profitability and performance of this business. So if tariffs are the next driver of an increase in the unit cost of handsets, I imagine we're going to have to go through the exact same play, which is, first of all, understand what the customer needs and then make some adjustments to how we support them in that process.\nBut that process is going to be taking that cost, as we've traditionally done, and largely moving it through to the end user and fitting it into the business model of ultimately what we can afford to drive the right level of returns in our business. And I think we've demonstrated over time that we've done that fairly effectively. So I think that if ultimately costs are passed to us from those that we buy handsets from, unfortunately for the customer, we're going to have to come up with some new ways for them to figure out how to digest that increase in pricing. I don't see the business model dramatically changing to accommodate subsidy levels that are much different from what's out there today and the modest adjustments we make to those day in and day out.\nBut we'll find different creative ways to build plans and approaches and supports that allow them to continue to use the network effectively and do what they need to do and feel good about it. And I also don't know if I step back and think about consumer behavior in this, handsets are just one part of a broader ecosystem of decisions that consumers are going to have to make on goods and services. And if their flat panel TV in their house is going to be more expensive and if their laptop is going to be more expensive and how they choose to kind of manage this dynamic within that ecosystem, I think we're all going to learn. But I feel pretty good that we've demonstrated we can get through that cycle.\nIn terms of the growth environment, look, I thought we've given you some pretty good views around how we're managing costs across the business in its entirety. It's not just consumer wireline. We laid out for you in the Analyst Day what we're doing across the entire wireline business. There's certainly, in that $6 billion pool that we're looking at, plenty of opportunity to address things that we can move forward and readjust. We're being pretty diligent about that. But we're also improving other parts of our business actively. We've shared some of that with you. We've talked about what we're doing broadly across our call centers. We've talked to you about how we're getting more efficient in our software development and our information technology organizations, shared with you that we've been a lot better in how we've managed our digital channels for acquisition and customer awareness.\nThat's before I think we've really gotten good at the operational side of our digital channels, which we're investing pretty heavily in, that I think we can have some additional uplift in the efficiency of how we bring customers into the business and support them. So I think we gave you an indication that we're very comfortable with our guidance for this year, is there's a lot of places we know we can go and operate the business a little more effectively and continue to work our expense lines more aggressively. I think you saw that in Q1. We clearly invested a little bit more in customer acquisition, but I'm pretty proud of the overall margin performance that the team delivered and how we balance those things out. I think we know how to do that, and we'll continue to do that going forward.\n\nPascal Desroches\n\nCFO, AT&T\n\nPeter, one other thing to add. Q1, when you look at it, was impacted by launch expenses associated with our guarantee. So the organic expense performance was really, really good.\n\nBrett Feldman\n\nSVP of Finance and Investor Relations, AT&T\n\nThanks, Peter. We'll go to the next question, please. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Benjamin Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nBenjamin Swinburne\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks. Good morning. Two questions. John, I doubt you'll answer this specifically, but I figured I'd ask anyway. There was a press report back in March around AT&T and talks to acquire Lumen's mass market consumer fiber business. Curious if you had any comment on that, or maybe just if you can't or won't talk more broadly about how you're thinking about inorganic investments at AT&T, just given the transformation over the last few years, but also the success you're having with your fiber strategy in general.\nAnd then I was curious if you could talk a little bit more about the FCC's recent orders on kind of legacy infrastructure. It sounded like you thought maybe you could move quicker. I don't know if that's on wire centers or that $6 billion pool or kind of all of the above, but could you come back to that comment and tell us what's happened and how that may impact your ability to take costs out of the business even faster than you have already sort of laid out for us? Thank you very much.\n\nJohn Stankey\n\nChairman and CEO, AT&T\n\nGood morning, Ben. I'm not going to make any comments on rumors and speculation that you reference. What I can tell you is I'll repeat what I've said about inorganic activity in the business.\nAlways keep my mind open to something that I think can improve value for the shareholder that's clear and centered on what we have laid out as our key strategic threats in the business. That's to be the best in connectivity. I've articulated that anything that allows me to accelerate what I believe is a reordering of assets for converged connectivity in the markets. It becomes a make-buy kind of analysis, which is, I know what I can make it for, and I have plenty of opportunity to make more infrastructure investment in the business and across the nation. We've demonstrated that we're pretty good at that, completing our recent commitments early, our cost per. We've been giving you a lot of insight into how effectively we've been doing that on our fiber build.\nI think you should take some satisfaction in what you see happening in the fixed wireless growth. That's an artifact, not exclusively, but partly because of our modernization efforts in the wireless network that, as we complete those things, it opens up geographies that we previously had closed that we can now sell into. So you can see that we're getting operational execution around those things. And as long as I can build opportunity and do it effectively, that's a good thing to do. And I think it's a sensible deployment of shareholder capital. If something were to come up inorganically that looked like it rivaled those types of business cases, or looked similar to that, or gave me a way to accelerate that where the market power of accelerating it did something good, of course, I'd be open to it.\nAnd as I've said earlier, I continue to be looking for opportunities in the business to find those nice tack-ons, bolt-ons, add-ons to our connectivity business that are a little less capital-intensive, that might be that next thing that we can interest our customers in and making an incremental purchase decision from us that is going entry to connectivity and how they use our core services. And I don't know if and when something like that will pop around, but certainly if it does, I would spend a lot of time understanding whether or not we can build some organic value for the shareholder as a result of it. On the FCC orders, here's what I would tell you right now. I think we're in a great place.\nWe talked a little bit about this in December when we had you all together, and I think I characterized it at the time that we've been working on this for a number of years and that there had been a lot of pick and shovel work to get to this time, and a lot of which we weren't necessarily exposing you to or talking about. But to get to the moment we talked about in December took years of work at the state level, took a lot of work internally about reordering data and structuring organizations differently to get focused on things, to get the work set up properly. And I felt like we had it all in a pretty decent package.\nI used the characterization in December, and I said it felt like we were about ready to move from maybe an environment where there was a bit of regulatory headwinds or a little reticence to change to one with regulatory tailwinds. And that ended up being true. And I think this FCC, since it's seated, what, 90 days-ish ago, has already moved to take out some procedural steps on the applications that we had pending to begin doing the things in wire centers that we articulated to you in December we needed to do to pull those costs out. And I think we're sitting at somewhere along the lines right now, about 25% of our wire centers where we have what I would call fairly clean sailing to act on all the plans that we told you we needed to do to sunset.\nAnd we have more applications now pending, and we're actively working with the FCC about how to do that more effectively. I would tell you right now, my bias internally as I talk with our folks is I think we now are focused on the effectiveness of our execution and less on the effectiveness of our operational execution and less on the effectiveness of the execution of our legal and regulatory affairs organization. And I'm going to say that deliberately because internally, I know there'll be a couple of departments that will be running down the hallways cheering and skipping and saying that they're not on the critical path anymore. And that's the way I feel. And I feel that we are now at a point where our operating groups need to go get the work done, and there's plenty of runway in front of them to do that.\nAnd they are doing that and beginning to step up on that, and that's how the management team is focused. We still have regulatory steps to get through, but I'm not worried about those becoming inhibitors for us to achieve the guidance that we put in front of you back in December.\n\nBenjamin Swinburne\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks a lot.\n\nBrett Feldman\n\nSVP of Finance and Investor Relations, AT&T\n\nThanks, Ben. We'll go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thank you. I think just two quick ones. First, for Pascal, is there any way to frame the impact or quantify the impact of the higher upgrades that you're seeing so far in the second quarter? I guess you gave us the Free Cash Flow for the quarter, but anything on what that could do to wireless margins or wireless EBITDA growth? That's number one.\nThen on the business side, if we add back the vendor adjustments, it looks like EBITDA was only down about 5%. Is this a good rate going forward? I mean, obviously, the trend had been above 20%. You guys have done a great job on the cost side, but is this about the level that we should expect as we look out over the next 12 months in that segment? Thanks.\n\nPascal Desroches\n\nCFO, AT&T\n\nHey, John, thank you for the question. First, on upgrades, here is the way I think you should think about it. Probably late in Q1, and as I mentioned in my comments in Q2, it accelerated in Q2. We saw an acceleration of upgrades. We think some of this may be a pull forward in anticipation of the tariffs. So in terms of Q2, I would expect elevated levels of upgrades.\nI mean, you see Q1 as a should be as a benchmark. I think thinking about it in the context of at least around the same levels. And so as you make your way through the balance of the year, of course, we're always impacted by the normal seasonality that you get with upgrades being more heavily weighted towards the second half of the year. But I think that's a good way to think about our upgrade. And it remains to be seen how much of this was a pull forward from the second half. In terms of business wireline performance, I would start and say we're really pleased with the execution of the team. There's a new leadership team in place there, and they've come in, and I think they've gotten the organization focused on driving growth in connectivity revenues, and we're pleased with how that is going.\nBut importantly, they've taken some steps to really rationalize some of the cost base, recognizing that they still have a pretty meaningful base of legacy revenues. I think this quarter, you've benefited from price increases on legacy plans. Those price increases typically come with higher churn as you make your way through subsequent quarters. So I think as you think about the balance of the year, we do expect some of the trends to moderate, and that we will see a pickup in legacy revenue declines as you make your way through. Also, this quarter, we benefited from the settlement I mentioned in my commentary. That was, think about that as around $45 million. So we're really pleased, but I think it's too early to really change our outlook for that segment.\n\nBrett Feldman\n\nSVP of Finance and Investor Relations, AT&T\n\nThanks, John. We'll go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you and our next question comes from Michael Rollins at Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Rollins\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nThanks. And good morning. Two topics, if I could. First, AT&T reported an acceleration of fixed wireless net adds and it's coming at a time when you're expanding the mid-band 5G coverage. So curious if you can give us an update on how AT&T is looking at the penetration and financial prospects from fixed wireless. And do these network enhancements give you an expanded opportunity to take more share of broadband outside of the 50-plus million passings that you're trying to get to with fiber by the end of this decade?\nAnd then just second on ARPU, I'm just curious. When you think about the pricing actions that AT&T has employed over the last couple of years, and you set that against the competitive backdrop and macro landscape, could you just frame the opportunities for AT&T to continue to improve ARPU for both postpaid phones and the fiber subscribers? Thanks.\n\nJohn Stankey\n\nChairman and CEO, AT&T\n\nMorning, Mike. So as I just mentioned, part of what's happening on the fixed wireless side is, as we've done the modernization of the conversion of the Alcatel-Lucent—excuse me, Nokia, I'm dating myself—the Nokia footprint into the Ericsson footprint. That conversion, as we go into those geographies, opens up territory where we, because we had not done the modernization to the level we liked with all of our spectrum assets, and the most modern equipment, they typically were not open for fixed wireless access.\nAnd that has opened up some footprint that will continue to open up as we go through that over the course of the next couple of years. And I would also tell you, on the margin, we're seeing better performance off of that investment than what we would have anticipated. So as we kind of thought about one of the economic reasons why we felt this was the right move, we understood that we would get some better yields off the network given the equipment deployments we were using, the more modern equipment, and some of the strategies around how we would actually integrate on a single vendor solution. And those are helping. We've also been doing the network as a living, breathing thing.\nWe've gotten better at yield and traffic management in some ways that we can use some of those efficiencies back against the network, in places that maybe we hadn't anticipated two years ago, that have opened up some opportunity. And I would just tell you, our strategy overall around how we think about using fixed wireless access has not changed. But what's happening is, I think you're seeing the learning benefits of focus. The business, in my estimation, has a much clearer point of view right now on the multi-year capital deployment and what we're doing and what footprints in terms of our investment. And so it's not just about where you're deploying fiber and where you aren't.\nIt's about what you need to do to make sure that you can transition out of legacy services so that you have the right infrastructure in place, whether it be wireless or fixed, to serve those customers. I think that clarity and the repeatability of that month in and month out is allowing all the organizations that are necessary to serve customers and sell product to get a lot better at what they're doing. And so we're moving up that learning curve of where we want to deploy our fixed wireless muscle, all consistent with what I talked about before, which is we'd like to use it as a catch product from legacy broadband services that we're not going to invest in building fiber in.\nWe'd like to use it as a holding product when we know we're going to be building fiber within a period of time, but we can provide a better solution or some market penetration on a converged basis until that fiber gets there. What we can do in the business segment, where the portfolio of the business is clearly a great match for fixed wireless long-term because of their usage characteristics and demand characteristics, all those reasons that we think are the right use cases to deploy, we're just getting better at our muscles around how to find those customers and how to activate that through our various channels and partners to drive that volume. And so I feel really good about the customer base that's coming in.\nWe continue to test that and look at it and say, \"Are we getting the right customers that are going to have longevity? They're going to be profitable?\" And I think we'll continue to find places to ramp this modestly as we move forward. But nothing's really changed in our point of view other than we're getting better at all aspects of how we run our business: yields on the wireless network, efficiency, lining up markets to distribution channels, coming up with the right offers that we can make it creative over the long haul. And I think that just means we're going to get better over time. On the ARPU side, look, I'm sorry to sound like a broken record.\nWe're going to continue to do what we've done pretty consistently over the last five years, which is we're going to find opportunities in our customer base where we think utility and value has improved tremendously. And because of the performance of the products and how customers are using them, allow us to have opportunities to possibly adjust what that means for pricing. I think we have done that pretty artfully over the last several years. You see the right trends in our ARPU performance. I think in this quarter, you shouldn't see anything in there that you look at and say, \"That's disconcerting or different than what you've been seeing over the last number of years.\" We're also going to be very sensitive to the realities of the markets we're in.\nIf we walk into a slower growth economic environment or there's a dynamic that goes on later in this year where growth is not what we expected it to be, then we'll be smart about how we work with our customers over the long haul and make sure that we do the right thing to keep the franchise healthy and make sure that we're providing value in the right ways back to those customers. So I will tell you, great products, superior products generally allow you to have a little bit more pricing flexibility. And I've been saying all along, you should expect that since fiber is the best fixed broadband product in the market over time, you're going to continue to see margins improve on it. You're going to see it scale operationally. You're going to see it get more profitable. And you are seeing that. And I don't think we're at the end of that runway of that dynamic continuing to materialize.\n\nBrett Feldman\n\nSVP of Finance and Investor Relations, AT&T\n\nAll right. Thanks for the questions, Mike. We're going to get the next one, Operator.\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. Our next question comes from Bryan Kraft at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Kraft\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThanks. Good morning. Just regarding Pascal's churn comments, I wanted to follow up there. I think you said, Pascal, that Q2 would be similar to Q1, and then second half would be characterized by typical seasonality. I assume that means we should look at the historical sequential step-ups in the back half of the year off of Q2 and estimated churn. Is that the right way to think about? And also, in general, how much of the higher churn is a function of, would you say, contract rolloffs picking up versus increased competitive intensity?\nAnd then lastly, I was wondering if you would just comment on your outlook for gross add performance. Would you expect this momentum in year-over-year gross adds to continue? And lastly, if upgrades are being pulled forward due to tariff concerns, do you think switching between carriers is also being pulled forward? It seems like both yourselves and Verizon yesterday are talking about pretty strong gross add performance currently. Thanks.\n\nPascal Desroches\n\nCFO, AT&T\n\nHey, Bryan. Thank you for the question. Remember, coming into the year, we said that we would have a higher level of contract rollouts this year. And we also said that we would expect the overall industry growth to be lower than it has been. Those two factors were baked into our expectations that this year we would have higher churn than we saw last year.\nI think as a good rule of thumb, 2023 was probably a year where we had similar levels of contract rollouts that we're seeing in 2025. And so I think that's a good benchmark for thinking about how this is playing out in 2025. And as I would expect, as you look at sequential performance and churn for the back half of the for Q2 and the back half of the year, I would tell you 2023 is probably a good proxy to use as your benchmark. In terms of gross adds, what I can tell you is what we've seen so far in the second quarter. We've continued with really good performance, and we're happy with how the team is executing and competing for the gross adds in the marketplace.\n\nJohn Stankey\n\nChairman and CEO, AT&T\n\nYeah, Bryan, I'd just add in. I mean, obviously, we gave you some guidance, and we characterized for you what we expect in growth in our wireless business. We do expect to continue growing our customer base and being competitive in the market to do that. If it's a math issue, it turns up a little bit. Yeah, gross is going to end up going up a little bit as a result of that. That's kind of the plan we're operating to right now. That's all baked into what we just articulated for you moving forward. But what I'd stress is the comments I made earlier in the call, which is how we're focusing on which customers to bring in as we're driving those gross additions and our focus on the high-value customers, especially in the converged space.\nWhen your LTVs are going up because you consolidate customers, and we just gave you an indication that that's the case, then you obviously maybe invest a little bit differently as a result of that. What I think we're doing, I'm very comfortable with relative to the customers I see coming in and our ability to put incremental products and services on them that have durability and longevity. Whether that's a fiber customer that we're adding wireless onto, or the other way around, or it's a newly consolidated fixed wireless access customer that has good runway because of the profile of the network in that area that ultimately consolidates wireless lines, I'm willing to invest in those in the right way because of that increased lifetime value. I think we're doing a good job of making that happen. I'm very comfortable running that play moving forward through the balance of this year.\n\nBrett Feldman\n\nSVP of Finance and Investor Relations, AT&T\n\nThanks for the questions, Bryan.\n\nBryan Kraft\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you.\n\nBrett Feldman\n\nSVP of Finance and Investor Relations, AT&T\n\nAll right. We'll go to the next question, Operator.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question comes from Sebastiano Petti with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nSebastiano Petti\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Thank you for taking the question. Just wanted to maybe, I guess, kind of wrap in Bryan as well as John and Mike's question. Just help us think about, I guess, the comfort or the confidence in getting to the higher end of the mobility service revenue, I guess, more particularly the EBITDA guidance of the higher end of 3 to 4. Just what underlies or underscores that confidence from the management team, just kind of given the higher activity that we're seeing here, obviously, cost opportunities. But just if you could double-click on that a little bit.\nThen, John, going back to perhaps what you talked about, the longer-term plans were based on low single-digit GDP, moderating inflation, and the management team's ability to adjust your operating posture to prioritize free cash flow. I mean, has that put your $45 million fiber target passings at risk at all as you think about or extrapolate over the next several years? Thank you.\n\nPascal Desroches\n\nCFO, AT&T\n\nLet me start. In terms of how to think about mobility, this past quarter, we delivered 3.5% growth. It's important to keep in mind that that included a cost of launching our AT&T Guarantee. So we were able to absorb that, higher promotions, and still deliver 3.5% growth. As I look at the rest of the year, here are a couple of things to keep in mind.\nThere are some adjustments we've made on auto bill pay discount, which should also help the balance of the year. Also, we said we are accelerating some of our cost actions that were planned for later in the year. We're moving those forward. That will help AT&T Mobility from here. So overall, we feel really good about the mark we put out there at the beginning of the year, and we continue to march towards that.\n\nJohn Stankey\n\nChairman and CEO, AT&T\n\nSebastiano, I guess to answer your question, I obviously like everybody else, and my visibility is not perfect right now. I wake up every morning expecting that I could see something today that I hadn't seen before that we have to adjust to. I feel good about our flexibility and being able to do that, given where the business is right now after several years of really hard work, to give us that latitude.\nThe way I think about our capital allocation, and it's really related to how I characterize our confidence in moving forward with share buyback right now, trying to be pretty deliberate, foundational, and strategic in how we do these things. And as I shared, I think fiber is a fundamental element to communications networks moving forward. I view it as a very long-lived asset. We're investing in this not for this year or next year. We're investing in it for decades. I view the restructuring and reordering of the industry that we're in a fairly seminal moment around that, and that there's a window here as a result of that reordering. And that window is not going to stay open forever. And I look at the characteristics of the business case of fiber.\nI would say that when you have a deployment and an investment that doesn't require what I would say is new market development, but it's a share take, the growth environment in aggregate is less of an impact on it. It's not like all those customers are going to disappear. There's still homes out there with people in them that want a better service. And so historically, my bias is when you get into these economic cycles, you use your balance sheet and your strength to continue to press your bets that are the right long-term bets that are going to help you be in a better position structurally. And as I think about our investments in fiber, I have a lot of reasons to think about, that's an important structural long-term bet that we want to make sure we continue to push ahead on.\nOur supply chain's in pretty good shape on that front. We've talked about this several times. We have longer-term contracts with our suppliers. There's been a lot of work to reshore and manufacture in the United States key elements of it. The most important element of building fiber is services. It's people power. Those all are people who work here in the United States, and they're not subject to the dynamics of tariffs and things like that. I feel like we can manage through the cost side of it pretty well. My bias would be that that's a place we continue to lean in and push on and execute to our plan.\n\nBrett Feldman\n\nSVP of Finance and Investor Relations, AT&T\n\nThanks for the question, Sebastiano. We'll go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question today comes from Jim Schneider at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my questions too, if I may. First of all, in the overall consumer health, how would you kind of characterize the state of the consumer at this point? Obviously, many moving parts in this market. But do you see any evidence of consumers less willing to trade up, or even trading down, or consumer credit quality issues that may sort of be impacting things over the next couple of quarters from what you can see today? And the second is on capital allocation. Can we maybe just sort of frame your earlier comments on M&A and buybacks in terms of, is the buyback guidance you've provided independent of any inorganic activities you might consider, or is it contingent on it? And if it's contingent, is there a minimum level of buybacks you would not go below? Thank you.\n\nJohn Stankey\n\nChairman and CEO, AT&T",
    "content2": "Hi, Jim. So I think the short answer to your question is I'm not seeing anything right now in a change in any dynamics of consumer behavior that I would say is out of pattern or out of trend of the business, with maybe a couple of things on the margin. One is I think the prepay market is a little bit slower than it had been. I think that's probably an artifact of some degree of immigration. But I don't know that that's economic per se. I'm not concerned about it. It's what we had expected and have been sharing with you that I would have expected that dynamic to evolve as the policies of the United States changed around it.\nI think what Pascal shared with you earlier, which is maybe there's some behavior in the market right now where some people are trying to get ahead of perceptions of what might happen to unit costs on things that are important to them and pre-buying as a result of that. We'll see if that is, in fact, the case. Our sense is that there's a little bit of that going on. How that sustains itself over what period of time and when does that shift, I don't know. But other than that, I think that's all I've seen. I certainly watch what's going on in the broader economy. I don't have any news to break on that. It's not my news. It's what I see macroeconomists representing. It's what I hear from retailers. We continue to pay attention to it.\nBut as we started out, as I shared with you in my opening comments, the good news is we're not showing up. We're not that dining-out experience. We're not that discretionary choice. We're pretty far down the list of things that people are going to part ways with if they're managing dollars and cents. And I think that's a good place to be. And I believe the combination, as I said earlier, are opportunities to run our business more efficiently, our opportunities to take share in places and still grow, even if it's growing on more value-oriented plans, portend well for the company, even if some consumers are going to put off choices on some upgrades or incremental purchases in places.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThe question on the -\nOh, I'm sorry. The capital allocation. I apologize. Small trivial question. Look, we gave you our guidance and our commitment in our order of capital allocation for a reason. And we intend to execute it, carry it through. And that's a priority for this management team and the business to do that. I can't see everything in the future. I don't know that something doesn't come up. But we're starting down this path. Our confidence in our share buyback is indicative of the fact that we're starting it early, that we're doing it at a time where I think some would say that visibility isn't as great right now as it was six months ago because we believe strongly in it. We think it's the right thing to do. And I'm committed to executing it and carrying it forward.\n\nBrett Feldman\n\nSVP of Finance and Investor Relations, AT&T\n\nThanks for the question, Jim. Operator, we're going to take our last question.\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. And our final question today comes from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nKannan Venkateshwar\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nThank you. So John, just from a macro-environment perspective, I guess, is there a certain growth framework you're working with, especially on the wireless side? I mean, in terms of either trying to retain a certain amount of share in the market, a certain amount of activity. And is that something that sets a floor in some ways in terms of managing your P&L on the mobility side? And then on the corporate decommissioning side, I think there's been a couple of real estate sales, at least for some of the wire centers earlier this year. Is there more opportunity to extract capital out of that business potentially at a faster pace at some point? And what should we look out for in terms of goal posts as that process moves along? Thank you. Sure.\n\nJohn Stankey\n\nChairman and CEO, AT&T\n\nSo the way I think about it, and I've articulated this before, is I'm very focused on what our shares of revenues are within an industry. As we talk about things like, are gross adds or net adds inflated and the value of a particular net add or gross add, the way I try to get the management team centered on it is if we can drive recurring service revenues and we have the right margin structure, that's going to be a good thing for the business. I think if you go back and if you look at what we've been able to do over the last couple of years, we've done a really good job of managing our share of service revenues in the markets that we're actively participating in. I think we've done that in a way that's returning.\nI believe that that's where I should have the team focused, and it's where we'll continue to be focused, always with the mindset that I think to be a really great company, we're ultimately going to have to be a share leader in places. I'm fully aware that we're not in that position right now. I would like to see our team achieve that. I don't view that as a quarter-to-quarter thing. I don't engineer a quarter's net ads or gross ads based on some assumption around that. I step back and I say, \"What are the right things we need to do structurally in the business that allow us over time to affect that kind of a share shift? How do we get the asset base lined up properly? How do we position the brand in the most effective way?\nWhat do we do to ensure that we've got the right kind of innovation and converged offers in place that will ultimately yield the shifts in share that designate us as a market leader in terms of the overall revenues that are available of the pool of the market that we choose to play in?\" I think we're making steady progress across those things. I just gave you examples of the modernization that we're doing in the infrastructure that I think will serve us well for the long haul. You see what we're trying to do to reposition the brand right now and establish the framework of how we continue to evolve that platform and the value proposition to the customer on that platform. When I talk about where we're going on the innovation of converged products, those are important things that come in with it.\nSo I think that's how I try to get the management team focused as opposed to saying, \"In this quarter, I need to engineer for this number because of some expected goal of me being a share leader in a position.\" I think that's earned over time, not earned in a 90-day cycle. In terms of where we have additional opportunities, we've given you, I think, about as good a visibility to our business over the next three years as we've done in a long time. When we talked to you in December, we outlined for you that we have a pretty good handle on that package of opportunity as we restructure the business, exit legacy businesses, exit footprint, that there's a lot of pools of cost and opportunity in that.\nWe have taken what I believe are achievable and reasonable estimates of that and factored them into our guidance over the next three years that we've provided to you. And some of those things, like where we think we have higher value assets for disposition that we can use to reinvest back in the business as cash flows to modernize things, or pay for fiber investment. We've done the best planning we can about that, and incorporated those things that we can catch. But I'm going to be honest with you. When you're disassembling infrastructure that's been built over 100 years, sometimes you're going to miss something. Sometimes there's going to be an opportunity that presents itself that you didn't expect.\nI mean, maybe we were wrong in our estimates of what copper might sell for in the market when it's reclaimed, and it sells higher than we expect, and there's incremental money that comes from it. But we've done our best of kind of giving you our point of view of what we think all those things in the mix master, including property dispositions and things that we can work through, are going to yield back to the shareholder base. And I'm not in a position to kind of tell you that I think that there's a remarkable upside or downside you should bet on at this juncture. Folks, I appreciate you being with us today, and I thank you for your continued interest in AT&T.\nAs I said at the beginning of my comments, I feel really good about where we started the year coming off what was a really solid and foundational year. I couldn't be more delighted in the fact that this is the quarter that we're making a pivot and adjusting our capital allocation to begin a buyback program that we worked really hard to get to and can demonstrate to our shareholders that their patience with us has been rewarded. Thank you very much for your time, and everybody have a good rest of the week.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day."

I'd like to introduce your speaker, Mr. Robert Mitchell. Please go ahead.\n\nRobert Mitchell\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nHello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. our fourth quarter 2024 results news release, MD&A, financial statements and detailed supplemental investor information were posted to our website earlier this morning.\nOn our call today, we will begin with remarks by Darren and Doug, the Q&A portion, we will be joined by Zainul, Navin, Jason and Tobias. Briefly, prepared remarks, slides and answers to questions contain forward-looking statements. Actual results could vary from these statements. the assumptions on which they are based and the material risks that could cause them to differ are outlined in our public filings with Securities Commissions in Canada and the U.S., including fourth quarter and annual 2024 MD&A. With that, over to you, Darren.\n\nDarren Entwistle\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, [ Ragnar ]. Hello, everyone. And in the fourth quarter and for 2024, our team's relentless pursuit of operational excellence continue to differentiate the TELUS organization, driving significant customer growth, and robust financial results. Through our premier asset portfolio and unwavering commitment to cost efficiency, we delivered strong profitable growth to close out 2024. A momentum that we intend to build upon in 2025 and beyond. Our focus is on margin accretive customer expansion, globally leading broadband networks, and a customer-centric culture culminated in our third consecutive year of surpassing 1 million mobility and fixed customer additions. Once again, TELUS led the industry with more than 1.2 million telecom net new customer additions in 2024. This performance is a testament to our unmatched bundled product offerings across mobile and home.\nIndeed, our team's passion for delivering customer service excellence again, contributed the continued strong loyalty across our key product lines. Notably, postpaid mobile phone churn of 0.99% for the full year marks the 11th consecutive year at less than 1%. Despite a challenging competitive regulatory and macroeconomic landscape, TELUS drove 5.5% GTECH EBITDA growth for 2024, meeting the target range that we set at the beginning of 2024. This included strong TTech EBITDA growth of 7% in the fourth quarter. Our team once again achieved industry best total customer telecom net additions of $328,000 for the quarter.\nIn mobile, we drove leading total net additions of $264,000, including healthy mobile phone net additions of 70,000 and strong connected device net additions of $194,000. This was supported by our ongoing intense focus on economic margin accretive customer growth which is evidenced by our consistent industry-leading lifetime revenue, buttressed by our industry best churn and superior customer experience.\nLet's turn now and take a look at our wireline business. TELUS delivered another quarter of industry-leading total wireline customer growth, including industry best fourth quarter Internet net additions of $37,000. The Notably, this drove industry-leading fixed data services revenue growth of 3.5%. Furthermore, in the fourth quarter, we drove continued strong momentum in our unique and highly differentiated data-centric growth businesses. Our TELUS Health team achieved accelerated revenue growth in the quarter, up 10%. And alongside 20% growth in its EBITDA contribution. Since acquiring LifeWorks in 2022, we've achieved $355 million in combined annualized synergies, including $294 million in cost synergies and $61 million in cross-selling.\nImportantly, we remain on track to deliver our goal of $427 million by year-end. Moreover, we drove a 10% year-over-year increase in global lives covered to over $76 million, a 16% increase in virtual care members and a 7% increase in digital health transactions. Likewise, our team achieved robust performance in TELUS Agriculture and Consumer Goods, with revenue growth of 16% on the back of eight consecutive quarters of record sales performance driving increasing profitability and margin contributions.\nWe look forward to continuing the momentum in these emerging growth areas in 2025 and beyond. The strategic investments that we've made in our leading broadband networks, alongside our customer experience leadership, underpin the continued advancement and sustainability of our strong financial and operational performance. This gives us confidence in the robust outlook for consistent, long-term profitable growth and our ability to deliver on the annual targets that we've set out for 2025. These include industry-leading TTech operating revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth of up to 4% and 5%, respectively. And consolidated free cash flow of approximately $2.15 billion supported by continued moderated capital expenditures of approximately $2.5 billion representing an industry-best capital intensity.\nOur team's track record for execution excellence, alongside an attractive long-term free cash flow growth outlook underpin our sustainable and leading multiyear dividend growth program now in its 15th year. Needless to say, we remain disappointed in our share price performance over the past year in spite of significantly outperforming the majority of our national and global peers across a wide range of operational and financial metrics. This is frustrating for our management team in the context of our robust and profitable customer growth which drove leading fourth quarter telecom EBITDA growth of 7% and 5.5% for the year, not to mention our dividend yield of 8% and coupled with TELUS' potent defensive characteristics in a volatile macroeconomic environment. Furthermore, our leading and differentiated asset mix underpins the significant value that we have created, including our pervasive pure fiber network with world best KPIs as reflected in recent U.S. fiber transactions. It includes our differentiated TELUS Health and TELUS Agriculture and consumer goods businesses with their attractive growth and valuation multiple characteristics. And it includes the best telecom asset in the business with a reliable execution track record.\nGoing forward, this management team remains laser-focused on building on the strong operational and financial performance momentum with which we exited 2024. We remain focused on achieving our robust targets for 2025 and and we remain focused on delivering sustainable free cash flow expansion year in and year out for the foreseeable future.\nThis is buttressed by one of the lowest capital intensity ratios globally, alongside compelling monetization opportunities that we anticipate supporting meaningful deleveraging also a key area of focus for 2025 and beyond. TELUS is targeting to achieve a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 3x in 2027 and in conjunction with the contemporaneous removal of the discounted dividend reinvestment plan preceded by a ratcheting down of the plan in 2026.\nIn May, per our established cycle, we will provide an update on our dividend growth program for 2026 through 2028 and more generally for the return of capital to our shareholders.\nIn closing, I'd like to express my gratitude to our team for their efforts, their expertise and frankly, in the environment, their grid in executing on our consistent winning strategy to meet our commitments to all of our stakeholders. And on that note, let me turn the call over now to Uncle Doug.\n\nDouglas French\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Darren, and hi, everyone. Mobile network revenue was flat as profitable mobile loading and connected device additions were offset by lower mobile phone ARPU, which declined 3.6%. The decline in ARPU, although reflective of the ongoing competitive pressures in the market remained relatively stable as compared to the previous few quarters. double-digit IoT revenue growth partially mitigated this impact. Fixed Data Services revenue grew 3.5% year-over-year, driven by strong customer growth across our leading product portfolio of pure fiber Internet, TV, security and home automation as well as B2B growth. At the segment level, TTech operating revenues were up 4.1%, driven primarily by mobile equipment, fixed data services as well as strong growth in health and agriculture, as Darren highlighted. Other income of $52 million in the quarter increased by $37 million over last year, largely due to gains recognized on our real estate and copper monetization programs.\nWe anticipate these programs to continue in 2025 as we execute against these initiatives. Notably, TTech adjusted EBITDA increased by 7% in the fourth quarter and 5.5% for the full year, achieving the low end of our target range alongside margin expansion of 110 basis points to 38.2%, demonstrating an unparalleled track record of execution excellence in a highly dynamic operating environment. These results were driven by our consistent emphasis on profitable revenue growth or customer growth and the benefits from our ongoing focus on cost efficiency and effectiveness, gains from our real estate and copper monetization programs as well as increasing margin contribution from TELUS Health and TELUS Agriculture and Consumer Goods.\nLooking at our TELUS Digital segment. Operating revenues and adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter continued to reflect stabilization and performance, both improving on a sequential quarterly basis. The team continues to manage their cost structure while focusing on revenue generation. Please refer to TELUS Digital's quarterly conference call earlier today. On a consolidated basis, net income increased by 3.2% year-over-year, while basic EPS was higher by 20%. On an adjusted basis, net income and EPS were higher by 11% and 4.2%, respectively. This growth was driven by the after-tax impacts of higher operating income, partially offset by higher financing costs mainly reflecting the impact of unrealized changes in the forward element of our virtual power purchase agreements as well as higher interest costs associated with our increased long-term debt and higher interest rates.\nFor the full year, CapEx, excluding real estate declined by $294 million or 11%, driven by our planned slowdown of our fiber and wireless asset builds as we approach their completions. Consolidated capital intensity of 12% was down 200 basis points year over last year. For the full year, free cash flow of approximately $2 billion came in slightly below our target of $2.1 billion. This was primarily due to higher-than-expected cash impact effects of contract assets and device financing, associated with the higher contracted devices in Q4 as promotions were heavily focused on device subsidies throughout Black Friday and the holiday selling period. Free cash flow was also impacted by slightly higher restructuring from our ongoing cost efficiency programs. These factors were partially offset by lower capital expenditures.\nLooking ahead, our financial targets for 2025 build up our leading growth profile and operating execution excellence. Our financial targets include TTech operating revenue growth of 2% to 4% and TTech adjusted EBITDA growth of 3% to 5%. Consolidated capital expenditures, excluding real estate, are targeted to remain at approximately $2.5 billion. We also set aside $100 million in capital for real estate development initiatives similar to 2024.\nLastly, free cash flow for 2025 is forecasted to be approximately $2.15 billion driven by higher EBITDA and disciplined capital management. Our outlook for free cash flow includes an increase of cash taxes due to higher installments related to higher taxable income. Additionally, there will be a catch-up tax payment in 2025 related to 2024 for the increase on our earnings before tax as well as a step down in the amount of tax depreciation TELUS can claim under the accelerated investment incentive program. For 2025, we also anticipate slightly higher interest paid. The effects of asset -- sorry, to contract assets and device financing as well as cash restructuring payments, both anticipated to be flat in 2024. A detailed list of our assumptions for 2025 are set out in our annual MD&A release today. As it relates to our balance sheet, the average turn to maturity of our long-term debt stands at over 10 years, and our average cost of debt is 4.3%. Our leverage ratio at the end of 2024 is at 3.9x and we remain committed to delevering our balance sheet with the execution of the plan in place toward the net debt-to-EBITDA leverage of approximately 3x in 2027. The plan includes EBITDA growth and cash flow expansion alongside of reducing capital intensity as well as the continuing of programs such as real estate and copper initiatives. Partner opportunities within our growth businesses, divestiture of noncore assets and surfacing or some value -- servicing value in our infrastructure where appropriate.\nFurthermore, as Darren outlined, we expect to achieve this target leverage ratio alongside our plans to reduce the discount associated with our dividend reinvestment plan in 2026. With the intention of removing it in 2027. Overall, we look forward to the new year. We remain highly confident in our ability to build on a track record of execution excellence underpinned by our leading asset mix and resilient business strategy. This will be supported by our focus on delevering as we ensure we are well equipped to deliver strong, sustainable growth into the future. With that, back to you, Robert.\n\nRobert Mitchell\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nCarl, we're ready for questions, please.",

Welcome to the TELUS 2024 Q2 Earnings Conference Call. I would like to introduce your speaker, Mr. Robert Mitchell. Please go ahead.\n\nRobert Mitchell\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nHello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Our second quarter 2024 results news release, MD&A and financial statements and detailed supplemental investor information were posted to our website earlier this morning. On our call today, we'll begin with remarks by Darren and Doug. For the Q&A portion, we'll be joined by other members of our leadership team. Briefly, prepared remarks, slides and answers to questions contain forward-looking statements. Actual results could vary materially from these statements the assumptions in which they are based and the material risks that could cause them to differ are our public filings with securities commissions in Canada and the U.S., including second quarter 2024 and annual 2023 MD&A. With that, over to you, Darren.\n\nDarren Entwistle\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Ringo, and hello, everyone. In the second quarter, our team built upon our track record of execution excellence to drive industry-leading customer growth and strong financial results, leveraging our premier portfolio of assets coupled with our relentless pursuit to drive cost efficiency and effectiveness. Our results clearly demonstrate how we are delivering sustainable profitable growth underpinned by our consistent strategic focus on margin-accretive customer expansion, our globally leading broadband networks and of course, our customer-centric culture. This enabled a record second quarter with total customer net additions of $332,000, up 13% on a year-over-year basis. This included helping mobile phone net additions and record second quarter customer growth for both connected devices and total fixed net additions.\nOur team's passion for delivering customer service excellence once again contributed to leading loyalty results across our key product lines. Notably, postpaid mobile phone churn was again below 1% alongside pure fiber churn of circa 1%. This showcases the consistent potency of our unmatched bundled product offerings across mobile and home and our leading customer experience over our industry best pure fiber and wireless broadband networks. For the second quarter, TELUS achieved resilient EBITDA growth of 5.6% and margin expansion of 170 basis points. These results reflect the progression of our ongoing transformational efficiency programs that are clearly bearing fruit.\nLet's turn now and take a look at our TTECH mobile results. TELUS realized second quarter customer growth of 262,000 net additions, our strongest second quarter on record. This included robust mobile phone net additions of 10,000 and driven alongside our continued focus on profitable margin-accretive customer growth. Indeed, we are doubling down on our disciplined focus on profitability as we progress through the remainder of 2024 and beyond. Our efforts will ensure our mobile customer growth drives sustainable EBITDA and cash flow accretion for our business and our investors. Mobile subscriber growth also included record second quarter connected device net additions of $161,000, which represents a 30% increase on a year-over-year basis. This reflects continued strong momentum with respect to our 5G and our IoT B2B solutions.\nImportantly, our team delivered another quarter of leading loyalty results which, of course, continues to be a hallmark of our TELUS team. Blended mobile phone churn of 1.07% was up against the backdrop of elevated competitive activity relative to seasonal trends. Whilst this is not a level at which our team is content, it once again represented an industry best result by a substantial margin versus our peer group. Notably, postpaid mobile phone churn was 0.89% in the quarter as we progressed through our 11th consecutive year with a churn rate below 1%. This is an outstanding result on a global basis and reflective of the industry best customer experience our TELUS team delivers time and time again.\nTo close on mobile second quarter ARPU of $58.49 was down year-over-year. This was a result of continued intense promotional market activity and heightened competition. Notwithstanding the competitive pressures, our team is distinctly dissatisfied with our ARPU results, and we remain focused on driving a better outcome through multiple levers prospectively. These include enhancing our premium bundled offers across mobility and fixed and driving unmatched product development, differentiation and intensity, all swab maintaining strategic focus on profitable growth and sustainable economics.\nOur flanker brands offer strong customer value in key growth segments, some with lower associated ARPU, but notably compelling AMPU attributes. Through digital transformation, we are meaningfully lowering our cost to serve across the board, inclusive of supporting an attractive AMPU for BYOD and flanker activity. Furthermore, our growing product intensity increases both average revenue and average margin per home, whilst reducing churn. Thus, we see sequential benefits as we layer more fixed and mobility products significantly enhancing lifetime revenue and the associated economics. These efforts will continue to be supported by our team's passion for winning and retaining profitable customers, whilst remaining highly disciplined in respect of device subsidies.\nFurthermore, we continue to expect connected devices and IoT to increasingly contribute to network revenue, network ARPU and ABPU and seeing that growth grow at a level of materiality prospectively. Importantly, our industry-leading customer loyalty and focus on profitable growth allow us to continue delivering industry-best mobile phone lifetime revenue which consistently exceeds our national peers by a considerable margin of up to 38% in the second quarter alone. Now let's take a look at our TTECH fixed operating results, where TELUS delivered another quarter of industry best total wireline customer growth. Indeed, our team achieved robust and industry-leading second quarter Internet net additions of $33,000, similar to the prior year and up slightly versus the first quarter of 2024. Importantly, consumers in the West are choosing TELUS for our pure fiber superiority, coupled with our customer service excellence, which is sustaining strong growth on a year-over-year basis.\nWe are also continuing to drive healthy growth in our TV product line with industry-leading net additions of 25,000, up 47% on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, modest residential voice losses of 8,000 were flat over last year and again represented an industry best result compared to our national peers by notably wide margin. Strong and leading security net additions of 20,000 were up 33% and reflect our successful multi-product penetration strategy as well as the distinctive performance on premium versus our peers. Overall, our industry-leading external fixed net additions of 70,000 again represented a record second quarter results for the TELUS organization. This demonstrates the strength of our unique and highly attractive bundled offers across our unmatched portfolio of products and services in combination with our superior customer experience over our ever-expanding pure fiber network.\nIt's terrific to be able to deliver that magnitude of net fixed results for this organization in terms of getting an ROI on the billions of dollars that we've invested in pure fiber connectivity. Any particular strengths will be further enhanced by continued significant innovation on our differentiated product road map where we will be delivering a series of new products in the months and quarters to come. In this regard, TELUS has built the first device agnostic smart home platform, leveraging new IoT services in close partnership with AWS as well as the development talent and capacity of our TELUS digital experience team, formerly TELUS International.\nThis platform will enable us to enter many new verticals such as energy management, which we launched earlier this week. Furthermore, that will enable the enhanced integration of existing capabilities, such as health and wellness, whilst at the same time, driving cost to serve improvements at a material level and driving as well licensing savings within our core business operations. is really the embodiment of what we did on ABPU on the wireless front being driven into the wireline side of our business. Our product development, differentiated service portfolio and product intensity driven by leading data and AI capabilities not only positions us for growth, but helps Canadians save money in an affordability challenged environment.\nLooking forward, the integrated product platform will deliver a multitude of innovative products. which will further solidify our product intensity leadership and present new revenue sources in the quarters to come that are completely differentiated from our competitive peer group. Let's turn now and look at TELUS Business Solutions, or TBS, which once again delivered a robust quarter of growth across all areas of the business. Our focus in B2B continues to be on accelerating profitable growth. And in this regard, notably, in the second quarter, TBS achieved strong cash flow growth of 8% on a year-over-year basis, reflective of our strong customers first culture global best networks, digital capabilities and, of course, focused execution, TELUS business drove industry-leading loyalty results in Q2, a lead, we've maintained now for 9 consecutive quarters.\nOur Business Solutions team continued securing significant wins and strategic renewals in the commercial and public sector space. This included an 8-figure deal to deploy TELUS' leading next-generation video security services for a high-profile client with a road map to expand with our video analytics, IoT and automation solutions. We also secured a new strategic partnership that will see TELUS supporting thousands of Canadian vehicles with their industry-leading IoT service. This win builds on our multiyear collaboration with GM to provide [indiscernible] car technology for its Canadian customers.\nIn TELUS Health, we are pleased with the solid performance returning to positive top line growth of 4% as investments in our products, sales capacity and distribution channels deliver strong momentum across multiple lines of service. This includes MyCare, pharmacy management systems, virtual pharmacy, Retirement Benefit Solutions, Health Benefits management, our precision health and our employee assistance programs. The performance at TELUS Health has been strong across all of our products and business lines. And notably, we expect this positive momentum to continue in the quarters ahead.\nFurthermore, our TELUS Health team delivered over 33% adjusted EBITDA contribution growth in the second quarter of 2024 and this was supported by accelerated revenue growth alongside the continued progression of our synergy program at TELUS Health. Notably, on the synergy front, we achieved $297 million in combined annualized synergies since acquiring LifeWorks back in 2022 including an increase of $46 million in the past quarter alone. Since the acquisition, we've driven $248 million in cost synergies along with $49 million in cross-selling as we work towards our overall objective of $427 million by the end of 2025.\nThis means we've got about 130 million synergies left to go and about $80 million are going to come from the cost side and $50 million as it relates to cross-selling. Moreover, in the second quarter, we saw a 10% year-over-year increase in our global lives covered by TELUS Health to now stand at more than 75 million. Similarly, within TELUS' Agriculture and Consumer goods or TAC, we are yielding positive outcomes as we strengthen our market position, delivering strong second quarter revenue growth of more than 15%. This reflects some inorganic growth from tuck-in acquisitions and as well improving organic revenue performance in our consumer goods, precision agronomy and animal agriculture businesses.\nFurthermore, it comes on the heels of continuing strong sales performance quarter to quarter to quarter where we have now realize in terms of our performance, we've more than doubled our year-to-date sales bookings versus this time last year. Nice to see that doubling of our year-to-date sales bookings in terms of our performance in 2024 versus 2023. And as a result of all of these factors, we expect positive organic growth in tech in the quarters ahead. Our commitment to amplifying the substantial growth potential of our distinctive global health and agriculture businesses includes capitalizing on significant cross-selling opportunities throughout all of our businesses, showcasing the collective talent and effectiveness of our team in propelling our success. Watch for more in that space in the quarters to come.\nTurning to TELUS International, which will formally complete its rebranding to TELUS Digital Experience in the third quarter. TELUS Digital's second quarter results reflect a macroeconomic and operating environment that remains distinctly challenged. Whilst we are obviously not pleased with this performance, our confidence in the business and assets remains steadfast, and our team is committed to proving this throughout strong execution and exceptional service delivery starting in the second half of 2024 and building momentum for a much more successful 2025 and beyond.\nThis is going to be achieved by reinvesting TELUS Digital's strong cash flow generation back into the business to support the reacceleration of top line profitable growth along with the ongoing and extensive focus on cost efficiencies and digital transformation initiatives that will improve not just our cost base, but the operational tempo of this organization. In that regard, TELUS Digital's promising capabilities in data and IR services as well as their early success with Fuel High X is capturing customer demand as demonstrated by the digit revenue growth within its AI Data Solutions line of Swiss in the first half of this year. and that growth is indeed encouraging.\nFurthermore, our relationship with TELUS Digital offers a unique competitive advantage as the strength of the Gen AI-fueled solutions created for and tested at TELUS fortify their go-to-market efforts with other external clients. Whilst we are encouraged by these positive indicators of longer-term significant growth potential, the challenges TELUS Digital is facing impact the expected levels of revenue and profit for 2024 as seen in the revised outlook for the full year. It's clear that TELUS Digital must execute on its strategy to deliver the financial results that our investors expect and that we know that we can achieve given the quality of the asset base. In a moment, Doug will provide further commentary on both TTECH and TELUS Digital's results.\nIn closing, the record customer growth we continue to report is underpinned by our dedicated team we're indeed passionate about delivering superior service offerings and digital capabilities over a world-leading wireless and broadband fiber networks. The significant broadband network investments we have made are enabling our resilient EBITDA growth, ongoing monetization of pure fiber and 5G, the financial and strategic benefits of copper decommissioning and intend strategic focus on efficiency enhancement and notable revenue and profit progression in TELUS Health and TELUS Agriculture and consumer goods. That's quite the combination. Together, this combination of factors, solidly positions TELUS the focus on what's next and you will see this organization doubling down in these areas and evolving our product road map and customer-centric offerings in the weeks and months ahead in a way that will drive further significant differentiation and profitable and material revenue growth opportunities.\nThat will be exemplified in terms of cross-selling and improved multiproduct penetration or what we call product intensity. This supports the continued advancement of our financial and operational performance, which is the bedrock of the long-term sustainability of our industry-leading dividend growth program. Finally, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the wildfires that devastated the beautiful community of Jasper last week, the thoughts of our entire TELUS team are with all those impacted by the fire. To support the community through this extremely challenging time, TELUS has committed over $100,000 and growing to assist with the vial rebuilding efforts. Moreover, our team members worked around the clock to support evacuees and local authorities and first responders, leveraging our technology to keep everyone connected when it mattered most.\nIn addition, we provided care kits and a free 50 gigabit data top-up for those tragically displaced from their homes as a result of the wildfires. As a further demonstration of our support, we activated a free community crisis hotline through TELUS Health, offering professional emotional support to anyone affected. I am and the entire team is sincerely grateful to the countless team members who continue that demonstrate that when things are at their worst, our TELUS team is at their very best. Indeed, I can think of no better exemplification of putting our customers first, then by putting our citizens in need first, such as the symbiotic relationship between customers and communities.\nAnd before handing off to Doug, I'd like to take this opportunity to express my immense gratitude and appreciation to Jeff Puritt for his innumerable and important contributions to TELUS Digital over the past 2 decades and almost 1/4 of the century as a TELUS team member. Jeff will retire as President and CEO of TELUS Digital effective on the third of September, and he will assume his new role as Executive Vice Chair of TELUS Digital and joined the Board of Directors at that same time. As you know, Jeff has played a pivotal role in leading and shaping our TELUS digital business since its inception from a single delivery center in the Philippines with fewer than 2,000 team members back in 2005 to an integrated global provider of AI, digital and customer experience services with over 75,000 employees now serving more than 650 clients from 32 countries around the world.\nSupported by robust senior leadership talent succession and in alignment with the company's strategy of bringing the best of technology to enable excellence in customer service. We are extremely pleased to welcome [ Jason McDonell ] as CEO of TELUS Digital and President of TELUS Digital customer experience. Jason is a 20-year tenured member of our TELUS senior leadership team with a proven track record of bringing the capabilities that TELUS has developed to lead in its industry and client care leading in loyalty, leading cost efficiency and leading in digital transformation excellence, bringing these capabilities to all the business verticals that TELUS Digital addresses with external clients.\nIn addition, Tobias Tango, Founder and President of WillowTree, will take on the elevated role of President of Digital Solutions at TELUS Digital Solutions. Tobias' both the industry-leading expertise. He's got the experience. He's got the credentials and he's got the entrepreneurial acumen and drive needed to ensure we continuously deliver best-in-class solutions across our digital, Gen AI and AI modeling businesses. Both Jason and Tobias will work with me closely and report directly to the TELUS digital Board of Directors and we are eager to see the significant leadership contribution and impact that they are going to have and make in returning TELUS digital to material profitable growth. And on that note, I'll turn the call over to Doug.\n\nDouglas French\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Darren, and hello, everyone. Mobile phone and connected device subscriber additions drove network revenue growth of 0.9% and partially offset by lower mobile on ARPU, which declined by 3.4%. The ARPU reflects the ongoing impact from the competitive pricing environment with customers optimizing the rate plans, as well as declining contribution from overage and roaming. This was partially offset by higher IoT revenue. As we progress through the back half of the year, we expect the highly competitive environment to continue.\nImportantly, we continue our intense focus on AMBU and bundling to drive the right economic outcomes. This is supported by our continued focus to drive lower cost to serve as well as leverage our significant digital capabilities. This is further bolstered by TELUS Digital, a key enabler to our customer experience leadership. Our significant and ongoing focus on cost efficiency is helping us offset the top line competitive pricing pressures, allowing us to invest in new product development that will support sustainable EBITDA growth and margin accretion. Fixed Data Services revenue grew by 1% year-over-year, driven by strong customer net additions of 78,000 across Internet security and TV as well as B2B growth, including cybersecurity and cloud services. Despite the competitive landscape, this solid growth demonstrates our superiority of our pure fiber network and growing product intensity.\nInternet ARPU in the quarter was stable due to our successful base management while our TV revenue per house home was lower as customers continue to evolve their entertainment packages along with technological substitution. This includes positive growth from the continued strong adoption of our Streams offering featured a bundle -- featuring a bundle of leading OTT content made available nationally through TELUS and Kudo. At the segment level, TTECH operating revenues were up 0.5%, driven by mobile network and fixed data services as well as positive health and Ag Services revenue growth, as Darren highlighted. This was partially offset by lower equipment revenue. Other revenue includes real estate and copper gains driven by our leading pure fiber deployment, which is enabling our copper decommissioning program, and monetizing of targeted central offices for redevelopment.\nTo date, we have completed copper retirement initiatives in 18 targeted CO offices and sites which is aligned to our real estate development opportunities. We expect these opportunities to grow and continue for years to come as we develop the diversified mix of real estate assets and continue monetizing copper from the active decommissioning program while also realizing the operational benefits of fiber. TTECH adjusted EBITDA growth increased by 5.1% and adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 150 basis points over 38%. The strong growth reflects a 9.2% decline in employee benefits expense driven by our cost efficiency programs. This reflects a net reduction of $87 million after annual increases as the cost savings from the programs we announced in last August have reached full run rate which will continue and while we continue to invest in incremental efficiency and effectiveness opportunities including digitization.\nWe have increased our outlook for restructuring from $300 million to $400 million for 2024 accordingly. In TELUS digital experience, external operating revenues declined by 7.9% year-over-year. This was primarily driven by unfavorable year-over-year revenue comparison from a leading social media client. Although we are seeing signs of stabilization in that regard, along with the broader impact from challenging macroeconomic environment, the industry and industry competitive conditions. This was partially offset in volumes and expansion of services providing from existing customers, including Google, in particular, driven by the continued momentum of digital AI services new clients over the last 12 months and some favorable foreign exchange.\nWhen including the intersegment revenue from TELUS, external operating revenues were essentially flat. The growing contribution from TELUS to TELUS Digital showcases our strong and unique partnership, which is creating mutual benefit opportunities and underscores the critical role in driving our customer experience and digital transformation. This includes the implementation of Gen AI applications across levels of organization, driving further efficiencies and effectiveness opportunities. TELUS digital adjusted EBITDA was up 18% or down 11% when excluding $43 million earn out in the adjusted number from WillowTree, other income associated with others was lapping share-based compensation from the prior year.\nAs discussed earlier today, TELUS Digital revised 2024 targets. Importantly, the updated outlook implies stable to slightly improving revenue in the second half of the year relative to the first half and stable margins aligned with the second quarter, while normalizing for the WillowTree earn-out. Overall, TELUS consolidated operating revenues decreased by 0.7% year-over-year, while adjusted EBITDA increased by 5.6%, improving from the 4.3% in the first quarter. EBITDA margins expanded by 170 basis points year-over-year, driven by a 6.1% decline in employee benefits expense. Consolidated net income increased by 13% year-over-year, while basic EPS was higher by 7.1.\nOn an adjusted basis, net income and EPS were higher by 34% and 32%, respectively. This growth -- this strong growth was driven by higher EBITDA and the flow-through from our cost efficiency programs in addition to stable depreciation and amortization. Free cash flow of $478 million was higher by $199 million, driven by lower capital expenditures and higher EBITDA. CapEx declined by $116 million or 14%, driven by our planned capital reductions. Consolidated capital intensity was down -- was 13%, down 300 basis points over Q2 last year. Looking ahead, we are confirming our TTECH revenue and EBITDA guidance, however, trending to the lower end of our 2024 targets.\nWe remain confident in our commitment to driving strong, sustainable and margin-accretive growth while maintaining focus on lowering our cost to serve with profitable customer loading. Our consolidated free cash flow has been updated to approximately $2.1 billion due entirely to the flow-through of TELUS Digital's revised EBITDA outlook as announced today. The $100 million of incremental restructuring investments as being offset by lower taxes and handset investments. On annual -- our annual target for consolidated capital expenditures remains unchanged at $2.6 billion. Overall, we remain confident in our ability to continue generating strong and growing cash flows for years ahead, driven by our ongoing strong EBITDA growth and moderating capital intensity towards 10% level.\nThis will remain -- that this will support maintaining its strong balance sheet to provide us with ample flexibility to support growth, our growth ambitions and shareholder returns. As we enter the back half, our financial position remains strong. At the end of the second quarter, we have approximately $2.5 billion of available liquidity. Our cost -- our average cost of long-term debt is 4.2%, and our average term to maturity is over 11 years with our debt -- net debt to EBITDA of 3.5x. The acquisition of wireless licenses in the recent years has increased that ratio by 0.56x. This includes payments of our 3800 megahertz spectrum auction and obtaining the use of AWS-4 spectrum in the second quarter alone.\nAs we progress through 2024 into future years, we anticipate our leverage ratio to improve as we work towards our target ratio through continued EBITDA growth, declining capital intensity and ongoing free cash flow expansion. Robert, over to you.\n\nRobert Mitchell\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Doug. Carl, we're ready for questions, please.",

I would like to introduce your speaker, Robert Mitchell. Please go ahead.\n\nRobert Mitchell\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nHello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Our first quarter 2024 news release MD&A, financial statements and detailed supplemental investor information were posted on our website earlier this morning.\nOn our call today, we will begin with remarks by Darren and Doug. For the Q&A portion, we will be joined by other members of our executive leadership team. Briefly, prepared remarks, slides and answers to questions contain forward-looking statements.\nActual results could differ materially from those statements, the assumptions in which they are based and the material risks that could cause them to differ are outlined in our public filings with the securities commissions in Canada and the U.S. including our first quarter 2024 and annual 2023 MD&A.\nWith that, over to you, Darren.\n\nDarren Entwistle\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nHello, everyone. In the first quarter, our team once again delivered against our differentiated growth strategy, leveraging our superior asset portfolio, consistent execution track record and proactive cost efficiency initiatives to deliver industry-leading customer additions and solid financial results.\nThis was achieved against the backdrop of a pretty dynamic operating environment. Our robust performance is underpinned by our strategic focus on margin-accretive customer growth, our customer-centric culture and our globally leading broadband networks. This enabled our strongest first quarter on record with industry-leading total customer net additions of 209,000, up 28% on a year-over-year basis.\nTELUS' industry best growth reflects the consistent potency of our operational execution and our unmatched bundle portfolio offerings across mobile and home. Our team's passion for delivering customer service excellence contributed to continued leading loyalty across our key product lines.\nIn the first quarter, TELUS achieved resilient EBITDA growth of 4.3% and margin expansion of 170 basis points. These results reflect the progression of our ongoing transformational efficiency programs that are clearly bearing fruit.\nLooking at our TTech mobile results, TELUS realized robots first quarter customer growth of 146,000 net additions, our strongest first quarter on record. This included healthy mobile phone net additions of 45,000, relatively stable as compared to this time last year.\nThis consistent result was driven alongside our continued focus on profitable margin-accretive customer growth. And of course, that's a hallmark of our organization. Indeed, we are continuing and now doubling down on this consistent and disciplined approach as we progress through 2024 and beyond. Our efforts in this regard will ensure our mobile customer growth drives EBITDA and cash flow accretion. That is the formula for this organization.\nMobile subscriber growth also included record first quarter connected device net additions of 101,000, which represents a 74% increase over the prior year. This reflects continued strong momentum with respect to our 5G and IoT B2B solutions. Importantly, our team delivered another quarter of leading loyalty results, which continues to be the hallmark of the TELUS team.\nBlended mobile phone churn of 1.13% was up against the backdrop of elevated competitive activity relative to seasonal trends and not clearly at a level where this organization is content. However, this represented an industry best result by a substantial margin of up to 46 basis points versus our peers.\nNotably, postpaid mobile phone churn was 0.91% as we now have entered the 11th consecutive year below the 1% level. This is an outstanding result, and it's an outstanding result on a global basis, reflective of the industry-based customer experience that we deliver that best-in-class and it's done time and again by our TELUS team delivering over our world-leading broadband networks. And that, for us, is the blend network excellence, combined with the excellence of our people and our digital technology at work.\nThe close on mobile, first quarter ARPU of $59.31 was down year-over-year. This was a result of intense promotional market activity and heightened competition and in particular, across device financing subsidies. Our flanker brands offer strong customer value in certain segments with lower associated ARPU, however, notably attractive AMPU attributes.\nThrough digital transformation we are lowering our cost to serve across the board inclusive of supporting a compelling AMPU for BYOD and flanker activity. Furthermore, with respect to our premium brand, we are doubling down to reinforce our long-standing and distinctive focus on AMPU-accretive loading.\nNotably, last week, we implemented changes to evolve our go-to-market offerings across our brands and particularly in order to enrich our premium TELUS offering and afford customers enhanced and differentiated value. These efforts will continue to be supported by our team's passion for winning and retaining profitable customers, whilst remaining highly disciplined in respect of device subsidies.\nFurthermore, we continue to expect connected devices and IoT to increasingly contribute to network revenue, ARPU and ABPU growth as we move forward, regardless of the external environment within which we find ourselves. First quarter ARPU, alongside leading customer loyalty continue to drive our industry best mobile phone lifetime revenue which consistently exceeds our national peers by a considerable margin, a considerable margin of up to 44% again in Q1.\nNow let's take a look at our TTech fixed operating results, where TELUS delivered another quarter of industry best total wireline customer growth. Indeed, our team achieved robots first quarter Internet net additions of $30,000. We also continue to drive healthy growth in our TV product line with industry-leading net additions of 19,000 and more than double the prior year.\nModest residential voice losses of some 8,000 were flat over last year and again represented an industry best result. Strong and leading security net additions of 22,000 were also similar to last year and continue to reflect our successful multiproduct penetration strategy, and also reflect a distinctive performance premium unloading versus our peers. And of course, that's reflected as well within the way we bundle security within the FFH portfolio at TELUS.\nOverall, our industry-leading external fixed net additions of 63,000, notably, again, a Q1 record demonstrate the strength of our unique and highly attractive bundled offers across our unmatched portfolio of products and services. These will be further enhanced by continued and significant innovation on our home automation road map and the products that are resonant within that particular ecosystem that really does create a level of excitement in terms of new revenue sources to come in the quarters ahead.\nOur superior bundled offerings are buttressed by our leading customer experience over our ever-expanding world-leading pure fiber and wireless broadband networks. These results are also bolstered by our strong and highly differentiated social capitalism attributes that truly underpin the strength of the TELUS brand.\nLet's turn now and look at TELUS Business Solutions, or TBS, which delivered another strong quarter and again, differentiates us from telco B2B performance on a global basis. In the first quarter, TBS achieved robust EBITDA and cash flow contribution growth of 4% and 9% on a respective basis. Building on our track record of continued profitable growth TBS experienced strong demand and product growth across all areas of our business.\nThese efforts are progressing our goal of leading the market across both core telecom capabilities as well as our 5G powered Software as a Service and Data Insights Industry Solutions.\nIn TELUS Agriculture and Consumer Goods, on the back of record sales performances over the past 2 quarters, we accelerated our momentum in the first quarter. Indeed, we achieved a 36% year-over-year increase in bookings in Consumer Goods and agribusiness. Furthermore, we delivered 8% revenue growth in animal agriculture. We remain confident in the strong growth potential in this business and anticipate positive mid- to high single-digit revenue growth in the second half of the year.\nLet's turn now and take a look at our TELUS Health business. We achieved first quarter revenues of $420 million, alongside 28% EBITDA contribution growth. On the back of on-target sales and bookings in Q1, we expect steady improvement in Health Services revenue growth in the quarters ahead. Strong first quarter EBITDA growth was supported by the achievement of $251 million in combined annualized LifeWorks integration and other cost synergies to date, leveraging TELUS International along the way.\nWe continue to work towards our overall TELUS Health synergy objective of $427 million to be realized by the end of 2025 as we've committed to the [ Street ] in that regard. Moreover, we supported health outcomes on close to 160 million digital health transactions in the quarter, up 7% on a year-over-year basis.\nIn addition, we increased our Virtual Care membership to nearly 6 million people, up 13.5% on a year-over-year basis again. As we continue to make strong progress scaling TELUS Health and TELUS Agriculture and Consumer Goods, we remain intensely focused on accelerating the significant growth profile of these highly differentiated global businesses that are thirsty for digital disruption to deliver better client outcomes.\nImportantly, we are leveraging the expertise, experience and high-performance culture and talent of our entire team inclusive of leveraging significant cross-selling synergies across all lines of our business. This is buttressed by the blue chip customer relationships leading digital customer experience and AI cost transformation capabilities of TELUS International.\nOn that note, earlier today, TI also reported its first quarter results. Jeff and the team announced robust cash flow generation amidst what remains a challenging global macroeconomic operating environment and a difficult prior year comparable.\nDespite the near-term top line challenges, our TI team has executed to gain significant cost efficiency programs over the past 10 months. These efforts are positioning the business to deliver a strong 2024 in totality. TI's capacity to generate strong cash flows remains highly visible in its quarterly results.\nCommitted to delivering profitable growth, TI's ability to service further efficiency gains will also help fuel its investment in sales and marketing, along with ongoing technology innovation.\nTELUS remains highly confident in TI's strategy and investment thesis. This is amplified by meaningful opportunities in respect of digital transformation and particularly with TI's capabilities in AI solutions including generative AI and this technology's proliferation on a worldwide basis.\nThe continuing critical importance of differentiated digital customer experience solutions in the market including a welcome and needed disruption from Gen AI is enabling us to serve customers better and win incremental business along the way. This is creating a vibrant tailwind for both TI and TELUS that will bear fruit over the medium and longer term in terms of growth and profitability. Doug is going to have an opportunity in a minute to provide further commentary on both TTech and TELUS International's results.\nIn closing, the record customer growth we continue to report is underpinned by our dedicated team who are passionate about delivering superior service offerings and digital capabilities over our world-leading wireless and PureFibre broadband networks. The significant broadband network investments we've made are driving extensive socioeconomic benefits for Canadians and communities across the country, and we'll continue to do so for decades to come.\nThese investments also enable the continued advancement of our financial and operational performance at TELUS and the long-term sustainability of our industry-leading dividend growth program.\nToday, we announced a 7% dividend increase, reflecting our unwavering commitment in delivering superior value to our shareholders. This builds on our extraordinarily consistent track record of delivering on our multiyear dividend growth program first established in 2011 and most recently extended through 2025, targeting annual growth in the range of 7% to 10%.\nToday's increase represents our over the past 14 years. It also reflects our unwavering confidence in delivering leading operational and financial results on a chronic basis prospectively. Importantly, our strong outlook includes anticipated and continued free cash flow expansion in the years ahead, driven by ongoing strong EBITDA growth and moderating CapEx intensity. This will further support the long-term sustainability and the quality and growth of our dividend expansion program.\nFinally, reflecting our team's long-standing belief in the synergistic relationship between doing well in business and doing good in our communities may marks the official kickoff of our 19th Annual TELUS Days of Giving. And we're glad that we've created emulators in this regard given the societal benefit for all. This year, with the support of our extended TELUS family, I have every confidence that we will exceed our goal of inspiring 80,000 volunteers, supporting positive outcomes in communities across the 32 countries in which we now operate as an organization.\nIndeed, it's thanks to the unparalleled level of caring and commitment that our team members and retirees globally have contributed 2.2 million days of giving since 2000, and this is more than any other company on the planet. And the cultural connection that we have to giving back and what it does for engagement at TELUS it's the same recipe that underpins the customer service excellence at this organization and the very low churn rates that we consistently deliver again, such as the Alchemy in that regard.\nMyself, our leadership team and our Board of Directors remain consistently and exceedingly grateful for our team's passionate efforts to support our global communities as we strive to deliver outstanding results for all of the stakeholders that we serve.\nAnd on that note, I'll turn the call over to Doug.\n\nDouglas French\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Darren, and hello, everyone. In the first quarter, our team navigated a highly competitive environment and challenging global macroeconomic climate to achieve strong operational and financial results.\nDespite the exogenous headwinds, our results are supported by our long-standing commitment to drive profitable customer growth, product intensity, execution excellence and our ongoing focus for efficiency and effectiveness. In mobility, continued mobile phone and connected device subscriber additions drove higher network revenue by 2.9%, partially offset by the high impact of competitive intensity.\nAs we progress through the remainder of 2024, we expect a highly competitive environment could continue to pressurize ARPU in the near term along with the lapping of some roaming recovery experience in the first half of 2023. Importantly, we continue to focus on AMPU to drive the right economic outcomes. This is supported by driving lower cost to serve and leveraging our significant digital and self-serve capabilities, along with critical support from TI.\nOur significant and ongoing focus on cost efficiency will help offset top line pressures across the business, driving sustainable EBITDA and margin accretion. Fixed data service revenue grew 2.7% year-over-year, driven by strong customer growth across Internet security and TV along with increased B2B revenue contribution. This solid growth reinforces our superior product diversity within the home and business, enabled by our world-leading pure fiber network.\nAt the segment level, TTech operating revenues were up slightly by 0.4%, while TTech adjusted EBITDA increased by 4.1%. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 160 basis points to over 39%, reflecting a 4% decline in employee benefits expense from our efficiency programs.\nTurning to DLCX, for more additional and comprehensive details, please listen to the TELUS International webcast that occurred earlier today. DLCX had continued impact from the challenging macroeconomic environment that resulted in operating revenues declining by 4.6% year-over-year. The decline was primarily driven by lower revenue from a leading social media client and a reduction in revenue in other industry verticals, notably, e-commerce, fintech and travel and hospitality.\nThis was partially offset by growth in services provided by existing customers, including TELUS and Google as well as other new clients added over the past 12 months. DLCX adjusted EBITDA was up 11%, including the earnout adjustment with respect to [ WillowTree ]. In addition, the efficiency and effectiveness programs executed on to address operating expenses included a decrease of over 3% in employee benefits.\nLooking forward, new opportunities with new and existing clients, supported by building on our momentum within AI [indiscernible] solutions revenue will continue to improve as the year progresses. While TI's ongoing focus on efficiency also puts them in a strong position to manage through some of the macroeconomic pressures as we progress throughout 2024.\nOverall, TELUS consolidated operating revenues decreased by 1.2% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA grew by 4.3%. Consolidated net income was down 38% year-over-year, while basic EPS was lower by 40%, in part driven by adjusted EBITDA growth being offset by higher restructuring, depreciation, amortization and financing costs.\nOn an adjusted basis, net income and EPS were essentially unchanged year-over-year. Free cash flow of $396 million was lower by $139 million, primarily driven by higher cash restructuring disbursements totaling $225 million in the quarter of which $185 million was related to the 2023 restructuring that we had discussed and disclosed in February.\nWe remain focused on driving towards achieving our financial targets for 2024, which we reiterated today. This includes targeting TTech operating growth of 2% to 4% and TTech adjusted EBITDA growth of 5.5% to 7.5%. Consolidated capital expenditures, excluding circa $100 million that is earmarked for real estate development are still targeted to remain approximately $2.6 billion.\nLastly, consolidated free cash flow for 2024 is forecasted to be approximately $2.3 billion, driven by higher EBITDA and stable CapEx. While top line growth was pressured at the beginning of the year, in part to the aggressive pricing environment, we remain laser-focused on profitable customer growth as evidenced by our recent and differentiated multi-brand pricing suite and continue to demand and continue to drive demand in our superior bundled offerings over our leading broadband networks.\nFurthermore, we anticipate improvement from TELUS International, particularly in the second half of the year as well as TELUS Health and TELUS Agriculture and Consumer Goods.\nOverall, we remain positive on our ability to continue to generate strong free cash flow for years to come, benefiting from our industry-leading growth profile that consistently showcases our superior asset mix and operational execution.\nThis strong position further supports our industry-leading dividend growth program in place for 2025. Our commitment to deliver on this program is underpinned by our confidence in executing our growth strategy and generating meaningful free cash flow on a sustained basis. This is balanced with maintaining a strong balance sheet and providing us ample flexibility to support our future growth ambitions leverage reductions and capital returns to shareholders.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Robert.\n\nRobert Mitchell\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nWe're ready to proceed with questions, please.",

I would like to introduce your speaker, Robert Mitchell. Please go ahead.\n\nRobert Mitchell\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nHello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Our fourth quarter 2023 results, news release, MD&A, financial statements and supplemental investor information were posted on our website this morning.\nOn our call today, we'll begin with remarks by Darren and Doug. For the Q&A portion, we will be joined by other members of the Lee's executive leadership team.\nBriefly prepared remarks, slides and answers to questions contain forward-looking statements. Actual results could vary materially from these statements, the assumptions on which they are based and the material risks that could cause them to differ are outlined in our public filings with the securities commissions in Canada and the U.S., including in our fourth quarter and annual 2023 MD&A.\nWith that, over to you, Darren.\n\nDarren Entwistle\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, [ Randy ], and hello, everyone. Throughout 2023, our team successfully navigated a highly competitive industry and overcame a challenging macroeconomic landscape and dynamic regulatory environment to achieve strong operational and financial results across our business.\nIndeed, our results for the year demonstrate execution strength in our TTech business segment, characterized by the potent combination of leading customer growth and strong operational and financial results, enhanced by our significant and ongoing focus on cost efficiency.\nThese results were buttressed by improving a resilient fourth quarter profitability from our DLCX segment despite the continued challenging macroeconomic operating environment faced by TELUS International.\nRobust performance in our core telecom business is underpinned by our globally leading broadband networks and superior customer-first culture. This enabled our strongest fourth quarter customer growth on record with industry-leading total net additions of $404,000. This represented an increase of 34% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for our leading portfolio of bundled services across mobility and VIX.\nThe fourth quarter capped off a record-setting year for industry best customer net additions of close to $1.3 million, surpassing our previous record high achieved in 2022 by more than 21%. Notably, 2023 marked the second consecutive year our team delivered more than 1 million new customer additions.\nThis robust performance included strong fixed subscriber growth of $259,000, our highest mobile phone net additions since 2010 with 443,000 net new customers and all-time record connected device and additions of $564,000. TELUS' industry-leading growth reflects the consistent potency of our operational execution and our unmatched bundled product offerings across mobile and home.\nOur team's passion for delivering customer service excellence contributed to strong loyalty across our key product lines, and we, of course, have done this on a continued basis. Looking at our consolidated performance for the full year, operating revenue growth of 9.4% essentially met the lower end of our updated guidance range, reflecting the exogenous challenges we encountered, which we will discuss further on our call today.\nDespite these challenges, we drove EBITDA growth of 7.6% for the year, just above the midpoint of our public guidance expectations. Moreover, we achieved strong free cash flow of approximately $1.8 billion, representing industry-leading growth of 38% for the year.\nLet's now turn to take a look at the fourth quarter. TELUS once again achieved resilient operating revenues and strong EBITDA growth of 2.6% and 9.4%, respectively. Looking at our TTech mobile results, TELUS realized robust customer growth of 329,000 net additions in the fourth quarter.\nThis included healthy mobile phone net additions of 126,000, representing a year-over-year increase of 13% and notably, surpassing the 10 million mobile phone customer milestone.\nThis strength was driven alongside our continued focus on profitable and margin-accretive customer growth. Indeed, this consistent and disciplined approach will continue throughout 2024 and beyond to ensure our mobile customer growth drives EBITDA and cash flow accretion.\nIt also included an all-time quarterly record for connected device net additions of 203,000 close to double compared to the prior year. This reflects continued strong momentum with respect to our 5G and IoT B2B solutions that are so essential for our successful future.\nImportantly, our team delivered another quarter of industry best loyalty results, which continues to be the hallmark of the TELUS organization and is emblematic of our customers' first culture in action by our team.\nWhilst blended mobile phone churn of 1.4% was up against the backdrop of heightened competitive activity and not at a level where we are content, it represented an industry best result by a rather substantial margin.\nNotably, postpaid mobile phone churn of 0.87% for the full year marks our 10th consecutive year at less than 1%. Not many companies can make that claim on a global basis. One key factor behind this consistent industry best performance is the superiority of our world-leading networks.\nIn this regard, in 2023, TELUS once again earned numerous accolades for network reliability, network expansiveness, speed and superiority. This included multiyear recognition from independent third-party organizations such as Opensignal and PCMag.\nTELUS is recognized as Canada's most awarded network by Opensignal over 6 consecutive years now. Moreover, PCMag named TELUS Canada's best mobile carrier and best mobile carrier for business in their annual Reader's Choice Awards.\nThe close on mobile, fourth quarter ARPU of $58.50 was down slightly year-over-year as a result of intense promotional market activity and heightened activity, in particular, in the flanker space. This was mitigated, however, by our long-standing focus on AMPU-accretive loading driven by our team's passion for winning and retaining profitable customers, whilst remaining highly disciplined in respect of device subsidies.\nFurthermore, connected devices and IoT will increasingly be an important contributor to network revenue, ARPU and AMPU growth in the quarters ahead. Indeed, our solid and resilient ARPU, which was up 1.2% in 2023, alongside our leading churn continued to drive our industry best mobile phone lifetime revenue.\nWe consistently exceed our national peers in this regard by a considerable margin of up to more than 60% in 2023. This leadership is reflective of the combination of our continued focus on high-quality customer growth and leading client loyalty.\nNow, let's take a look at our TTech fixed operating results, where TELUS delivered another quarter of industry best wireline customer growth. Indeed, our team achieved strong fourth quarter Internet net additions of $36,000.\nWe also continue to drive healthy growth in our TV product line with industry-leading net additions of 23,000, up 35% over the prior year despite modestly higher churn. Modest residential voice losses of 7,000 again represented an industry best result.\nStrong and leading security additions of 23,000 further reflect the momentum with respect to our successful multi-product penetration strategy. Overall, our industry-leading external fixed net additions of 75,000 demonstrate the strength of our unique and highly attractive bundled offers across our unmatched portfolio of products and services combined with our customer service excellence.\nThese are buttressed by our ever-expanding broadband networks, our leading customer centricity approach as well as our strong and highly differentiated social capitalism attributes that truly underpin the strength of the TELUS brand and culture in action in respect of our go-to-market activities.\nNotably, PCMag recognized TELUS as the fastest Internet service provider in Canada for the fourth consecutive year in 2023. The accolades that we have won for the superiority of our broadband networks across both mobile and fixed, illustrate the TELUS team's steadfast commitment to connecting Canadians to the people and to the information that matter most.\nFurthermore, the generational broadband network investments that TELUS is prudently made over the last decade, will continue to drive extensive socioeconomic benefits for Canadians and communities from coast to coast, whilst underpinning the continued advancement of our operational and financial performance at the TELUS organization.\nLet's turn now and look at TELUS Business Solutions, or TBS, which continues to contribute meaningfully to the success of the wider TELUS organization. TBS once again delivered another strong quarter with continued revenue and EBITDA growth.\nImpressively, TBS achieved its highest Q4 year-over-year EBITDA growth over the past 3 years. During the quarter, TBS continued its strong momentum in SMB and secured several notable wins with commercial and public sector organizations across Canada, accelerating the growth of both our core services and monetizing 5G through private wireless networks, connected worker, fleet and IoT connectivity management solutions.\nTELUS Agriculture and Consumer Goods, or TAC, has recently delivered the best back-to-back sales quarters on record in over 3 years in consumer goods and also realized the best quarter on record for digital animal agriculture.\nAs we move into 2024, we are looking to build upon this positive momentum and drive accelerated financial contributions on a consolidated basis. To support the next chapter of our winning growth strategy and reflective of our commitment to use our technology and data services to lead the world in social capitalism, we recently moved our TELUS Health business into TBS.\nSimilar to our earlier integration of TAC into TBS, this better positions our health business to leverage the expertise, the experience and high-performance culture and talent of our broader B2B teams.\nLooking now at our TELUS Health business. We achieved fourth quarter revenues of $432 million, alongside 24% year-over-year EBITDA growth and delivered total annual revenues of $1.7 billion in 2023.\nWe continue to execute on our global growth strategy and demonstrate our progress towards our goal to be the most trusted well-being company in the world. And this includes our health care services and programs now covering 70 million lives around the world, an increase of almost $2 million on a year-over-year basis.\nThis includes supporting health outcomes on 610 million digital health transactions during 2023, up 5% over last year and this includes increasing our Virtual Care membership to $5.6 million, up more than 24% over the prior year.\nSince acquiring LifeWorks in 2022, our team is committed to driving $427 million in annualized synergies by the end of 2025. This includes $327 million expected to be realized through operating cost synergies from continued integration and optimizing our organizational structure, our systems and our real estate portfolio.\nIn addition, we continue to anticipate $100 million or more from longer-term revenue synergies, driven by cross-selling health services products within our TELUS Health customer base and throughout our TELUS portfolio of assets, including TELUS Business Solutions, TELUS Partner Solutions, TELUS Agriculture and consumer goods and obviously, TELUS International.\nTo date, we've achieved $233 million in combined annualized synergies towards our overall objective of $427 million. These synergies will allow us to reinvest in the growth of our business and improve our profitability whilst we focus on delivering efficient, secure and best-in-class health and wellness solutions to our customers across the globe.\nNow, let's take a look at TELUS International. Earlier today, TI reported its fourth quarter and full year 2023 results with solid revenue growth, notwithstanding a continued challenging operating environment.\nImportantly, TI delivered on its commitment to improve profitability in the second half of the year, exiting the year with a strong margin profile more aligned with its historical trend. Our synergistic relationship offered incrementally more opportunities to partner with TI.\nAlongside continued momentum fueled by the AI solutions that TI provides to companies like Google, its second largest client, offsetting an otherwise softer demand environment. The improvement in TI's profitability also reflected meaningful cost efficiency efforts implemented during the year, realigning its cost base to better meet the near-term demand environment.\nOver the longer term, TI remains a compelling growth story with meaningful opportunities driven by digital transformation underpinned by robust and highly differentiated AI capabilities. Doug is going to provide further commentary on both TTech and TELUS International's results in just a moment.\nOur team's ability to consistently drive profitable growth over the longer term on the back of our differentiated asset base, best-in-class customer experience and world-leading networks alongside our unique growth businesses, provides us with confidence in the robust outlook for our business and delivering on the annual targets that we've announced for 2024.\nThese include TTech operating revenues and adjusted EBITDA increases of 2% to 4% and 5.5% to 7.5%, respectively. It includes consolidated CapEx of approximately $2.6 billion, and it includes consolidated free cash flow of approximately $2.3 billion, up circa 30% over 2023, supported by strong EBITDA growth and stable capital investments.\nOn a consolidated basis, our 2024 performance will be supported by the annual targets TI announced this morning. This includes revenue and EBITDA growth of 3% to 5% and 7% to 10%, respectively, supporting robust profitability and leading free cash flow yield in line with TI's historical average.\nCombining our outlook for TTech and TI, we expect consolidated operating revenues and adjusted EBITDA growth rates similar to those that were outlined for the TTech segment.\nFurthermore, the unparalleled skill innovation and, of course, the execution excellence of our team on our consistent and winning strategy underpins our industry-leading multiyear dividend growth program now in its 14th year through to the end of 2025, and we look forward to communicating our multiyear dividend growth program at our AGM in May.\nTo further buttress the sustainability of our consistently strong performance against the backdrop of the rapid transformation in our industry due to the evolving regulatory, competitive and macroeconomic environment, we continue to focus on executing extensive efficiency and effectiveness initiatives across the TELUS organization.\nImportantly, the transformational investments we have prudently made over the course of more than a decade in building the best culture and supporting industry-leading customer experiences over our globally leading wireless and pure fiber broadband networks, are enabling the progression of our accelerated plans to digitally revolutionize our business and further streamline our operating costs because this organization leads on digital and this organization has a unique update in TI.\nOur team's great. Brazil's an ability to embrace change and continuously evolve the way that we operate have enabled us to achieve our targeted team member reductions in 2023 with the full run rate of annualized cost savings expected to be realized in the second quarter of 2024.\nFurthermore, our intensified focus on cost efficiency is continuing into 2024, targeting restructuring investments of approximately $300 million over the course of the year. While these come with many difficult decisions, we continue to leverage our decade-long track record of successfully navigating exogenous factors in order to rise to the current challenges and future proof our business and deliver industry-leading operational, financial and value-creation results.\nAgainst the backdrop of these ongoing challenges, our TELUS family continues to bring our caring culture to life. Last year, our team members and retirees logged in unprecedented 1.5 million hours of volunteerism in communities across the globe. This is an unparalleled accomplishment that is more than any other company in the world.\nDue in part to our team's unsurpassed dedication to putting both our communities and customers first, the TELUS brand is increased in value from $10.3 billion in 2023 to circa $11.5 billion today as ranked in the Brand Finance 2024 global report.\nNotably, TELUS moved up 2 places to become the most valuable telco brand in Canada and the eighth most valuable brand nationally. And to think this brand was worth $600 million back in 2000. Myself and our entire leadership team as well as the TELUS Board of Directors remain exceedingly grateful for our team's passionate efforts to support our global communities as we strive to deliver outstanding results for all of our stakeholders.\nAnd on that note, I'll turn the call over to Uncle Doug.\n\nDouglas French\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Darren, and hello, everyone. In the fourth quarter, our team achieved strong operational and financial results, supported by our long-standing commitment to drive profitable customer growth, our product diversity, execution excellence, our leading customer service and our ongoing focus on efficiency and effectiveness.\nIn Mobility, continued mobile phone and connected device subscriber additions drove network revenue higher by 3.8% along with the moderating roaming revenue growth. We expect a highly competitive environment will continue to pressurize ARPU along with the lapping of the [indiscernible] recovery that we experienced in the first half of 2023.\nImportantly, we continue to focus on AMPU to drive the right economic outcomes. Our ongoing focus on efficiency and effectiveness will help drive sustainable EBITDA growth and margin accretion.\nOur strong AMPU performance is further evidenced by our mobility direct margin contribution, increasing by nearly 5% in the quarter. Fixed Data services grew 3.6% year-over-year, driven by strong customer growth across Internet security, TV and higher but moderating revenue per customer.\nHealth Services revenue increased by 5.1% over the prior period, primarily driven by demand for our products and services and continued adoption of our virtual care solutions. At the segment level, TTech operating revenues were up 2.6%, while TTech adjusted EBITDA increased 8% and adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 190 basis points supported through our efficiency program flow-through.\nIn DLCX, operating revenues from our existing customers were higher by 6.8% year-over-year, primarily from growth in our tech and games, e-commerce, fintech and other clients arising from additional services provided to existing customers and new customers added since the prior year, including those from the acquisition of Willow Tree. A strengthening of both the European euro and U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar also benefited in the period.\nDuring the fourth quarter, our TELUS International team continued to execute against its significant efficiency plans and meaningful of rightsizing to its cost structure. Notably, DLCX adjusted EBITDA was up 19% or closer to 6% when excluding the onetime earnout adjustment, while margins improved 120 basis points year-over-year.\nHeading into 2024, TI's focus on efficiency and organic growth will continue as we address some of the continued macroeconomic pressures.\nOverall, consolidated operating revenues increased by 2.6% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA grew by 9.4%. Consolidated net income was up 17% year-over-year, while basic EPS was up 18%. On an adjusted basis, net income was slightly up by just under 1%, while EPS was relatively flat.\nFree cash flow of $590 million in the fourth quarter increased by $267 million, driven by increased EBITDA growth, lower capital expenditures and taxes paid, partially offset by an increase in interest payments and higher restructuring disbursements.\nFor the full year, free cash flow of approximately $1.8 billion came in higher than our updated target of 1.5. The result was higher primarily for 2 items. The increase in restructuring reserve that we had deferred until 2024 of payments, which will flow into the first quarter and partially the second quarter.\nIn addition, the second was the handset financing of approximately $75 million, where promotions in the period were more focused on rate plans instead of device plans. Looking forward to our financial targets for 2024 and leading of the period. As Darren highlighted, our TTech revenue growth that will grow by 2% to 4% and TTech adjusted growth of EBITDA of 5.5% to 7.5%.\nOur financial outlook reflects continued healthy growth, while our core TTech business as we maintain our consistent focus on profitable growth driven by continued demand for superior bundled offerings over our leading networks. Our strategic focus to drive increased efficiency and effectiveness will also contribute to our financial outlook.\nFurthermore, in 2024, we anticipate improving financial contributions from TELUS International as well as TELUS Health and our TELUS Agriculture and consumer goods. Consolidated capital expenditures are targeted to remain stable at $2.6 billion, representing a consolidated capital intensity ratio of 13%, which is a historic low for TELUS.\nIn addition, we have earmarked $100 million for capital for real estate development initiatives similar to 2023 as we progress our copper to decommissioning program and work towards delivering our strategy and co-developing certain surplus real estate assets within our footprint.\nLastly, consolidated free cash flow for 2024 is forecasted to be $2.3 billion, driven by higher EBITDA and stable CapEx. The strong growth includes higher cash restructuring payments related to our efforts undertaken in 2023 as discussed earlier as well as incremental restructuring targeted in 2024.\nPutting it all together, and combined with TI's outlook announced earlier today, on a consolidated basis, we expect operating revenues and adjusted EBITDA to grow similar to that of TTech.\nAs we progress through 2024, we anticipate our adjusted EBITDA growth to build as the year progresses. A detailed list of our assumptions for 2024 are set out in our annual MD&A released today.\nOverall, we remain bullish on our ability to continue generating strong free cash flow for the years to come, benefiting from our industry-leading growth profile that consistently showcases our superior asset mix, our leading customer service and our operational execution excellence.\nThe strong position further supports our industry-leading dividend growth program in place through 2025 and beyond. Along with the de-levering of our balance sheet while continuing to make key strategic investments and continuing advancing our winning growth strategy.\nWith that, Robert, back to you.\n\nRobert Mitchell\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Doug.

I would like to introduce your speaker, Mr. Robert Mitchell. Please go ahead.\n\nRobert Mitchell\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nHello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Our third quarter 2023 results news release, MD&A, financial statements and detailed supplemental information were posted on our website this morning. On our call today, we'll begin with remarks by Darren, Doug and Zainul. For the Q&A portion, we will be joined by other members of our executive leadership team. Briefly, prepared remarks, slides and answers to questions contain forward-looking statements. Actual results could vary materially from these statements, the assumptions on which they are based and the material risks that could cause them to differ are outlined in our public filings with Securities Commissions in Canada and the U.S., including our third quarter 2023 and annual 2022 MD&A.\nWith that, over to you, Darren.\n\nDarren Entwistle\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, [ Roscoe, ] and hello, everyone. In the third quarter, our TELUS team once again demonstrated execution strength in our TTech business segment, characterized by the potent combination of leading customer growth alongside strong operational and financial results. This was complemented by sequential EBITDA improvement and margin expansion in our DLCX segment.\nNotably, we achieved our strongest quarter of telecom customer growth on record with total net additions of 406,000, up 17% on a year-over-year basis. This was driven by strong demand for our best-in-class portfolio of bundled services. Our all-time record customer growth is reflective of our dedicated team, who are passionate about consistently delivering customer experience excellence, leveraging our superior service offerings and digital capabilities over our world-leading wireless and PureFibre broadband networks. In the third quarter, we delivered solid consolidated operating revenue growth of 7.5% and resilient EBITDA growth of 5.5% in spite of the macroeconomic challenges TELUS International continues to manage through globally.\nLet's turn now to our TTech mobile operating results. TELUS achieved leading and record wireless customer growth of 339,000 net additions in the third quarter, up 24% over this time last year. This included strong Mobile Phone net additions of 160,000, up 7%. Notably, this represents our best third quarter on record and our best quarterly result since the second quarter of 2008. This strength was driven alongside our continued focus on profitable and margin-accretive customer growth. Indeed, this consistent and disciplined approach will continue throughout the fourth quarter and into 2024 to ensure our net adds exclusively drive EBITDA and cash flow accretion.\nIt also included leading an all-time record quarterly connected device net additions of 179,000, which was up 44% on a year-over-year basis. This reflects continued strong momentum with respect to our 5G and IoT B2B solutions that are so critical for the future. Importantly, our team delivered another quarter of industry best loyalty results, which continues to be the hallmark of the TELUS organization and is emblematic of our customers first culture in action.\nWhilst blended Mobile Phone churn of 1% and Postpaid churn of 0.84% were up slightly against the backdrop of heightened competitive activity, both represented industry best results. Notably, our Postpaid churn is now in the tenth consecutive year at less than 1%, and we'll soon be entering its 11th year. The close on Mobile third quarter ARPU of $59.19 was down slightly year-over-year as a result of intense promotional activity in the market and heightened activity in the flanker space. This was mitigated, however, by our long-standing focus on AMPU-accretive loading, driven by our team's passion for winning and retaining profitable customers. At the same time, we are maintaining a keen eye on efficiency by remaining highly disciplined on device subsidies and leveraging our leading digital capabilities.\nFurthermore, connected devices and IoT will increasingly be an important contributor to network revenue, ARPU and AMPU growth in the quarters ahead. Indeed, our solid ARPU and leading churn continued to drive our industry best mobile phone lifetime revenue, which consistently exceeds our national peers by a considerable margin. This is reflective of the combination of our continued focus on high-quality customer growth and leading client loyalty, enabled by our highly engaged team, who passionately deliver superior service offerings over our world-leading broadband networks, offering customers the fastest, most expansive and most reliable service in Canada.\nLet's turn now and take a look at our fixed operating results. TELUS delivered another quarter of robust external fixed net additions of 67,000 in the third quarter. This represented an industry-leading result of the company's reporting to date. Moreover, it included strong and steady Internet net additions of 37,000, powered by the significant advantages of TELUS' extensive PureFibre network.\nOur leading performance reflects the continued strength and success of our unique and highly attractive bundled offerings across our truly unmatched portfolio of products and services. These are buttressed by our ever-expanding globally leading PureFibre and 5G networks, all of which are backed by our long-standing customer-centric culture. I'll turn the call over to Zainul in a moment to provide further color on our consumer TTech performance.\nLet's turn now and take a look at TELUS Business Solutions, or TBS, which continues to contribute meaningfully to the success of the wider TELUS organization. Notably, this includes delivering another strong quarter with continued revenue and EBITDA growth. Our performance reflects the strength of execution and cost transformation and our highly differentiated solutions, market segment and geographic diversification. It is also indicative of how we uniquely extend our social purpose through our stand with owner's brand promise, including technology solutions that empower businesses to thrive in an increasingly digital world.\nDuring the quarter, our TBS team secured several notable wins to bring our highly differentiated assets and capabilities to meet the evolving needs of our customers. This included a significant strategic deal with Flo to provide TELUS' world-leading connectivity to the most extensive electric vehicle network footprint in Canada, as well as underpinning a record-setting quarter for connected devices performance.\nSince announcing the move of TELUS Agriculture and Consumer Goods, or TAC, to TBS, we've begun executing a robust strategic plan, leveraging the strengths of both organizations to capture the market opportunity across the business, also allowing us to streamline our focus, align the right talent, the key leadership roles and of course, as always, improve our cost structure. Whilst TAC revenues of $83 million in the quarter were relatively flat against the backdrop of ongoing macroeconomic headwinds, we remain strongly confident in the positive outlook for this exciting business.\nNotably, our Consumer Goods business had its strongest sales quarter in over 3 years, with a strong sales funnel to continue that momentum going forward into 2024. TAC is exceedingly well positioned as the globally leading provider of digital technology and data insights, leveraging its superior products, platforms, distribution channels and enviable client base to scale this business into a true asset of consequence and deliver meaningful and sustained growth for the TELUS organization. Furthermore, we are accelerating efforts to build AI capabilities into the full suite of product offerings to capitalize on data commercialization and monetization across animal agriculture, agronomy and rebate management, and as well our consumer goods capabilities of trade promotion management and retail execution.\nLet's turn now and take a look at our TELUS Health business. We achieved third quarter revenues of $422 million in TELUS Health, alongside 20% EBITDA growth normalizing for LifeWorks. We continue to execute on our global growth strategy and progress towards our goal of being the most trusted well-being company in the world, accelerated by the acquisition of LifeWorks. And this includes our health care services and programs now covering nearly 70 million lives around the world, an increase of more than 9 million on a year-over-year basis. It includes supporting health outcomes on nearly 151 million digital health transactions during the third quarter, up more than 5% over the same period a year ago. And it includes increasing our Virtual Care membership to 5.5 million, up nearly 40% over the prior year.\nAs we evolve to answer the needs of our customers worldwide, we foresee TELUS Health continuing its double-digit growth over the medium and longer term. Indeed, since acquiring LifeWorks, our team is committed to driving $427 million in annualized synergies by the end of 2025. This includes $327 million expected to be realized through operating cost synergies from continued integration and optimizing our organizational structure, systems and our real estate portfolio. Furthermore, we continue to anticipate $100 million from longer-term revenue synergies driven by cross-selling health service products within our TELUS Health customer base and throughout our TELUS portfolio of assets, including TELUS International.\nTo date, we've achieved $194 million in combined annualized synergies towards our overall objective. These synergies will allow us to reinvest in the growth of our business, and as well, improve our profitability whilst we focus on delivering efficient, secure and best-in-class health and wellness solutions to our customers.\nNotably, we continue to grow our revenue opportunities globally with significant wins in Canada, the U.S. and Europe exemplified by deals won year-to-date, representing over $450 million in total contract value. Indeed, in the third quarter alone, we closed several material deals across our employer line of business, our payer and provider line of business and our retirement benefit solutions portfolios. The strength of our combined health and well-being solutions and services remain unmatched in the marketplace.\nNow let's turn and take a look at TELUS International. Earlier today, TI reported steady year-over-year revenue growth, a meaningful improvement in sequential profitability and margins, and reiterated its 2023 full year outlook. Revenue growth was driven by a combination of higher volumes and the ramp-up of projects across key clients, notably within TELUS International's AI data solutions, demonstrating the significant potential in the AI space and portending what is to come in the quarters and years ahead.\nTI's adjusted EBITDA margin increased meaningfully quarter-over-quarter, a positive trend that we expect to continue in the fourth quarter and into 2024. The strong improvement reflects the team's considerable efforts to realize the significant cost savings from our cost efficiency program aimed at rebalancing supply and demand factors across TI's operations, most notably those in Europe. Despite the near-term macroeconomic pressures that TI has faced this year, we remain highly confident in TI's strategy and TI's investment thesis. This is amplified by meaningful opportunities in respect of digital transformation, particularly with generative AI adoption and the continuing critical importance of differentiated digital consumer and B2B business experience solutions in the overall marketplace.\nIn this regard, earlier this week, TI launched Fuel iX, an enhanced end-to-end offering that integrates generative AI in the clients' customer experience ecosystems, enabled by TI's capability in digital consulting, TI's capability in data analytics, their capabilities in self-serve applications and TI's leveraging of their AI-enabled platform integration. Critically, Fuel iX helps companies overcome disjointed data and organization silos and ensures that AI is thoughtfully embedded in the functionality of day-to-day client experience, operations and workflows, driving better outcomes and driving better inherent efficiency. Moreover, TI offers an accelerator program that unlocks gen AI potential with a clear path to production for companies at the start of their AI journeys, representing a vibrant tailwind for TI's medium and long-term growth and profitability. Doug is going to provide further commentary on both TTech and TELUS International's third quarter results in just a moment.\nThe significant broadband network investments that we've made and those that we continue to make enable the advancement of our financial and operational performance and underpin the long-term sustainability of our industry-leading dividend growth program. The 7.1% year-over-year dividend increase announced today represents the 25th increase since we initiated our multiyear dividend growth program in 2011, which is now in its 13th year. Since 2004, TELUS has returned more than $24 billion to shareholders, including over $19 billion in dividends, representing approximately $17 on a per-share basis.\nOur robust outlook for the continuity of our strong free cash flow expansion portends well for future dividend growth, particularly in the context of our dividend payout ratio guideline of 60% to 75% and the opportunity for increases as we prospectively approach the lower end of that range in the quarters and years ahead. Indeed, this represents an attractive investment scenario, particularly in combination with our dividend growth program for a 7% to 10% annual growth through 2025 and an attractive current dividend yield of well over 6%.\nTo buttress our consistently strong performance against the backdrop of rapid transformation in our industry and the evolving regulatory, competitive and macroeconomic environment, we continue to focus on executing the extensive efficiency and effectiveness initiative across TELUS that we announced back in the month of August. Importantly, the transformational investments we've prudently made over the course of more than a decade in building the best culture and enabling industry-leading customer experiences over our globally leading wireless and PureFibre broadband networks are allowing us to accelerate our well progressed plans to digitally revolutionize our business and further streamline our operating costs.\nOur team's grit, resilience and ability to embrace change and continuously evolve the way that we operate have enabled us to substantially complete the targeted team member reductions. The incremental cost savings are expected to more meaningfully contribute to fourth quarter EBITDA, with the full run rate expected to be felt by the second quarter of next year. Whilst this initiative has certainly come with many difficult decisions, we've leveraged our decades-long track record of successfully navigating exogenous factors, from regulatory and competitive, to macroeconomic, and most recently through the global pandemic in order to rise and answer the current challenges and future-proof our business and all of our profitable growth aspirations.\nImportantly, your company's global leadership in social capitalism was exemplified by the recent launch of the $50 million TELUS Student Bursary, the largest bursary fund in all of Canada. The TELUS Student Bursary will enable thousands of young people who might otherwise lack the means to enrich their lives through post-secondary education at a university, college or technical vocational school. Our annual bursary program will empower these leaders of tomorrow to pursue their ambitions, realize their potential and create a brighter future for themselves and their communities. Myself and our entire leadership team as well as the TELUS Board of Directors remain exceedingly grateful for our team's passionate efforts to support our global communities as we strive to deliver outstanding results for all of our stakeholders.\nFinally, from the head and from the heart, I'd like to conclude by extending my sincere appreciation to my long-term colleague and friend, Jim Senko. Today marks Jim's final TELUS investor call before he retires at the end of the year. Over the past 22 years, Jim's amazing dedication to TELUS and his team, alongside his tremendous skill and expertise, have set a remarkably high standard of excellence for our entire organization. I know I speak on behalf of our entire leadership team when I say we will dearly miss Jim's considerable skill, his relentless competitive spirit and his outstanding ingenuity in respect of delivering innovative programs and exceptional outcomes for our customers. Thank you, Jim, for the many outstanding contributions, and congratulations on a truly, truly, truly outstanding career.\n\nJim Senko\n\nEVP & Chief Product Officer of Consumer Solutions\n\nThank you.\n\nDarren Entwistle\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nOn that note, I'll turn the call over to Zai. Zai, over to you.\n\nZainul Mawji\n\nEVP & President of Telus Consumer Solutions\n\nThank you, Darren. Amidst an intensely dynamic market, we remain steadfast in our commitment to our consistent strategy, demonstrated by our strong results and driven by our dedicated team, who relentlessly put our customers first, provide the best products and services in our industry and passionately believe in our social purpose.\nAs Darren highlighted, our winning strategy has resulted in another record quarter for mobility loading, including robust share within the new Canadian and other key growing segments. In addition, our household intensification strategy is yielding impressive results. This has translated into industry-leading customer retention rates and strong customer loyalty. Our leading Postpaid churn is resulting in an industry-best customer lifetime value of over $5,900. Our focus on product intensity has yielded superior churn and also optimized acquisition and retention costs.\nWhile ARPU momentum has softened by competitive aggression, deceleration of roaming growth versus pre-pandemic performance and a skew in loading towards lower ARPU segments, we remain disciplined on quality profitable loading. Growth in the newcomer segment has been predominantly through our [ Public ] and [ Kudo ] brands, which are heavily digitized and have a lower cost to serve. We have achieved our tenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year network revenue growth, supported by a 60% year-over-year growth in the percentage of our base on 5G-enabled devices.\nMobility direct margin growth is outpacing revenue growth by 35%, or 4.2% versus 3.1%, respectively. Our device subsidy per subscriber is declining at a 3.5x faster rate than ARPU as customers step up to access device discounts. And as a result of our transformative cost evolution, we have reduced overall cost to serve by 4% year-over-year. This underscores our historic commitment to focus on profitable customer growth, an axiom that has served us well in the past and one we will continue into the future.\nIn fixed, customers continue to choose TELUS over our competitors. We have achieved year-over-year growth in Internet net additions in 5 of the last 6 quarters, enabled by our network superiority with PureFibre as we expand our premium leadership in the West through the launch of symmetrical 3- gigabit-per-second high speed, which is 20x the upload cap of the competition on a vastly more reliable network. This has supported a 19% year-over-year growth in the percentage of our base on 1-gig-plus plans.\nIn August, U.S.-based PC Mag named TELUS the fastest Internet service provider in Canada for the fourth consecutive year and the best Internet service provider for Alberta and British Columbia. This demonstrates our commitment to connecting Canadians to the people and information that matter most and underscores the tremendous value of our generational investments in world-leading wire line and wireless network technologies.\nPureFiber continues to yield superior results, including markedly higher products for household, 68% fewer outside plant repairs and resulting in a 26% higher margin per household. PureFiber Internet churn is 31% lower than copper, driving higher customer lifetime value. Our long track record of positive subscriber growth in video also continued in Q3 with our strongest growth in over 10 quarters. This hinged on the success of our industry-leading video platform, which offers bundled premium and OTT content in addition to the success of Stream+, our affordable OTT aggregation offering for cord shavers that is resonating significantly among customers across the country.\nAs Darren conveyed, our focus on innovation to provide the most comprehensive suite of products in the industry underpins our leading bundling strategy. We will continue to enhance the breadth and depth of our portfolio, offering unparalleled value to our customers with smart home security and automation, Stream+ and our unique suite of consumer health products like TELUS Health MyCare and MyPet. These results demonstrate our company's ability to drive consistent growth, deliver strong customer loyalty and maximize household lifetime value.\nIn what is anticipated to be a seasonally competitive fourth quarter, we will maintain our long-standing focus on quality, profitable customer growth that will deliver positive financial outcomes, including AMPU and cash flow per subscriber. Finally, if I could take a moment to echo Darren's comments and thank Jim for his unwavering dedication to our team. Jim, your outstanding leadership has set the team up well for the future. I am grateful for your partnership and support. We wish you all the best in this next chapter. Now I'll hand it over to Doug.\n\nDouglas French\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Zainul, and hello, everyone. Mobile network revenue increased 3.4% year-over-year, driven by strong subscriber additions, which has been supported by Canadian population growth. ARPU growth declined by 0.5% in Q3, given the competitive environment, particularly within flanker and as roaming revenue growth slowed. Overall, AMPU is strong as we predominantly focus on profitable loading, cost reduction and service delivery, managing device subsidies to higher value loading and as we leverage our leading digital capabilities.\nOur strong AMPU performance is further evidenced by our strong mobility direct margin contribution increasing by 4.2% in the quarter, notably exceeding mobile network revenue growth of 3.4%. On a year-to-date basis, ARPU is higher by 1.6%. And for the fourth quarter, we anticipate ARPU on a year-over-year basis to improve relative to Q3 through a continued focus on profitable loading, strong base management, leveraging our product superiority and bundling and including strong growth in connected devices.\nFixed data service revenue grew by 4.9% year-over-year, driven primarily by strong customer growth in Internet security and TV and higher but moderating revenue per Internet customer. Within fixed data, residential Internet grew 10% year-over-year, a leading result primarily driven by continued market share gains. Health Service revenue increased by 88% or $197 million over Q3 last year, reflecting the contribution from LifeWorks as well as continued organic growth. As a reminder, we have now lapped the LifeWorks acquisition on a year-over-year basis as of September 1.\nEBITDA contribution in our Health business area, which excludes shared services from TELUS, continues to grow at a very good rate in the mid-teens, which will include any -- which we expect to increase in 2024 and beyond, benefiting from organic growth, revenue cross-sell synergies and significant cost synergies. Overall, TTech operating revenues were up 7.8% over last year, and adjusted EBITDA grew by 7%.\nDLCX operating revenues from external customers were up 5.8% year-over-year, driven by additional services provided to existing and new customers, including those from the acquisition of WillowTree. A strengthening of both the Canadian -- sorry, the U.S. and European dollar against the Canadian dollar also benefited revenue growth. DLCX adjusted EBITDA was down 6.5%, primarily due to revenue pressures from some of their larger technology customers, partially offset by the rightsizing of their cost structure.\nDuring the third quarter, our International team executed against its significant and ongoing efficiency plans to meaningfully rightsize that cost structure. Notably, as compared to the prior quarter, DLCX EBITDA improved 12 percentage points to adjusted EBITDA margin and increased 410 basis points to 21%. Heading into the fourth quarter, these ongoing efforts put TI in a strong position to continue to build on this momentum.\nOverall, consolidated operating revenues increased by 7.5% and adjusted EBITDA of 5.5%. On an adjusted basis, net income was lower by 21% as higher depreciation, amortization and interest costs offset the strong adjusted EBITDA growth. While we have substantially completed our targeted headcount reductions that we announced in August, including approximately 4,000 in TTech and 2,000 team members within DLCX, we anticipate consolidated restructuring and other costs to remain elevated in the fourth quarter of up to approximately $175 million, all within our revised outlook that we gave last quarter as we continue to implement our efficiency programs, including nonlabor initiatives.\nFree cash flow in the quarter was up $355 million, increased by 7.3%, driven by lower CapEx, higher EBITDA and partially offset by our higher restructuring costs and cash interest paid. Our balance sheet remains strong, as evidenced by our successful multi-tranche $1.75 billion debt offering in September, including our fifth sustainability-linked bond, which contributes to TELUS' position as the largest SLB issuer in Canada. The average cost of our long-term debt stands at 34.33% at the end of Q3, well below current rates. In addition, we expect -- or in addition, we have our long-term debt to maturity of 12 years, and our ratio of fixed to floating is at 85%.\nAs we progress through the seasonality -- competitive final quarter of 2024, we remain in a strong operating and financial position. Today, we reconfirmed our 2023 financial targets. Our positive outlook reflects the confidence we have in our business to successfully navigate through a dynamic and competitive macroeconomic environment globally. Our outlook is further supported by our significant investments in our cost efficiency, which we are expected to begin yielding more notable savings in the fourth quarter and well beyond. Furthermore, our go-to-market strategy remains consistent in prioritizing strong economic and financial outcomes, including EBITDA and cash flow accretion, balanced against the focus of profitable customer growth.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Robert.\n\nRobert Mitchell\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Doug. [ Mihai ], we're ready to proceed with the questions, please.",

I would like to introduce your speaker, Robert Mitchell. Please go ahead.\n\nRobert Mitchell\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nHello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Our second quarter 2023 results news release, MD&A and financial statements and detailed supplemental investor information were posted on our website this morning.\nOn our call today, we'll begin with remarks by Darren and Doug. As usual, for the Q&A portion of our call, we will be joined by a range of other executive leaders, [indiscernible], Consumer Solutions; Navin Arora, Business Solutions; Jim Senko, Chief Product Officer; Tony Geheran, COO; Jeff Puritt, President and CEO of TI and Sid Kosaraju, President of TELUS.\nBriefly, this presentation and answers to questions contain forward-looking statements. Actual results could vary materially from these statements. The assumptions on which they are based and the material risks that could cause them to differ are outlined in our public filings with the Securities commissions including second quarter 2023 and annual 2022 MD&As.\nWith that, Darren, over to you.\n\nDarren Entwistle\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThanks very much, and hello, everyone. In the second quarter, our TELUS team once again demonstrated execution strength in our TTech business segment, characterized by the potent combination of leading overall customer growth, complemented by strong operational and financial results.\nThe robust performance in our Communications Technology business continues to be underpinned by our globally leading broadband networks and of course, our customer-centric culture. This enabled our strongest second quarter on record, with total customer net additions of 293,000, up 19% on a year-over-year basis, driven by strong demand for our superior product portfolio and service excellence. Our leading customer growth is reflective of our consistent industry-best client loyalty across both mobile and our fixed product lines.\nThe TELUS team's passion for delivering customer experience excellence contributed to blended and postpaid mobile phone pure fiber Internet and residential voice churn all being below 1% yet again this quarter.\nI'll pick it up here on the interruption. I was speaking to the fact that mobile phone churn is now in its 10th consecutive year of being less than 1%, and our pure fiber Internet product has been below the 1% threshold now for 14 consecutive quarters. This is quite the unique combination that certainly bodes well for the future of the organization.\nIn the second quarter, we delivered strong consolidated revenue growth of 13% and resilient EBITDA growth of 5% in spite of the macroeconomic challenges impacting TELUS International. Alongside that, we generated strong free cash flow growth of 36%.\nLet's turn now to have a look at our mobile operating results at TELUS. TELUS achieved leading wireless customer growth of 234,000 net additions in the second quarter. This included strong mobile phone net additions of 110,000, our best second quarter result since 2010. Notably, this strength was driven alongside our continued focus on high-quality and profitable customer growth. It also included record second quarter connected device net additions of 124,000, which were up 35% on a year-over-year basis. This reflects continued strong momentum with respect to our 5G and our IoT B2B solutions that are so critical for the future.\nImportantly, our team delivered another quarter of industry fast loyalty results, which continues, of course, to be the hallmark of the TELUS organization and is emblematic of our customers' first culture in action in terms of the empirical results it generates. Blended mobile phone churn was an industry low 0.91%. Moreover, our industry-leading postpaid mobile phone churn of 0.73% represents the 10th quarter out of the last 14 that we have earned a customer loyalty rate below 0.8%. This clearly distinguishes TELUS from our competitors and indeed, it is a result that is unsurpassed in North America with a churn rate that is amongst the lowest globally.\nOur consistently strong performance is powered by our highly engaged team who passionately deliver superior service offerings and digital capabilities over our world-leading broadband networks, offering customers the fastest, most expansive and most reliable service in Canada.\n[indiscernible] on mobile industry-leading second quarter ARPU growth of 1.8% over last year was supported by roaming improvements as a result of increased international travel. It was also buttressed by higher domestic monthly recurring revenue as well as our industry-based churn rates, whereby we are retaining our highest value customers in addition, of course, to growth in connected devices and IoT revenues. This once again drove strong industry best organic network revenue growth of 6% in the quarter.\nNotably, our leading mobile phone lifetime revenue continues to exceed our national peers by up to 70%. This has been a consistent story at the TELUS organization for a very long time. This is reflective of the combination of our continued focus on high-quality customer growth and leading client loyalty delivered consistently as is the hallmark of our company.\nTurning now to our fixed operating results where TELUS delivered industry-leading second quarter wireline customer growth. Our team achieved leading Internet net additions of 35,000 in the quarter, up 3% on a year-over-year basis, powered by leading customer loyalty in combination with the significant advantages of TELUS' extensive pure fiber network.\nWe continue to drive leading growth in our TV product line with net additions of 17,000 and which was up 13% on a year-over-year basis. Furthermore, residential voice losses were again an industry low at 8,000 and were relatively flat over this time last year.\nNotably, this leading performance reflects our continued momentum with respect to multi-product intensity and the inherent churn benefits that have been so consistently successful for the TELUS organization. healthy and leading security net additions of 15,000 further reflect our successful strategy of driving profitable customer growth and multiproduct penetration.\nOverall, we drove robust and industry-leading external fixed net additions of 59,000 in the second quarter. This performance is indicative of the strength of our unique and highly attractive bundled offerings across our truly unmatched portfolio of products and services, buttressed by our ever-expanding, globally leading pure fiber and 5G networks, all wrapped within our customer-centric culture.\nIndeed, the generational investments that we've made in the global best network technologies that are the cornerstone of our leading customer growth and the significant ongoing profitable market share gains that we have driven over so many years and will continue to do so on a go-forward basis. Furthermore, these investments will continue to drive important and extensive socioeconomic benefits for our communities and Canadian citizens for many, many, many decades to come.\nLet's turn now and take a look at TELUS Business Solutions. Our team within TELUS Business Solutions continues to deliver on its track record of contributing meaningfully to the success of the wider TELUS organization. Notably, this includes delivering another strong quarter with 6% revenue growth and profitable EBITDA contribution growth across our B2B product lines. This is enabled by a team that is absolutely dedicated to propelling its position as one of the leading B2B organizations on the planet and it's a story of differentiation at TELUS versus our peers.\nDuring the quarter, our team secured several notable wins to bring our highly differentiated assets and capabilities to meet the evolving needs of our customers. This included a significant deal to deploy our intelligent smart building technology that will modernize retail operations for H&M 1 of the world's leading retailers.\nWe recently moved our TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods business, or TAC into TBS. This will clearly support enhanced efficiency and effectiveness measures and is reflective of our collective commitment in respect of realizing quantum growth in our compelling TAC business.\nSecond quarter TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods revenues of $79 million were relatively flat on a year-over-year basis, and this disappoints us. It reflects headwinds in our agribusiness vertical due to softness related to macroeconomic challenges and as well it reflects onetime professional services revenues that were realized in the second quarter of 2022.\nWe continue to expect progress on our top line and to see that flow through to profitability in this business for the second half of 2023, resulting in positive annual growth. The TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods team will leverage the expertise, the leverage the experience, and to leverage the high-performance culture and talent of our TDS team, ensuring that we are well positioned to accelerate our customers for sales, marketing, channel and holistic go-to-market efforts, including exciting and plentiful cross-selling opportunities.\nTELUS remains steadfast in our objective to accelerate and significantly scale our TAC business into a potent asset of consequence focused on becoming the world's largest global independent provider of digital technologies and data insights, connecting customers from producers to consumers across the agricultural products, food and packaged goods industries.\nLet's turn now and take a look at our TELUS Health business unit. We achieved second quarter revenues of $428 million in TELUS Health, up 212%. Notably, when normalizing for LifeWorks, EBITDA grew by 11%. These results reflect the continued growth and increasing scale of our health operations since our acquisition of LifeWorks in 2022 enabling us to make meaningful progress on our goal to be the most trusted, well-being company in the world. And this includes covering more than 68 million [ lines ] around the world with our health care services and health care programs, an increase of nearly 46 million on a year-over-year basis and includes supporting health outcomes on nearly 153 million digital health transactions during the second quarter of 2023. This was up more than 5% over the same period a year ago.\nIt includes increasing our Virtual Care membership to 5.3 million. up nearly 50% over the prior year. We expect TELUS Health to continue its sustained growth and a sustained expansion underpinned by the integration and innovation of our diverse product suite and care delivery that enables us to support the evolving needs of our customers around the world.\nImportantly, since acquiring LifeWorks, our team has now committed to driving $425 million in annualized synergies by the end of 2025, up from $250 million. This includes $325 million expected to be realized through operating cost synergies from continued integration, continued optimizing of our organizational structure, systems and, of course, optimizing the real estate portfolio of TELUS Health within the wider TELUS fold.\nFurthermore, we expect to drive at least $100 million from revenue synergies over the same period, fueled by cross-selling health services and the potent products that we have within our portfolio to our TELUS Health customer base, but also across the wider TELUS portfolio of assets. The realization of these synergies will allow us to reinvest in the growth of the business and improve our profitability, whilst we focus on delivering efficient, effective 6 year and truly best-in-class health and wellness solutions to our customers.\nNotably, to date, we've achieved $127 million in combined annualized synergies towards this overall objective of $425 million.\nNow let's take a look at TELUS International. As we announced in July, increasing macroeconomic pressure has temporarily impacted service demand from some of TI's larger tech clients as they aggressively address their own cost structures, slowing expected revenue and profit growth for 2023.\nIn response, our TI team has actioned significant incremental cost efficiency programs including staff reductions to address lower service volumes. TI importantly is also driving additional automation and generative AI-enabled solutions to further optimize its cost structure, and of course, its go-to-market sales opportunities, which are significant. Despite these near-term challenges, we at TELUS remain highly confident in TI's strategy, the team and their investment thesis. This is amplified by meaningful opportunities in respect of digital transformation, particularly within generative AI adoption and the continuing critical importance of differentiated digital customer experience solutions in the market, which remains a vibrant tailwind for TI's medium- and long-term growth and profitability. Doug will provide further commentary on both TTech and TELUS International's second quarter results in just a moment.\nBefore I close, let me turn to the significant investment which we are announcing today in an extensive efficiency and effectiveness initiative across TELUS. This is against the backdrop of rapid transformation in our industry and the ways in which our customers want to engage with us. Furthermore, it is in response to the evolving regulatory, competitive and macroeconomic environment that we currently face and where we want to realize success within.\nImportantly, the transformational investments that we are prudently making now are building upon the saying when investments that TELUS has made over the course of 2 decades in building the best culture and enabling industry-leading customer experiences over our globally leading wireless and pure fiber broadband networks, and they are allowing us to accelerate our well progressed plans to digitally revolutionize our business and further streamline operating costs meaningfully that bodes so well for the future success of this organization.\nThe generational investments we have made are fueling significant economic efficiencies and will ensure we remain market leaders in driving innovation and value for our customers, realizing profitable growth for our shareholders and supporting our team members and the communities within which we live, work and serve.\nThe accelerated program we are announcing today will yield expected cumulative annual cost savings of more than $325 million. Building smartly upon the terrific digital progress that this organization has made on a leading basis over the last few years, aided and embedded by the TELUS International Organization. Whilst this investment will temporarily dilute our strong free cash flow in 2023, importantly, it will support stronger free cash flow expansion in the years ahead as well as the progression and affordability of our leading multiyear dividend growth program.\nGiven the scale of this incremental program, it is with a heavy heart that we are proceeding with 6,000 staff reductions across our global footprint, including approximately 4,000 in TTech and 2,000 at TELUS International including offering early retirement and voluntary departure packages.\nAs a result of these extremely difficult decisions, we now expect incremental restructuring investments of up to $475 million in 2023. Our winning strategy at TELUS remains unchanged and our transformational efforts will be buttressed by our decade-long track record of successfully navigating exogenous factors from regulatory and competitive to macroeconomic and most recently, through the global pandemic, where we distinguished ourselves so admirably. Our resilience and ability to embrace change and continuously evolve the way we operate our cornerstones of our TELUS culture and the technology that we deploy in combination. And these 2 things will continue to fuel our future and all the success that we will realize.\nIn closing, I'd like to extend my sincere appreciation to our more than 80,000 team members, retirees, family members and friends who have collectively volunteered in 260 communities across 32 countries, thus far for our 18th annual TELUS Days of Giving making 2023, our most giving year yet. Indeed, since 2000, our TELUS family has contributed 2.2 million days of volunteerism, more than any other company in the world, helping to improve the lives of people across the globe that need a helping hand.\nMyself, our leadership team and the TELUS Board of Directors remain exceedingly grateful for our team's passionate efforts to support our global communities as we strive to deliver outstanding results for all of our stakeholders, exemplifying our world leadership in social capitalism. And on that note, I'll hand the call over to Doug.\n\nDouglas French\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Darren, and hi, everyone. Mobile network revenue increased by 6% year-over-year, our 9th straight quarter of strong year-over-year growth. driven by high-quality customer additions, which has been supported by record population growth, along with higher mobile ARPU.\nOur growth has been also supported by our superior product bundling across home and mobile, customer service excellence and globally leading networks. Our ARPU growth of 1.8% in Q2 reflects -- 1.8% in Q2 reflects the continuing roaming benefits, however, at a lower level as we lapped the Q1 recovery. We anticipate roaming to remain positive contributor to grow in Q3 and Q4, but in smaller increments.\nDespite a highly competitive operating environment, particularly in the flanker space, we delivered positive year-over-year growth in domestic ARPU in the second quarter, reflecting high-quality loading and strong base management. As we progress through the back half of the year, we are targeting ARPU growth approaching 2% for 2023.\nFixed Data Services revenue growth grew by 6.2% year-over-year, driven primarily by strong customer growth across Internet, Security and TV and higher revenue per Internet customer. Within fixed, we also achieved strong B2B growth of 5%.\nOur leading fixed customer growth reflects our superior bundled offers and our leading pure fiber network. Customers are continuing to move to our higher Internet speed tiers, recognizing the superior customer excellence of our pure fiber network, the compelling value of symmetrical speeds and the value and reliability of our leading portfolio bundled offerings.\nOn the B2B front, inclusive of both mobile and fixed services, we continue to see positive financial results with revenue and EBITDA contribution up year-over-year. Health revenue increased by $291 million in Q2 over last year, primarily reflecting the contribution of LifeWorks as well as organic growth. EBITDA contribution in our health business area continues to grow steadily, along with margins in the mid-teens, which we anticipate to increase over time.\nAs part of our broader cost efficiency program, our health team is improving their cost structure as we actively and complete the LifeWorks integration. Longer term, we continue to anticipate meaningful health revenue synergies from cross-selling opportunities and continued margin expansion, benefiting from the cost optimization. Overall, TTech revenues were up nearly 14% over last year, and adjusted EBITDA grew by 8.1%.\nIn TI, we pre-released the second quarter results on July 13. Operating revenues from external customers were higher by 7.6% year-over-year, driven by additional services provided by existing clients and new clients, including those from our WillowTree acquisition. A strengthening of the U.S. to Canadian dollar exchange also benefit the DLCX revenue growth. DLCX adjusted EBITDA was down 19%, consistent with the pre-release last month -- earlier this month, primarily due to the reduction in service revenues from larger tech clients combined with higher service delivery costs in our AI business. These imbalances are due to the timing of some of the European labor reduction regulations and will be part of our future cost reduction initiatives.\nOur TELUS TI team remains firmly focused on managing through these near-term headwinds with a keen eye on efficiency and effectiveness in order to support their margin and cash flow generation. Overall, consolidated operating revenues increased by 13% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA grew by 5%. Consolidated net income and EPS were both down approximately 60% due to higher depreciation and amortization from our growing asset base, including LifeWorks [indiscernible] and our generational investments in pure fiber and 5G networks.\nMacroeconomics, notably our DLCX operating segment also impacted EPS and higher financing costs from our higher debt outstanding, reflecting the investments in our growth strategy as well as higher interest rates. In Q2, net income and EPS were also impacted by higher restructuring costs, as it relates to our cost efficiency initiatives.\nFree cash flow of $279 million increased 36% year-over-year, primarily by lower capital expenditures and higher adjusted EBITDA. This was partially offset by the increase in cash interest paid, higher restructuring, primarily due to the lump sum payments from the ratification of our TWE agreement and our ongoing efficiency programs.\nAs announced on July 13, we revised our annual target for consolidated revenue and adjusted EBITDA to reflect TELUS International's updated outlook. Notably, the implied annual financial target for our TTech operating segment remains unchanged. Today, we updated our 2023 free cash flow guidance to reflect the higher expected restructuring disbursements related to the accelerated cost efficiency programs throughout all parts of our organization.\nWhile these decisions are difficult to undertake, they reflect our innovation for our customers, and are required -- the requirement to address the pressures from the current regulatory competitive macroeconomic environments while embracing our significant digital progression.\nRestructuring costs are now anticipated to be up to $750 million for the full year, an increase of $475 million from our original assumption. As Darren highlighted, the annual cost savings from the incremental accelerated program are anticipated to be approximately $325 million for the full year and about 80% of that will be to the TTech segment. Of the $325 million, we anticipate a small portion of the benefits to begin accruing in the back half of this year.\nConsistent with our capital plan, we anticipate approximately 85% of our annual capital expenditures of our $2.6 billion target to be in the first 3 quarters of the year and we reaffirmed our $2.6 billion guidance for the year on CapEx. The expected decline in our capital program in Q4 is aligned with our seasonal build plan.\nOur growth profile and robust balance sheet position continue to -- and our well-established dividend program will continue into the future. The initiatives we take today will be supporting all of that. We will continue to focus on executing our cost efficiency and effectiveness opportunities driving down our cost structure on a permanent basis.\nWith that, we'll turn it over to Robert for the Q&A.\n\nRobert Mitchell\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Doug. Fredric, could we please proceed with questions?",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI would like to turn the conference call over to our host, Amir Rozwadowski, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nAmir Rozwadowski\n\nSenior VP of Finance & Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter call. I'm Amir Rozwadowski, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today are John Stankey, our CEO; and Pascal Desroches, our CFO.\nBefore we begin, I need to call your attention to our safe harbor statement. It says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they're subject to risks and uncertainties described in AT&T's SEC filings. Results may differ materially. Additional information, including our earnings materials, are available on the Investor Relations website.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to John Stankey. John?\n\nJohn T. Stankey\n\nChief Executive Officer, WarnerMedia, AT&T, Inc.\n\nThanks, Amir, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining us. Earlier today, we shared our first quarter results, which again illustrate how we're meeting our commitment to grow high-quality, durable 5G and fiber customer relationships. Thanks to a consistent discipline and return focused go-to-market approach. Our team is balancing customer growth with profitable long-term value creation as we connect people to greater possibility.\nAnd I'm particularly proud of the quality of our subscriber additions. Despite high promotional activity seen in parts of our industry, we continue to achieve consistently low churn levels while increasing the take rate of our high-value 5G and fiber plans. We believe our results demonstrate that the customer-centric strategy we launched almost 3 years ago continues to deliver the right mix of quality subscriber and profit growth that will prove sustainable over the longer term.\nSo let me highlight some of our progress. Let's start with mobility. In January, I shared that we anticipated industry demand trends would continue to normalize to pre-pandemic levels. However, we still expect it to grow both postpaid phone subscribers and wireless profits, thanks to investments in our customer experience, distribution channels and network, and that's exactly what our team's delivered.\nWe had 424,000 postpaid phone net adds in the first quarter and continued to grow wireless service revenues, EBITDA and postpaid phone ARPU, all while maintaining historically low churn. Checking the box for each of these success metrics paints a clear picture of what sustainable, profitable wireless growth looks like.\nWe've now had more than 11 straight quarters of 400,000 postpaid phone net adds or better, and we've totaled 2.6 million postpaid phone net adds over the past 4 quarters. We're pursuing longer-term growth by remaining committed to fostering durable relationships that solve customer pain points and bring great value to our customers.\nWe're executing well on our disciplined go-to-market strategy that centers around putting the customer first and takes advantage of our improved distribution.\nWe also continue to hone our ability to deliver targeted solutions that provide real value to customers in our historically underpenetrated segments, like first responders, as well as small and medium businesses. This approach establishes a long-term growth trajectory that thoughtfully balances customer additions with profitable returns.\nNow let's turn to our fiber business. Quarter after quarter, our teams proved that wherever we build fiber, we win. And the first quarter was no exception, with 272,000 AT&T fiber net adds. This marks 13 straight quarters with more than 200,000 net adds. These net adds were a significant achievement with a number of household moves, a key growth metric for fiber sales, decreasing nationwide. As we noted at the end of last year, our fiber subscribers now outnumbered nonfiber and DSL subscribers. We now have about 7.5 million AT&T fiber subscribers, with the fiber adoption and margin expansion driving Consumer Wireline revenue and EBITDA growth.\nWe believe that AT&T offers the best wired Internet service available anywhere, that this elevated AT&T fiber experience is providing a strong tailwind.\nSo overall, across both 5G and fiber, I'm very happy with the high-quality subscriber adds we achieved in the quarter, and these long-term customer relationships provide a great and profitable revenue stream now and into the future. Even in the midst of increased macroeconomic uncertainty, we're executing more sharply and efficiently after repositioning our operations around our connectivity strengths. We remain on track to achieve our $6 billion plus cost savings run rate target by the end of the year, if not sooner.\nAs we mentioned before, the benefits from these efforts are expected to increasingly fall to the bottom line. While we've largely delivered what we set out to accomplish 3 years ago, our journey has only raised our confidence that we can continue to evolve and improve. In fact, we believe we can further accelerate cost take-outs as we progress through the year. Part of this entails transforming our network as we ultimately replace our copper services footprint with best-in-class fiber connectivity, and where it makes sense for customers, replacement products built on our wireless network.\nThink about a cost structure that's no longer anchored to legacy network technologies and software stacks. For example, in addition to all of fiber's enhanced resiliency and its superior transport characteristics, we're already seeing that fiber uses less energy, costs less to maintain and requires fewer service dispatches.\nAnd as we reduce our copper services footprint and related legacy infrastructure, we expect to consistently improve our margins, grow EBITDA and, ultimately, improve our capital efficiency.\nAnother contributing element relies on unlocking new capabilities that make it easier to collaborate and get work done by leaning into our digital transformation. We're seeing this already come to life through early trials in our collaboration with NVIDIA, where we're testing the use of artificial intelligence to improve fleet dispatches so our field technicians can better serve customers. Separately, we're using AI to match customers with the right customer care support path, resulting in more effective issue resolution. We think this is only the tip of the spear of what's possible.\nNow let's turn to our final priority, which centers on how we're allocating capital. We continue to invest in our 5G and fiber networks at record levels in order to deliver long-term sustainable earnings growth. Our goal is to build a network that not only meets today's demands but will serve the needs of our customers for decades to come. This is at the core of what we do and who we are as a company. It's also why we continue to be 1 of America's largest capital investors.\nWe're investing in our connectivity infrastructure, and using our team's proven expertise to not only maintain our network advantages but to advance it, and we're doing this while moving forward on our commitment to provide more Americans with access to reliable, high-speed broadband. We plan to actively pursue bead funding to support the transition of our wireline footprint and expect to be a significant participant in public, private partnerships.\nAnd while we're clearly committed to investing in our networks, we also remain focused on the strengthening of our balance sheet and reducing our net debt. We expect to increase cash generation over time, which will allow us to continue delivering an attractive dividend with improving credit quality. And by executing on the simplified capital allocation framework, we expect to improve our financial flexibility in the long run. This will provide us with the opportunity to take additional actions, such as investing to accelerate our business growth or generating incremental values and returns for our shareholders.\nNow before I wrap up, I'd like to quickly touch on some developments we're seeing in the macroeconomic environment. We started the year with the expectation that we'd be operating against a less-predictable macro backdrop. This belief has proven true thus far. And what we're seeing is in line with the expectations we built into our guidance in January, including a moderation of growth for wireless services.\nWe expected to transition back to more historical cost of debt. That is certainly underway, with the added dose of tighter credit availability to some segments of the economy. I'm clearly not breaking any ground with these observations, but this is why we have been focused on reducing our leverage and optimizing our use of capital over the last few years.\nAs the economy adjusts to a likely period of tighter capital availability and higher interest rates, I take comfort in the state of our business for 2 reasons. The first is the heavy lifting we did to strengthen our balance sheet over the last several years. We've reduced our debt, taking advantage of the prior low interest rate environment on our remaining debt and managed our debt towers for the next several years. As a result, more than 95% of our debt is now fixed at an average rate of 4.1%.\nThe second is the repositioning of our business to focus on exclusively communication services, particularly 5G and fiber. As the last few years have demonstrated, the solutions we provide are more critical than ever before, and we only expect the demand for purpose-built, best-in-class Internet access to grow. The resiliency of the services we provide, coupled with our improved financial flexibility, provide us with the right tool set to navigate the economic environment.\nWe remain on track to deliver the 2023 financial and operating commitments we made to our shareholders at the start of the year. However, should the need arise, we feel comfortable using the tools we have at our disposal to align our actions with a more challenging economic backdrop, whether that's accelerating cost transformation actions, being more deliberate with our capital spend or increasing our liquidity.\nTo conclude my remarks, I'd simply reemphasize that I'm proud of how our team started the year. Last quarter, I said that our approach and strategy for 2023 was to do it again. In the first quarter of the year, our teams have done just that.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Pascal. Pascal?\n\nPascal Desroches\n\nSenior EVP & CFO\n\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As you know, we typically provide a brief review of our subscriber trends at this point in our prepared remarks. But today, I'd like to zoom out and connect the dots on the progress we've made so far on our multiyear journey to reposition our core operations.\nOur goal has been to take advantage of the expected increased demand for wireless and broadband connectivity by adding customers the right way, with a focus on long-term value. We recognize that in order to do that, we had to increase our investments in the business to enhance our customer value proposition and make more memorable and lasting connections with our customers. We understood that these investments would have a short-term impact on wireless ARPU and profits, but over time, would build durable customer relationships and deliver attractive returns.\nOver the last few quarters, we've started to see the full picture and the results of these efforts. In mobility, our largest business unit, we're growing subscribers and taking share. We also continue to see very healthy ARPU. This translates to growth in wireless service revenues and EBITDA, while improving margins. We've grown both revenues and EBITDA year-over-year for 4 consecutive quarters, and this past quarter was the best first quarter for mobility EBITDA in the company's history.\nIn Consumer Wireline, we've invested to increase our fiber footprint to provide customers with best-in-class access technology. Over the course of the past 3 years, we added about 6 million fiber locations that we can now serve. By doing this, we successfully transformed the business that was in secular decline into a growth business, with fiber growth outpacing legacy wireline declines. The consistency of our results across 5G and fiber provides us with confidence that our go-to-market approach is both sustainable and delivers attractive returns.\nThese results are the outcome of the hard work our teams have done and show the value in what we've been working towards the last 3 years, and now it's about continuing to deliver quality growth with attractive returns. So again, we're clearly growing the right way and focused on the long term.\nNow let's turn to our first quarter financial summary on Slide 6. Consolidated revenues were up 1.4% in the first quarter, largely driven by wireless service revenues and to a lesser extent, Mexico and Consumer Wireline. This was partially offset by an expected decline in Business Wireline as well as lower mobility equipment revenues. Adjusted EBITDA was up 3.9% for the quarter as growth in mobility, Mexico and Consumer Wireline were partially offset by an expected decline in Business Wireline.\nAdjusted EPS was $0.60 compared to $0.63 in the year ago quarter. In the quarter, there were about $0.06 of aggregated EPS headwinds from higher pension, lower DIRECTV equity income and higher effective tax rate. This was partially offset by strong growth in mobility. Cash from operating activities came in at $6.7 billion versus $7.6 billion last year. This was largely due to the timing of working capital, which includes lower securitizations. As a reminder, the first quarter is typically the high watermark for device payments, and we expect payments to progressively get lower as we make our way through the balance of the year.\nCapital investments were $6.4 billion as we continue to make historically high levels of investments in 5G and fiber. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1 billion. This was consistent with our expectations and accounts for several seasonal and anticipated working capital impacts. We remain confident in our full year outlook for free cash flow of $16 billion or better. This expectation is largely due to the timing of capital investments, device payments, incentive compensation, which all peaked in the first quarter.\nNow let's look at our mobility operating results on Slide 7. Before we get started, we disclosed in early March that we modified our business unit reporting and no longer record prior service credits to our individual business units. Prior period business unit results have been recast for this change. There is no impact to consolidate the operating income, as price service credits continue to be recorded in other income.\nLooking at our Mobility results. Revenues were up 2.5% and service revenues were up 5.2% driven by subscriber growth and higher ARPU. Mobility EBITDA was up $621 million or 8% for the quarter, driven by growth in subscribers, service revenue and the assets of 3G network shutdown costs versus the first quarter of 2022. Mobility postpaid phone ARPU was $55.05, up $1.05 or nearly 2% year-over-year. ARPU growth remains largely driven by higher ARPU on legacy plans from last year's pricing actions, a continued mix shift to higher-value rate plans and a continued improvement in consumer international rolling trends.\nPostpaid phone churn remains low at 0.81% for the quarter. We believe our team's ongoing success can be largely attributed to the consistent investment we've made to build a fast and reliable 5G network and the actions we've taken to ensure our customers feel valued and appreciated. In prepaid, we had 40,000 phone net additions. Our total prepaid churn was below 3%, primarily driven by loyalty from Cricket customers who stayed with us as a result of our value and reliability. Overall, I'm really pleased that the team achieved solid subscriber growth even against a moderation in industry demand.\nI'd like to also quickly acknowledge the strong results posted by our team in Mexico. We're very pleased with the performance of our Mexico wireless operations, which boasted strong revenue and steady profit growth, thanks to improved operational execution and scale.\nNow let's move to Consumer and Business Wireline results, which are on Slide 8. Let's start with Consumer wireline where our growth was led by our investment in fiber, which is consistently yielding strong returns. We added 272,000 fiber customers in the quarter. This speaks to the quality of the service we're providing and the continued demand for the best Internet technology available today. With our fiber subscribers now outnumbering our nonfiber subscribers, the increasing mix shift from legacy products to fiber continues to drive strong broadband results.\nBroadband revenues grew by more than 7% year-over-year, including accelerated year-over-year fiber revenue growth of more than 30%. Fiber ARPU was $65.92, up more than $1 sequentially, with ARPU for new fiber customers at about $70. Customers are increasingly choosing to take advantage of the benefits offered by faster speed tiers, which is also supporting ARPU growth.\nConsumer Wireline EBITDA grew 3.2% for the quarter due to growth in fiber revenues and transformation savings, partially offset by higher storm costs on the West Coast, which hurt growth by about 250 basis points in the quarter. Overall, we could not be more confident in the future of our Consumer Wireline business, with fiber well positioned to lead our growth in the decade ahead.\nTurning to Business Wireline. EBITDA was down $230 million year-over-year, which was in line with our expectations. This was partially driven by about $50 million in year-over-year comparability factors, including favorable compensation adjustments in the first quarter of last year. Our rationalization process in Business Wireline also continues as we remain focused on the opportunities that 5G and fiber expansion create, particularly in the small and midsized business category.\nOur Business Solutions wireless service revenues grew nearly 7% despite a moderation in industry growth as we continue to grow faster than our peers. One driver of this growth continues to be FirstNet, where wireless connections grew by about 300,000 sequentially, about 40% of which are postpaid phones. Ultimately, we're making progress on transforming our Business Wireline operations. And when we normalize out for onetime comparison items in the quarter, we still see the same underlying trends and continue to expect full year results aligned to what we guided in January.\nNow to wrap up my comments. I'll restate that we embedded expectations for a comparatively slower macro backdrop in our full year outlook and, therefore, remain on track to deliver on our full year guidance. We will continue to monitor the economy closely. And if we find ourselves operating in a more challenging macro environment than we anticipated, there are levers to pull. Ultimately, we feel like we have found the right formula to deliver sustainable results with profitable 5G and fiber subscriber gains.\nWe've demonstrated this by growing consolidated EBITDA, improving ARPUs and growing broadband and wireless service revenues, with consistently low postpaid phone churn, and we are confident that this formula will continue to work.\nAmir, that's our presentation. We're now ready for the Q&A.\n\nAmir Rozwadowski\n\nSenior VP of Finance & Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Pascal. Operator, we're ready to take the first question.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI would like to turn the conference call over to our host, Amir Rozwadowski, Senior Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nAmir Rozwadowski\n\nSenior VP of Finance & IR, AT&T Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter call. I'm Amir Rozwadowski, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me today on the call are John Stankey, our CEO; and Pascal Desroches, our CFO.\nBefore we begin, I need to call your attention to our safe harbor statement. It says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they're subject to risks and uncertainties described in AT&T's SEC filings. Results may differ materially. Additional information as well as our earnings materials are available on the Investor Relations website.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to John Stankey. John?\n\nJohn T. Stankey\n\nCEO, President & Director, AT&T Inc.\n\nThanks, Amir, and Happy New Year, everyone. I appreciate you joining us today, and I hope you enjoyed a restful and healthy holiday season. And at the conclusion of this call, I'm declaring the statute of limitations on this being the new year has run out. I'll share upfront that our commentary is a bit longer than usual. However, we thought it was important to provide a bit more clarity on our business today, primarily our fiber strategy since we haven't had an opportunity to discuss our December GigaPower joint venture announcement. Still, we'll ensure we have enough time to get to most of your questions.\nAs I reflect on not only this past year, but the past 2.5 years, it's clear that our teams have worked diligently to refocus AT&T around a connectivity strategy has simplified our company and positioned it for sustainable growth. Our results over the past 10 quarters demonstrate we are on our way to delivering the full promise of the strategy. We're operating a streamlined and return-focused business with an improved profit trajectory that's committed to generating sustained cash earnings growth while delivering an attractive dividend.\nUnderpinning all of our actions is a deep desire to connect our customers with greater possibility through 5G and fiber. And importantly, we're assembling the right assets, talent and capital structure to offer an experience and value proposition that customers appreciate. Our fourth quarter results are the latest example of how our teams continue to consistently deliver for our customers. We finished 2022 with strong momentum in growing customer relationships. As you can see from our profitability trends, we're growing them in the right way.\nSo let me highlight some of our progress. Let's start with wireless. We delivered 656,000 postpaid phone net adds in the fourth quarter and nearly 2.9 million postpaid phone net adds for the full year. And over the past 2.5 years, we've increased our postpaid phone base by nearly 7 million to 69.6 million subscribers which represents our best 10-quarter stretch of wireless growth more than a decade. During the same 10-quarter time span, we've grown wireless service revenues, EBITDA and also increased our postpaid phone ARPU by nearly $1.\nAnd while others may have jumped the gun, they claim that they were the only ones to reduce churn in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis, we also lowered our fourth quarter postpaid and postpaid phone churn without offering richer promotions or free line giveaways. We consider this yet another data point highlighting that our comprehensive approach to improving the entire customer experience is working from our simplified go-to-market strategy, to our better network experience, to our focused market segmentation practices.\nOn top of that, our growth was not only robust but profitable with 2022 being the most profitable year ever for our mobility business. We expect profit growth to continue in 2023 as we benefit from the investments we've made in our business over the last 2.5 years. Our network teams have also consistently outpaced our mid-band 5G spectrum rollout objective. In fact, we now reach 150 million mid-band 5G POPs, more than double our initial 2022 year-end target. Our goal remains to deploy our spectrum efficiently and in a manner that supports traffic growth. In the markets where we have broadly deployed mid-band 5G, 25% of our traffic in these areas already takes advantage of our mid-band spectrum.\nNow let's move to fiber where we build fiber, we continue to win. We had more than 1.2 million AT&T fiber net adds last year. The fifth straight year, we've totaled more than 1 million AT&T fiber net adds. And after 2.9 million AT&T fiber net adds over the last 2.5 years, we've now reached an inflection point where our fiber subscribers outnumber our non-fiber DSL subscribers. The financial benefits of our fiber focus are also becoming increasingly apparent as full year fiber revenue growth of nearly 29% has led to sustainable revenue and profit growth in our Consumer Wireline business. As we scale our fiber footprint, we also expect to drive margin expansion.\nIn summary, we're enhancing and expanding our networks while extending our long runway for sustainable growth. And I'm very happy with the high quality and consistent customer adds we achieved last year. We've emphasized that our plan was to grow customer relationships in a thoughtful and responsible way grounded by an enhanced value proposition that resonated with customers. That's exactly what our teams have done, quarter after quarter. In addition to growing customer relationships, we've executed some of the most challenging actions associated with repositioning our operations. We've doubled down on our cost transformation. We've now achieved more than $5 billion of our $6 billion plus cost savings run rate target.\nIn 2023, you can expect the benefits from these efforts to increasingly fall to the bottom line. In fact, you've already seen the benefits of this cost transformation beginning to translate into operating leverage despite inflationary pressures. Our teams did an excellent job implementing pricing actions and business efficiencies to offset continued inflationary impacts, the impacts we anticipate will be with us in the near to midterm. Part of tapping into these efficiencies entails improving acquisition costs and further streamlining our operations and distribution. Another part entails rationalizing our Wireline copper infrastructure and reinvesting those savings into fiber and wireless where we're seeing improving returns.\nAs we look at our last priority, we also continue to generate meaningful levels of free cash flow even with record levels of investment. This gives us confidence in our ability to continue delivering an attractive dividend today and in the future, while also improving the credit quality of that dividend as we expect to increase our cash generation over time. We strengthened our balance sheet last year, reducing our net debt by about $24 billion. So as we close 2022, I'm proud of what the AT&T team accomplished despite a competitive market and challenging macro environment.\nTurning to 2023, what's our strategy? Well, it's simple. Do it again. What exactly does that mean? It means we're focused on the same 3 operational and business priorities we set in place 2.5 years ago. As I've mentioned time and again, our north star remains solely focused on becoming the best connectivity provider with 5G and fiber. We're confident we can achieve this because in wireless, we'll maintain our focus on building durable and sustainable customer growth in a rational, return-focused manner.\nJust as we've done over the past 10 quarters, we'll continue to take a disciplined approach to selectively target underpenetrated areas of the consumer and business marketplace and improve the perception and execution of our value proposition. We also expect to continue our 5G expansion, reaching more than 200 million people with mid-band 5G by the end of 2023. In wired broadband, we have the nation's largest and fastest-growing fiber Internet, and we expect continued healthy subscriber growth as we grow our fiber footprint. As we keep expanding our subscriber base will drive efficiencies in everything we do. This includes consistently elevating our customer experience through the improved durability and reliability of our 5G and fiber networks.\nWhen we couple our evolving networks with further enhancements to our distribution and digital and self-service channels will make a competitive customer experience even more appealing. We expect to realize additional benefits from our consistent go-to-market strategy and lower cost structures we also benefit from our improved brand perception, strong fiber and wireless asset base, broad distribution and converged product offers.\nAdditionally, we have a clear line of sight to achieving our $6 billion plus cost savings run rate target by the end of this year. We expect even more of these savings to fall to the bottom line as the year progresses. With that improved performance, we remain focused on further strengthening the balance sheet by using cash after dividends to reduce debt as we progress toward our target of a 2.5x range for net debt to adjusted EBITDA. Our commitment to providing an attractive annual dividend also remains firm. As our CapEx is expected to moderate exiting this year, following the peak investment levels of 2022 and 2023, we expect the credit quality of our dividend to improve on the back of our higher free cash flow and improved financial flexibility.\nIn summary, we feel confident that our growth and profit trends are sustainable despite the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. As I stated previously, we continue to expect that we will be operating in a challenging macroeconomic environment where wireless industry growth is likely to return to more normalized levels. The resiliency of the services we provide are time-tested and only growing in importance. When you couple this resiliency with the investments we've made to our networks and proven go-to-market strategy, we're confident in our ability to navigate potential economic headwinds that may emerge and our improving financial flexibility only further strengthens that confidence.\nNow I'd like to take a moment to touch upon our fiber strategy by quickly level setting on how I'm thinking about the success we've had, our plans for the next few years and how we'll hold ourselves accountable.\nSimilar to the early days of wireless, we consider fiber, a multiyear opportunity that will transform the way consumers and businesses growing connectivity needs are met in the ensuing decade and beyond. For AT&T, we segment this opportunity into 3 distinct buckets based on the specific input parameters and return dynamics each one possesses. The first is our in-footprint build where we can take advantage of our existing infrastructure, deep insights on both the customer base and competitive landscape and our market presence in order to take share and deliver attractive returns. We believe our performance over the last few years supports the wisdom of allocating our capital to these opportunities with sustainable and solid return characteristics.\nAs we stated previously, we currently size this opportunity is passing 30 million-plus consumer and business locations within our existing wireline footprint by the end of 2025. We finished last year with approximately 24 million fiber locations passed, including businesses, of which more than 22 million locations are sellable, which we define as our ability to serve. Our build to these locations is providing great returns, as you can see from our growing fiber revenues and ARPUs. As a general rule, about 5% of consumer locations passed may not be immediately sellable, primarily due to timing factors such as building access, construction or vacancies. Over time, we expect more of this inventory to become addressable for sale.\nWe remain on track to reach our target of 30 million plus past locations by the end of 2025. The simple math would suggest 2 million to 2.5 million consumer and business locations passed annually moving forward. As we previously shared, build targets will vary quarter-to-quarter in any given year based on how the market is evolving. The second bucket is availing ourselves a partnership opportunities to not only expand but also accelerate our coverage in excess of that 30 million-plus location target. This is where our recent GigaPower joint venture announcement with a BlackRock infrastructure fund resides. While this deal is not yet closed, we're very excited about the expected benefits. Through this endeavor, GigaPower plans to use a best-in-class operating team to deploy fiber to an initial 1.5 million locations, and I would expect that number to grow over time.\nThis innovative risk-sharing collaboration will allow us to prove out the viability of a different investment thesis that expanding our fiber reach not only benefits our fiber business, but also our mobile penetration rates. But what makes me most enthusiastic about this endeavor is that we believe GigaPower provides us long-term financial flexibility and strategic optionality and what we believe is the definitive access technology for decades to come, all while sustaining near-term financial and shareholder commitments.\nIf I were to draw parallel to this partnership approach, I'm reminded the early days of wireless where the race to grow footprint was somewhat time-bound and facilitated by a similar approach ultimately culminating in today's national networks. The last bucket is framed by opportunities to connect people who previously did not have access to best-in-class technologies through broadband stimulus and BEAD funding. As I shared before, we truly believe that connectivity is a bridge to possibility in helping close the digital divide by focusing on access to affordable high-speed Internet is a top priority of AT&T. The intent of these government programs is to provide the necessary funding and support to allow both AT&T and the broader service provider community that means to invest alongside the government at the levels needed to achieve the end state of a better connected America.\nAs the year progresses, we expect to gain more clarity around additional opportunities that exist, none of which are included in the $30 million plus fiber location target I've mentioned. As we compete for the subsidy, we'll bring our operational and market experience to compete for contracts in a disciplined manner. In doing so, we may be the only participant that has the ability to bid as part of an embedded wireline operation, a scaled national wireless provider and GigaPower may participate as a focused and flexible commercial open access wireline fiber network.\nWe think this will prove to be a winning combination in pursuit of attractive growth. The bottom line is this. Our commitment to fiber is at the core of our strategy. In footprint, we're on track to deliver our $30 million-plus location commitment and we're building the strategic and financial capabilities to take advantage of further opportunities as they emerge.\nTo wrap up, regardless of what transpires in the macro economy in the year ahead, we remain confident in the resiliency of the services our customers depend on in their daily lives. I believe our plan for the year rings true to who we are at our core. For almost 150 years, AT&T has invested heavily into connecting our country. And in the process of doing so, we provided a spark for innovation that connects people to greater possibility. This year, we'll continue to honor this heritage by significantly investing in best-in-class technology to build on a foundation for the future of our country's evolving connectivity needs, needs that we expect to grow significantly in the coming years.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Pascal. Pascal?\n\nPascal Desroches\n\nSenior Executive VP & CFO, AT&T Inc.\n\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Since John already discussed the great momentum we have this past year in growing our customer base in 5G and fiber, I'd like to start by taking a look at our fourth quarter financial summary on Slide 8. First, as a reminder, with the close of the WarnerMedia transaction in April, historical financial results have been recast to present WarnerMedia and certain other divested businesses as discontinued operations. Therefore, where applicable, I will highlight our financial results on a comparative like-for-like basis.\nFor the fourth quarter, revenues were up nearly 1%. On a comparative basis, revenues for the full year were up around 2%, largely driven by wireless service revenue and, to a lesser extent, broadband in Mexico. This was partly offset by a decline in business wireline.\nAdjusted EBITDA was up about 8% for the quarter. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA was up around 3.5% on a comparative basis as growth in mobility, consumer wireline in Mexico were partly offset by a decline in business wireline. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.61, up about 9% for the quarter primarily due to strong organic growth in mobility and lower interest and benefit-related expenses.\nFor the full year, adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $2.57. I should note that we've taken a $24.8 billion noncash goodwill impairment charge in conjunction with our annual goodwill assessment primarily due to increases in discount rates associated with the overall rise in interest rates. We also took a noncash charge of $1.4 billion to abandon certain conduit assets related to the ongoing rationalization of our copper network.\nFree cash flow for the quarter was $6.1 billion, including about $800 million in DIRECTV distributions. This is an improvement of $780 million year-over-year, even with a $1 billion lower distribution from DIRECTV and $500 million less in FirstNet capital reimbursements. We also delivered on our revised full year guidance with free cash flow of $14.1 billion for the year. Cash from operating activities for our continuing operations came in at $10.3 billion for the quarter, up $2.3 billion year-over-year. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $4.2 billion with capital investments of $4.7 billion. Full year capital investment marked an all-time high at $24.3 billion as we continue to make record investments in 5G and fiber.\nNow let's look at our mobility segment operating results on Slide 9. For the fifth consecutive year, our mobility business grew both revenues and EBITDA. Revenues were up 1.7% for the quarter and 4.5% for the year. Service revenues were up more than 5% for both the quarter and the year, driven by continued subscriber growth. This exceeds the raised annual guidance we provided to you last quarter.\nMobility EBITDA was up about $740 million or more than 10% for the quarter, driven by growth in service revenues, transformation savings and the absence of 3G network shutdown costs versus the fourth quarter of 2021. This was partially offset by higher bad debt levels. For the full year, mobility EBITDA grew nearly 4%. Even as competitors introduce richer promotional offers during the holiday seasons, our consistent go-to-market approach once again drove our results. This gives us confidence that we have the right formula and structure in place to continue to grow customers, service revenues and EBITDA at a healthy clip this year.\nMobility postpaid phone ARPU was $55.43, up $1.37 or 2.5% year-over-year. ARPU growth continues to come in ahead of our expectation and largely reflects our targeted pricing actions, customers trading up to higher price unlimited plans and improved roaming trends. As John previously mentioned, postpaid phone churn of 0.84% for the quarter declined year-over-year even as we were less promotional compared to our peers. We believe that this decline is reflective of our improved customer value proposition.\nIn prepaid, our phone churn was less than 3% driven by cricket phone churn that was substantially lower than 3%. While we believe industry wireless subscriber volumes will continue to pace towards normalized levels this year, we also expect our consistent go-to-market strategy to help us deliver strong relative performance and ongoing customer growth.\nNow let's move to Consumer and Business Wireline results, which are on Slide 10. Let's start with consumer wireline. As John mentioned, our fiber customer growth and network expansion continue. And wherever we have fiber, we win share. We added 280,000 fiber customers even in a seasonally slow fourth quarter that was impacted by lower year-over-year household move activities and challenging December weather conditions. The increasing mix shift from legacy products to fiber drove strong broadband results, and we expect these trends to continue. Broadband revenues grew more than 7% year-over-year due to fiber subscriber growth and higher ARPU from the mix shift to fiber. Fiber ARPU was $64.82, up $2.20 sequentially with intake ARPU now approaching $70. Consumer wireline EBITDA grew over 20% for the quarter and nearly 10% for the full year due to growth in fiber revenues and transformation savings.\nTurning to business wirelines. EBITDA was relatively flat for the quarter due to $90 million in intellectual property transaction revenues and ongoing transformation savings as we continue to rationalize our portfolio of low-margin products. In fact, margins were up 110 basis points year-over-year, thanks to our transformation process. This rationalization process will continue in 2023 as we remain focused on the opportunities that our 5G and fiber expansion create in the small and midsized business category. Our Business Solution wireless services revenue grew more than 7%. This is very impressive given the fact that we already have the second largest share and are growing faster than our peers. FirstNet wireless connections grew by $377,000 sequentially.\nNow let's move to Slide 11 for our 2023 financial guidance. Let me walk you through how we're thinking about operating expectations for 2023. First, we expect to continue to grow mobility subscribers against a return to a more normalized industry growth. We also expect continued benefits from a larger subscriber base and improving ARPUs. This should result in wireless service revenue growth of 4% plus for the full year.\nFor broadband, we expect revenue increases of 5% plus reflecting a higher mix shift to fiber with improving ARPUs partially offset by continued legacy revenue declines. Overall, we expect to grow total revenues next year. However, as you all know, variability in equipment revenues driven by industry volumes could be a factor on consolidated top line trends as we think about EBITDA trends in 2023. We expect to grow mobility EBITDA mid-single digits as our disciplined approach helps us grow our valuable subscriber base.\nIn business wireline, we expect EBITDA to be down high single digits due to continued declines in legacy products, partially offset by incremental cost savings and increased fiber-based revenues. As you consider the first quarter for Business Wireline, it's worth noting that 2022 included a onetime incentive compensation benefit that will impact year-over-year comparisons. In Consumer Wireline, we expect to grow EBITDA in a mid-single-digit range, plus or minus, due to continued growth in fiber revenues and transformation savings, partially offset by continued declines in legacy copper subscribers. We expect to benefit from ongoing corporate cost reductions. Altogether, this yields consolidated adjusted EBITDA growth of 3% plus for the full year.\nWhen you think about adjusted EPS calculations, note that our guidance reflects nearly $0.20 per share of headwinds associated with noncash pension costs related to higher interest rates and to a lesser extent, lower spectrum interest capitalization. Importantly, we have no need to fund our pension plans for the foreseeable future. We also expect to incur more than $0.05 of noncash headwinds related to a higher effective tax rate of around 23% to 24%. Combined, these headwinds aggregates to about $0.25 year-over-year.\nNormalizing for these noncash items, our guidance would imply adjusted EPS growth consistent with our expected growth in adjusted EBITDA. Given these assumptions, adjusted EPS is expected to be in the $2.35 to $2.45 range. We also expect adjusted equity income from DIRECTV to be about $3 billion for the year versus $3.4 billion in 2022.\nHere's what to consider when looking at our free cash flows for 2023. First, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth of 3% plus. Next, expect cash interest to be down about $500 million. Assume your cash taxes will be higher in 2023 versus 2022 to the tune of about $1 billion. And expected cash distributions from DIRECTV should be down about $1 billion. We continue to expect that 2022 and 2023 will be our peak investment year. So capital investment is expected to be consistent with 2022 levels.\nWe also expect about of $2 billion of working capital improvements, largely from lower deferrals and higher noncash amortization of deferred acquisition costs. As we mentioned earlier, we expect a more normalized industry growth volume which is expected to help working capital as well. When you combine all these factors, you get to a free cash flow expectation of $16 billion or better. This is about twice as much as our current annualized dividend and more than enough to cover other commitments.\nSimilar to last year, we expect greater free cash flow generation in the back half of the year based on higher capital investment levels and device payments in the first half of the year as well as the timing of the annual incentive compensation payout. We will use our free cash flows to pay out our dividend and to pay down debt as we continue to progress towards our target of 2.5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, which we anticipate will take place in early 2025.\nAnd lastly, the guidance we provided to you is based on our current reporting. We expect our segment reporting in 2023 will remain the same as last year. However, I'd like to note that we no longer plan to record prior service credit benefits to the individual business segments with a corporate elimination. Instead, it will only be recorded in other income.\nOverall, we are confident in our plan for the year. And as John mentioned, it takes into account our expectations for a more normalized industry growth backdrop against continued challenges in the macro environment. Our confidence is underscored by the resiliency of the services we offer, the consistent strength of our go-to-market strategy, our ongoing momentum in core connectivity and most importantly, our team's unwavering commitment to deliver best-in-class services to consumers and businesses alike.\nAmir, that's our presentation. We're now ready for the Q&A.\n\nAmir Rozwadowski\n\nSenior VP of Finance & IR, AT&T Inc.\n\nThank you, Pascal. Operator, we're ready to take the first question.",

(Operator Instructions) Following the presentation, the call will be open for questions. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI would like to turn the conference call over to our host, Amir Rozwadowski, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nAmir Rozwadowski\n\nSenior VP of Finance & IR, AT&T Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter call. I'm Amir Rozwadowski, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today are John Stankey, our CEO; and Pascal Desroches, our CFO.\nBefore we begin, I need to call your attention to our safe harbor statement. It says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they're subject to risks and uncertainties described in AT&T's SEC filings. Results may differ materially. And as always, additional information and earnings materials are available on the Investor Relations website.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to John Stankey. John?\n\nJohn T. Stankey\n\nCEO, President & Director, AT&T Inc.\n\nThanks, Amir. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we shared our third quarter results, which, yet again, demonstrate our strong execution in delivering critical connectivity services to our customers.\nEarlier this month, we saw just how vital these services truly are. In the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Ian, the ability to connect with others proved to be invaluable to so many people. And our teams were, yet again, some of the very first to arrive on the scene, working tirelessly for our customers. The effort they made, along with first responders, supported by FirstNet, to keep our network running in some of the hardest hit areas was nothing short of heroic. I'm really grateful for their sacrifices, and all of AT&T is proud of their efforts.\nI'd also like to say thank you to our teams for their solid execution in deploying our mid-band 5G spectrum and building out best-in-class fiber-based access solutions. As you can see from our results, we continue to deliver strong customer growth on the back of our focused 5G and fiber strategy.\nThe demand for fast and reliable 5G and fiber is at an all-time high, and our disciplined and consistent go-to-market strategy continues to resonate. In addition, as we begin to lap investments we need to optimize our networks, improve our distribution and transform our business, we're now seeing the benefits of our growth fall to the bottom line, as we suggested they would and as evidenced by accelerating adjusted EBITDA growth.\nLet me dive in a bit. In Mobility, we posted another strong quarter of growth by adding 708,000 postpaid phone net adds. As I stated in prior quarters, our consistent results are being driven by an improved value proposition, better network experience and our ability to meet our customers where their needs are. We're creating efficiencies through our distribution, and acquisition costs are improving. This is helping us drive further gains in operating leverage.\nThis past quarter, our teams delivered across 3 key performance measurements: strong postpaid phone net adds, accelerating ARPU growth and higher Mobility EBITDA. In fact, the third quarter marked our highest wireless service revenue growth year-over-year in more than a decade, and we now expect to achieve wireless service revenue growth at the upper end of the 4.5% to 5% range. This is about 200 basis points higher than where we expected to land at the start of the year, thanks to continued net add strength and ARPU growth.\nNow let's jump to fiber, where we continue to invest in building out a premium network and deliver on our stated expectations for steady customer growth. The success of our strategy is evidenced by the fact that we just posted our 11th straight quarter with more than 200,000 fiber net adds, with 338,000 net adds this past quarter.\nWe're finding success in serving more customers in new and existing markets with what is the best wired Internet offering available. We're increasing share in our fiber footprint and converting more IP broadband Internet subscribers to fiber subscribers. This is driving favorable ARPU trends and profitable growth within our overall Consumer Wireline business.\nUltimately, our fiber strategy is a long-term play, centered around a best-in-class network technology with a multi-decade lifespan. When others finally decide they need to upgrade their infrastructure, we will already be providing our customers with great service and sustainable technology. Simply put, where we have fiber, we win. And the numbers show we expect to keep winning.\nSo let's step back for a minute and take a look at what we've done so far this year across 3 quarters. We've achieved what we expect will be an industry best with more than 2.2 million postpaid phone net adds. Additionally, our teams are deploying our mid-band 5G spectrum quickly and efficiently, and the spectrum assets we're rolling out are performing even better than our high expectations.\nAs a result, we've achieved our already increased year-end target of 100 million mid-band 5G POPs and now expect to reach more than 130 million people by the end of the year, nearly double our expectations when we entered the year. This progress is benefiting our customers as well. In fact, since the start of the year, our already consistent download speeds have increased materially as a result of our mid-band deployment.\nWe're also approaching 1 million AT&T Fiber net adds for the year, and we've added nearly 2.3 million fiber locations through 3 quarters to bring our total customer locations to 18.5 million. This keeps us on track to achieve our target of 30 million-plus locations by the end of 2025. In summary, I'm very happy with the strong, high-quality and durable customer adds, network enhancements and improving financial returns we're seeing across our twin growth engines of 5G and fiber.\nMoving to our next priority. It's more important than ever that we be effective and efficient across our operations. We continue to have strong visibility on achieving more than $4 billion of our $6 billion transformation cost savings run rate target by the end of this year.\nAs I said earlier, we're beginning to see savings start to contribute to the bottom line. We're transforming our business as the world continues to face what feels like a period of uncertainty. Many of the economic trends that we spoke about at the start of the year and the assumptions that we've been operating under are now coming to fruition.\nThis is one reason why we focus so intently on reorienting our business, whether it was asset dispositions, investing in cost transformation or our proactive decision to address rising inflation through a measured pricing strategy. As a result, our balance sheet has improved, our network performance continues to get better, and we're now seeing some benefits to our profit trends. This is a direct result of acting when we did and how we did it.\nOur third quarter results demonstrate that our business can deliver even against the challenging backdrop. The current environment is not easy to predict, but our flexibility affords us the ability to meet or surpass all of our financial commitments while investing in the best technology available.\nNow turning to our capital allocation strategy. The long-term economic justification for our investments in 5G and fiber remains fundamentally sound, and we're continuing to invest through this cycle to support future growth. These investments will prove to be the foundation of AT&T over the next few decades.\nWe feel confident our approach will prove to be increasingly beneficial with each passing year as data demand and traffic continues to grow dramatically. Our strength and focus on core connectivity is helping us meet customers' needs, and we're growing mobility and fiber subscribers in a disciplined and profitable manner quarter after quarter after quarter.\nThis makes me very comfortable with our ability to continue improving the cash yields of our business going forward. Our free cash flow for the quarter was in line with our expectations despite higher third quarter capital investment spend, and we're on track to deliver on our previously stated $24 billion capital investment plan for the year.\nAt the same time, we hope this healthy free cash flow for the quarter gives you confidence in our ability to achieve our target for free cash flow in the $14 billion range for the year, a level that is more than ample to support our $8 billion dividend commitment. Before I turn this over to Pascal, allow me to finish with this.\nOur results demonstrate that the strategy we put forward more than 2 years ago is the right strategy for not only the future of our business, but for the future of the communications industry. We're focused on creating sustainable and scalable businesses that drive a free cash flow flywheel for many years.\nWe continue to hold ourselves accountable for earnings growth against our historic levels of investment, which you'll see through improved cash conversion moving forward. We're confident that the investments and choices we're making will benefit our customers and shareholders now and in the future, while also setting the stage for our next act as America's best broadband provider.\nLet me now turn it over to Pascal to discuss the details of the quarter. Pascal?\n\nPascal Desroches\n\nSenior Executive VP & CFO, AT&T Inc.\n\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by taking a look at our subscriber results for our market focus areas on Slide 5. Our consistent Mobility strategy remains successful as we delivered 708,000 postpaid phone net adds in the quarter. Since we began our transformation 9 quarters ago, we've delivered nearly 7 million postpaid phone net adds, along with improved ARPU.\nLooking at AT&T Fiber. We totaled 338,000 net adds in the quarter. This marks our second best quarter ever. Our plan in Consumer Wireline remains centered on pivoting from a copper-based product to fiber, and we're doing just that. Over the past 9 quarters, we've gone from 4.3 million AT&T Fiber subscribers to now approaching a subscriber base of 7 million. So we're really pleased with the momentum we have with customers in the marketplace across mobility and fiber.\nNow let's move to our third quarter consolidated financial summary on Slide 6. First, as a reminder, with the closing of the Warner Media transaction in April, historical financial results have been recast to present Warner Media and certain other divested businesses, including Vrio, Xandr and Playdemic as discontinued operations.\nAdditionally, there continues to be some year-over-year comparative challenges as the prior year results also included DIRECTV for 1 month and other 2021 dispositions for a partial quarter. Therefore, where applicable, I will highlight our financial results on a comparative like-for-like basis.\nComparative revenues for the quarter were $30 billion, up 3.1% or more than $900 million versus a year ago. This is largely driven by wireless revenue growth and, to a lesser extent, higher Mexico and Consumer Wireline revenues. This was partly offset by a decline in Business Wireline.\nComparative adjusted EBITDA was up nearly 5% year-over-year as growth in Mobility, Consumer Wireline in Mexico were partly offset by a decline in Business Wireline. We expect the year-over-year EBITDA trend lines to improve for the balance of the year as we continue to grow our wireless and fiber customer bases and lap 3G network shutdown costs and stepped-up investments in technology that began in the second half of 2021.\nAdjusted EPS from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.68. On a comparative stand-alone AT&T basis, adjusted EPS was $0.62 in the year ago quarter. The quarter also includes a recurring favorable impact of about $140 million to adjusted EPS from retirement/medical benefit plan change. For the full year, we now expect adjusted EPS from continuing operations to be $2.50 or higher.\nCash from operating activities for our continuing operations came in at $10.1 billion for the quarter, up 9% year-over-year. Capital investments of $6.8 billion was up $1.3 billion year-over-year, and we continue to expect capital investments in the $24 billion range for the year. Free cash flow was $3.8 billion. DIRECTV cash distributions were about $1 billion in the quarter. Overall, we remain on track to achieve or surpass all of our previously shared financial targets for the year.\nNow let's take a deeper look at our Communications segment operating results, starting with Mobility on Slide 7. Our Mobility business continues its strong subscriber momentum and positive profitability trends. Revenues were up 6%, with service revenues growing 5.6%, driven by subscriber growth.\nMobility postpaid phone ARPU was $55.67, up $0.86 sequentially and 2.4% year-over-year. This continues to come in ahead of our expectations. This is largely a result of benefits from our targeted pricing actions, improved roaming trends and more customers trading up to higher-priced unlimited plans.\nWith regard to EBITDA, we delivered our highest Mobility EBITDA ever. Year-over-year, Mobility EBITDA increased 5.5%, driven by wireless revenue growth. We remain confident that Mobility EBITDA growth will continue to accelerate through the balance of the year due to revenue growth and the lapping of 3G network shutdown investments that began in the second half of 2021. So we're really happy with our Mobility performance, and our consistent strategy is yielding great results.\nNow let's turn to our operating results for Consumer and Business Wireline on Slide 8. Our fiber growth remains strong, and we continue to win share where we have fiber. Our total Consumer Wireline revenues are up again this quarter even with continued declines from nonfiber broadband services.\nBroadband revenues grew 6.1% due to fiber revenue growth and higher broadband ARPU, driven by customer mix shift to fiber. Our fiber ARPU was $62.62, and we expect that to continue to improve as more customers roll off legacy promotional pricing and on to simplified pricing constructs.\nLooking forward, remember that seasonality in the fourth quarter typically results in lower industry net adds. We expect EBITDA growth to remain strong on a year-over-year basis for the balance of 2022. This will be driven by growth in broadband revenues and the lapping of technology investments that began in the second half of 2021.\nLooking at Business Wireline. We continue to restructure and rationalize our portfolio with a focus on core connectivity where we have owners' economics. In this regard, we continue to grow our connectivity services revenue as both 5G and fiber offerings continue to perform well.\nOur enterprise mobility momentum remains strong, with Business Wireless service revenue growth of 7.9% and a sequential increase in our FirstNet wireless base of 334,000. Additionally, we had about $100 million in revenue from intellectual property transaction in the quarter. This is about $80 million more than the prior year. For context, this is an action we've taken in the past when favorable opportunities arise.\nNow I'd like to quickly touch on our capital allocation strategy. Overall, our priorities remain unchanged, and we're largely past the heavy lift of reorienting our company's focus on our core connectivity strengths. As a result, we've established a more sustainable financial structure that better positions us for the current environment. We also have enough flexibility to invest in our business while meeting our financial obligations.\nIn the third quarter, the $3.8 billion in free cash flow we delivered was largely in line with our expectations. And given the expected timing of our capital investments, we feel good about our line of sight to achieving our free cash flow target in the $14 billion range for the year. We are very comfortable with our cash levels after paying our dividend commitment, and this should only increase in the future years as we expect cash conversion to improve from here.\nOur results today have only further solidified our confidence that we will exit 2022 stronger than we entered the year. In fact, we continue to expect EBITDA growth and higher free cash flows in 2023. We also plan to continue to use excess cash after dividends to reduce debt with a goal of reaching a net debt to adjusted EBITDA range of 2.5x. And as we typically do, we'll provide 2023 guidance when we share our fourth quarter results.\nAmir, that's our presentation. We're now ready for Q&A.\n\nAmir Rozwadowski\n\nSenior VP of Finance & IR, AT&T Inc.\n\nThank you, Pascal. Operator, we're ready to take the first question.",

Welcome to AT&T's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI would like to turn the conference call over to our host, Amir Rozwadowski, Senior Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nAmir Rozwadowski\n\nSenior VP of Finance & IR, AT&T Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter call. I'm Amir Rozwadowski, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today are John Stankey, our CEO; and Pascal Desroches, our CFO.\nBefore we begin, I need to call your attention to our safe harbor statement. It says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they're subject to risks and uncertainties described in AT&T's SEC filings. Results may differ materially.\nI also want to remind you that we are in the quiet period for the FCC Spectrum Auction 108. So unfortunately, we can't answer questions about that today. And as always, additional information and earnings materials are available on the Investor Relations website.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to John Stankey. John?\n\nJohn T. Stankey\n\nCEO, President & Director, AT&T Inc.\n\nThanks, Amir. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Last quarter, I shared that AT&T had entered a new era with the right asset base capabilities and financial structure to become America's best broadband provider. I'm happy to share this morning that we're continuing our progress, improving our infrastructure and expanding our customer base across our twin engines of growth, 5G and Fiber.\nWe saw historic levels of second quarter net additions, thanks to our discipline and consistent go-to-market strategy and solid execution, building fiber and deploying our mid-band 5G spectrum assets. In Mobility, we brought in the most second quarter postpaid phone net adds in more than a decade, just like last quarter, building on our momentum from 2021.\nIt's noteworthy that we've sustained this momentum in a highly competitive environment. Industry growth in the first half of 2022 has been stronger than the expectations I shared with you late last year. In our view, this strong performance reinforces that our success is not solely promotion-led, but instead reflective of our improved value proposition in the market.\nEven though better-than-anticipated customer growth metrics resulted in some higher-than-expected success-based investment, ARPU and profitability in 2Q improved, and we expect that trend line to accelerate in the second half of the year. As Pascal will discuss shortly, we're, in fact, increasing our service revenue growth guidance for 2022.\nIn Fiber, we continue to invest in building out a premium network, drive a great build velocity and deliver on our stated expectations for accelerated customer growth through improved penetration rates. We're finding success in serving more customers in new and existing markets with what we believe is the best wired Internet offering available.\nThis is evidenced by our more than 300,000 second quarter AT&T Fiber net adds, marking our 10th straight quarter with more than 200,000 Fiber net adds. The strength and value of the AT&T Fiber experience is enabling us to increase share in our Fiber footprint and convert more IP broadband Internet subscribers to Fiber subscribers.\nUltimately, our Fiber strategy is a sustainable and long-term technology play that will support key macro trends. We expect to see a continuation of favorable ARPU trends as we expand the availability of what we believe is a best-in-class network with a multi-decade lifespan. So I'm very pleased with the strong customer growth we're seeing.\nOur success only reinforces the improved value proposition we're providing, and we expect our investment in top-tier technology to translate into strong resiliency for our services for years to come. Over the last 8 quarters, we've achieved an industry-best 6 million postpaid phone net adds while adding nearly 2.3 million AT&T Fiber customers, increasing our Fiber subscriber base by more than 50%.\nI'm also very proud with the progress our teams have made in rapidly expanding our 5G and fiber footprints. I'm pleased to say that we've achieved our target of covering 70 million mid-band POPs 2 quarters ahead of our year-end target, and are now on track to approach 100 million mid-band POPs by the end of this year.\nAnd our expanded Consumer Wireline fiber footprint now gives us the ability to serve 18 million customer locations. This is an increase of nearly 2 million from the start of the year. Our teams are running hard to deliver these world-class services to our customers. And we expect our commitment to investing in our core connectivity networks to serve as the foundation for AT&T's growth for decades to come.\nMoving to our second major priority. It's more important than ever we'd be effective and efficient across our operations. The dispositions we executed over the last 2 years provide us with operating flexibility to adjust, as needed, what is proving to be an increasingly pressured economic backdrop without requiring us to materially compromise on our investment priorities and financial obligations.\nWe have strong visibility on achieving more than $4 billion of our $6 billion transformation cost savings run rate target by the end of this year. As we shared before, we've initially reinvested these savings to fuel growth in our core connectivity businesses. However, as we enter the back half of this year, we expect these savings to start to contribute to the bottom line.\nAs you're likely aware, we're taking proactive measures, such as selective pricing adjustments, to address as much of the very real inflationary pressures that are clearly impacting all parts of our economy. The pricing strategy we implemented is being executed in a proactive and methodical way that enables some of our longest-standing customers the opportunity to take advantage of our most robust offers while also ensuring that we're responding to the real-time cost pressures in our business.\nI believe we've navigated this difficult reality effectively and, thus far, are seeing results that are consistent with our expectations, although not sufficient to cover all inflationary impacts. Last quarter, I shared that we're seeing inflationary pressures, and we estimate those to be more than $1 billion above the elevated cost expectations embedded into our outlook.\nWe're clearly operating in different times, and the macroeconomic backdrop is evolving in a dynamic manner. Still, we're confident in our ability to emerge in this chapter a stronger company, thanks to our position as one of the world's largest-scaled telecom operators, our improved underlying financial flexibility, the cost reduction initiatives we have in place, the essential nature of the services we provide and our pricing actions that help partially offset these impacts.\nWith that said, the current environment is not easy to predict. We're seeing more pressure on Business Wireline than expected. And on the consumer side of our business, we're seeing an increase in bad debt to slightly higher than pre-pandemic levels as well as extended cash collection cycles.\nHowever, it's important to note that historical patterns in previous economic cycles suggest customers have managed their accounts similar to what we're experiencing today. In fact, we feel even better about the resiliency of our services, given the elevated importance of connectivity in everyone's lives. We view this cycle no differently and still expect customers will pay their bills, albeit a little less timely.\nFurthermore, as I mentioned before, we feel better about our underlying financial flexibility that we have in quite a while. This is why we're confident, we can maintain our focus for growth over the long term by investing in the future of connectivity through 5G and fiber. It's our belief that near-term cyclical economic uncertainty does not warrant a retrenchment in the deployment of long-lived assets.\nThe long-term economic justification for these investments remain sound, and timing of the market development supports our intent to invest through this cycle. Importantly, we maintained our focus on paying down debt, with the $40 billion in proceeds from the completion of the WarnerMedia Discovery transaction in April helping us to significantly reduce our net debt in the quarter.\nI'd also like to touch on free cash flow directly. While free cash did come in lower than we expected this quarter, there were several notable factors that drove this. The first is the timing of higher success-based investments on the back of our robust customer growth.\nAdditionally, we front-end loaded our capital investment plans in order to kick-start our growth initiatives. We expect these plans to seasonally moderate through the course of the year as we achieve our $24 billion in capital investment plan. And I'm pleased we've been able to effectively manage our supply chain and front-end load some of our work this year.\nIn addition to these investment-driven impacts, we're seeing some longer collection cycles and inflationary costs that we've not been successful in fully offsetting. These cash flow impacts, along with expectations for a more tempered economic climate in the latter half of the year, have led us to adjust our cash flow expectations for the full year, even with our expected material improvements over the next 2 quarters.\nThe key takeaway is that we understand the emerging economic pressures on our business and feel confident in our ability to manage through them while, at the same time, investing for the long-term benefit of our customers and shareholders. While we're not immune to the pressures impacting the broader economy, the repositioning of our business to focus on core connectivity solutions, the underlying financial flexibility achieved through a significant reduction of our debt and the ability to invest in access technologies built for the long term allows us to opportunistically maneuver through this economic climate.\nFinally, I want to take a moment to discuss our Business Wireline unit and our focused efforts to reposition the asset. There is a sizable base of business revenue coming from legacy voice and data services, and this business is increasingly facing secular pressures as customers replace traditional voice services with mobile and other collaboration solutions.\nOn the data front, VPN and legacy transport services are being impacted by technology transitions to software-based solutions. Today, approximately half of our segment revenue comes from these types of services. Last quarter, we shared that we're experiencing additional government sector pressure related to the reallocation of spending priorities. This pressure, tied to the timing and restructuring of government spending, continued in 2Q.\nWhile we're hopeful that some spending will return and the Enterprise Infrastructure Solutions contract volumes and share gains will offset pricing reductions over time, we consider it prudent to reset expectations. It's worth noting that approximately 20% of the year-over-year Business Wireline revenue declines in the second quarter were due to government spending impacts.\nLastly, we saw inflation and wholesale network access charges we incur to provide services to customers outside of our footprint due to contractual resets. This cost pressure resulted in more than 20% of the segment's year-over-year EBITDA decline. This pressure will be managed through opportunities to operate more efficiently, movement of traffic to alternate providers, symmetrical wholesale pricing adjustments and natural product migration trends.\nLooking ahead, these developments only strengthen our resolve in executing our transformation, including actions to accelerate cost take-outs and simplify our product portfolio. We expect these actions to mitigate the year-over-year pressure in this segment's profitability over time. But we now expect Business Wireline EBITDA declines in the low double digits this year, and our expectation for stabilization extends to the back half of 2024.\nHowever, we remain confident in our efforts to reposition the segment. The deployment of Fiber is leading to an acceleration of growth each quarter in our connectivity solutions, which delivered close to 15% growth this quarter.\nOur Fiber expansion also provides us with the ability to gain market share in SMB, which is an underpenetrated segment for us. Moreover, we continue to utilize our business relationships to expand opportunities in Mobility. Since last year, we've taken more than 1 full point of share in the business Mobility space.\nOur focus on Fiber and 5G continues to gain traction. And we expect to use our strong enterprise and growing SMB relationships to take advantage of opportunities as they expand. We know this transformation won't happen overnight. But similar to our turnarounds in Mobility and Consumer Wireline, we're confident we have the right strategy in place and in our ability to execute it successfully.\nI'll now turn it over to Pascal to discuss the details for the quarter. Pascal?\n\nPascal Desroches\n\nSenior Executive VP & CFO, AT&T Inc.\n\nThank you, John. And good morning, everyone. Let's start by taking a look at our subscriber results for our market focus areas on Slide 5. As John mentioned, our consistent and disciplined go-to-market strategy continues to resonate with customers.\nIn the quarter, we had a remarkable 813,000 postpaid phone net adds, our best second quarter in more than a decade. Looking at Fiber, we had 316,000 net adds as we delivered upon our expectations to accelerate our subscriber growth. Our Fiber deployment plans remain on track, and we expect to continue our solid momentum with customers.\nNow let's move to our second quarter consolidated financial summary on Slide 6. First, it's important to note, with the closing of the WarnerMedia transaction in April, historical financial results have been recast to present WarnerMedia and certain other divested businesses, including Vrio, Xandr and Playdemic, as discontinued operations.\nWhile continuing operations provide a clearer view of our remaining operations, keep in mind that there continues to be some year-over-year comparative challenges as the prior year results also include DIRECTV and certain other dispositions. Therefore, where applicable, I will highlight our financial results on a comparative like-for-like basis in addition to continuing from operations.\nComparative revenues for the quarter were $29.6 billion, up 2.2% or more than $600 million year-over-year. This was largely driven by wireless revenue growth and, to a lesser extent, higher Mexico and Consumer Wireline revenues, partially offset by declines in Business Wireline.\nComparative adjusted EBITDA was up 1.7% year-over-year as growth in Wireless, Mexico and lower corporate costs were partially offset by Business Wireline declines. We continue to expect the year-over-year EBITDA trend line to progressively improve through the year as we begin to lap 3G shutdown costs and step up investments in technology that began in the second half of 2021.\nAdjusted EPS from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.65. On a comparative stand-alone AT&T basis, adjusted EPS was $0.64 in the year-ago quarter. Adjustments for the quarter were made to exclude a gain in our benefit plans, noncash restructuring and impairment charges and our proportionate share of DIRECTV intangible amortization.\nCash from operations for our continuing operations came in at $7.7 billion for the quarter. Capital investments of $6.7 billion was up $1.7 billion year-over-year. Free cash flow was $1.4 billion. DIRECTV cash distributions were $800 million in the quarter.\nCash flow for the quarter was affected by several key factors. First, as expected, we had higher front-end loaded capital investments as we ramped our Fiber and 5G mid-band spectrum deployment. As John already noted, we expect lower capital investment levels in the back half of the year, in line with our expectations of $24 billion.\nThe second is the timing of consumer collections, as it's taking about 2 more days than last year to collect customer receivables. The impact of this is almost $1 billion for the quarter. The last item is some incremental success-based investments, including device payments tied to accelerate subscriber growth.\nNow let's take a deeper look at our Communications segment operating results, starting with Mobility on Slide 7. Our Mobility business continues its record-level momentum. Revenues were up 5.2%, with service revenues growing 4.6%, driven by subscriber growth.\nMobility postpaid phone ARPU was $54.81, up $0.81 sequentially or 1.1% year-over-year. This is ahead of our prior expectations for stabilizing in the second half of the year. This improvement is largely a result of more customers trading up to higher-priced unlimited plans and improved roaming trends.\nOur June pricing actions were a modest benefit as well. But given the timing of the increases, we would expect our pricing access to be a larger factor in the back half of the year. Given our expectations for ARPU, we now expect service revenue growth of 4.5% to 5% for the year. That is up from our previously stated expectations of 3%-plus.\nMobility EBITDA increased 2.5% year-over-year despite an approximately $100 million impact from lower CAF II government credits and higher FirstNet cost. We also had around $130 million of higher bad debt expense during the quarter.\nWhile bad debt is now slightly higher than pre-pandemic levels, it is being offset by better-than-expected customer revenue growth. We remain confident that Mobility adjusted EBITDA growth accelerates in the second half of the year due to revenue growth and the lapping of 3G shutdown investments that began in the second half of 2021.\nAgain, our customer growth performance was better than we expected, especially when you consider we became less active in promotional activities compared to others in our industry. So it's clear to us that the strategic change we made to simplify our go-to-market strategy 2 years ago continue to yield great results and that our value proposition is resonating in the marketplace.\nNow let's turn to our operating results for Consumer and Business Wireline on Slide 8. Our Fiber growth was solid as we continue to win share where we have fiber. Our total Consumer Wireline revenues were up again this quarter, even with declines from copper-based broadband services.\nBroadband revenues grew 5.6% due to Fiber revenue growth and higher broadband ARPU, driven by a customer mix shift to Fiber and recent broadband pricing actions. Our Fiber ARPU was $61.65, up 5.3% year-over-year, with gross addition intake ARPU in the $65 to $70 range.\nWe expect overall Fiber ARPU to continue to improve as more customers roll off promotional pricing and on to simplified pricing constructs. We accelerated our fiber footprint build and now have the ability to serve 18 million customer locations with great AT&T Fiber experience that consistently receives high Net Promoter Scores.\nAs you heard at Analyst Day, our plans center on pivoting from a copper-based product to fiber, and we're doing just that. We continue to expect EBITDA growth to accelerate through the remainder of 2022, driven by continued growth in broadband revenues and the lapping of technology investments that began in the second half of 2021.\nLooking at Business Wireline, as John stated, revenues and earnings came in lower than we expected. There are 2 main factors that are driving the shortfall to our expectation: the first is lower revenue than anticipated from the government sector; the second is inflationary pressure on wholesale network access costs.\nOn a combined basis, these 2 factors accounted for about $100 million in EBITDA pressure year-over-year. While the Business Wireline transition and portfolio rationalization creates incremental pressure on near-term revenues, it underscores the importance of transitioning to our owned and operated connectivity services as well as growing 5G and Fiber-integrated solutions.\nIn fact, our connectivity services revenue growth continues to accelerate as we are up nearly 15% year-over-year. Both areas, Business 5G and Fiber, continue to perform well, with Business Wireline service revenue growth of 7.4% and a sequential increase in our FirstNet wireless base of more than 300,000.\nBefore we shift to questions, I want to provide you an update on how we are thinking about the rest of the year, given the dynamic macro environment we're operating in. As I mentioned previously, we like the momentum in our Mobility business, both on a service revenue and EBITDA basis.\nWhile we maintain expectations that 2022 industry postpaid phone demand levels are unlikely to replicate 2021, the strength we experienced in the first half of the year, coupled with better ARPU trends, give us confidence in our raised service revenue outlook and expectations for an improved EBITDA trajectory.\nOn Consumer Wireline, we are largely trending on plan, given mix shift to higher-ARPU Fiber plans, which is driving both revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth. On Business Wireline, you know the near-term challenges we are facing, which reduces our expectations.\nWe now expect Business Wireline to decline in the low double-digit EBITDA range for the year. Putting this all together, we remain comfortable in our ability to deliver revenue, adjusted EBITDA and EPS within our prior guidance ranges for the year.\nMoving to free cash flow. Given the combination of elevated success-based investment, the potential for further extension of payments by our customers, inflation and the more challenging environment facing our Business Wireline unit, we consider it prudent to take a more conservative outlook to free cash flow for the year.\nGiven these factors, we anticipate pressure of about $2 billion to our free cash flow guidance from our prior $16 billion range for the year. Now before the questions on how we get to the implied $10 billion of free cash flow in the second half of the year when we generated $4 billion in the first half of the year, let me provide you with some specific items to consider.\nOur outlook reflects the following expectations: $3 billion-plus lower device payment versus the first half of the year due to timing; nearly $2 billion lower capital investment versus the first half of the year as we reach our $24 billion expectations for the full year. The balance of the improvement relative to the first half of the year is due to wireless customer growth, including our recent pricing increases and lower cash interest expense.\nWe expect these benefits to be partially offset by reduced distributions from DIRECTV and our expectations for incremental tax payments in the second half of the year. However, we do expect full year tax payments to be lower than we previously anticipated. Additionally, we expect typical free cash flow seasonality, with the fourth quarter higher than the third quarter.\nAlthough we're not providing an updated 2023 outlook, we expect improved cash conversion of EBITDA in 2023. Here's how. Better Mobility cash flow as we get a full year benefit from a larger subscriber base at higher ARPU level. We expect MVNO volumes to ramp and become more material through the course of the year. International roaming trends should improve as well.\nWe expect broadband revenue growth from the mix shift to higher-priced fiber to continue. On the cost structure, we expect a full year benefit from our cost transformation efforts implemented in 2022 in conjunction with reaching our $6 billion-plus target by the end of 2023.\nAdditionally, the cost actions we plan to execute in Business Wireline in the second half of the year should produce more than $300 million of savings in 2023 relative to 2022. Also recall that we have no 3G shutdown costs in 2023.\nIn addition, we expect lower cash interest expense as we get a full year benefit from the debt paydown actions taken in 2022. All these factors should more than offset the expected lower distribution from DIRECTV and an expected year-over-year increase in cash taxes.\nIn summary, there is no doubt we're operating in a dynamic macro environment, but we feel confident in both the resilient nature of our business and the underlying financial flexibility we gained from recent dispositions. Amir, that's our presentation. We're now ready for the Q&A.\n\nAmir Rozwadowski\n\nSenior VP of Finance & IR, AT&T Inc.\n\nThank you, Pascal. Operator, we're ready to take the first question.",

Welcome to AT&T's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI would like to turn the conference over to our host, Amir Rozwadowski, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nAmir Rozwadowski\n\nSenior VP of Finance & IR, AT&T Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter call. I'm Amir Rozwadowski, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today are John Stankey, our CEO; and Pascal Desroches, our CFO.\nBefore we begin, I need to call your attention to our safe harbor statement. It says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they're subject to risks and uncertainties described in AT&T's SEC filings. Results may differ materially. Additional information is available on the Investor Relations website. And as always, our earnings materials are on our website.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to John Stankey. John?\n\nJohn T. Stankey\n\nCEO, President & Director, AT&T Inc.\n\nThanks, Amir, and good morning to all of you. I appreciate you joining us this morning.\nTwo weeks ago, we reached a major milestone in the repositioning of our business with the completion of the WarnerMedia Discovery transaction less than 11 months after announcing the deal. I'd like to thank everyone who played a role in getting this across the finish line in good time and with a little drama, just as we promised you.\nI'd also like to share how proud we are of the entire WarnerMedia team. David inherits an organization with one of the best global portfolios of beloved intellectual property, a team with unparalleled talent and one of the few truly global direct-to-consumer players, as evidenced by the continued growth in HBO Max and HBO subscribers which closed this quarter at nearly 77 million globally, up 3 million from last quarter and nearly 13 million year-over-year. We're excited about the potential for continued HBO Max growth as the service launches in more new territories.\nWarner Bros. Discovery is well positioned to lead the transformation we're seeing unfold across the media and entertainment landscape. And like many of my fellow AT&T shareholders who own a stake in this new and promising enterprise, we're excited to continue to watch their success and the value they create as one of the leading global media companies.\nSo let me turn to AT&T and the new era and opportunities ahead of us. Our transaction marks a critical step in the repositioning of our business. We're now able to focus intensely on what we believe will be multiyear secular tailwinds in connectivity. We now have the right asset base and financial structure to devote our energy to becoming America's best broadband provider. Over a 5-year period, we expect a fivefold data increase on our networks and we plan to capitalize on the growing desire from consumers and businesses for ubiquitous access to best-in-class connectivity solutions. The results we've achieved the past 7 quarters, all while undergoing a significant repositioning of our business, give me confidence that we can accomplish this goal.\nOur first quarter financial results are consistent with our expectations and once again demonstrate that our teams are executing well against our consistent business priorities. We're seeing record levels of net additions in Mobility and consistently strong AT&T Fiber growth, thanks to our disciplined and consistent go-to-market strategy.\nIn Mobility, our strong network performance, simplified offers and improving customer experience brought in the most first quarter postpaid phone net adds in more than a decade, surpassing last year's then decade best first quarter total. And we're confident we can continue this momentum in a disciplined manner, given our subscriber success has come from diversified channels that span consumers and businesses.\nIn Fiber, we continue our great build velocity and now have the ability to serve 17 million customer locations. This expansion continues to allow our business to grow. And this quarter, we achieved overall broadband subscriber and revenue growth as our Fiber net adds more than offset legacy non-Fiber broadband losses.\nI'm pleased with the improved fiber momentum we're seeing with our multi-gig plans launched early in the first quarter. It's also noteworthy that we're experiencing improved subscriber growth following the introduction of our straightforward pricing across the fiber portfolio, which does away with discounted introductory pricing. This improvement in share gains suggest that consumers are finding value and higher quality services when they're made available to them.\nSo taking a step back, let's review our progress over the last 7 quarters. During that time, we've added industry-best subscriber totals of more than 5.3 million in postpaid phones and nearly 2 million in AT&T Fiber, as our fast-growing fiber revenues now make up nearly half of our Consumer Wireline broadband revenues. This is real and sustainable momentum.\nWe also continue to emphasize effectiveness and efficiency across our operations. As we shared at our Analyst Day last month, we expect to achieve more than $4 billion of our $6 billion cost savings run rate target by the end of this year.\nOur focus on driving efficiencies continues to show tangible results from our network build-out to customer experience. As we told you, we're initially reinvesting these savings to fuel growth in our core connectivity businesses. However, as we move to the back half of this year, we expect these savings to start to fall to the bottom line.\nOur success over the past 7 quarters can also be attributed to our focus on better recognizing and delivering on what customers want. Our Mobility and Fiber Net Promoter Scores are up year-over-year. And near historically low churn levels across all businesses demonstrate how our improvements to the customer experience are real and delivering a positive impact.\nOur Business Wireline unit continues its transformation. As we move through this year, we had planned to accelerate the pace at which we reposition the business as we focus our energy on growing repeatable core connectivity and transport solutions where we have owners economics. At the same time, we'll continue to rationalize reselling low-margin, third-party products and services. The expansion of our fiber footprint is enabling our business portfolio to target significant opportunities in the small and medium business market, allowing us to capture a greater portion of the opportunities in core transport and connectivity. In addition, as we open up relationships with more customers, we'll have incremental opportunities to continue our growth in business wireless.\nWe expect to take advantage of these near-term opportunities to help stabilize our Business Wireline unit as we simplify the portfolio and grow connectivity with small- to medium-sized businesses complementing our leading enterprise position.\nAs we thoughtfully fuel growth for services powered by our owned and operated connectivity assets, we're also being deliberate in how we allocate our capital. We've taken significant steps to improve our financial flexibility, and we're now in a much better place to grow our business as we significantly invest in the future of connectivity through 5G and fiber.\nWith the completion of the WarnerMedia Discovery transaction, we've monetized more than $50 billion of assets since the beginning of 2021. And with this transaction, we reduced our net debt by approximately $40 billion in April.\nAs we share, we feel as though we're really well suited to navigate this unique moment in time. This leaves us in a much better position to pay down debt. In fact, we've already addressed some of our near-term maturities and paid off over $10 billion in bank loans. This improved financial posture gives us the flexibility to carefully and prudently use the balance of the WarnerMedia proceeds to reduce our outstanding debt by opportunistically using the evolving higher rate environment to redeem debt securities at lower prices while also working to reduce cash interest. In addition, our expectations for continued strong cash generation provide us with incremental capabilities to reduce leverage while still paying an attractive dividend yield near the top of the Fortune 500. This improved financial flexibility also allows us to pursue durable and sustainable growth opportunities that offer future upside for customers and shareholders.\nIf you couldn't tell, I'm proud of all the work the team has accomplished to reposition the business over the last 7 quarters and could not be more excited about this next chapter for AT&T. I know our teams are thrilled about the momentum we're generating with our deliberate and focused approach in attracting and retaining customers.\nI'll now turn it over to Pascal to discuss the details of the quarter. Pascal?\n\nPascal Desroches\n\nSenior Executive VP & CFO, AT&T Inc.\n\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by taking a look at our first quarter consolidated financial summary on Slide 5. It's important to note that our first quarter consolidated results include the contributions of WarnerMedia and that last year's first quarter included results of our U.S. Video business and Vrio. Accordingly, our reported results do not provide a clear reflection of our business on a forward-looking basis. So let me quickly cover a few key points before reviewing the financial results of our new stand-alone AT&T operations on the next slide.\nOn a consolidated basis, including a full quarter of WarnerMedia, our adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.77 compared to $0.85 in the first quarter of 2021. In addition to merger amortization, adjustments for the quarter were made to exclude our proportionate share of DIRECTV intangible amortization and a gain in our benefit plans.\nYear-over-year earnings declines were primarily driven by WarnerMedia and, to a lesser extent, certain onetime costs in the Communications segment. The declines in earnings at WarnerMedia reflect increased investments incurred in launching CNN+ and expanding new territories at HBO Max. HBO Max and HBO now reached an impressive global subscriber base of nearly 77 million. WarnerMedia's results were also impacted by the advertising sharing agreement entered into with DIRECTV upon its separation in last year's third quarter and the termination of HBO Max's wholesale agreement with Amazon late last year.\nWhen excluding revenues from our U.S. Video business and Vrio from the prior year quarter, AT&T consolidated revenues were $38.1 billion, up 1.6% or $600 million year-over-year.\nCash from operations came in at $5.7 billion for the quarter.\nOverall spending was up with capital investments totaling $6.3 billion.\nFree cash flow was $700 million for the quarter. WarnerMedia had declines of $2.6 billion in free cash flow year-over-year. This decline was driven by $1.2 billion in lower year-over-year securitization of receivables in advance of the transaction, $600 million in higher cash content spend, increased investments in HBO Max's global footprint and ramp-up for the CNN+ launch as well as NHL right payments and other working capital changes.\nNow let's look at our financials for the new stand-alone AT&T on Slide 6. On a comparative like-for-like basis, our financial results for the quarter are in line with our expectations for how we expect the year to trend. However, our subscriber metrics came in better than we expected as market conditions remain strong. This gives us confidence in the annual guidance provided at our recent Analyst Day.\nRevenues were $29.7 billion, up 2.5% or $700 million year-over-year, driven by wireless and broadband revenue growth, partially offset by declines in Business Wireline.\nAdjusted EBITDA was flattish year-over-year as lower retained video costs were offset by peak impact from our 3G network shutdown, continued success-based investments in wireless and fiber and the launch of multi-gig fiber plans. We remain confident that Q1 will be the trough in our year-over-year adjusted EBITDA trajectory. We continue to expect the year-over-year trend line to progressively improve through the year.\nOn a comparative basis, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.63 versus $0.58 in the first quarter of 2021 due to higher equity income from DIRECTV and lower interest expense.\nCash from operations came in at $7.7 billion for the quarter.\nOverall spending was up year-over-year with stand-alone AT&T capital investments of $6.1 billion.\nFree cash flow was $2.9 billion. As expected, cash flow this quarter was affected by several factors. First, higher capital investments as we ramp fiber deployment and prepare to deploy our 5G mid-band spectrum bands in the back half of the year. Second, the absorption of 3G shutdown impact. Third, increased employee incentive compensation benefits paid in Q1. Fourth, lower proceeds from securitizations.\nDIRECTV cash distributions were $1.8 billion in the quarter, which is modestly better than the $1.5 billion contribution in last year's first quarter. We continue to expect about $4 billion distribution from DIRECTV for the year, so we do expect some moderation.\nGiven that Q1 is a seasonally low quarter for free cash flow and many of the factors impacting free cash are not expected to repeat, we remain confident in the guidance we provided to you during our Analyst Day to achieve free cash flow in the $16 billion range for the year and on a stand-alone basis.\nLooking forward, we expect to incur restructuring charges over the next few quarters as we continue to execute our transformation initiatives. The cash impact of these charges has already been contemplated in our full year free cash flow guidance.\nNow let's turn to our subscriber results for our market focus areas on Slide 7. Diving a bit deeper into our business unit level performance, the story continues to be simple and straightforward. The consistent, disciplined go-to-market strategy we implemented almost 2 years ago continues to work very well, and we're delivering strong momentum and growing customer relationships with 5G and fiber.\nIn the quarter, we had 691,000 postpaid phone net adds. As John said, this marks our best first quarter in more than a decade. This total also excludes impacts of 3G network shutdown of more than 400,000 postpaid phones. Consistent with industry practice, we have treated this reduction as an adjustment of our base at the beginning of the period.\nChurn also remained near historically low levels, thanks in part to our improving NPS, which is being driven by an enhanced customer experience, the strength of our network and our consistent and simple offers. We're growing our customer base with this disciplined approach. Our teams have maintained a strong focus on growing the right way with high-quality intake and by investing in existing customers. As mentioned in March, we're focused on incentivizing customers to shift to our current unlimited rate plans, which are designed for the 5G era and to better meet each customer's unique needs and provide greater value to both existing and new customers.\nLooking at AT&T Fiber, our customer base continues to grow as we expand availability of the best access technology across our footprint. We had 289,000 AT&T Fiber net adds in the first quarter and we expect to accelerate growth from here.\nTo say we're excited about the underlying momentum of the business would be an understatement. Where we have Fiber, we win and gain share and our deployment plans remain on track. We now have 6.3 million AT&T Fiber customers, up 1.1 million compared to a year ago and we expect customer momentum to accelerate from these already stepped-up levels. We continue to see strong demand for AT&T Fiber as customers seek out faster broadband speeds at an attractive price. And our Fiber churn remains low as AT&T Fiber continues to offer a great experience and a consistently high Net Promoter Score.\nNow let's take a deeper look at our Communications segment operating results, starting with Mobility on Slide 8. Our Mobility business continues its record-level momentum. Revenues were up 5.5%, with service revenues growing 4.8% due to subscriber growth. Impressively, this growth in service revenue comes despite impact on service revenue of our 3G shutdown and without a material return of international roaming revenues.\nConsistent with our comments on Analyst Day, Mobility EBITDA declined 1.8% year-over-year, largely due to a number of onetime-related factors. EBITDA was negatively impacted by over $300 million due to 3G shutdown costs and the absence of FirstNet [and capital] reimbursement. We remain confident in our stated expectations for Mobility adjusted EBITDA trajectory to improve through the course of the year as these impacts moderate through the balance of the year.\nOverall, we continue to see healthy Mobility demand. While our guidance does not factor in industry demand levels replicating the strength that we experienced in 2021, our Q1 results came in better than anticipated. Both our postpaid phone and prepaid phone churn remained near record low levels despite a modest uptick among lower-income cohorts as certain pandemic levels [wear off].\nNow let's turn to our operating results for Consumer and Business Wireline on Slide 9. Our fiber growth was solid as we continue to win share where we have fiber. Even with expected declines from copper-based broadband services, our total Consumer Wireline revenues are up again this quarter, growing 2% due to higher broadband ARPU and fiber revenue growth.\nOur fiber ARPU was approximately $60 with gross addition intake ARPU in the $65 to $70 range. We expect overall fiber ARPU to continue to improve as more customers roll off promotional pricing and on to simplified pricing constructs we introduced earlier this year.\nIn addition, with the launch of our new multi-gig speeds in January, we have even more opportunity to move customers to higher speed tiers. Over time, we expect these factors to serve as a tailwind to the trajectory of our fiber ARPU.\nWe also continue to accelerate our Fiber footprint build and now have the ability to serve 17 million customer locations. As you heard us share on Analyst Day, our plans center on pivoting from copper-based products to fiber. As we make this pivot, we expect positive EBITDA growth in 2022, driven by growth in broadband revenues.\nAlso to help provide you with greater insight into the performance of our Consumer Wireline Fiber operations, we've provided additional metrics in our trending materials that can be found on our IR website.\nLooking at Business Wireline, we continue to execute on our rationalization of low-margin products in our portfolio. In the first quarter, we experienced some impacts by the timing of government sector demand due to the delays in passing the federal budget, which caused deeper-than-expected revenue declines. However, we expect demand to rebound later this year.\nWhile the rationalization of our Business Wireline portfolio creates incremental pressure on our near-term revenues, it also allows us to focus on our own and operated connectivity services as well as growing 5G and fiber integrated solutions. Both areas, business 5G and fiber, continue to perform well, benefiting our Mobility segment with Business Solutions wireless service revenue growth of 8.4% and a sequential increase in our FirstNet wireless base by about 300,000.\nWe remain comfortable with our guidance of Business Wireline EBITDA down mid-single digits in 2022.\nShifting to Slide 10, I'd like to reiterate our overall capital allocation framework moving forward. With the completion of the WarnerMedia transaction, AT&T received $40.4 billion in cash and WarnerMedia's retention of certain existing debt. Additionally, AT&T shareholders received 1.7 billion shares of Warner Bros. Discovery, representing 71% of the new company. This transaction greatly strengthens our balance sheet and provides us with financial flexibility going forward. We now have a simplified capital allocation framework.\nFirst, we plan to invest in our strategic focus areas: 5G and Fiber. As previously said, we expect stand-alone AT&T capital investments of $24 billion in 2022 and 2023. Starting in 2024, we expect our capital investment to begin tapering to around the $20 billion range as we surpass peak levels of investments in 5G and transformation.\nThe completion of the WarnerMedia transaction also marks a significant step towards achieving our established goal for net debt to adjusted EBITDA in the 2.5x range by the end of 2023. We've shared, as we get closer to this target, we expect our financial flexibility to improve. This increases our ability to pursue other ways to deliver incremental value for our shareholders.\nAs previously said, we expect to deliver annual total dividends of around $8 billion, which represents $1.11 per common share. This remains an attractive dividend and places AT&T among the very best dividend-yielding stocks in the U.S.\nNow let's take a step back and look at the free cash flow generation expected from our business. As outlined at our Analyst Day, we expect to generate in the range of $20 billion of free cash flow in 2023. After paying dividends and noncontrolling interest commitments, we expect to have at least $10 billion of cash remaining. And beyond 2023, this pace of cash generation will be helped by the tapering down of our capital investment. This is why we continue to feel very comfortable with our capital allocation plans.\nAs I've stated, we're in a much stronger financial position to pay down debt. And at the end of the first quarter, more than 90% of our debt portfolio was fixed and we do not have near-term needs to issue debt. In April, we improved our net debt by about $40 billion and paid down over $10 billion in bank loans, providing us with a lot more financial flexibility. We also provided notice that we plan to redeem an additional $12.5 billion of bonds by mid May, reducing our near-term maturities.\nFor the balance of the WarnerMedia proceeds, we plan to reduce our outstanding debt by focusing on pay down of commercial paper to improve our liquidity and opportunistically using the higher-rate environment to redeem debt at lower prices. So we feel really confident in our ability to pay down our current debt maturities in an effective manner and reach our goal for net debt to adjusted EBITDA.\nAmir, that's our presentation. We're now ready for the Q&A.\n\nAmir Rozwadowski\n\nSenior VP of Finance & IR, AT&T Inc.\n\nThank you, Pascal. Operator, we're ready to take the first question.",

Welcome to AT&T's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions)\nAnd as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to turn the conference call over to our host, Amir Rozwadowski, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nAmir Rozwadowski\n\nSenior VP of Finance & IR, AT&T Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter call. I'm Amir Rozwadowski, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today are John Stankey, our CEO; and Pascal Desroches, our CFO.\nBefore we begin, I need to call your attention to our safe harbor statement. It says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they're subject to risks and uncertainties described in AT&T's SEC filings. Results may differ materially.\nAdditional information is available on the Investor Relations website. And as always, our earnings materials are on our website. In addition, the FCC Spectrum Auction 110 results have been announced, but we're still in the quiet period, so we're limited in what we can say.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to John Stankey. John?\n\nJohn T. Stankey\n\nCEO, President & Director, AT&T Inc.\n\nThanks, Amir, and good morning, everyone. I hope you're all doing well, and a belated Happy New Year to all of you.\n1.5 years ago, we began simplifying our business strategy to reposition AT&T for growth. As you can imagine, this was a significant undertaking requiring us to not only focus our operational efforts toward growing customers, but also doing so in a manner that set us up for an improved profit trajectory in the coming years.\nSimultaneously, we took on the task of structuring our communications, video and media businesses in a manner that ensures their future success with the right capital structures, access to capital and most importantly, the ability to drive better returns in a manner consistent with their respective market opportunities. I'm pleased with the results our teams delivered last quarter, last year and for the last 6 quarters while this repositioning was underway.\nWe finished last year with strong momentum in growing customer relationships, achieving outstanding yearly subscriber growth across Mobility, fiber and HBO Max. In Mobility, strong network performance and a consistent go-to-market strategy helped us lead the industry with about 3.2 million postpaid phone net adds. That's more customers than we added in the prior 10 years combined. We achieved this growth the right way with full year Mobility EBITDA up about $1 billion.\nIn fiber, we ended the year with a great build velocity, passing more than 2.6 million additional customer locations. We added more than 1 million fiber subscribers for the fourth consecutive year, and full year broadband revenues were up 6.5% as we returned our Consumer Wireline business to revenue growth.\nWe also surpassed our high-end guidance for global HBO Max and HBO subscribers, adding 13.1 million subscribers in 2021, more than any year in HBO's history. HBO Max and HBO now reaches a base of 73.8 million subscribers globally. WarnerMedia is well positioned as a dynamic global business.\nIn addition to growing customer relationships, we also continue to make great progress in repositioning our operations to be more effective and efficient. We achieved more than half of our $6 billion cost savings run rate target, which we've reinvested into operations supporting our growth. This includes simplifying and enhancing our customer experience, which has resulted in higher customer self-service, lower customer churn and greatly improved mobility NPS and industry-leading fiber NPS.\nWe also continue to rationalize our low-margin Business Wireline services as we reinvest savings into segments that support improving returns. And you're familiar with the significant steps we've taken to reposition the company's assets for future success from our U.S. video assets in Vrio to our pending WarnerMedia transaction. Together, these and other asset monetizations will generate more than $50 billion, and AT&T shareholders will own 71% of one of the world's foremost media companies in the new Warner Bros. Discovery at close.\nWe also continue to generate meaningful levels of free cash flow, nearly $27 billion in 2021, a number we feel good about when looking at our business after the WarnerMedia transaction. So to summarize, we did what we said we were going to do last year. I'm really proud of what our team has accomplished, and we're very pleased with the momentum we have.\nTurning the page to this year, we'll be consistent in focusing on these same 3 operational and business priorities. Now that our asset disposition initiatives are largely complete, I expect we'll take our execution to the next level.\nTo that end, we're encouraged with how the process for the WarnerMedia deal is progressing and now expect the transaction to close in the second quarter. Going forward, we aim to be America's best broadband provider powered by 5G and fiber and defined by greater ubiquity, reliability, capacity and speed.\nWe're confident we can achieve that because in wireless, our focus will be continuing our subscriber momentum while increasing the pace of our 5G deployment. We're confident in our ability to compete with 5G and our disciplined approach to selectively targeting and taking share in underpenetrated segments of the consumer and business marketplace.\nWhile we're still in the quiet period, I can share that we're very pleased with the results of Spectrum Auction 110. We received 40 megahertz of quality mid-band spectrum that we can begin to put into service this year, and we plan to efficiently deploy it with our C-band spectrum using just one tower climb.\nWe're on track to cover 200 million POPs using mid-band spectrum by the end of 2023. And our network is only going to get better as we effectively deploy our new spectrum holdings.\nIn wired broadband, we have the fastest-growing fiber network and expect to capitalize on the expansion of our fiber footprint and accelerate subscriber growth. The best-in-class experience we provide is getting even better with our multi-gig rollout, which brings the fastest Internet to AT&T fiber customers with symmetrical 2-gig and 5-gig speed tiers. This will truly differentiate how our customers experience the Internet.\nComing off an outstanding year with HBO Max, we plan to hand off the business with a strong exit velocity, and we look to further our international momentum and deliver more world-class content for viewers. When the deal closes, the investments made in both content and HBO Max growth, coupled with strong execution by the team, will ensure Warner Bros. Discovery is positioned as a leading global media company with the depth of content and the capabilities required to lead in the next era of media.\nAs we expand our customer base, we'll continue to responsibly remove costs from the business. We have a clear line of sight to achieving more than 2/3 of our $6 billion cost savings run rate target by the end of this year. And importantly, we expect the CD savings start to fall to our bottom line beginning in the back half of the year.\nOur increased ability to reinvest in our business will fuel growth and allow us to deliver an even better customer experience as we further improve NPS and sustain low churn levels. As we expand our fiber reach, we'll be orienting our business portfolio to leverage this opportunity and stabilize our Business Wireline unit by growing connectivity with small to midsized businesses.\nWe also plan to use our strong fiber and wireless asset base, broad distribution and converged product offers to strengthen our overall market position. We're now at the dawn of a new age of connectivity where customers want more consolidated and integrated offers, and we're well positioned to meet that demand.\nOur 5G network is already the best and most reliable. And it will be enhanced by our accelerated fiber expansion in 5G spectrum deployment, a great reputation for advanced and reliable networking and our expertise to bring it all together for the customer.\nWe remain laser-focused on reducing debt, and we'll strengthen our balance sheet by using proceeds from the WarnerMedia transaction to achieve a 2.5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA by the end of 2023. We also expect to remain a top dividend-paying company after deal close, with a dividend payout in the $8 billion to $9 billion range where anywhere in that range should rank us among the best dividend yields in corporate America.\nWe're now in the middle innings of our transformation, and the momentum we have is real and sustainable. We're well positioned post deal close to have a capital structure and balance sheet that puts us in an attractive position relative to our peers.\nIn addition, we believe it provides us with the financial flexibility to invest significantly in our business and the flexibility to pursue additional shareholder value creation initiatives over time. We look forward to giving you more detail at our virtual analyst event, which we expect to host in March.\nNow I'll turn it over to Pascal. Pascal?\n\nPascal Desroches\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, AT&T Inc.\n\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Slide 6 should look familiar. As our pre-release earlier this month already indicated, we continue to deliver growth in postpaid phones, fiber and HBO Max.\nJohn just highlighted our full year results. We're really pleased with them and expect the momentum we've built in 2021 to carry over to 2022.\nLet's now take a look at our financial summary on Slide 7, starting with revenues. On a comparable basis, excluding DIRECTV and Vrio from both periods, consolidated revenues were up more than 4% for the quarter and about 6% for the year, thanks to growth in our market focus areas. Adjusted EBITDA was down 8% for the quarter on a comparable basis. Growth in mobility was more than offset by a decline at WarnerMedia from the increased HBO Max investment, the new DIRECTV advertising channel arrangements and lower contribution from basic networks.\nOur consolidated operating income results continue to be impacted by certain retained costs from DIRECTV that are in the process of being rationalized. Apart from WarnerMedia's contributions, our Communications segment EBITDA was up approximately 2% for the quarter.\nAdjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.78. In addition to merger amortization, adjustments for the quarter were made to exclude our proportionate share of DIRECTV intangible amortization and a gain in our benefit plan. For the year, EPS was up nearly 7% with strong organic growth in mobility, lower interest, lower benefit costs and higher investment gains.\nWe exceeded our free cash flow guidance for the year. For the quarter, cash from operations was $11.3 billion, spending increase year-over-year with CapEx of $3.8 billion and gross capital investments totaling $4.9 billion. Free cash flow for the quarter was $8.7 billion even with a year-over-year increase of $1.4 billion in CapEx.\nFor the full year, free cash flow was $26.8 billion despite an increase in CapEx of about $900 million and more than $4 billion in higher cash content costs. Our total dividend payout ratio was about 56%. This included cash distributions from DIRECTV of $1.9 billion.\nLet's now look at our segment operating results, starting with our Communication business on Slide 8. For the second consecutive quarter, our Communications segment grew both revenues and EBITDA. A big part of that growth was driven by our increasing strength in mobility, which turned in another solid quarter.\nService revenues were up 4.6% for the quarter and 3.7% for the year driven by postpaid and prepaid subscriber gains. Postpaid phone churn continues to run at low levels and in fact, hit a record low for the full year.\nOur strong subscriber momentum continues with industry-leading postpaid phone growth. Prepaid also continues to deliver impressive results with phone churn less than 3% and revenues up mid-single digits. Cricket momentum continues with strong ad and phone churn substantially lower than 3%.\nMobility EBITDA was up more than $300 million driven by growth in service revenues and transformation savings. This growth comes without a material return to international roaming and with 3G shutdown costs of about $130 million during the quarter. We remain on track to successfully shut down our 3G network next month and expect 3G shutdown impacts to peak in the first quarter of 2022 at about $250 million.\nIn addition, we expect another $100 million of expense in the first quarter associated with investment in our FirstNet operations and the completion of support funding for the CAF II program.\nBusiness Wireline EBITDA margins continue to be stable as we rationalize our portfolio of low-margin products. In fact, margins were up 50 basis points year-over-year, thanks to our transformation process. This rationalization process will continue in 2022. And as we lap the beginning of this process, we should see improving revenue trends in Business Wireline in the latter part of 2022.\nWe believe we're really well positioned in the enterprise space. And there is an interesting dynamic as public and private networking stock (inaudible). We have the account management infrastructure, the consulting expertise and the capabilities to support those businesses through that evolution as converged wireline and wireless solutions become the norm. At the same time, we're energized by the opportunities that our fiber expansion creates in the small to midsized business segment, and we plan to be more active there going forward.\nTurning to Consumer Wireline. Our fiber customer growth and fiber network expansion continues. And we continue to win share wherever we have fiber. We added 271,000 fiber customers even in a traditionally slow fourth quarter, and our fiber network continues to get even better with our new multi-gig speeds for AT&T fiber.\nDriven by our strength in fiber, total Consumer Wireline revenues were up for the third consecutive quarter. We had sequential EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter. Segment EBITDA did decline year-over-year due to a onetime pandemic-related benefit in last year's fourth quarter and higher network costs, including storms in the quarter.\nLet's move to WarnerMedia's results, which are on Slide 9. WarnerMedia revenues were up 15.4%, led by strong content licensing and D2C growth. D2C subscription revenues grew 11%, reflecting continued success of HBO Max, partially offset by lower wholesale revenues related to the termination of our arrangement with Amazon at the end of the third quarter.\nContent and other revenues were up 45%, reflecting higher TV licensing and theatrical releases. Advertising revenues were down about 13% primarily due to lower audiences with tough comparison to the political environment in last year's fourth quarter.\nCosts were up year-over-year due to a significant increase in programming and marketing, including the international launch costs for HBO Max. Incremental HBO Max investments for the quarter was approximately $500 million.\nThe fourth quarter also included the impact of about $380 million in DIRECTV advertising revenue sharing cost. We also launched some incredible content in the fourth quarter, including the premiere of the hit series And Just Like That and the third season of Succession. With the production team operating close to full throttle, we expect peak content investment in 2022 with an even stronger release schedule, including Batman, Winning Time: The Rise of Lakers Dynasty and the highly anticipated Game of Thrones prequel House of the Dragon.\nNow let's look at our 2022 guidance on Slide 11. What we're showing you today is a full year view of our consolidated revenue outlook excluding DIRECTV and Vrio from both periods. Our outlook does include a full year of expected results for WarnerMedia and Xandr. We also included our full year expectation for WarnerMedia's stand-alone contribution to help you model post close.\nWe now expect the WarnerMedia Discovery transaction to close in the second quarter. Given this, we plan to update guidance for RemainCo at our upcoming virtual analyst event in March. Until then, let me walk you through our expectations for the year.\nFirst, we expect consolidated revenue growth in the low single-digit range with wireless service revenue growth of about 3% plus for the full year. Mobility EBITDA is expected to grow low single digits plus over the course of the year as we continue to take disciplined share of subscribers with attractive long-term value.\nAs noted earlier, several onetime related impacts such as peaking 3G network shutdown costs are expected to impact year-over-year EBITDA trends in the first quarter. Consumer Wireline revenues and EBITDA are expected to grow on improving fiber subscriber trends. However, we expect front-end loaded investments to impact first quarter year-over-year EBITDA trends as we ramp up promotional efforts around our new multi-gig offering.\nAs noted earlier, we expect year-over-year comparison pressures to ease in our Business Wireline segment through the course of the year. However, we expect product rationalization to peak in the first quarter, resulting in more pronounced margin pressures in the first part of the year before recovering in the back half of the year.\nConsolidated adjusted EPS is expected to be in the $3.10 to $3.15 range. This guidance reflects WarnerMedia's declining contributions due to anticipated investment initiatives, a 200 basis point increase in our effective tax rate and no anticipated investment gains. We also expect adjusted equity income contributions from DIRECTV to be about $3 billion for the year. Look for more details on our earnings outlook during our upcoming virtual analyst event.\nGross capital investment is expected to be in the $24 billion range and capital expenditures in the $20 billion range. Free cash flow is expected to be in the $23 billion range. That includes expected DIRECTV cash distribution of approximately $4 billion and $2 billion in higher expected cash taxes in 2022, reflecting the expiration of the immediate expensing of R&D and lower limitations on interest expense deductions starting this year.\nWe expect WarnerMedia's full year contributions when including Xandr to be: revenues in the $37 billion to $39 billion range, EBITDA in the $6 billion to $7 billion range and free cash flow contribution of approximately $3 billion as we expect 2022 to be the peak investment year for HBO Max.\nAmir, that's our presentation. We're now ready for the Q&A.\n\nAmir Rozwadowski\n\nSenior VP of Finance & IR, AT&T Inc.\n\nThank you, Pascal. Operator, we're ready to take the first question.",

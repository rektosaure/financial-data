I'm Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President and Head of Medtronic Investor Relations. Joining me here today are Geoff Martha, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Thierry Piéton, Chief Financial Officer. Geoff and Thierry will provide comments on the results of our Q2, which ended on 24 October 2025, and our outlook for the remainder of fiscal year 2026. After our prepared remarks, we'll take questions from the Sell-side analysts that cover the company. Today's program should last about an hour. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release discussing our results and containing several financial schedules. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The presentation can be accessed in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com.\nDuring today's program, many of the statements we make may be considered forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause our actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. Unless we say otherwise, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, and revenue comparisons are made on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange, Q2 revenue in the current and prior year from our divestiture this quarter of the Dutch Obesity Clinic, also known as NOK, and Q2 revenue in the current and prior year reported as other. References to sequential revenue changes compare to the Q1 of fiscal 2026 and are made on an as-reported basis.\nAll share references are on a revenue and year-over-year basis and compare our 2nd fiscal quarter to our competitor's 3rd calendar quarter. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. Finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. With that, over to you, Geoff.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nOkay, thanks, Ryan, and hello, everyone. Last quarter, I told you that Medtronic is on the cusp of an acceleration in our financial results and our strategy. Well, today I'm pleased to share that because of our organization's relentless focus, that acceleration is indeed underway. We delivered a strong Q2. Both our revenue and EPS beat expectations. Looking across our business, procedure volumes and end markets are robust, and we're bringing Medtronic's full capabilities to bear as we launch innovative technologies and execute ahead of plan in some of the most attractive and fast-growing end markets in medtech. We're glad to be able to raise our revenue growth and EPS guidance for the full year on the back of this building progress. This quarter, we accelerated our growth with significant contributions from our Cardiac Ablations business, as promised. Looking ahead, there's even more that Medtronic is capable of.\nWe're positioning ourselves for even greater acceleration in revenue growth in the back half of the year and beyond. Our momentum is fueled by our enterprise growth drivers, including our PFA franchise for AFib, Simplicity for Hypertension, Hugo and Soft Tissue Robotics, and Altaviva for incontinence. Look, these are game changers, and they'll power our trajectory. At this pivotal inflection point in our growth journey, we recognize the need to capitalize on the incredible market opportunities before us. We've scaled manufacturing to support our acceleration. This quarter, we took the opportunity to increase OPEX investments to support our revenue growth momentum. We did all this while still delivering outsized EPS growth relative to our guidance. Overall, we've shifted to a growth mindset. Besides our organic programs, we're focused on pursuing tuck-in M&A and executing strategic portfolio management.\nNow let's get into the details on our enterprise growth drivers. One of them powered our growth acceleration this quarter, and together, all of them will fuel our total company revenue growth in the quarters ahead. In Cardiac Ablation, our PFA franchise is generating just a ton of momentum. We grew 71%, which is a strong acceleration from last quarter's nearly 50% cash growth. This is the highest growth rate of any company in this large and fast-growing space. We're winning share as our PFA franchise grew over 300% in the US, as well as in international markets. This was based on the strength of our Affera Mapping System and our Sphere-9 Dual Energy and High-density Mapping Catheter. Look, physicians tell us that they appreciate not only the shorter procedure times that they're seeing with Affera, but increasingly, they're calling out its outstanding durability as well.\nDemand continues to be extremely high as we hear repeatedly from customers that they want to purchase additional Affera Systems to expand into even more of their labs. In the vast majority of instances, when a new Affera system goes into a lab, we take the majority of the AF procedure share in that lab. You know, our plants have scaled, as I mentioned earlier, to meet the challenge, and our mapping hiring is going really well. As a result, we've doubled our installed base of Affera Mapping Systems during the quarter. Given the economics of this business with capital and consumables, our Mapping System Sales are a strong leading indicator of future revenue growth and margin expansion.\nWe're still in the early parts of this rollout, and we expect revenue acceleration to continue with an even higher cash growth in Q3. We remain on track to double the revenue of this business soon, adding an incremental $1 billion off the $1 billion FY 2025 base. Look, we're not stopping there. With our pipeline, we're bringing Affera technology to the single-shot segment with Sphere-360. EPs tell us that 360 is the most anticipated PFA catheter out there, given the strength of its early clinical data. We've submitted the IDE to the FDA to get approval for our US pivotal trial, which we're expecting to start in Q3. The EP Ablation Space is now over $12 billion.\nIt's growing mid-20s, and with our low double-digit share and the high demand I just talked about for our current portfolio and our pipeline, we see a long runway to gain significant share and add meaningful growth to Medtronic. On top of that growth, we're launching as the clear market leader into very large end markets: our Simplicity procedure for Hypertension, and Altaviva for incontinence. We're excited to have received the final Medicare NCD for Simplicity three weeks ago. Now, in addition to a broad label from the FDA, we have an excellent coverage outcome from CMS. The final NCD enables broad access and removes certain patient pathway barriers that were in the original proposal, including reducing In-person visits, removing a kidney function exclusion, and cutting in half the time requirement for adherence to meds. It also highlights patient quality of life as an important consideration.\nThe NCD gives physicians many avenues to bring Simplicity to patients. Additionally, we are currently the only company to meet the full NCD criteria with an approved continued Evidence Development Plan. On the Commercial Payer front, we picked up significant momentum with wins during the quarter, including HCSC, Regents, and several Blue Cross Blue Shield plans that collectively cover 30 million lives. Shifting to efficacy, Medtronic is the runaway leader with Ardian clinical data, and we continue to add to it. Only Symplicity RF Ardian has consistently shown sustained and improving blood pressure reductions in the long term. This is definitively unique to us, as we've not seen this with the ultrasound devices. This sets the standard that all other devices must now meet.\nLast month at TCT, we shared three-year data from our OnMed trial that continue to show the procedure is effective over the long term. Patients who underwent the Simplicity procedure experienced an 18.5-point average drop in Systolic blood pressure. We also completed enrollment in our SPYRAL Affirm trial, which aims to expand Simplicity into high-risk subgroups, including people with Isolated Systolic Hypertension. The 1st data from a subset of this trial was also shown at TCT with very strong results. We're using these results in ongoing discussions with the FDA. Simplicity represents a massive multi-billion dollar opportunity for Medtronic, with an addressable market of 18 million people in the US with uncontrolled Hypertension. Now, with a broad NCD in place and Commercial Payers coming online faster than anticipated, this isn't a question of if or even how big; it's a question of how fast.\nWe have not incorporated much Simplicity revenue into our back half guidance, but we are sprinting after this opportunity. We have supply, we've ramped up physician training and market development activities, with many hospitals initiating Simplicity programs across the country. Now we're increasing our consumer awareness programs. As a result, we expect our revenue to pick up in the back half of the fiscal year and ramp over the next few quarters, and meaningfully contribute to Medtronic for years to come. Now, shifting to Altaviva, we're seeing very positive signs in the 1st several weeks of the US launch. Physician training programs are oversubscribed, and we're expanding training capacity to meet this demand. Physicians are stacking cases, and early media coverage has driven a surge in consumer search activity.\nAltaviva is a simple option to treat Urinary Urges and Involuntary Leaks, which affect 16 million people in the US. This small device is inserted just below the skin but above the Fascia near the ankle. The procedure is minimally invasive, doesn't require sedation, and the patient goes home with the therapy activated. They're not waiting for follow-up appointments to feel the results. The device is only recharged once or twice a year, eliminating the need for daily at-home charging equipment, and it has a 15-year battery. We believe Altaviva will add meaningful growth to our Pelvic Health business and be a Medtronic growth driver, again, for years to come. More importantly, it is meaningful for patients. This is our 1st patient in South Carolina who is dancing to Jingle Bell Rock.\nIt's getting to be that time of the year, and it's a wonderful video. In addition to these enterprise growth drivers, we're seeing improvements in many of our other businesses as we execute on new product introductions, getting products to market ahead of schedule, and ensuring strong commercial follow-through. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Thierry to cover the details of our business performance, financials, and our guidance.\n\nThierry Piéton\n\nCFO, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Geoff. Hi, everyone. I appreciate everyone joining us today. I'll start with our Cardiovascular Portfolio, where we grew 9%. This was our strongest growth in over a decade, excluding the easy comparisons we had after the pandemic. The growth acceleration was driven by our building momentum in cash, which Geoff walked you through. It's worth noting that PFA is now 75% of our Cardiac Ablation revenue. Our PFA growth significantly offset the 40% declines we had in cryo, and 90% of our remaining cryo revenue is in markets outside of the US. Look, it wasn't just cash. The rest of our Cardiovascular Portfolio grew a combined mid-single digits. Cardiac Rhythm Management grew 5%, with 18% growth in Micra Leadless Pacemakers, and nearly 80% growth in Aurora EV-ICDs. In structural heart, we grew 7% on the strength of the Evolut TAVR platform.\nIn Peripheral Vascular, we grew low single digits, and we expect growth to improve as we continue to launch neuroguard iep Carotid Stent and begin the launch of our Librand mechanical thrombectomy system. Next, in our neuroscience portfolio, our growth returned to mid-single digits, as expected, with growth of 4%. In Cranial & Spinal Technologies, we grew 5%. That included 8% growth in core spine, both globally and in the US, and 5% in Neurosurgery Capital Equipment. Our Spine-AiBLE ecosystem, which includes AI-enabled Preoperative Planning Software and enabling Capital Equipment, including Robotics, Navigation, Imaging, and Powered Surgical Instruments, continues to attract strong spine surgeon adoption and drive meaningful share gains. This is enabling strong pull-through of our core spine hardware. Our specialty therapies businesses had flat results in Q2 and expected improvement from last quarter, driven by ENT and Neurovascular.\nWe have a clear line of sight to continued improvement in specialty therapies next quarter as we accelerate growth in both Neurovascular and pelvic health. In Neurovascular, growth will improve as we anniversary the vast majority of China VBP in January. We also expect an increase in growth contribution neuroguard iep Carotid Stent launch, which is being sold by both our Peripheral Vascular and Neurovascular businesses. In pelvic health, we expect growth to accelerate on the Altaviva launch that Geoff Martha outlined. In neuromodulation, we grew 7%. Both pain stim and Brain Modulation grew high single digits as we continue the rollout of our Inceptiv SCS and BrainSense ADBS systems. The market continues to appreciate our differentiated fully closed-loop technology with responsive, real-time therapy adjustments that's available in both of these products. Next, our med search portfolio grew 1% as expected.\nOur surgical business also grew 1%, impacted, as we anticipated, by the timing of certain tenders in emerging markets and the ongoing, but stable, market pressures from Bariatric surgery and the shift to robotics. We expect a slight rebound in surgical in the back half, and, over time, we expect growth to continue to improve as we enter new markets with Hugo. In the back half of this fiscal year, we expect the FDA to approve Hugo with a Urology indication, and we'll start our entrance in the US. We also continue to make progress on expanding indications. During the quarter, we presented our Enable hernia repair study, which met its safety and effectiveness endpoints. We kicked off our Embrace Gynecology US pivotal study last month. This builds on the momentum from the positive results of our international GAINS study, which we shared at SRS in July.\nGiven our experience in international markets, we've developed a clear understanding of the differentiated features that will make our Robotics Program successful. This includes Hugo's Modularity and Open Console. It also includes continuously adding advanced technologies such as our ICG imaging and instrumentation like LigaSure RAS. Our Touch Surgery Digital Ecosystem is a force multiplier for robotics and for Laparoscopic surgery. Adoption is building momentum, and bringing AI into operating rooms in over 30 countries. Beyond the features, we're also leveraging our deep partnerships with customers through our training, support, and through our service. We look forward to robotics becoming a more meaningful growth driver over time. Next, our endoscopy business grew 8%. This was driven by double-digit growth in our Esophageal products, as well as in GI Genius, our AI-powered solution used to detect Polyps during Colonoscopies.\nWrapping up our business performance, our Diabetes business, or MiniMed, as it will be called Post-separation, grew high single digits. We had particular strength in international markets, which grew 11%. As expected, the US was lower this quarter, in large part due to a decline in new orders as customers anticipated the launch of our new sensors. As we started accepting orders, we're seeing this pent-up demand materialize. There's a lot of excitement behind both the Simplera Sync and Instinct sensors. Look, with the Simplera Sync, we continue to ramp manufacturing volume to support its European launch. As that ramp continues, we plan to roll it out more broadly to US consumers later this fiscal year. Ahead of that, we started accepting orders during the quarter.\nWith the Instinct sensor, we started taking pre-orders in the US during the last month of the quarter, and we expect to begin shipping in late November. We accumulated more than 35,000 US customer orders for Simplera Sync and Pre-orders for Instinct. Around 25% of these orders are from new pump users or our Medtronic pump users who are not using our CGM. The rest of these orders are current customers in our install base upgrading to the new sensors. We also saw over 9,000 HCPs in the US who are new Medtronic prescribers. Look, for those of you who follow this space, you know how big a deal these numbers are, and the impact they're expected to have on increasing our install base. We expect the demand for our new sensors to accelerate our US growth in the back half of the fiscal year.\nOur Diabetes business is in a strong innovation cycle. We've had a lot of great news in the last few months as our teams execute on the pipeline. In July, the 780G system received CE mark for three expanded indications, including for Type 2, for children as young as age two, and during pregnancy. In September, the US FDA also approved 780G for people with Type 2 Diabetes, and they cleared our SmartGuard algorithm that enabled integration with the Instinct sensor. Earlier this month, we received FDA approval to start the US pivotal for Vivera, our 3rd-generation algorithm. We also continue to make progress with our new AID systems, MiniMed Flex and MiniMed Fit. We remain on track to submit Flex, our next-generation durable pump, to the US FDA.\nWith Fit, our AID patch system, we intend to submit to the US FDA by the fall of next year. Finally, our planned separation of MiniMed is on track. Our preferred path continues to be a two-step IPO and split. We continue to expect the separation to be complete by the end of calendar year 2026. We have a lot of momentum with Diabetes given the order inflection, progress on the pipeline, and separation. You're hearing today that this momentum acceleration extends across the enterprise as we advance our pipeline and deliver growth. Now, turning to the financials, Q2 revenue of $9 billion grew 6.6% reported and 5.5% organic. That's an acceleration from last quarter and 75 basis points ahead of the midpoint of our guidance.\nOur revenue from a Geographic perspective was balanced, with double-digit growth in Japan and mid-single-digit growth in the US, Western Europe, and China. In China, we're driving growth even as we go through ongoing, but very manageable, volume-based procurement in a few businesses. Our adjusted Gross Margin was 65.9%, up 70 basis points year-over-year. Similar to last quarter, I'll walk you through the main components. We got 30 basis points again from pricing, as well as 40 basis points from our COGS efficiency programs net of inflation. Importantly, margin headwinds from ramping up our manufacturing capacity on Affera are now behind us. Together, we drove a 70 basis point operational improvement in Gross Margin in the quarter. This was offset by business mix, which represented a headwind of 80 basis points, split roughly equally between Cardiac Ablation and Diabetes.\nAs I noted last quarter, cash is impacted by the mix of lower margin capital to higher margin catheters, and Diabetes is early in its manufacturing ramp-up of Simplera. Over time, we expect both of these to improve as we scale our cash business and separate the Diabetes business. Next, tariffs were a 20 basis points headwind, and finally, FX was about 100 basis points tailwind. Adjusted R&D was 8.4% of revenue and increased 8.9%, which is 230 basis points ahead of reported revenue growth. We've increased R&D investments in our core Right-to-win franchises, where we've identified opportunities to accelerate top-line growth and improve our share in the near, mid, and long term. SG&A was 32.7% of revenue, up 20 basis points versus last year.\nAs Geoff mentioned, we proactively took the opportunity to increase spending to accelerate our PFA and RDN launches in light of the considerable market demand and compelling near and medium-term outlooks. At the same time, we delivered discipline leverage on G&A with growth at under half the rate of our revenue growth. Our adjusted profit was $2.2 billion, an increase of 6%. This resulted in an adjusted Operating Margin of 24.1%, down 20 basis points year-over-year, but an increase of 50 basis points sequentially. Our adjusted tax rate was 16.4%. Q2 tax expense was lower than expected, which is largely due to timing and which we expect to offset in the Q4. All in all, adjusted EPS was $1.36, an increase of 8% and $0.05 above the midpoint of our guidance. Now, let's cover our guidance.\nGiven our outperformance in the 1st half of the year, as well as the confidence we have in our revenue growth acceleration, we're raising our four-year revenue guidance today. Year to date, we've delivered 5.2% organic growth, and we expect this to further accelerate in the back half of the year. As a result, we now expect fiscal 2026 revenue growth of approximately 5.5%, a 50 basis point increase from the prior guidance. In the Q3, we're also expecting approximately 5.5% growth, and Q4 will be even stronger. Based on recent rates, we now see an effect tailwind to fiscal 2026 revenue of $625 to 725 million, including a $150 to 200 million tailwind in the Q3.\nMoving down the P&L, we expect our fiscal 2026 Gross Margin to be slightly up Ex tariffs, with pricing, FX, and COGS efficiency programs more than offsetting the negative impacts of business mix, primarily from Cardiac Ablation and Diabetes. We anticipate a tariff impact to COGS of approximately $185 million, including $90 to 95 million in the Q3. Including tariffs, we expect a fiscal 2026 Gross Margin decrease of roughly 40 basis points. We'll continue to fund R&D to grow greater than sales. With SG&A, in light of the outsized demand and building momentum for our enterprise growth drivers, we're capitalizing on every opportunity to accelerate our top line by strategically increasing sales and marketing investment in key programs. We'll still deliver SG&A leverage on the full year by rigorously managing our G&A line.\nTaking all of this together, we expect fiscal 2026 adjusted operating profit to grow approximately 5% or 7 excluding tariffs. Our fiscal 2026 Operating Margin is expected to be roughly flat ex tariffs, and down about 50 basis points, including the tariffs impact. Now, coming to EPS, second quarter EPS came in $0.05 above the midpoint of our guidance. $0.35 of this beat was from Reduced Tax Expense, as I mentioned earlier, that we now expect to occur in Q4. We're flowing through the remainder of the Q2 beat and increasing our fiscal 2026 EPS guidance to a new range of $5.62 to 5.66 versus the prior range of $5.60 to 5.66. For Q3, we expect EPS in the range of $1.32 to 1.34. We're expecting margins to be down a couple hundred basis points in Q3 as the quarter includes half the annual impact of tariffs.\nIn addition, the expected growth acceleration in cash and Diabetes will continue to impact business mix, and Q3 is typically our lowest quarter for generating COGS efficiency savings given the holidays. However, we do expect Q4 margins to increase year-over-year, and show strong sequential improvement. Looking ahead to next year, we continue to expect high single-digit EPS growth in fiscal year 2027, driven by accelerating revenue growth, a lesser impact of business mix from cash and Diabetes on the Gross Margin line, and leverage on SG&A, while we continue to drive higher investments in R&D and sales and marketing. Look, we remain committed to driving both revenue and earnings growth, and believe strongly that our Financial Algorithm will flow from our current focus on building sustained top-line momentum. Geoff, back to you.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nOkay, thank you, Thierry. Before we go to Q&A, let me share a few quick thoughts.\nWhen you look at our top line, you can really see the focus we've had on allocating capital and executing on our pipeline is all now coming together to drive meaningful acceleration in our growth. We're on an incredible trajectory with PFA, and we're just getting started with some big new opportunities with Simplicity and Altaviva. At the same time, our newly formed Board Committees are helping as we act decisively and with increased speed. We're executing on margin enhancement programs to fuel our enterprise growth drivers, the future pipeline, and earnings leverage. We continue to evaluate the overall portfolio at every level, as well as tuck and M&A, and we are committed to growing above our WAMGR while also raising the WAMGR of the company over time. I'm looking forward to diving deeper into all of this with you at our Investor Day next year.\nBottom line, we're executing on our commitments. You can see it in our numbers, and with every quarter, we're picking up more momentum. We're pleased with the progress, but eager to continue proving Medtronic has turned the page and entered a new period of greater revenue and earnings growth. Finally, I want to thank our employees who are watching today around the world. Thank you. Thank you for your steadfast commitment to the Medtronic mission and to the patients that you and our customers serve every day. I also appreciate your continued execution, which allows us to collectively deliver on our total company performance. So thank you. Okay, now it's time to move on to Q&A, where we're going to try to get to as many analysts as possible. We ask that you limit yourself to just one question and, only if needed, a related follow-up.\nIf you have additional questions, you can reach out to Ryan and the investor relations team after the call. Ryan, can you please give the Q&A instructions and queue up the analysts?\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nSure, Geoff. For the Sell-side analysts that would like to ask a question, please select the participants button and click Raise Hand. If you're using the mobile app, press the More button and select Raise Hand. Your lines are currently on mute, and when called upon, you will receive a request to unmute your line, which you must respond to before asking your question. Finally, please be advised that this Q&A session is being recorded. We'll pause for a few seconds now to assemble the queue. Okay, let's take the first question from Patrick Wood at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Patrick. Patrick, can you hear us?\n\nPatrick Wood\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThere we go. Nailed it.\nThank you so much for taking the question. Thanks, guys. I'll keep it to one, of course. I'd love to start with Simplicity. You mentioned the commercial discussions happening faster than kind of expected. Obviously, without diving into any individual payer, how are those reflective relative to the NCD? Are there restrictions being put on? What is the sort of tone of the conversation, and how are the Commercial Payers looking to introduce this within their patient pool? Thanks.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah, thanks for the question, Patrick. Yeah, the Commercial Payers, like you mentioned in the commentary, they are coming online faster than I believe we anticipated. They're getting a lot of push from patients as well. In terms of restrictions, I would say, first of all, I'd say, look, the NCD, the Medicare NCD, is broad, and it's better than we anticipated.\nIt's better than the proposal, so we're comparing it to that. The one area that I've heard, in addition on the NCD, they've incorporated, for lack of a better word, physician discretion, patient discretion on as a patient, can I tolerate these meds, or does the physician feel like the patient cannot tolerate the meds? That gives them that avenue to move to RDN, to Simplicity. In the Commercial Payers, we're seeing where there is one difference that I know of is around the medications. More of an emphasis on being on a few medications for a while. That's the one area that I'm aware of, Patrick, and we'll keep everyone posted as we get more Commercial Payers online.\nThanks, Abricella.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nYeah, thanks, Patrick. We'll take the next question from Travis Steed at BofA Global Securities. Go ahead, Travis.\n\nTravis Steed\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research and Medical Technology, BofA Global Securities\n\nCongrats on a good quarter.\nI guess, first of all, the implied 2nd-half guide around 6%. Kind of think about it in two buckets: the pipeline and then kind of the base business. Maybe talk about kind of what you're assuming on RDN in the 2nd half, and then also the base business, why confident in the slight rebound in med surge, and kind of the confidence to keep the base business humming. On the margins in the 2nd half, this quarter, we didn't see quite as much margin flow through. Just assuming that changes in the second half, the revenue upside leads to more margin upside in the 2nd half.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nDo you want to take that one?\n\nThierry Piéton\n\nCFO, Medtronic\n\nSorry, maybe I start with the margin. Hi, Travis. Thanks for the question. Look, we described the momentum that we had from a commercial perspective in the 2nd quarter.\nPretty early on in the quarter, we saw the order intake being pretty strong. We also saw that we were going to have a little bit of upside from a tax perspective, even though that's timely, but we did see it coming early on in the quarter. We just made a decision to go invest in the places that are going to drive the growth going forward. We made some significant investments in the MAPRS structure, for example, in Cardiac Ablation. We started to build up the capability from a Direct Marketing on the Simplicity side. We took the opportunity that we were going to see upside on revenue and a little bit on the tax line just to lean into the investment to make sure we fully capture the opportunities that are ahead of us. You saw that in R&D.\nIt's the 2nd quarter where we have R&D growth that's pretty significantly higher than the revenue growth. This quarter, specifically, you saw it on the SG&A line, where we put, as I said, quite a bit of investment, especially in sales and marketing, while keeping the G&A line pretty constrained. Going forward into the rest of the year, we'll keep investing in these growth areas. You'll see R&D continue to ramp up. As you know, we're targeting to get over time to roughly about 10% of our revenue on the R&D line. On SG&A, though, you should expect to see leverage in the second half. SG&A together, we'll start seeing a lift there. Ex tariffs, we'll have Gross Margin and Operating Margin leverage in the 2nd half, but we'll have to contend with the tariff impact.\nAll in all, on a four-year basis, you'll see Gross Margin slightly up before tariffs, down about 50 basis points post tariffs. At the Operating Margin level, you'll see Operating Margin roughly flat year-over-year, ex tariffs, and slightly down with the impact of tariffs. Look, it's all about capitalizing on the opportunities that we've got ahead of us, and that's what we'll keep doing. Again, 2nd half leverage on both those lines.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nOn the revenue, as you see from the guidance, we're looking at a back half ramp here that will extend into 2027. The way I'd break it down, I mean, a big piece of that is these growth drivers that are kicking in, these multi-billion dollar opportunities. In terms of the back half, though, most of that is really coming from PFA.\nIn terms of the new big ones, right, when you think about PFA, simplicity, Altaviva, and we have Hugo coming, those are, we would say, our big multi-billion dollar upmarket opportunities. In the back half, the contribution will be more from PMA in that category. PFA is, I mean, it's cranking right now. We've got a lot of momentum there. When it comes to Simplicity, and obviously, Simplicity and Altaviva are approved in the US. On Simplicity, I'd say we're going to see it start to tick up in the back half of the year and then ramp in the quarters following that. Like I said, between the NCD and the Commercial Payers coming online, this market is really a best-case scenario. It's as big as what we said it is. It's not about if or even how big. It's as big as we said, it's really how fast.\nWe're measuring that speed of adoption in quarters, not years. Altaviva, again, just approved. A lot of great leading indicators. Physician trainings overbooked. We can talk more about that if I get questions on why we're so excited. It'll start to contribute in the back half a little bit. Hugo, we don't have too much on, but we do still expect the approval in the back half of our year. There's another, getting to the base business. Diabetes pops back up as our new sensors are available. Neuromodulation continues to be strong. CST will continue to be strong. CRM had two really good, a really good Q2. I don't know if we're going to have that same level of growth there, but still a strong growth there.\nYou've got two other businesses that'll, I'll call it, tick up, incrementally increase their growth rate. Peripheral vascular with the Carotid Stent, Mechanical Thrombectomy coming. Neurovascular, again, it's also selling that Carotid Stent. Got some Hemorrhagic products coming. They're just lapping some issues, a recall, and then lapping VBP here. The base business is a big contributor. PFA is a big contributor. You're going to start to see simplicity, Altaviva, and a little bit of Hugo.\n\nTravis Steed\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research and Medical Technology, BofA Global Securities\n\nGreat. Thanks a lot.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThank you, Travis. Next, we'll go to the line of Vijay Kumar at Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, Vijay.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director of Equity Research, Evercore ISI\n\nGuys. Congrats on a nice sprint here. Geoff, thanks for taking my question. I had maybe a new product question, a two-parter, if you will. One on Affera, Geoff, do you feel like we have enough MAPRS now?\nIs supply in a place enough where you can hit the $2 billion? How are you thinking about Supply and Mapping? On TBL, we've got some good feedback on cannibalization of whether TBL could cannibalize Botox procedures. Could TBL be a billion-dollar product for you guys down the road? Thank you.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nI'll start with the PFA questions. On the supply, that's not holding us back. Supply is in a good spot. On the MAPRS, the MAPR hiring is going well, right? We're staying ahead, but I wish the buffer a little bit more because the growth is tremendous. We are staying ahead on the MAPRS, and the supply is not an issue. Like I said, our PFA business is really humming. I was just with a big customer yesterday. They've got two systems.\nThey laid out three more that they're going to buy. Just talking about once they put, especially Affera, once they put that in one of their hospitals, how it kind of takes all the market share or the majority of the market share there for all types of cases. There are just all these benefits there. Feeling really good about that. Again, this MAPR hiring has been a Medtronic, not just our Cardiac Ablation business, but a Medtronic effort. Our HR team's doing a hell of a job there. On Tibial, look, Tibial is something I think everyone needs to invest a little bit of time in here. It's a huge market, 46 million people in the US with Overactive Bladder, and of that, 16 million with Urinary Urge incontinence, where this really shines. It takes the therapy versus sacral, which works really well.\nIt's been a great market for us. There's been some channel disruption in the market lately, but it's still a great market and works really well for patients. It does take weeks or months to get that therapy to a patient from when they start versus Tibial's less than a day. What you're seeing here is with Tibial, right, you have to do, with sacral nerve, you have to do a trial, then you have to go in for the implant, then the patient leaves without the therapy turned on, has to come back to get it activated. Versus Tibial, this all happens in a day, and the procedure is easier. When patients, to get to your quarter question, when they're presented with options, all of their options, sacral nerve, Tibial, Botox, they tend to choose the Tibial.\nWe do think it will take share from Botox. I would emphasize that this, we believe, look, there's a very strong place for sacral nerve. This is an incremental opportunity on top of our sacral business. That sacral combined with Tibial, given that it's going to be incremental, is going to make that business, that Pelvic Health business, a growth driver for the company. That's what I'll say about that. It's going to meaningfully improve the growth rate of that business.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThank you, Vijay. Next, let's go to the line of Robbie Marcus at J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead, Robbie.\n\nRobbie Marcus\n\nMedtech Senior Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nGreat. Good morning and nice quarter. Thanks for taking the questions. Thierry, I wanted to ask, you talked about strategically reinvesting into SG&A and over time materially increasing R&D, I think up to 200 basis points.\nHow are you thinking about where those dollars are going? How soon should we be thinking about that? Just help us think about the cadence and the ability to still grow Operating Margin in the face of higher investment.\n\nThierry Piéton\n\nCFO, Medtronic\n\nYeah. Hi, Robbie. Thanks for the question. First, where the dollars are going. There are really two different categories, I would say. One is to, as I said, capitalize to the maximum extent possible on the growth drivers that are ahead of us. There is a significant amount of investment that's going to CAST, to Ardian, to Altaviva, and obviously to Hugo, with a profile that's a little bit more long-term. There are other growth drivers that we're funding at the same time, such as Structural Heart and Neuromodulation, for example.\nThe 2nd category of where we're putting investment is to make sure that we keep the leading edge from a technology perspective in the key franchises that are our bread and butter. There's overinvestment compared to the average of the business in CRM, for example, in next generation of Micra. There's significant investment going in CST to continue to develop the ecosystem that that business has created around AiBLE that has enabled us to make the CST business more sticky with the customers from a device perspective and gradually improve the margin. It's really those two areas: capitalize on the growth drivers on one hand, and keep the edge on innovation in the key franchises on the other side. From a sequence perspective, I would say third quarter, we made a pretty deliberate strong investment because we saw the upside coming.\nYou'll see a bit less of that already in the 2nd half. As I said, you should see leverage on the SG&A line in the 2nd half of the year already. Maybe going into the longer term, look, we've tried to give as much clarity as possible on the Gross Margin Line so that you see the dynamics. If you look at what happened this quarter, we had about 40 basis points of pricing and about 30 basis points or 40 basis points of cost out. That's been sort of a recurring performance over the last quarters. We expect that to continue over time, right? We're generating between those two lines 70 to 80 basis points of Gross Margin improvement, right? This quarter, you had about 80 basis points of negative mix and 20 basis points of tariffs, and that was offset with FX.\nGoing forward, we expect that negative mix to start getting better towards the 2nd half of 2027. For the rest of the year, it's still going to be a pretty significant headwind as CAST and Diabetes continue to accelerate. In the 2nd half of 2027, Diabetes will be deconsolidated. On the CAST side, we'll start seeing the shift between the capillary equipment and the catheters, which will make that an accretive business as opposed to being dilutive. What you're going to see there is the 70 to 80 basis points of Gross Margin improvement operationally start to show up more as the mix becomes gradually smaller and a positive effect over time. Outside of that, we've got some external factors, so we have to contend with the tariffs.\nFor the 2nd half, we've got about 90% of that $185 million of tariffs that's going to show up in the income statement. The bigger portion is in Q3. We'll have a carryover of tariffs going into 2027. We expect Foreign Exchange, which is the last item there, to be a slight tailwind going into 2027. It's a long answer, apologies, but I think it's important that you understand the algorithm. Going into 2027, we'll keep investing in R&D to get to the 10% over time. You should expect to see leverage on the SG&A line in 2027. Look, we're confident that with the growth, with what we're doing from a Gross Margin performance in a sustainable fashion, and COGS and pricing, and the leverage on the overhead, we'll have a leverage P&L on the operating profit line in 2027.\nThat's why we hold on our commitment to have high single-digit EPS growth going into next year.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah. Just to add to that, there's more oxygen here to create for the investment. It's been good to see the improved pricing. As we go forward, we're not assuming much incremental pricing, but at least holding the improved position that we have. There's more oxygen in our cost down, as there's opportunities in scrap, obsolescence, and over time, continue to optimize our network. These are areas, I think there's incremental opportunity and cost down. Robbie, I've read some of your stuff in the past that you don't think there's much to do for us on SG&A, but there's more. There's more to go on SG&A for the company, and that's where the scale of the company should benefit us here.\nIt's not going to be easy on the company, but there's opportunities there. We're committed to doing what it takes to fund these growth drivers because what we're seeing out there with patients on these different growth drivers and what we're hearing from clinicians, the impact on them and their staff, this is a big opportunity for the company we haven't seen in decades, and we're going to make it happen, right? There's still room to go on SG&A as well. Like I said, COGS to make this happen.\n\nRobbie Marcus\n\nMedtech Senior Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nGreat. That was a fantastic answer. Maybe just one quick follow-up, Geoff and Terry, I know even since the beginning of this year, you've talked more and more about Tuck and M&A. How are you thinking about the environment today?\nDo you see a lot of opportunities and any areas you see more interesting than others to help flesh out the portfolio? Thanks a lot.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nWell, yeah. No, look, we're very focused on the tuck and M&A. I don't want to tip our hat in terms of exact segments, but we definitely are prioritizing some of the, again, it's tuck and we're prioritizing these higher growth segments. A lot of that is in Cardiology, some in neuroscience as well. We like that affair profile, right, where you're close to market or just you're on the market, early stage or close to market would be ideal, not afraid to make the investment that it takes to get those type of companies.\nAs Thierry said on your earlier question on where's the R&D going, the tuck and M&A, I wouldn't rule out some of our other key franchises that may need to augment their R&D with a little M&A, but we are more focused on these higher growth segments. The Board Committees we've set up help with the speed, enable us to move faster. We'll see where it goes, but it's definitely a big focus.\n\nThierry Piéton\n\nCFO, Medtronic\n\nOne thing that we don't communicate a lot about, we've got a pretty active ventures, and that arm's been pretty active. It's got over 50 companies in which we have a stake right now, and we like to use that arm to make investments in sort of early stage companies. It helps with some of the dilution, etc.\nTypically, we always make these venture investments with a view of going higher into the capital over time. It's never venture for venture. Again, the pipeline there is pretty strong. We'll keep working that angle too because it's helpful to feed the pipeline for future M&A.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYep.\n\nRobbie Marcus\n\nMedtech Senior Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nThanks a lot. Appreciate it.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nYeah. Thank you, Robbie. Looking at the clock here, I think we've got time for about three more questions. Next, we'll go to the line of Larry Biegelsen at Wells Fargo Securities. Larry, please go ahead.\n\nLarry Biegelsen\n\nSenior Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on a nice print here. Geoff, I wanted to ask about the ramp of Ardian because, as you said, it's a question of how fast. I'm hoping you can add some precision to your earlier comments.\nI think at our conference in September, I asked if US Ardian sales could replicate the US Watchman ramp, which was about $400 million in year five. I believe you said you'd be disappointed if your US Ardian sales didn't achieve $400 million by, I believe, year three. How does the exclusion of Isolated Systolic Hypertension in the NCD impact how you think about the ramp? Do you still believe you can achieve $400 million US sales by around fiscal 2028, which I think would be year three? Just confirm, Geoff, that the current run rate in the US is about $50 million. Thank you.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nWell, look, let me start by saying yes, I would be disappointed if we're at year five, whatever you said, at $400 million. We think it would go faster than that. The final NCD won't hold us back.\nLike I said, we believe it's an improvement on the proposed NCD. Maybe this is a good time because I know there was on that NCD, like I said, it's an improvement to the proposed NCD. If you go back a year, it's better than what we thought a year ago. If you go back five years and you asked us if we thought we would get this type of NCD, we'd say that's the best-case scenario. This market, like I said, is as big as we said it's going to be. We believe that this final NCD, as you dig into and really understand how Hypertension today is treated, actually reduces the requirements for patients to get this therapy, and it reduces the time.\nMaybe this is a good time that we have our Chief Scientific and Medical Officer on the line, knowing that there'd be Dr. Laura Mauri, who's also an Interventional Cardiologist, knowing that there'd be maybe some questions on this, on the treatment pathways. Maybe we'll ask Laura to comment since you mentioned that one Systolic question or diastolic question. Laura, can you maybe provide some context here?\n\nLaura Mauri\n\nChief Scientific and Medical Officer, Medtronic\n\nSure. Larry, specific to your question about Isolated Systolic Hypertension, those are patients who don't have an elevation of their diastolic or the lower number of their blood pressure. It's only the top one. Just to continue to study those patients. I think the important thing to note is that this population is actually pretty small for us overall.\nIf you look at recent studies, people with Hypertension over age 60, it's less than 15% of patients who have ISH or this condition. For patients who are younger than 60, who are half of our patients in trials and also in practice, it's really very unusual. As Geoff said out the gate with the NCD, if you just look at that topic, we would estimate that it would be less than 10% that would be affected by isolated systolic Hypertension or not meet those criteria. Overall, just to reiterate what Geoff said, the final NCD makes access more practical for patients with less time delays to treatment, less restrictions. The couple of things that they've talked about screening for are really things that are done in standard practice by general practitioners or internists.\nI think the other part just to mention is that in their response, CMS really reiterated that quality of life is a really important consideration for patients because lifestyle changes and being on many medications can be really difficult. They specifically said the good faith attempts are reasonable before referral rather than specifying some mandatory minimum doses or number of medications. Overall, whether it's ISH or overall the workflow for patients to get into referral for Simplicity is really not restricted.\n\nLarry Biegelsen\n\nSenior Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nAll right. Thank you, Laura.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nYep. Thanks, Larry. Next, we'll go to the line of Shagun Singh at RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead, Shagun.\n\nShagun Singh\n\nMedical Technology Analyst, RBC Capital Markets",
    "content2": "Great. Thank you so much. I wanted to touch on the financial algorithm there. A key message was growth acceleration. How should we think about the base business? Is it mid-single digits?\nThe $1 billion incremental PFA sales is about 300 basis points. RDN, I don't know if you could put a final point there in terms of the growth contribution. As you think about growth acceleration, should we think about Medtronic moving towards that high single digit on the top line? On portfolio management, I was just wondering how you're thinking about or should we expect portfolio pruning beyond Diabetes? Thank you for taking the questions.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nWell, maybe Shagun, thanks for the question. I'll start with the last part of it on the Portfolio Management. Look, this is an ongoing focus for the company. It's really making sure that beyond Diabetes, right? First of all, that deal is tracking and it's on track and going well. Beyond Diabetes, we just want to make sure that the whole portfolio fits together.\nWe're getting the right amount of synergies, and we can provide the right amount of focus on these Generational Enterprise growth drivers like PFA, like RDN, like Altaviva, and Hugo when it comes to the US and others. It remains a focus, and it remains a focus of one of the Board Committees that we set up. We're meeting frequently on this and looking at it. That's what I'll say there. I'll have Terry answer.\n\nThierry Piéton\n\nCFO, Medtronic\n\nOverall, If you think about the guidance that we just gave, 5.5% on the full year, we were at 5.2% at the end of the 1st half. We're guiding at 5.5% in the Q3. You can do the math for what Q4 looks like, and we don't want to slow down from there.\nLook, what I would say is it's pretty clear that CAST represents a sizable opportunity. We reiterate the incremental $1 billion coming shortly, probably in the beginning of fiscal year 2027 for us. RDN, we have all these discussions about the speed, et cetera., but I think it's important to keep in mind that 1% of market share in that population is sort of almost $3 billion of revenue for us. It's a pretty significant opportunity. We talked about the size of the Altaviva opportunity as well. It's 20 million patients overall. Those come in increment to the rest of the business. The rest of the business is not standing still. Specialty therapies is getting better. You saw a 1st sign in this quarter, and it's going to keep going with the product activity that we've got in Neurovascular with Altaviva and Pelvic.\nThe key franchises, look, CRM had a great quarter. It's going to continue to perform for the rest of the year and beyond. We're investing in that business to keep the technology lead. We don't intend to go backwards. CST has been improving on the back of the AiBLE Spine Surgery ecosystem that the team has created. We're positive about the opportunities of the company going forward, and we'll keep you posted when we give next year's guidance at the end of Q4.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThank you, Shagun. We've got time for one more question. I apologize to the analysts that we weren't able to get to. If you've got additional questions, feel free to reach out to me during the day. We'll go to our last question, Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. Pito, please go ahead.\n\nPito Chickering\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.\nI have sort of two product questions, so I'll ask them up front. The first one is, as AF ablations is moving to the ASC setting, can you talk about how you are positioned in ASC in terms of mappers and fair replacements? On TAVR, can you talk about what you saw in the US, Europe, and Japan, and how market share is looking in those markets? Thanks so much.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nWell, thanks, Pito. Look, for PFA in ASCs, over time, we do see that as an incremental opportunity for market expansion there. There'll be a bit of a shift outside of the tertiary centers to the ASCs over time, but it'll also be a market expansion opportunity for us. It is a focus for us.\nWe have been hiring across the company, quite frankly, particularly in neuroscience and in cardiovascular, folks that are specifically focused on Market Development in the ASCs for us, what our strategy is, how our product portfolio fits there, and the resources we need, including Mappers. This definitely is in the Calculus for Medtronic, not just our Cardiac Ablation business. Like I said, I think this will represent an incremental growth opportunity for us there. On TAVR, what I'll say is we had a decent Q2 here, growing high single digits on a global basis. Internationally, we're executing particularly well and getting more than our Fair Share of that Boston exit. As we move forward in PFA, I think Q3, we may see a deceleration there. In TAVR. In TAVR. In TAVR. What did I say?\n\nPito Chickering\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nPFA.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nPFA. I'm sorry.\n\nPito Chickering\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nNo, no, no.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nPFA, he's going to keep going. I'm sorry. In TAVR, a little bit of a deceleration in Q3, but then it'll pop back up in Q4. We've seen, due to a phasing, we've seen this in prior quarters as well. I don't know if you want to add anything to that.\n\nThierry Piéton\n\nCFO, Medtronic\n\nNo, that's right. We saw the Q4, Q1 effect, and Q2, Q3 looks kind of similar, a little bit slower in Q3, but with a pickup in the Q4. In Q4, yeah.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nJust for clarity, PFA will continue to grow off the 71%. It'll accelerate into Q3 and beyond.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThank you, Pito. Geoff, if you want to go ahead with your closing remarks.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nSure. Well, thank you for joining and all your thoughtful questions this morning. Like Ryan said, apologize to the analysts we didn't get to.\nWe certainly appreciate your support and your interest in Medtronic. Please join us again for our Q3 earnings broadcast for more updates, there'll be more, and our continued progress, and on the long-term strategies. We expect to hold this on Tuesday, 17 February 2025. For those of you in the US, I wish you and your families a very happy Thanksgiving next week. I can't believe Thanksgiving's next week. With that, enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you."

I'm Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President and Head of Medtronic Investor Relations. Joining me here today are Geoff Martha, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Thierry Piéton, Chief Financial Officer. Geoff and Thierry will provide comments on the results of our first quarter, which ended on 25 July 2025, and our outlook for the remainder of fiscal year 2026. After our prepared remarks, we'll take questions from the sell-side analysts that cover the company. Today's program should last about an hour. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release discussing our results and containing several financial schedules. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The presentation can be accessed in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com.\nDuring today's program, many of the statements we make may be considered forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause our actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. Unless we say otherwise, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, and revenue comparisons are made on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency and first quarter revenue in the current and prior year reported as other. References to sequential revenue changes compare to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 and are made on an as-reported basis. All share references are on a revenue and year-over-year basis and compare our first fiscal quarter to our competitor's second calendar quarter.\nReconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. Finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. With that, over to you, Geoff.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nAll right, thanks Ryan, and hello everybody. Welcome to the call, welcome to the new look. As you've seen from our press releases, we have a lot to talk about today. Why don't we just jump in and I'll get going on our Q1 results here. We started the fiscal year by delivering another consistent quarter of mid-single-digit revenue growth. Look, we remain confident in our ability to accelerate growth as we move through fiscal 2026. Our top line growth for the quarter was in line with our guidance, and EPS came in ahead of guidance. Look, the entire organization is working with laser focus to execute on the incredible set of opportunities Medtronic has in front of us. We're pleased to be able to raise our EPS guidance for the full year on the back of this strong start of the year.\nAs you're going to hear today, Medtronic is, we're at the forefront of MedTech innovation across product categories, and we're on the cusp of an acceleration in our financial results and our strategy. Let me take you through some key portfolio highlights before I turn the call over to Thierry, who's going to walk through the results across all of our businesses. I'm going to start with cardiovascular, which grew high single digits again this quarter, and that's off a high single digit comparison in the prior year. This is driven by our innovative product portfolio and a relentless execution in what is a core right-to-win area of the market for us. We achieved double-digit growth in cardiac surgery, in ICDs, and in leadless pacing. Critically, we reached nearly 50% growth in cardiac ablation solutions on the rollout of our PFA systems.\nThis performance is reflective of our execution capabilities, and we're excited that our growth momentum in this pivotal area is only really just beginning. Look, this past quarter, I've witnessed Affera and our competitors in action in several ablation cases. I can tell you firsthand that the advantages that we're bringing to the market in terms of procedure time and ease of use are truly differentiated. Physician feedback and utilization levels of our equipment are phenomenal. And we have more conviction than ever that we have the right technology and the product pipeline to catapult us to category leadership in cardiac ablation. Now in neuroscience, we grew 3%, supported by high single-digit growth in both neurosurgery and neuromodulation. Look, as I mentioned last quarter, our spine AiBLE ecosystem is driving differentiated share gains as health systems; they're not just updating one piece of capital equipment when they upgrade.\nThey're upgrading to the full AiBLE ecosystem, which is a powerful thing for us and creates a real moat, a competitive moat around that business. In neuromodulation, our innovative closed-loop sensing technology in both pain stim and brain modulation, combined with our strong commercial execution, is also winning share. That said, our neuroscience growth was a bit below trend due to our specialty therapies businesses, which was the result of some deliberate changes we'll discuss in a few moments, but we expect to improve starting in Q2 and further accelerate in the back half of the fiscal year. Switching to MedSurg. MedSurg grew 2% this quarter, in line with our current expectations, and diabetes continued to grow above the company average on the strength of our 780G system and Simplera Sync sensor in international markets.\nLooking ahead, we're well positioned to accelerate growth in each of our segments in the second half of the year. In our earnings deck that we posted earlier today, we outlined several milestones that we have coming over the rest of the fiscal year that will drive this acceleration. The largest, of course, being our CAS business with our continued rollout of our PFA portfolio. In Q2, we expect our CAS business to grow even faster than the nearly 50% growth we posted this past quarter, and we continue to have near-term line of sight to adding an incremental $1 billion in revenue off of our fiscal 2025 base. Demand remains extremely high, and we're executing against our plans to quickly ramp mapping system and catheter supply. And CAS is just one of several upcoming growth accelerators for cardiovascular. Let's talk renal denervation.\nWe're expecting the final national coverage from CMS on or before 8 October, and we expect the US launch of our Symplicity Spyral renal denervation system to ramp after that. Our peripheral vascular business will start the launch of our Concerto self-expanding peripheral stent system this quarter, and our next-generation thrombectomy system in the second half of the fiscal year. Now in neuroscience, we're poised to accelerate growth starting this quarter, with further acceleration in the back half of the fiscal year. First, we expect our pelvic health business to be a key driver for this segment in fiscal 2026 and beyond. Importantly, ahead of our InterStim X launch this fall, we took the opportunity to make some significant changes to our commercial organization in pelvic health in Q1. Now, while this had some short-term impact in the quarter, as we expected, it sets us up.\nIt sets us up to capitalize on the large opportunity ahead as we anticipate accelerating growth from this business as we go through the year. In neurovascular, we expect growth to accelerate each quarter as we go through the remainder of the fiscal year and as we lap China VBP and product recall comps. We also have some new products ramping in carotid stenting and our hemorrhagic portfolio. Now in surgical, we have the US launch for Hugo in the back half of the fiscal year, which we expect to be accretive to growth. In diabetes, we expect performance to accelerate as we launch two new sensors, Simplera Sync this fall, and the Abbott-based sensor, which we're calling Instinct, in the coming months. Simplera is 1/2 the size of our current sensor. It's disposable, and it's much easier to put on with no overtape.\nWith Instinct, our customers will get access to Abbott's most advanced CGM platform. When you combine these improved sensors with our MiniMed 780G and its exclusive needle detection technology, we expect to see a positive inflection in our installed base and revenue growth. As for the separation of our diabetes business, MiniMed, we're calling it, is proceeding according to plan. MiniMed is entering a strong innovation cycle in its own right. The separation will sharpen Medtronic's focus on our core businesses, including high-growth opportunities like we discussed, PFA, Ardian, and others. It will also allow Medtronic to grow revenue and earnings faster without diabetes than we do with it today. We continue to expect the separation to be immediately EPS accretive, even with conservative valuations, and this portfolio move will be a value-creating separation for Medtronic shareholders.\nClearly, look, there's a lot to be excited about at Medtronic in the next few quarters. As a result of the strength of our product pipeline, we're confident that not only will our revenue growth inflect in the near term, but we'll also achieve higher earnings growth over time. This will come through a combination of natural P&L leverage and decisive urgent action we're taking to improve efficiency in both COGS and our operating expenses. We're creating an environment at Medtronic where innovation fuels growth, and growth in turn creates the oxygen needed to fuel more high ROI investments into innovation. We've already started increasing these investments, as you saw this quarter, with our high single-digit increase in R&D. It is these investments that will make our earnings power durable.\nNow with that, I'll turn it over to Thierry, who's going to cover the details of our business performance, our financials, and of course, our guidance. So over to you, Thierry.\n\nThierry Piéton\n\nEVP and CFO, Medtronic\n\nHey, thanks, Geoff, and hello everyone. I'll start first with our cardiovascular portfolio. So CV grew 7% this quarter, led by cardiac ablation solutions. CAS growth continued to accelerate to nearly 50%, including low 70s growth in both the US and Japan, and low 30s growth in international markets. This rapid growth is being driven by high demand for our pulsed field ablation systems, including our PulseSelect anatomical catheter, and especially our Sphere-9 focal catheter and Affera mapping system. Affera mapping system utilization is high, and the Sphere-9 catheters are being used in a wide variety of cases. Our teams are quickly ramping supply, and our mapper hiring is on track. This is allowing us to enter new accounts as well as going deeper into more labs in our established accounts.\nWe're still early in the rollout, and we continue to execute with urgency to capitalize on this massive opportunity. We expect to continue to win share in this 11 billion space that is now growing over 25%. As we look forward, we're advancing our PFA pipeline, including our next-gen Affera Sphere-360 catheter. We hear from many EPs that Sphere-360 is the most anticipated single shot catheter in this space, driven by very positive early clinical data. We're expecting to start the pivotal trial for Sphere-360 this calendar year. Next, in structural heart, we grew 6%. We continue to gain traction with our Evolut FX TAVR device and our differentiated clinical evidence. We're getting our fair share of international revenue from Boston Scientific's market exit. We're also gaining momentum in several geographies, including Japan.\nWe expect all of this to drive continued strength in our TAVR franchise in the quarters ahead. In cardiac rhythm management, we grew 3% with 6% growth in defibrillation solutions and 3% in cardiac pacing therapies, offset by cardiovascular diagnostics. We continue to see strong adoption of our premium innovative products, including 83% growth of Aurora EV-ICD, 14% growth in Micra leadless pacemakers, and 21% growth with our 3830 conduction system pacing lead. In hypertension, we were very pleased with CMS's proposed NCD for our Symplicity system that they issued last month, as well as the positive comments that came in during the public comment period. And then last week, we received the news that the ACC and AHA issued updated guidelines recognizing Ardian as a treatment option for hypertension. These are very important steps to providing patients access to our innovative Symplicity procedure.\nNearly half of US adults have hypertension, and one in four are uncontrolled, despite the broad availability of numerous generic drugs. CMS now expects to finalize the NCD on or before 8 October, and we expect procedures to ramp following that. Ahead of this, we're working with healthcare systems across the US to train physicians and help them establish Symplicity service lines. We're rapidly hiring clinical specialists, market development, and healthcare economics managers to drive the future growth. They will work alongside our existing coronary sales force to provide support for this important new treatment. We also continue to invest in next-gen Ardian technology, including our next-gen catheter that will provide radial access. We enrolled our first patient in our multi-organ denervation pilot study, which is called SPYRAL GEMINI.\nNow turning to the neuroscience business, which grew 3%. Our cranial and spinal technologies business grew mid-single digits, including 5% US core spine growth and 8% US neurosurgery growth. As Geoff mentioned, we had a strong capital equipment quarter as our differentiated AiBLE spine ecosystem continues to win share. Several categories of our enabling equipment grew double-digit globally, including Mazor, O-arm, Midas Rex, and StealthStation. In neuromodulation, we had another very strong quarter, growing 9%. In pain stim, we grew 10% globally, including 11% in the US. Our Inceptiv system, with its responsive real-time therapy adjustments, is giving patients greater freedom. In brain modulation, we grew high single digits as our groundbreaking BrainSense Adaptive DBS technology is launching in the US, Europe, and Japan. BrainSense is a fully closed-loop brain-computer interface that automatically provides personalized real-time therapy adjustments based on brain activity feedback for patients with Parkinson's disease.\nNext, turning to our MedSurg portfolio, which grew 2%. Our surgical business also grew 2% this quarter. The business had high single-digit growth in advanced energy, where our market-leading LigaSure vessel sealing technology won share again for the 12th quarter in a row. This, combined with high single-digit growth in emerging markets, helped offset two ongoing but stable market pressures. One is in bariatric surgery, and the other is from the shift to robotic surgery. Both are primarily in the US. We continue to expect our surgical growth to improve over time, starting in the back half of the fiscal year as we begin to expand the launch of Hugo. Earlier this calendar year, we filed for FDA approval for Hugo, and we're looking forward to launching it in the important US market. In international markets, we're making good progress in surgical robotics as our revenue and procedure volumes continue to grow.\nLast month, we received CE mark for LigaSure technology on Hugo. This was an important step for our robotic offering, given that LigaSure is the most preferred vessel sealing technology in the world, having been used over 35 million procedures. Robotics and the ecosystems that robotic-assisted surgery enables are important for our surgical business. And as we look ahead, we see robotics and our world-class digital and AI capabilities as an important strategic differentiator that will benefit many of our franchises at Medtronic. To wrap up our business performance, in diabetes, we grew 8%. This included 11% growth in international markets, where our Simplera sensor technology is already available. We've heavily invested in diabetes over the past few years. And now we're entering a strong innovation cycle with both new technology and new indications. Last month, we received CE mark for expanded indications for the 780G for Type 2 diabetes, children as young as two, and during pregnancy.\nLooking ahead, in addition to launching the two new sensors that Geoff mentioned, we're expecting Type 2 approval in the US in the coming months. We also continue to make progress with our new insulin pump systems. We intend to submit our next-generation durable pump, the MiniMed Flex, to the US FDA by the end of the fiscal year. Flex is much smaller than 780G, as the screen is your phone, allowing for more discreet placement while still using the same reservoirs and infusion sets. Flex will work with both Simplera Sync and Instinct sensors. Finally, as mentioned, our planned separation of MiniMed is on track. Our preferred path continues to be a two-step IPO and split, which we expect to have fully completed within 15 months from now.\nUpon separation, we continue to expect approximately 50 basis points of growth margin improvement and 100 basis points of operating margin improvement. Now turning to the financials, Q1 revenue of $8.6 billion grew 8.4% reported, and 4.8% organic, in line with our guidance. Our adjusted gross margin was 65.1%, down 80 basis points year over year. This was expected and stable when compared to Q4. I'll walk you through the four main components that drove the gross margin this quarter. First, we continue to benefit from pricing as we launch new products and maintain pricing discipline on contracting, and this had a 30 basis points benefit. Second, business mix, as I noted last quarter, continues to be a near-term headwind. Approximately 70 basis points this quarter, split roughly equally between CAS and diabetes.\nCAS today is impacted by the mix of lower margin capital to higher margin catheters, and diabetes is early in its manufacturing ramp of the Simplera sensor. Over time, we expect both of these to improve as we scale our CAS business and separate the diabetes business. Third, our COGS efficiency programs, net of inflation, continue to benefit gross margin as our global operations and supply chain organization execute to deliver savings on materials and drive efficiencies in our manufacturing plants. This quarter, this was more than offset, primarily by the manufacturing ramp of Affera that we incurred last year. The net of these items was a 50 basis points headwind. Finally, foreign exchange was 10 basis points tailwind to gross margin.\nMoving down the P&L, adjusted R&D was up 7.7%, 100 basis points ahead of revenue growth. We're allocating significant capital to high-growth projects across our businesses, including large increases in both cardiovascular and diabetes. With FD&A, we continue to drive leverage, growing it 170 basis points below revenue growth. Importantly, we drove the significant leverage while also increasing investment in growth areas, including CAS as we hired more mappers, and Ardian as we developed the market. We are extremely focused on making sure we fuel our growth drivers to maximize the opportunities from these technological breakthroughs. Our adjusted operating profit was $2 billion, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 23.6%. Below the operating profit line, our adjusted tax rate was 17.8%, about 70 basis points better than expectations due to our jurisdictional mix of profits. The FX impact on EPS was neutral in first quarter, a couple cents better than anticipated, given rate movements throughout the quarter.\nThe net result was adjusted EPS of $1.26, $0.03 above the midpoint of our guidance. Now let's move to our guidance. On the top line, we continue to expect fiscal year 2026 organic revenue growth of approximately 5%. In Q2, we're expecting 4.5% to 5 organic growth, similar to what we just delivered in the first quarter. As Geoff covered earlier, we're expecting revenue growth to accelerate in the back half of the fiscal year. Based on recent FX rates, which have moved substantially over the past quarter, we now see a tailwind of revenue of $550 to 650 million in fiscal 2026. This is over half a billion dollar positive increase versus three months ago. In Q2, FX is currently a $50 to 100 million tailwind based on the recent rates.\nMoving down the P&L, we're continuing to drive pricing discipline and to deliver savings on our COGS efficiency programs. These will be offset in the near term by continued business mix, primarily in CAS and diabetes. Regarding tariffs, you'll recall we outlined two scenarios when we gave our annual guidance last quarter. Given where we are in the year, we can take the worst case, $350 million scenario, off the table for this year. The $200 million scenario has modestly improved, driven by our execution on mitigation efforts. As a result, tariffs are now expected to be approximately $185 million for fiscal 2026. We also remain committed to increase investment in our current and future growth drivers, resulting in increased R&D, sales, and marketing spend. At the same time, we are confident in our ability to drive leverage with our G&A expenses.\nAccordingly, there's no change in our expectation for fiscal 2026 operating profit to grow materially faster than revenue. Given our Q1 results, we're raising our underlying fiscal 2026 EPS growth expectation, which excludes the impact of tariffs, to 4.5% versus the prior 4%. FX is now a flat to 1% benefit to fiscal 2026 EPS. Including the impact of tariffs, we're now guiding EPS in the range of $5.60 to 5.66, a raise from our prior range of $5.50 to 5.60. For Q2, we would expect EPS of $1.30 to 1.32, which includes an approximate 1% benefit from foreign currency based on recent rates, as well as an approximate $18 million negative impact coming from tariffs.\nAs I mentioned last quarter, we're expecting high single-digit EPS growth in fiscal year 2027, driven by accelerating revenue growth, improved business mix from CAS and diabetes, as well as the other financial benefit of the diabetes separation. To conclude, our confidence is building. We're advancing our growth drivers to accelerate revenue and growth, and we're executing on efficiencies in manufacturing and supply chain and operating expenses to drive earnings growth. At the same time, we're increasing our growth investments in R&D and sales and marketing, all with a deliberate focus on creating long-term shareholder value. Geoff, back to you.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nOkay, thank you, Thierry. Before we go to Q&A, I want to make a few brief remarks on the shareholder value creation initiatives we announced this morning in partnership with Elliott Investment Management, and on the opportunity that we both see ahead for Medtronic. Today, we've announced a series of governance enhancements that will help capitalize on the enormous opportunities in front of us and unlock the full extent of Medtronic's potential.\nTo start, we've appointed two new independent board members, John Groetelaars and Bill Jellison, each of whom bring deep operational expertise in MedTech and fresh perspectives to the table. The Board and I are excited to welcome both John and Bill to Medtronic. As part of our inflection, the leadership and I are reinvigorating our laser focus up and down the organization on two key fronts: growth and creating oxygen to fuel that growth and drive earnings power. These two focus areas need to be linked from the frontline employees of Medtronic up through senior leadership, including me, and all the way to the board.\nToday, we announced that we've created two new board committees to support management: the Growth Committee, which will oversee our portfolio management and capital allocation decisions to accelerate growth, and an Operating Committee, which will provide oversight of our efforts to drive efficiency gains in our operations and expense base. This will enable a higher level of organic investment back into our business while also delivering improving margins and accelerating EPS growth. We'll have a fresh perspective from our two new board members, and these two committees will give us support and focus so we can execute with both speed and urgency. Finally, we look forward to sharing the culmination of these initiatives at an investor day sometime mid-calendar year 2026.\nAt this event, we intend to provide a comprehensive update for investors on our strategy post-diabetes, the value proposition of our go-forward portfolio, and new long-term financial targets for sustained value creation. So to conclude, here's what we want you to take away from today's announcement with Elliott. Medtronic is turning the page, and we'll be entering a new period of greater revenue and earnings growth. We've put in place a stronger foundation for the company. Over the last few quarters, we've discussed how we have an incredible product pipeline that is poised to accelerate our organic growth. Now, with our renewed focus on aligning our portfolio and capital allocation for higher growth, as well as enhancing operational excellence, we're putting the pieces together in place to translate that accelerating top line into a period of sustained outsized earnings growth.\nWe're entering a new phase of our transformation to act more boldly and more decisively to deliver the strategic clarity, growth profile, operational rigor, investment strategy, and shareholder returns that this company is capable of. As I wrap up, I want to thank the Medtronic employees watching today. We've gone through a lot of change together to better position the company to deliver improved performance. I appreciate that you've accomplished this while also keeping the Medtronic mission front and center. You're striving without reserve for the greatest possible reliability and quality in our products, and you're doing so with dedication, honesty, integrity, and service. Your work is benefiting millions of patients around the world as we alleviate their pain, as we restore their health, and we extend their lives. Thank you.\nOkay, now it's time to move on to Q&A, where we're going to try to get to as many of you analysts as possible. So we ask that you limit yourself to just one question and only, if needed, a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, you can reach out to Ryan and the investor relations team after the call. Ryan, can you please cue up the Q&A instructions?\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nSure, Geoff. For the sell-side analysts that would like to ask a question, please select the Participants button and click Raise Hand. If you're using the mobile app, press the More button and select Raise Hand. Your lines are currently on mute, and when called upon, you will receive a request to unmute your line, which you must respond to before asking your question. Finally, please be advised that this Q&A session is being recorded. We'll pause for a few seconds now to assemble the queue.\nOkay, we'll take the first question from Travis Steed of BofA Securities. Please go ahead, Travis.\n\nTravis Steed\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research for Medical Technology, BofA Securities\n\nHey, thanks for taking the question. I guess first of all, on the pipeline, I see it's coming through this quarter, CAS, 72% US growth. Sounds like supply is ramping up nicer there. So love an update on CAS, but also it's not showing up in the total US growth. US growth, 3.5% this quarter, 1% structural heart growth. I just want to hear your confidence. You talked about being confident in the ability to accelerate growth over FY 2026, but how do you get confidence in kind of the base business still kind of growing mid-single digit so the pipeline can kind of be on top of that?\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nSure. Yeah, thanks for the question, Travis. Look, let me start with just some context on the quarter. Like I said, another mid-single digit quarter, 4.8% organic revenue growth coming in within our guidance of 4.5% to 5, EPS coming in $0.03 above the midpoint. To your point, the growth drivers are accelerating. You highlighted CAS. I'll come back to that. And we got other ones coming, aortic, we talked about the tibial coming in the back half of the year. But there are a couple of areas that came in a little below trend, like in neuroscience, for example, pelvic health, neurovascular, and then we'll get to diabetes. Demand is strong there, but the US growth came down a bit. There are a couple of areas, and I'll turn those over to Thierry in a second that are going to be kind of bouncing back and accelerating.\nAnd then on the US, and that'll impact US, but also on the US growth, all the new technology that's coming, the continued acceleration in CAS, Ardian, like I mentioned, diabetes, pelvic health, plus the rebound of these, they're all will have an outsized impact on have an outsized impact on the US growth. Thierry, do you want to talk about the?\n\nThierry Piéton\n\nEVP and CFO, Medtronic\n\nNo, I think you hit the main point. So as you said, some of the pieces of the business that had relatively slower growth in the first quarter were mostly US impacting. If you take a couple of these examples in pelvic health, we made some changes in the commercial force, as we said in the commentary, to prepare for the launch of tibial. And that's primarily a US impact, I would say. The second element, I would say, is diabetes.\nDiabetes grew very strongly outside of the US. We were up 11% in the international market. The US was a bit slower, and that's mostly a product topic. We have the demand for Simplera, but the ramp-up is only starting, and that's impacting the US as well. As this ramp-up occurs, we'll see those things start kicking in the US and changing the profile that we mentioned between US and international markets. So positive going forward in the US.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah, and in CAS, like we showed in the earnings presentation, that's going to continue to accelerate. As you highlighted, Travis, we're getting the capital systems out there. The utilization is off the charts high. Everyone's excited about the catheters we have. They're also the catheters that are coming, Sphere-360 in the single-shot space. So it's great. I was just in Japan the week before last. I was there for 50 years of Medtronic in Japan. I spent a lot of time with physicians, a lot of conversations on CAS.\nThere, we're the number one market share. Affera is approved, but not even launched there. This is on PulseSelect. I know our competitor highlighted that they felt they were the number one, talked about how many cases they've done. We've done meaningfully more in Japan, and I know we're the number one there. I asked what I was probing as to why. They talked about the precision of PulseSelect and that, but really the safety profile of our catheters, both the publicized safety of PulseSelect, but also Affera in our IDE trials. Then they did their own, the largest centers there in Japan did their own IDE, their own trials, and that safety profile came through.\nI think that safety message, obviously, it means a lot in Japan. They really prioritize it. But I think that as PFA grows and becomes more ubiquitous, I think that's going to become a bigger kind of driver here in the US as well, and that plays to our favor. I think CAS is in a really good spot to continue to accelerate. And not only did it grow year over year, but it accelerated meaningfully sequentially. We saw strong sequential growth in CAS, especially in Affera, which was, I think, like near 60% sequential. I mean, any way you slice it, our CAS business, from technology to commercial execution, geographic expansion, safety profile data, physician experience, etc., is doing really well.\n\nThierry Piéton\n\nEVP and CFO, Medtronic\n\nGeoff, as you mentioned, the sequential growth is going to continue, right? And you saw that on the chart. We're going to have both higher growth rate in Q2 than we did in Q1 in CAS. And we're also going to have an absolute value, significant sequential growth between the first quarter and the second quarter.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nAll right, thanks, Travis. Appreciate the one question. Next, we'll go to Larry Biegelsen at Wells Fargo Securities. Larry, please go ahead.\n\nLarry Biegelsen\n\nSenior Medical Device Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nNew board committees, one focused on growth, one focused on operations. What can these committees do that you couldn't do before? What would success look like, and how long before investors start to see an impact? Thank you.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah, thanks, Larry. Look, the two committees, I think, like I mentioned in the commentary, they're going to provide focus to support management. I think particularly the two committees, one on growth, one on operational performance, think margins, think continued focus on our supply chain. One thing they're going to do, a couple of things. One, we're bringing on these two new directors with deep MedTech experience.\nThere'll be a strong voice on the board, I believe. We've had MedTech experience in the past, and recently not as much. So bringing in John and Bill will help a lot, and they'll be on those two committees. The other thing is just the frequency. We've rearranged our committees. We didn't just add two committees. We're going to rearrange them so that we keep the same amount of committees. These will be very focused on those two topics. The amount of the intervals with management will be higher. It'll be, I think, quite a bit higher than we've had in the past. A lot of off-cycle discussions that will help drive this. That's what I think.\nIt's the focus, it's the interval, and it's of touchpoints with management, and I think the MedTech voice on those two committees.\n\nLarry Biegelsen\n\nSenior Medical Device Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nThank you very much.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Larry. Next question we'll take from Mike Kracke at Leerink Partners. Mike, please go ahead.\n\nMike Kracke\n\nAnalyst, Leerink Partners\n\nHi, everyone. Thanks very much for taking our question. Maybe just going back to the CAS business. So during your last call, you talked about CAS growth accelerating from 30%. You put up another great quarter of nearly 50%, expecting that to accelerate again. I'm curious in terms of the ramp that you've seen, is that $2 billion that you've talked about in annual CAS sales now squarely on the table for fiscal 2026, or what reservations would you have about committing to that?\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah, no, thanks for the question, Mike. When I said that, we're sticking to that. Nothing's changed. I said it's near term. I think getting it in fiscal 2020, and it's off, just to be clear, it's another billion on top of our FY 2025 base, right? So that's what we're anchored on, sticking to that. I said near term. So near term, it could be FY 2026. I think it'll go into FY 2027, but it won't be far. So that's on track. Like I said, accelerating sequentially as well, and things are looking good. So no change there.\n\nMike Kracke\n\nAnalyst, Leerink Partners\n\nGot it. Thanks very much.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Mike.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nWe'll take the next question from Robbie Marcus at JPMorgan. Robbie, please go ahead.\n\nRobbie Marcus\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOh, great. Thanks a lot for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on Larry's question on the new directors and the formation of the committee. Geoff, Thierry, maybe you could give us a little more. Besides more touchpoints and communication, is this something where maybe the size of the company, the dividend, the capital allocation might be up for discussion, how to create more EPS growth? I'm just trying to understand how much of this is more a continuation, Geoff, of your strategy since you became CEO, and I know you've talked a lot about portfolio optimization versus maybe evaluating something more of a wholesale change. Thanks a lot.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah, look, Robbie, I'd say, first of all, I think we're entering, like I said in the call, a new chapter here for the company. I mean, when I came in, immediately was met with a couple of challenges that we had to work our way through, some of our own making, some market like VBP and things like that. But we've got a stable foundation. We've worked through that.\nOur growth drivers are kicking in, and we're going to execute to that, right? You'll see this growth inflection in the back half of the year. But on top of that, I think we feel confident. Our board feels confident. This is something that was in place before we started engaging with Elliott, that we can turn the page to a new chapter and be more aggressive on some of these other drivers, right, that we talked about. These are the same things that Elliott has talked to us about, is whether it be it's all about value creation and some bold decisions around a couple of areas. One is more M&A, okay? The Affera deal is looking great.\nAnd like I said, we feel like the team has the bandwidth to integrate more such deals like that, not necessarily in AFib, but across the company in these high-growth areas. So more M&A, a reinvigorated laser focus on the portfolio to reorient the whole portfolio between M&A and any kind of portfolio moves towards higher growth. Increase our WAMGR. Diabetes deal is a good proof point, but there's other opportunities we can look at here. So that's one big area. And then the second is investing more in the company. We've talked about capital allocation within the company, where we're investing our R&D and our G&A, our growth-oriented G&A, where's that going? But making sure we're investing more in the company. Are we investing enough behind these big growth drivers? We think, no, we'd want to invest more.\nYou see it in our R&D this quarter growing almost 8%. We'd like to keep that trend going, invest more behind these growth drivers because they're secular growth drivers. And talking to Elliott, they call them transformational growth drivers that we haven't seen in decades. That's their words, not mine. So these are the themes: reorienting the portfolio for even higher growth that's durable, and then reinvesting more behind our growth drivers. We've got the confidence. We've got the stable operational base to do this. And we can work on those things as these other growth drivers that we've been working on for the past couple of years are taking us, are accelerating our growth. We can do both of these at once. And these committees are going to help with that. And super excited to have both John and Bill on the board.\nWe talked about their MedTech background, but specifically operators, strong financial acumen, experience in doing portfolio moves, M&A. They're just a good fit. They went through our normal process, through our Nominating Corporate Governance Committee. Everyone was unanimous that everyone felt was a good fit. We want them. They want us. I think they're going to do a great job, not just supporting management, but also representing all of our shareholders. So that's how I'd answer that question, Robbie. It's all about value creation. We're going to do what it takes to get there. There's a big opportunity in front of us, and it's about capitalizing on this opportunity and accelerating it.\n\nRobbie Marcus\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks, Geoff. Can't wait to see what comes. Appreciate it.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Robbie. Appreciate the question. Next, we'll go to the line of Matt Miksic at Barclays. Matt, please go ahead.\n\nMatt Miksic\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on some of the progress here that you're making in these major growth drivers. So on that subject, you've been investing in the groundwork for these major growth drivers now for several years: diabetes, ablation, RDN, and they're just starting to really come through. We get excited. I think everyone gets excited about seeing the growth come through and hearing about rates like 50% growth in cardiac ablation. But it would be super helpful if you could try to square, not to temper the enthusiasm because they're great programs, but try to square what these can mean on an annual basis to sort of overall Medtronic portfolio growth, just because I think the perception becomes we're accelerating growth, which means we're not going to do 5%.\nMaybe we'll do 6% growth or something like that, which to take that off the list for the long term, but maybe help us walk through a cadence of is it 25 or 50 basis points over the next 12 months? Is it another 25 or 50 basis points maybe in 2027? Just some way of gauging what this means to overall portfolio growth would be super helpful. Thanks.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nOkay, Mike. Thierry, do you want to take that one?\n\nThierry Piéton\n\nEVP and CFO, Medtronic\n\nI guess I'll take a shot at it. And Geoff, you can comment. So first, you might have seen in the announcement that we'll do an investor day sometime in mid-2026 to take you through sort of the next step in our financial profile. I'm not going to give you very specific targets until we get to that point because that'll be the whole purpose of that discussion. When we have that discussion, what we'll do is we'll show you where the company is going. We'll show you the steps to get there, and we'll show you what it means from a financial profile perspective, the new sort of framework, financially speaking.\nWe'll give you the indicators that you can use to see that we're tracking towards that path. That being said, to be a little more short-term, look, Geoff mentioned the magnitude of the opportunity that we've got in cash. We're talking $1 billion of incremental revenue over the 2025 run rate within a relatively short timeframe, right? You could see the type of impact we're going to have there. On RDN, it's also a secular change for us and a massive transformation in terms of run rate. You could see the size of the opportunity that this represents.\nThese two things alone are going to have a pretty significant impact on our growth rates. Then Geoff mentioned all the other elements such as Tibio and Hugo that are going to kick in, etc. So it's very clear that we're talking macro-level impacts, growth opportunities. To be clear, we're not giving up on the rest of the business, right? We've made the underlying changes to make them run smoother. We're addressing with product and innovation some of the businesses that have been slower growth businesses or franchises for us in the past. You should see these large opportunities as being incremental. And that's what we're targeting. For the exact quantification, I'm afraid you're going to have to wait a little bit. You'll start seeing the signs in the second half. Then we'll show the new framework when we talk to you in the mid of 2026.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah. No, the only thing I'd add to that is, look, why now? We've got this growth coming, right? You have this inflection in the back half of the year and very tangible new product innovation coming. And even from this quarter, you have some businesses that were growing below trend that also have nice products coming or lapping an issue like VBP and neurovascular that also contributes. It leads to a nice back half growth that will continue. And that higher growth gives us more just through some natural leverage and our cost control in our operational efficiencies. It gives us more oxygen to reinvest, which allows us to do more innovations. There was that chart of that cycle. And the only thing I think is missing from there is portfolio, right?\nMore growth leads to more oxygen, which leads to more investment, which leads to more innovation and more growth. And then you've got the portfolio in there. I do think it creates opportunities for a different algorithm here. But that's something we're not going to really talk too much about until we get to that Investor Day. I'd like to think there'll be some milestones along the way, but the broader strategy and algorithm, all that we'll talk about on that Investor Day.\n\nThierry Piéton\n\nEVP and CFO, Medtronic\n\nIf I can just add one comment, Geoff, on that. We're talking about reinvesting more, but I want to be clear that we're not talking reinvesting to the detriment of EPS, right? So it has to be and. We're very clear on the fact that the growth will allow us to invest more while continuing to generate leverage in the income statement and improving EPS, right? I just want to be clear about that.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah. Good point.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nOkay. Thanks, Matt. Next, we'll go to the line of Anthony Petrone at Mizuho. Anthony, please go ahead.\n\nAnthony Petrone\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Mizuho\n\nGreat. And congratulations on the announcements this morning. And maybe I'll zero in on one of the growth initiatives, which is renal denervation. We're looking at the targeted date of 8 October for the NCD. So maybe just frame for us what you would view as the best-case outcome in terms of the targeted population and uncontrolled hypertension. And when you sort of think about this new structure, growth initiatives, where would you stack rank renal denervation on transforming the growth profile of this company? Can this be a multi-billion dollar product category over the next few years? Thanks.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question, Anthony. Look, first of all, there was an update on RDN this quarter, which I don't think we talked about. We didn't talk about in the commentary, but we did get through the comment period. That 30-day comment period ended with CMS. And there was, I think, a record, I'm told from our reimbursement folks, a record number of comments, overwhelmingly positive in support of RDN and the guideline and kind of the CMS, how they framed reimbursement and what's required. And that, like we said on our last call, is kind of a very good case for us that opens up this market.\nIn addition to that, you're seeing physician societies. We already saw it in Europe a few months ago, now in the US, incorporating renal denervation in our, I guess I'm saying our product name here, Symplicity. You're going to hear a lot more about that into the care pathway. All these puzzle pieces that we've been working on for so long, breakthrough FDA device designation, a nice indication for this, the CMS proposed reimbursement, the comments. Now you're seeing the physician societies incorporate Symplicity into the care pathways, how you take care of these patients. Strong demand from hospitals to say, \"Okay, we need to get serious about this. We need to build these care pathways.\" We've deployed a lot of market development specialists to support them in this. Training of the physicians, although that's not a huge burden.\nThe interventional cardiology community, this is not a big stretch for them. So that's not a huge burden, like something completely new. They got the catheter skills. All the dominoes are falling. The puzzle piece is snapping into place that this is going to be a massive market. Now, we're looking at cath right now. It's very tangible. You see the transition from drugs to ablation and, within ablation, from one technology or PFA, and we've got a great technology there. It's growing like crazy. It's very tangible. I still think RDN has a chance to even be bigger. The patient population is massive. We've talked about how many hundred million people in the US? 100 to 200 million people, 1 million people in the US that have hypertension. Of those, is that right? About 100 million? Yeah.\n\nThierry Piéton\n\nEVP and CFO, Medtronic\n\nA lot of million in 18 million that are uncontrolled hypertension. So it's a massive population.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nOne in four people with hypertension have. It's a huge number that's uncontrolled. We think this is going to be the biggest thing that we ever do. This is one of those areas that we talked about, investing behind this to really make this market develop, grow, and be a driver for us and create a moat around our franchise, our Symplicity franchise, to protect it against competitors. We've got already our next generation of catheters ready to go. We've got new clinical trials ablating different places that we think, in the early work, meaningfully helps the blood pressure reduction. There's a lot of work going on here, and just really pleased with the way it's all coming together. Anything else?\n\nAnthony Petrone\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Mizuho\n\nAppreciate that.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nGreat. Thanks, Anthony. Next, we'll go to the line of Josh Jennings at TD Securities. Josh, please go ahead.\n\nJosh Jennings\n\nManaging Director, TD Securities",
    "content2": "Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I got to change that picture, update it. Sorry about that. Wanted to just check back in with the increased focus on the diabetes franchise with the IPO split separation strategy. Just in the US, it sounds like that the slowdown may have been driven by just patients, and physicians waiting for next-generation CGM and Instinct, the collaboration with Abbott. Multi-part question, but just first, just wanted to check and make sure there hadn't been disruption that's leading to a slowdown. And then second, just to set expectations in terms of how we on the sell-side investor should be thinking about the ramp from here in the US diabetes business.\nAnd then lastly, just what's left for the approval and launch of Instinct and the integration with 780G. Sorry, three-parter there, but hope you got all that.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nOkay. We'll answer the three-parter and change the picture if you want. But why don't I do two things here? I'll have Thierry update you just on the deal. It is on track, and let him talk about that. We'll bring Que on to talk about the business specifics. So Thierry, do you want to update us on the deal?\n\nThierry Piéton\n\nEVP and CFO, Medtronic\n\nJust on the deal, I would say the process is perfectly on track. So there's really two sides. One is the operational separation of the business, and the other is the transaction itself. On both fronts, the teams are making progress exactly in the way we anticipated. The first investor engagements have been very, very encouraging. Look, we said three months ago, we thought we'd complete the separation within 18 months. It's three months later. Now it feels like 15 months. So everything on track. That's all I would say on this one, Geoff.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nOkay. Que, do you want to answer the business questions that Josh had?\n\nQue Dallara\n\nEVP and President of Medtronic Diabetes, Medtronic\n\nYes, Geoff. Thanks. Josh, I think you got it right. It's really a matter of timing in the first half. We're really excited about Simplera. And you can see that we're achieving double-digit growth in the international markets where Simplera has been launched. And in the US, the demand is absolutely there. We have this dynamic where patients are waiting for the new CGMs. To give you a sense of how we're ramping up production, we're going to be producing double what we made in Q1 and in the second half, double what we're making in the first half.\nProduction is ramping up really nicely. And then in parallel to that, the Abbott-based sensor, Instinct, we expect to launch in the coming months. So not too far behind Simplera. And to put it in context, it's actually a very big moment for us because we're now going to have two competitive sensors on the market, giving patients choice, significant improvements in form factor, and days of wear. And so really, it's a matter of timing and why I'm actually extremely confident that we'll see growth acceleration in the second half. And then you asked about what's left to get Instinct over the line.\nWe told you that we submitted for ACE and iAGC back in April. We got ACE approved in July. Our expectation is that we'll be in a very strong position to launch in the coming months.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah. Look, I'd summarize it. However you want to phrase it, a super cycle of innovation here that diabetes has. It's on the very front end of, and we think this transaction is going to be a significant value-creating event for shareholders. But meantime, we still, Medtronic is the owner of this company for a year plus, and we're very focused on it. This is an important part of the company, and we're committed to making this capitalize on this cycle of innovation that we've been building towards and making this transaction a meaningful value creator for investors.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nGreat. Thanks, Josh. We'll take two more questions here before we wrap up. We'll go to the line of Matt O'Brien at Piper Sandler. Matt, please go ahead.\n\nMatt O'Brien\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nMorning. Thanks for taking the question. I'd love to ask a little more about RDN, but I think the other thing to think about here is the overall business as you spin off diabetes. You've got half the business that's doing really well, growing very quickly, but another half that's a little softer, not growing quite as quickly, maybe some structural headwinds. You do have a couple of new products in tibial and robotics that may be able to help kind of some of these softer areas. But are there other products on the organic side of things that can help kind of bring some of these softer businesses up to the other half of the business that's doing so well?\nOr do we need to wait for more inorganic additions to really help with that side of the business, maybe post the Elliott contributions? Thanks so much.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah. Thanks, Matt. No, look, the short answer to your question is some of the businesses that came in below trend or lower growth in the portfolio, they have very specific growth accelerators already organic. We talked about neurovascular, for example. That's been a good grower for us in the past. And it has to get through a major, probably the biggest VBP impact we've had on any one business. Neurovascular for us is huge in China. And so that is we're moving through that. And it also had a recall, which we're not technically lapping that, but the replacement product now is ramping up. So that's going to accelerate.\nI mentioned through the Contego partnership, some products that we'll be putting in our neurovascular and our peripheral vascular bag. I'll come to PV in a second that will help with its growth. And then finally, we've got some hemorrhagic products in neurovascular. So neurovascular, you're going to see a meaningful acceleration. We talked about pelvic health. I think this is an underappreciated one. This overactive bladder is a huge market. It's millions of patients. And the idea of going from basically an implantable device in your upper buttocks, the sacral nerve modulation, to something that's above your fascia on the ankle, it's not quite a wearable, but it's pretty close to a wearable, is really going to open up that market. We'll take market share, which will be fun. But the bigger thing, we're going to grow this market like crazy. So that's another one.\nNeuroscience over the years has been a consistent performer for us, and it's very well positioned competitively, and it will be that way. I think these two will help accelerate it. Peripheral vascular as well. Again, the Contego transaction, we'll put those carotid stenting products in their bag. They have some other organic products coming in aspiration, Liveron. There's another example as well. Those are some of the slower. Then we talked to you about diabetes. The other two things are big. Look, we started what we've talked about. There are those headwinds. They're stable, but consistent headwinds that we're dealing with there. In our other two big franchises, Spine and CRM, we're in great shape. Spine had a mid-single-digit revenue overall, and it was like 4.5%. I think we had over 8% in capital worldwide.\nI know our competitor said something about their capital was a little lower or a lot lower, and there were concerns about capital in that area. Now, our capital is growing like crazy globally, over 8%, 13% in large capital. We got a motor on that spine business that's going to be durable. And then cardiac rhythm, it has some tougher comps to deal with. There's a lot of innovation there. EV-ICD growing, well, first of all, leadless is still growing over 14% this quarter. It's over a decade, and it's still growing in the teens even with competition, 14% this last quarter. You've got EV-ICD growing over 80%. And then our conduction system pacing lead was 20%-some, 21%, I think. And then we've got a new high-power conduction system lead coming, OmniSecure. I think that business is in great shape.\nSo you look around the portfolio, you see major growth drivers, and you see some. I'll call them singles or doubles coming in some of these lower-growth businesses, except for pelvic health. That's more than a single. That's a big one that are going to get the rest of the company up and really support this back half ramp and keep it durable. Did I miss anything?\n\nThierry Piéton\n\nEVP and CFO, Medtronic\n\nNo, I think that was very comprehensive.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah. Thanks, Matt.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nYeah. Thanks, Matt. We'll take one more question. We'll go to the line of Joanne Wuensch at Citi. Joanne, please go ahead with your question.\n\nJoanne Wuensch\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nThank you. And good morning. And I like the new background look. At SRS earlier this summer, Hugo had a really significant showcasing. I'm curious, what are your thoughts on what you've learned in the European market and how that could translate to when it comes into the US market? I'm also curious if you can give us any sort of metrics on revenue, robots placed, anything that sort of helps ground us to the progress that's being made in that segment. Thank you.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Joanne. I think we'll call Mike Marinaro to answer those questions. I'll start by saying Hugo continues to make progress. This is an important program for us. We're counting on it being one of our growth drivers, particularly when it gets into the US. We talked about it in the back half of the year. I'll turn it over to Mike to answer those specific questions. Mike?\n\nMike Marinaro\n\nEVP and President of Medical Surgical Portfolio and Americas, Medtronic\n\nYeah. Thanks, Geoff. Thanks, Joanne. So maybe first to answer the questions around what we've learned in the international markets. I think importantly, we've learned that we have a form factor that's been received very well, particularly the open console, the modular design, which is now really starting to play out in a very meaningful way in general surgery. We're seeing that general surgery applications are really a place where the modularity of this system really shines because you can take a true lap-like approach. We're learning that partnership really matters. We're not really selling, we're selling robots, and the performance of the robot, obviously, is critically important. But we're really building partnerships. And so training, education, how we surround the robot, how we come to customers as a full surgical business, these are all critical lessons that we've learned so far.\nAlso, lessons that we're borrowing from our spine business, which I think Geoff just talked through, that there's really a whole ecosystem play here that we're thinking about as we come to the US market. From a performance perspective, we're now in over 30 countries in markets around the globe. We've logged tens of thousands of procedures, and we're seeing significant double-digit growth in our current accounts on a year-on-year basis. So very good progress there. We're tracking that momentum very carefully because how those accounts perform on a year-on-year basis obviously is a good indicator for what we should expect moving forward. As you know, we've filed, and we talked about it at SRS, Joanne. I think you were there. We filed for FDA approval for our urology study, our urology indication, rather, here this year. We're progressing well in talks with FDA.\nWe're preparing to launch or rather submit hernia and GYN shortly thereafter. Those are all submitted by very large data sets that we're presenting at major conferences. We presented urology at AUA, a very large data set at the European Urology Society, GYN data at SRS. We're presenting the hernia, enable hernia, which will be the data to support our US approval at the American Hernia Society here coming up in September. We're taking a very sort of forward-leaning public approach to really displaying the safety and efficacy of the system so that customers and the community can see what that looks like. We're shortly preparing to enroll our first patient in our GYN-Onc study so that we can pursue that indication as well.\nThere's a whole series of progress that's being made here in addition to our digital ecosystem, which grew significantly last year, both in lap and robotics, including in competitive systems, and is poised to more than double again this year. I think Geoff said it. We are making very good progress. We've seen now the performance of the system. We've learned from that. We've seen how critical it is to really come in as full partners. And we're expanding the number of countries and significantly increasing the number of procedures on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Thanks for the question.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nOkay. Thank you, Mike. And thanks, Joanne, for the question. I think we're going to bring the call to a close here. First, I want to thank all the analysts for their questions and all the support. Thank you for joining us today. And I'd like to announce our Q2 earnings call is going to be broadcast the week of Thanksgiving, actually, Tuesday, 18 November.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThe week before.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nThe week before. I'm sorry. The week before Thanksgiving, Tuesday, 18 November. That's the week before Thanksgiving where we'll update you on our progress. With that, I'll bring the call to a close. And thanks for joining us, and have a great day."

I'm Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President and Head of Medtronic Investor Relations, and I appreciate that you're joining us for a Fiscal 2025 Q4 Video Earnings Webcast. Before we go inside to hear our prepared remarks, I'll share a few details about today's webcast. Joining me are Geoff Martha, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Thierry Piéton, Chief Financial Officer. Geoff and Thierry will provide comments on the results of our Q4 which ended on 25 April 2025 and our outlook for fiscal year 2026.\nAfter our prepared remarks, the executive VPs from each of our four segments will join us and will take questions from the sell-side analysts that cover the company. Today's program should last between 60 and 90 minutes. Earlier this morning we issued a press release containing our financial statements, divisional and geographic revenue summaries, and non-GAAP reconciliations.\nWe also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The presentation can be accessed in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. During today's program, many of the statements we make may be considered forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement.\nAdditional information concerning factors that could cause our actual results to differ is contained within our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement unless we say otherwise.\nAll comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, and revenue comparisons are made on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency and Q4 revenue in the current and prior year reported as other. References to sequential revenue changes compared to the Q3 of fiscal 2025 are made on an as-reported basis. All share references are on a revenue and year-over-year basis and compare our fourth fiscal quarter to our competitors' first calendar quarter.\nReconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com, and finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. With that, let's head into the studio and hear about the quarter and our outlook for fiscal 2026.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nHello everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As you can see in our Q4 results released this morning, we had a strong finish to our fiscal year growing 5.4%. Our growth drivers are having impact and are still building momentum, and we've proven to you that our growth is durable as we've now delivered mid single-digit revenue growth for two and a half years.\nOur cardiovascular growth accelerated as forecasted growing 8% on broad strength across the portfolio including nearly 30% growth in CAS. We also delivered double-digit growth in Neuromodulation and Diabetes, and high single-digit US growth in Cranial and Spinal Technologies.\nTwo of our businesses, CAS and ENT, reached important milestones entering the $1 billion annual revenue club alongside 10 of our other businesses, and we've had a number of important clinical and regulatory updates during the quarter as we continue to advance our pipeline. Operationally, we translated our revenue growth into leveraged earnings with high single-digit operating profit and low double-digit EPS growth.\nCoupled with our Q3 results, we delivered a very strong 9% EPS growth in the back half of the year, and for the full year we delivered at the upper end of the commitments that we laid out a year ago. We shared with you this morning our view on the potential impact from tariffs, which we have included in our newly issued guidance.\nThierry will walk you through this later in the broadcast, but you can see from the significant amount that we've already been able to offset that we are extremely focused on mitigating actions. You also see from our guidance that the underlying fundamentals of the business are strong and they're getting stronger.\nWe also announced this morning that we have decided to separate our Diabetes business as we continue to execute on our active portfolio management. Look, we see this as a win for both Diabetes and for Medtronic and I'm going to touch upon this a bit later.\nSo we have several details to cover today, and let's start with our Q4 performance highlights. Starting first with the Cardiovascular portfolio, innovation drove broad-based growth in the quarter, which accelerated to 8%. We delivered double-digit growth in Cardiac Ablation Solutions, Structural Heart, and Cardiac Surgery, and high single-digit growth in Cardiac Rhythm Management.\nCardiac Ablation Solutions growth accelerated as forecasted to nearly 30% with high-30s growth in the US and low-20s in international markets. Our portfolio of pulsed field ablation products, the broadest in the space, continues to drive rapid growth around the world. We're opening up new accounts as our supply continues to quickly increase, and demand for our Affera PFA products is extremely high.\nThis quarter, I spent a lot of time talking to EPs, and we're hearing great feedback. Physicians are saying that our Sphere-9 focal catheter is the most desired PFA catheter on the market, and we're seeing large centers switch to Medtronic. EPs appreciate the efficiency that comes from fewer catheter exchanges, given that Sphere-9 can do mapping, PFA, and RF ablation all from the same catheter.\nNow across our PFA platforms, customers appreciate their ease of use, their precision, durable efficacy, and of course the safety. Now if there's a PFA catheter that is driving even more customer excitement than Sphere-9, it's our next-gen Affera Sphere-360 single-shot catheter.\nSphere-360 is an integrated mapping and ablation catheter where the entire lattice tip delivers pulsed field energy so the EP doesn't have to rotate the catheter. One-year data for Sphere-360 was presented last month at the HRS meeting, which showed excellent efficacy, durability, and safety as well as very fast procedure times. We plan to start our US pivotal trial for 360 later this calendar year.\nSo our CAS business has a lot of momentum and its contribution to total company growth continues to increase, including 70 basis points this quarter, and we expect CAS's growth rate to accelerate again next quarter. The business reached $1 billion in revenue in FY 2025 and we have near-term line of sight to doubling that as we continue to enter new accounts globally with Affera and with PulseSelect.\nWith the cardiac ablation space now at roughly $10 billion and growing double-digits, this is a huge growth opportunity for Medtronic and our focus is to be the leader in this space next. Our cardiac rhythm management business had a very strong quarter growing 7% with high single-digit growth in both Defibrillation Solutions and Cardiac Pacing Therapies.\nWith Defib Solutions we're seeing strong customer adoption of our Aurora EV-ICD with its revenue doubling year-over-year as we're taking meaningful share from the incumbent. We are seeing our customers placing larger and faster repeat orders for Aurora. Now in pacing we continue to have strong growth in leadless pacing and conduction system pacing. Our Micro leadless pacemaker had strong 17% growth and our 3830 conduction system pacing lead grew 19%.\nIn Structural Heart, we grew 10% with strong growth of our Evolut TAVR platform in the US, Japan, and emerging markets. We continued to differentiate Evolut with positive clinical evidence. Our 5-year low-risk data was presented at ACC during the quarter showing outstanding valve performance for Evolut, and our 2-year data from our head-to-head SMART trial was presented at CRT showing continued superior performance versus the leading competitor's valve.\nThe SMART data and FX+ launch continue to have an impact. To give you just a few examples, a large nonprofit system in the Upper Midwest that does over 200 TAVR implants a year recently reviewed their own patient data and found that SMART was consistent with their outcomes, better valve performance with Evolut, and as a result we went from a low single-digit share to Evolut being their valve of choice.\nAnother example would be an East Coast academic center that implants about 200 valves a year and whose physicians participated in the competitor's first balloon expandable TAVR trials. Well now they've moved from using the competitor's valve almost exclusively to using our Evolut valves in a majority of their patients. Now I could keep going with such examples. The point is that our data, our technology, and our sales execution are having a significant impact, giving us confidence that we can continue to grow structural heart at or above the market.\nIn hypertension, we continue to ramp our market development activities for our Symplicity blood pressure procedure as we await reimbursement coverage from CMS. CMS has indicated that they will finalize the NCD on or before 11 October and ahead of this they will issue a draft on or before 13 July. Many large healthcare systems are establishing outpatient Symplicity service lines today so that they're prepared to rapidly scale to meet the large demand and we're right there with them.\nWe're hiring market development managers, clinical specialists, and healthcare economics managers to supplement our existing coronary sales force. We expect Symplicity revenue to meaningfully ramp when it's covered. Just like PFA over time it will become an important contributor to overall Medtronic growth.\nNearly half of US adults have hypertension, and 1 in 4 of those with hypertension don't have their blood pressure under control despite the broad availability of numerous generic drugs. Look, the opportunity here is massive, and we will be the leader in addressing this large unmet need. Now turning to the Neuroscience portfolio, our Cranial and Spinal Technologies business grew mid-single-digits, including 7% growth in the United States as we continue to win share.\nWe've changed the basis of competition in spine to one where enabling technology drives spine implant decisions. Our differentiated AiBLE spine ecosystem, including AI-driven pre-op planning, software, imaging, robotics, navigation, and powered surgical instruments, has by far the largest install base with over 10,000 capital units well ahead of our competition.\nNow this is important because when a customer upgrades one of our pieces of capital, they're not just upgrading one product, they're upgrading to the full AiBLE ecosystem. You don't go just from O-arm to new O-arm or navigation to new NAV or robot to new robot, you go from one of these pieces of equipment to the entire AiBLE ecosystem.\nAiBLE is not only appealing to spine surgeons around the world, but it's also attracting the competition's best sales reps, and distributors to join Medtronic. Some of the world's leading spine and neurosurgery centers, including large iconic teaching institutions, are moving to Medtronic, and combined with the investments we're prioritizing to even further enhance the AiBLE ecosystem, we expect our strength in CST to continue. Another business that continues to win share is Neuromodulation, which grew 10%.\nOur closed loop sensing technology is driving strong growth in both Pain Stim and Brain Mod. In Pain Stim we grew 12% including 15% growth in the US on the continued strength of our Inceptiv closed loop spinal cord stimulator. We continue to win share and have now reached the number one global position in SCS. Inceptiv is changing patients' lives as they no longer have to adjust their therapy throughout the day and they aren't having to come back to the doctor's office to have their device settings changed.\nInceptiv is reducing burden for the patient and for the physician. In Brain Modulation we grew mid single-digits including 9% growth in international markets on the continued adoption of our BrainSense Adaptive DBS for people with Parkinson's.\nLook, this is a groundbreaking technology, a fully closed-loop brain computer interface that automatically provides personalized real-time therapy based on brain activity feedback. In the US, we received FDA approval for BrainSense during the quarter. Now following stories on Adaptive DBS technology on Good Morning America, the BBC, and several other media outlets, we are seeing patients now proactively talking to their doctors and requesting adaptive devices.\nThe early results are very exciting, and we're now entering full market release in the US and Europe, with Japan launching next month. In Neuromod, we have near-term growth drivers; we're the category leader, and we're well-positioned to capture the future innovations that are coming. Now turning to our Medical Surgical Portfolio and our Surgical business, which improved and grew 2%, we continue to drive strong growth in emerging markets and advanced energy.\nOur market-leading LigaSure vessel sealing technology continues to attract strong surgeon adoption, resulting in our 11th straight quarter of winning share in advanced energy. Now we expect our surgical growth to improve over time as we expand and launch our Hugo soft tissue robotic platform. Hugo continues to reach important milestones, like last quarter we filed with the US FDA for a urological indication and the pivotal data from the Urology trial, which met its primary safety and effectiveness endpoints, was presented last month at AUA.\nWe expect to follow our urology indication in the US with hernia and benign GYN indications, and we will begin enrollment in our gyn oncology trial in the coming months. We also continue to expand instrumentation, having conducted our first cases with LigaSure on Hugo this past quarter.\nWe're expanding Hugo's installed base and are now in 30 countries around the world, and we continue to see strong increases in Hugo procedure volumes and utilization. In Surgical, we are also driving impressive expansion in our AI-powered Touch Surgery ecosystem. Touch Surgery is a foundational intelligence technology used across both robotic and laparoscopic surgery, and we're leading the industry in establishing this digital surgical ecosystem globally.\nWe see our growing digital footprint as a long-term strategic advantage for our Surgical business, and this will apply to other businesses across Medtronic over time. Finally, in diabetes, we grew 12%, our Q6 in a row of double-digit growth. The growth was broad-based with strength in pumps, CGM, and consumables. We continue to grow our MiniMed 780G installed base in both the US and international markets.\nPeople with diabetes are attracted to 780G's highest time in range of any commercial AID system, giving them the ability to achieve more control with less burden. In Europe, the launch of our Simplera Sync sensor is driving strong mid-teens CGM growth. Simplera is half the size and much easier to apply than our previous sensor. Now, in the US we received FDA approval for Simplera Sync just last month and expect to begin the launch this fall.\nRegarding our Abbott-based sensor, backend integration and development work is progressing well. We submitted our interoperable pump and controller for FDA clearance, which paves the way for bringing our AID system with this sensor to the market. We also submitted to the FDA for a 780G label expansion including for Type 2 diabetes, and rapid-acting insulins.\nLooking ahead, we expect to submit for our 8-Series next generation pump, the MiniMed Flex by the end of the fiscal year.\nAs you can see, we've significantly turned around our diabetes business, and it's very well-positioned. This morning we announced our plan to separate diabetes into a standalone public company with a capital market separation through our preferred path of an IPO split. This is a win for both companies.\nFor Medtronic, our portfolio becomes more focused on high margin growth markets like PFA and renal denervation. At the same time, the independent New Diabetes Company will be a scaled leader and the only diabetes company to commercialize a complete ecosystem to address intensive insulin management.\nToday's announcement marks a significant milestone in our ongoing active portfolio management efforts, an important lever to delivering on our long-term strategic and financial objectives. Look, there is a clear strategic rationale for Diabetes to be a standalone company. Diabetes is predominantly B2C, whereas Medtronic, our businesses are predominantly B2B.\nWe sell different types of products to different types of customers. Medtronic's commercial manufacturing and technology platform synergies are less applicable to the diabetes business given their distinct customer go-to-market and supply chain infrastructure. For Medtronic, we will continue to have leading franchises in attractive medtech markets, and this separation shifts and simplifies our portfolio to have even more intense focus on our highest margin growth drivers.\nThese growth drivers are already building momentum, and this increased focus will ensure that they reach their full revenue growth potential. Our portfolio also shifts to higher profitability, allowing us to to pick up both margin and earnings, and the shift increases our exposure to markets where we demonstrate our strongest core capabilities and have scale and synergy benefits, which importantly lowers the overall risk profile of the company.\nNow, taken altogether, we'll be in a great position to continue delivering mid single-digit or higher organic revenue growth as well as accelerating our earnings leverage. Our direction of travel here is clear. This is about greater focus on the significant opportunities in high margin growth markets where we are well-positioned, and we believe that this will result in a win for Medtronic.\nLook, I'm also excited about what the future holds for the Diabetes business, and now I'd like Que Dallara, who will become the CEO of the New Diabetes Company, to share some of her thoughts. Que joined Medtronic in 2022 and has been instrumental in turning the diabetes business into what it is today. She's an inspirational, transformative leader who is also strategic and pragmatic.\nHer impressive track record in driving growth and innovation has set the diabetes business on a path to continued success, ensuring the needs of people with diabetes are met around the globe. Over to you Que.\n\nQue Dallara\n\nEVP and President of Diabetes Operating Unit, Medtronic\n\nThanks Geoff. I want to start by thanking you for your leadership and vision. Your decision a few years ago to double down on the Diabetes business and significantly increase investment has positioned us well, setting us up to generate significant returns for stakeholders.\nWe wouldn't be where we are without your unwavering support. I'm very excited to be leading this large scale direct to consumer Diabetes business. We have over 8,000 employees in two global manufacturing facilities and a lot of innovation in the works. Our innovations are driven by the desire to improve outcomes while reducing burden, and as an independent company, we will have a shareholder base that is aligned to our business and financial profile.\nThis will enable more focused investment in innovation as well as manufacturing scale and automation, positioning us for success in automated insulin delivery and SMART MDI while also driving margin expansion over time. Our $2.8 billion Diabetes business has strong momentum in a large $16 billion global addressable market.\nWe've delivered double-digit growth now for six consecutive quarters along with several recent product approvals and the strategic partnership that we have established with Abbott Diabetes Care. We have a deep pipeline as we've been investing in CGM options, insulin delivery options such as a pen patch and durable pump, a fully automated algorithm, and a unified digital customer experience.\nThis full ecosystem not only enables people with diabetes to have a seamless transition between therapies without changing companies, but it also allows them to achieve better control with less burden, and finally, I want to thank and celebrate the dedication of our diabetes team. Their passion and perseverance is transforming diabetes care to give people the freedom to forget about diabetes and live their best lives. Back to you, Geoff.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nThanks Que. I couldn't agree more. Next, I'm going to turn it over to Thierry to share some additional transaction and financial information on the Diabetes separation, as well as take you through a deeper look at our Q4 financial performance and our guidance for the coming year. But before I do that, I want to officially welcome Thierry to his first earnings call with Medtronic. He's now in his 12th week and has already hit the ground running, including playing a critical role in preparing for today's announcement.\nThierry is a proven, experienced CFO, having most recently been in the automotive industry where he created significant value for shareholders by increasing margins, earnings power, and free cash flow. His extensive experience with M&A divestitures and forming innovative partnerships is proving to be highly relevant to work here at Medtronic.\nHis presence is already having a significant impact on our organization. He's brought forward many new ideas on how we can further invest in innovation, accelerating R&D while also driving operating leverage, and he brings with it the expertise to ensure we get it done. It's great having you on board, Thierry.\n\nThierry Piéton\n\nEVP and CFO, Medtronic\n\nThank you for the warm welcome, Geoff. This is certainly an exciting time to join Medtronic. I've had the pleasure of visiting many of our facilities, meeting our employees, and also starting to meet with many of you in the investment community. A common question from many of you has been why did I come to Medtronic?\nFor me, health care is a special industry given the connections to patients, and I've always wanted to return since working in health care earlier in my career. In addition to this sector, there were two specific things that stood out about Medtronic. First, I saw an opportunity to apply my background to enhance the operations of the company. Second, Medtronic has a few large, exciting growth opportunities that don't come around very often, and the company is at an inflection point.\nI'm energized by the opportunities for durable growth and value creation that are ahead of us, and I'm really looking forward to hopefully making a difference here.\nNow let's cover our plan to separate the Diabetes business, which represented about 8% of our revenue and 4% of our segment operating profit in fiscal year 2025. We intend to separate Diabetes through a series of capital market transactions. Our preferred path involves two steps. First, we plan to execute an IPO of up to 20% of the Diabetes business.\nThe proceeds are expected to appropriately capitalize the New Diabetes Company and provide the ability to retire Medtronic shares. Second, we intend to execute a spin off where Medtronic will exchange our remaining New Diabetes Company shares for Medtronic shares from willing shareholders. We plan to retire those shares resulting in a lower Medtronic share count.\nWe're targeting completion of the entire separation within 18 months, and taking this preferred path should result in a tax-free impact to Medtronic shareholders for US federal income tax purposes. From a financial standpoint, there are several benefits to Medtronic. Diabetes has lower gross margins and operating margins than overall Medtronic.\nSo upon full separation, we're expecting our adjusted gross and operating margins to improve by approximately 50 and 100 basis points, respectively. Given the share retirement, this separation is expected to be immediately accretive to Medtronic EPS upon completion. We don't expect any change to our dividend policy.\nSo financially there are some clear short term financial benefits. But the most important aspect is what Geoff mentioned earlier. This separation will allow us to increase our growth accretive investments in our core businesses where margins are structurally higher. This is all about capital allocation and creating the conditions to fuel our future growth.\nSo clearly this separation will be beneficial for both Medtronic and the New Diabetes Company, unlocking both strategic value and shareholder value. With that, let's now come back to Medtronic overall and recap our Q4 results. As Geoff mentioned earlier, Q4 revenue of $8.9 billion grew 5.4% organic.\nOn the bottom line, adjusted EPS was $1.62 up 11%. Both revenue and EPS were ahead of expectations driven by outperformances in CRM, Structural Heart and Aortic, Diabetes, and Neuromod among others, along with better than expected interest and tax expenses.\nOur revenue growth was broad-based from a geographic perspective. We grew 5% in the US, our strongest quarterly US growth in 15 quarters. As we accelerated on the strength of new technology, Japan grew high single-digits and Western Europe and emerging markets grew mid single-digits with strength in India, Southeast Asia, and Eastern Europe. Moving down the P&L, our adjusted gross margin was 65.1%, down 70 basis points year-over-year as a result of mix from diabetes and CAS as well as foreign exc\nhange. Our gross margin was actually unchanged on a constant currency basis. On the positive side, we continue to see the benefit of increased pricing, in particular in areas where we introduced new products such as Neuromod, CRM, and Structural Heart. We continue to improve our ability to offset FX with price in emerging markets this quarter.\nAgain, the savings from our COGS efficiency programs more than offset the impact of inflation. Our Medtronic Performance System, which we implemented across our manufacturing network, resulted in high single-digit improvement in labor efficiency. We insourced three of our distribution centers to drive cost savings and further improve supply. Finally, we were able to significantly reduce our scrap and obsolescence charges.\nWith SG&A we drove significant leverage, particularly with G&A, while at the same time increasing investment in R&D. More to come on that later. The net of this was leverage on our adjusted profit line, which grew 7.6% or $175 million. Our adjusted operating margin was 27.8%, an increase of 90 basis points or 200 basis points on a constant currency basis below the operating profit line.\nOur adjusted tax rate of 16% was better than expected due to favorability in our actual jurisdictional mix of profits for the year, which also resulted in a modest pickup from prior quarters. All in all, as stated in Q4, we delivered EPS of $1.62, up 11% and 16% at constant currency. This was a strong close to the year, where in fiscal year 2025 we grew revenue 5% organic and EPS 6% or 10% on a constant currency basis.\nFrom a capital allocation perspective, we returned $6.3 billion to shareholders in 2025 through share repurchases and through our dividend. This morning we announced that we're increasing our dividend for the 48th consecutive year.\nNow let's move to our 2026 guidance. We've now delivered mid single-digit organic revenue growth for 10 quarters in a row, and we expect this to continue through fiscal year 2026 with an increasing contribution from our key growth drivers. We expect organic revenue growth of approximately 5% in fiscal year 2026 including 4.5% to 5% growth in Q1.\nBased on recent FX rates, we would expect a tailwind from FX of $0 to 100 million in the total year with a roughly neutral impact in Q1. Moving down the P&L, I'll first talk about our underlying business excluding the impact of tariffs like we saw in the Q4. We expect continued mix headwinds within gross margin from CAS and Diabetes with an increasing impact from Diabetes.\nAs we are early in the manufacturing ramp of the Simplera sensor, we will continue to drive pricing discipline, in particular on the back of new product introduction, and to cover FX. We will also accelerate our COGS efficiency programs to significantly outpace inflation. Given my background, this will be a key area of focus for me together with our businesses, Greg Smith, and our global supply chain team.\nIn fiscal year 2026 we will significantly increase investment in our growth drivers to maximize future growth. For the first time in four years, we're planning to grow R&D faster than revenue. We will also invest in sales and marketing.\nThese investments will be deliberately focused on areas like Cardiac Ablation, as well as in Surgical Robotics and RDN in as we prepare for scaling the US launches of our Hugo robot and Symplicity hypertension procedure. On the flip side, we do expect to drive significant leverage with G&A expenses. The net of this will be an operating profit line that grows materially faster than revenue.\nBelow our profit line, we're expecting increases in both interest and tax expense, which combined results in a 300 basis points impact on EPS growth from the interest. This is driven by the fact that any debt we refinance will likely be at higher rates given the current higher interest environment, whereas the pressure on the tax side derives primarily from the effects of Pillar Two.\nThis leads to our expectation for approximately 4% EPS growth in fiscal year 2026 excluding the impact of tariffs, and foreign exchange is a neutral impact to fiscal 2026 at recent rates. For Q1, we would expect EPS in the range of $1.22 to 1.24, which includes minimal expected impact from tariffs and a 1% to 2% headwind from foreign exchange at recent rates. Next, I'll share with you our thinking on tariffs, which we laid out in our earnings presentation this morning.\nWe built our expectations based on two potential scenarios. The low end of the potential impact assumes that the current bilateral US-China tariffs that are in place during the 90-day pause remain throughout fiscal year 2026, while the high end assumes that they resume at the higher levels.\nFollowing the 90-day pause through focused efforts from teams across Medtronic, we already have visibility to offsetting a good portion of this headwind, and we have high confidence in our ability to execute additional mitigation efforts.\nAs a result, we forecast the net tariff impact to COGS in fiscal year 2026 of approximately $200 to 350 million. From a quarterly breakout, we would expect minimal impact in Q1, as I mentioned earlier, and then approximately 10% in the Q2 and approximately 30% and 60% in Q3 and Q4, respectively.\nAll that said, it's highly likely that the impact from tariffs will change, and we'll keep you updated periodically as we go through the year.\nSo, combining our underlying performance with our current tariffs expectations, we would have you model fiscal year 2026 EPS in the range of $5.50 to 5.60. We've shown you that we can deliver high single-digit EPS growth as we did with the 9% growth in the back half of fiscal year 2025.\nAs we look beyond next year to fiscal year 2027, we expect to return to high single-digit EPS growth upon the Diabetes separation, driven by several factors including strong revenue growth and further underpinned by FX tailwind at recent rates and the margin and share retirement benefits of the separation. Geoff, back to you.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nOkay, thank you, Thierry. Now, before we go to Q&A, I'll make a few closing remarks starting with that we had a strong close to the fiscal year with two and a half years of mid-single-digit revenue growth that is now also translating into strong operating profit and EPS leverage. We have durable growth drivers that are taking hold, and we also have clear line of sight to improving growth drivers in other businesses.\nFor example, Peripheral Vascular, where we're working with Contego Medical in the carotid market, and we will soon enter the peripheral thrombectomy segment as well. In Pelvic Health, we are working to open a large new market when our revolutionary Tibial stimulation device is approved. As for Hugo, procedures and utilization are growing, and the cadence of key milestones is accelerating.\nWe're also working aggressively to manage external factors that are impacting our 2026 guide, and as Thierry pointed out, we'll be back to high single-digit EPS growth in 2027. As I assess the overall business, the underlying fundamentals are strong, and they are getting stronger. We've been working on a number of changes to the company, and those changes are making a difference. We streamlined the operating model and implemented performance-driven incentives.\nWe brought in outside leadership with accretive skill sets, which are enhancing execution and improving operating rigor. We prioritized investments in groundbreaking innovation that are now paying off and accelerating company growth. We centralized global operations, supply chain, and quality, resulting in improved KPIs. We're adding a performance culture to this mission-minded company and transforming our portfolio.\nToday's Diabetes announcement accelerates our speed of travel to higher profitable growth aligned around our core strengths, giving all of our stakeholders increased conviction in our ability to deliver. I want to thank our employees around the world who are listening today. You've truly embraced our AND culture, our culture of driving both our Medtronic mission and performance.\nThis is directly leading to our strong financial outperformance, and it's making a difference for the millions of people around the world that depend on Medtronic to alleviate pain, restore health, and extend life. We've made a lot of progress this past year, and your efforts have laid the groundwork for the inflection point that we're now entering. I couldn't be more excited about what we're going to accomplish here in the new fiscal year. Thank you for your dedication and service.\nFinally, as you may have seen in our earnings press release this morning, Sean Salmon is moving on and this will be his last earnings call with us. After more than 20 years of service to Medtronic, Sean has been responsible for leading a number of our successes. He leaves a legacy of having developed strong, capable leaders in our Cardiovascular businesses as well as a robust technology pipeline, both of which are responsible for driving the CV growth acceleration you saw this quarter.\nSean departs with our cardiovascular portfolio in a leading position to lead CV going forward. We're promoting Skip Kiil. You've seen Skip's impact in driving above market growth in our Cranial and Spinal Technologies business and he had success in other parts of Medtech prior to joining Medtronic.\nSkip will augment our deep CV leadership team with his strategic mindset, broad global expertise, strong customer focus, and demonstrated track record of developing new markets and driving commercial success. I want to thank Sean for his service, and we're looking forward to Skip leading our continued success in cardiovascular.\nSo with that, let's move to Q&A where we're going to try to get to as many analysts as possible. We ask that you limit yourself to just one question and only if needed, a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, you can reach out to Ryan and the investor relations team after the call, Wynne. Can you please give the instructions for asking a question?\n\nOperator\n\nFor the sell-side analysts that would like to ask a question, please select the Participants button and click Raise Hand. If you're using the mobile app, press the More button and select Raise Hand. Your lines are currently on mute, and when called upon, you'll receive a request to unmute your line, which you must respond to before asking your question.\nLastly, please be advised that this Q&A session is being recorded. For today's session, Geoff, Thierry, and Ryan are joined by Que Dallara, EVP and President of Diabetes, Mike Marinaro, EVP and President of the Medical Surgical Portfolio, Sean Salmon, EVP, President of the Cardiovascular Portfolio, and Brett Wall, EVP, President of the Neuroscience Portfolio. We'll pause for a few seconds to assemble the queue.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nFirst of all, good question, as Danielle pointed out, and I will take the first part of it and then hand it to Thierry to go through the earnings stuff. But on the growth side, look, we're very bullish on the growth drivers.\nEven in the markets that we're in and the growth drivers that we have. Even in Q4, our markets grew 7% even without diabetes. We've got strong positions in these markets and we see growth from our big three portfolios to be mid single and then some. We're running the company at higher expectations than we're guiding here.\nJust some examples. I mean, you see our CV business accelerating to 8% with nearly 30% growth in CAS, which, that alone, added 70 basis points to the company growth, and that's without Ardian. It'll start ramping through 2026. You got neuroscience with double-digit growth in Neurmod and CST.\nWhat can I say? It's just separating itself from the pack. We've got Tibial coming in, Pelvic Health, and so we've got some growth drivers there. Of course in surgical, Hugo, as we talked about the commentary, building momentum, and we'll start to have more of a meaningful impact on Med Surg next year and then beyond that on the company.\nWe're bullish about the markets that we're in, the positions we have in those markets, and our growth potential. That's what's baked into next year's guide and going into 2027. I mean, we're at the early stages of these growth drivers with more to come on the earnings. I'll turn it over to Thierry. Anything else going out on the growth?\n\nThierry Piéton\n\nEVP and CFO, Medtronic\n\nNo thanks. I think Geoff, you were pretty complete on the growth. We feel comfortable that we've got a good opportunity from a growth perspective. From a profitability standpoint, what the construct has, as you may have seen in the details that we've given in the commentary, is actually still getting quite a bit of leverage before tariffs at the operating profit level. We've got a construct that has operating profit that's growing around 7%, so significantly in excess of revenue.\nThat's despite.aking a significant investment for the future of the business here. I mentioned it in the commentary, for the first time in four years, we actually have a plan that has R&D growing quicker than revenue, and that's even with revenue up 5%. Our R&D spend should be increasing around $200 million next year, which is about 7% versus the 5% growth rate.\nDespite that, you know, we have significant leverage at the all profit level. Then to your point, we've got a couple of pressure points below the line. You know, one is around the tax rate, and that's primarily driven by Pillar Two. Our tax rate should go from about 16.7% this year to about 18% next year. Then as we refinance our debt in a higher interest rate type of environment, that also puts some pressure.\nSo we lose about 300 basis points between the profit level and the net. You know, on the opportunity to do better. Hey, look, we're, you know, first of all, operationally we're as usual going to drive the teams to a higher number than this.\nWhether it's from a growth perspective or from a margin standpoint. You know, on the margin side, you know, given my background, this is going to be a key area of focus for me, and my initial view is that there is some opportunity from a cost perspective. I think the supply chain team with Greg has kicked off a lot of very positive initiatives, and we're starting to see the results, and I think there's more to come.\nSo I'll be focusing on that deeply, and then on the below the line items, sure on the tax front, we'll keep working it. Some of the increase between 2025 and 2026 is due to the temporary safe harbors that we've got in Pillar Two.\nThere is uncertainty in terms of our ability to qualify for some of those safe harbors going into next year, and we'll do everything we can to secure, you know, being able to capture that opportunity. Sure, we'll be working on it. Look, we tried to give a guidance that's all in, and we'll work from there.\nYou also had a part of the question on 2027. Sorry, I wanted to address the 27th part of the question. Hey, look, as Geoff mentioned, you know, the growth is not, you know, a one-off thing in 2025 or in Q4 2025. It's going to carry into 2026 and some of the new products that you know are carrying this are going to carry us well into 2027.\nSo you know, Geoff mentioned CAS, Ardian, and tibial that will start having a small impact towards the end of 2026 and will carry into 2027. You know, first we expect to continue to have good growth into 2027 and that's regardless of the separation of the Diabetes business.\nJust to give you some clarity on that, you know, Diabetes drives about 40 basis points of our growth, so we're comfortable we could still achieve the mid single-digit growth even after the Diabetes separation. We'll continue to drive the cost out initiatives. As I mentioned earlier, effects should start turning into a small, you know, a headwind toward the end of 2026 and into 2027.\nThe last item I wanted to mention is, you know, we'll probably talk about it more in detail in the rest of the conversation, but the deal that we're the structure that we're taking on the Diabetes deal actually provides us the opportunity to retire some shares. This will be immediately accretive to our EPS and help strengthen the construction to get back to high single-digit growth into 2027.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nI just want clarification on the FX flips to a tailwind.\n\nThierry Piéton\n\nEVP and CFO, Medtronic\n\nOh, did I say headwind? Yeah, sorry, tailwind. Sorry.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYou got tax on your mind, that's headwind. But FX flips to a tailwind.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nIts the 7%.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThanks for the question, Travis. Go ahead.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nI was going to ask, is the 7% operating profit including or excluding tariffs? Is there an extra week this year? Then, why is there a diabetes EPS headwind this year if it's 18 months away? Those are just a few quickies.\n\nThierry Piéton\n\nEVP and CFO, Medtronic\n\nSo, yeah the 7% is excluding the impact of tariffs. The impact of tariffs, again, as you probably saw in the commentary, it's $200 to 350 million of cost at the cost of goods sold level. From an impact on the op profit growth, I guess it's something between 2.2 and 3.2 points depending on the outcome on China, and then the pressure on Diabetes. I think it's primarily driven by the rollout of Simplera.\nIt's the launch of this product and as we grow it, the cost is going to go down, but initially it does put, you know, quite a bit of pressure on our margin rate to the tune of about 60 basis points at the GM level, which will translate into the earnings, and again, that will get better as the manufacturing ramps up.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nHelpful. Thanks a lot.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nOkay, thanks, Travis. Let's take the next question, please. Wynne,\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take the next question from Robbie Marcus at JPMorgan.\n\n[Company Representative] (JPMorgan)\n\nCompany Representative, JPMorgan\n\nOh, great. Good morning, everyone, and Thierry, welcome. Maybe question for you, and I'll just have one.\nYou said you'll be back to high single-digit EPS growth in fiscal year 2027. That's with assuming currency remains the same and favorable, and you execute the diabetes spin and resulting share buyback, which aren't really quite sustainable in nature. Without those benefits, which are kind of one-time, would fiscal 2027 EPS still grow high single-digits? Thanks.\n\nThierry Piéton\n\nEVP and CFO, Medtronic\n\nHey, look, you know, I want to insist on the fundamentals here. You know, I think the first thing to look at if you think about the construction for 2027, is to come back to the performance that we're showing for Q4 here and for the second half of the year.\nThis is with no FX tailwind and with diabetes in the portfolio. We just delivered a quarter that's up 5.4% organically on revenue. That has operating margin up 90 basis points, which is 200 basis points. If you actually exclude FX, and we've got EPS, that's up 11%, which is really 15.8%, if you exclude EPS. That earnings growth is actually 9% in the second half of the year.\nYou know, that's the fundamentals of the business that we're trying to build on. Now back to 2027. As I said, you know, we were looking at a growth rate that should continue to be positive. With all the momentum that Geoff mentioned, we're going to continue driving the leverage on the cost side. Here you see some signs of improvement that are pretty significant from an operating profit perspective.\nWe're going to continue to work on that. You know, FX, we're just assuming that it's flat, so we're not assuming that it improves. The tailwind that I mentioned on 2027 is just the effect of the carryover of the goodness that, you know, we'll have based on the current FX rate. Then you're right, there should be some accretion that comes from diabetes from the separation, and that's going to help. But the target that we have for the teams is to deliver on the framework regardless of the transaction.\n\n[Company Representative] (JPMorgan)\n\nCompany Representative, JPMorgan\n\nGreat, thanks, Thierry. Appreciate it.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThank you. Robbie, take the next question, please. Wynne.\n\nQue Dallara\n\nEVP and President of Diabetes Operating Unit, Medtronic\n\nWe'll take the next question from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.\n\n[Company Representative] (Wells Fargo)\n\nCompany Representative, Wells Fargo\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question. So, Geoff, I wanted to focus on the decision to spin diabetes. I guess a couple questions. One, did you consider, you know, breaking Medtronic up into four separate businesses? One could argue that the remaining three businesses scale on their own and have different customers and capital allocation requirements.\nWhy not go further in breaking up the company? Yu know, the pushback, you know, you think you're going to get on diabetes is that it's growing above Medtronic's corporate average, you know, so why spin it off if your focus is on accelerating top line growth? Thank you.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nWell, look, yeah, good question, you know, Larry, like why diabetes? Why now? You know, so first of all, you know, on the Diabetes business, like I said earlier, we believe this is a win-win for both diabetes and Medtronic. On diabetes, we're well down the path of the turnaround. It's ready to stand alone, and we think it's well suited for the public markets.\nThis move is going to ensure that they get really both the funding and the focus the franchise needs to reach its full potential. As much as we're sitting here, much progress as we've made, talk about six quarters in a row, double-digits. There's more to come here. The product pipeline is very robust. We submitted several filings to the FDA for approvals on multiple products here in the last couple months.\nYou know, we believe with this focus and funding, you know, the business will, you know, be a top tier diabetes franchise well into the future. Then for Medtronic, though, it allows us to, you know, focus more on our high margin growth drivers that we just, you know, walk through. Like I just mentioned, you know, we're even without diabetes. We're in great markets, 7% growth last quarter.\nStable. These are higher margin sectors for us. This accelerates our speed of travel to these high margin growth areas. It's aligned around our core strengths of the company, not technology strengths, as well as our go to market channel to healthcare systems. We think it's a win-win. It's going to create shareholder value short- and long-term. Thierry walked through the accretive nature of the deal, accretive to our EPS, operating margin, and gross margin.\nI think, I don't want to speculate, but I think the diabetes business is probably worth more outside the company than in. Back to Robbie's point, yes, it'll provide a kind of a one-time step up in margins. The whole idea to Thierry's point is that we're growing them from there and getting to that.\nYou know, you saw a little bit of that in the last two quarters, and we're going to continue to do that once we get through some of these below the line issues. You know, that's it. The rest of the company we believe, I said, are, you're right, they do have scale. We think it's better together. There's a lot of synergies, and we've got really robust growth drivers across all three of those, those portfolios of businesses.\n\n[Company Representative] (Wells Fargo)\n\nCompany Representative, Wells Fargo\n\nAll right, thanks so much.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThank you, Larry. Next question, please. Wynne.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take the next question from Vijay Kumar from Evercore.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director of Equity Research, Evercore",
    "content2": "Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Geoff and Thierry, maybe one sort of on the earnings and margins kind of question. You look at the guidance, a 4% EPS growth ex tariff rate Q1. I think it's implied as like flattish earnings growth. Why is earnings growth back-end loaded? Is this a mix impact on margins? I think Q4 gross margins came in below. Was it a product mix issue? Geoff, sort of. When you look at that earnings algorithm, can you commit to EPS growing above revenues irrespective of the FX environment? Thank you.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nSure. Thierry, you want to take the first part there?\n\nThierry Piéton\n\nEVP and CFO, Medtronic\n\nSure. Look, I think the question is why is the construction back-end loaded? I think, in Q1, a couple of things. I would say first, it's always a bit lower from a revenue perspective than Q4 and the rest of the year. That generates lower absorption from the factories, etc.\nWe typically have a dip between Q1 and the rest of the year. The second element, which I think is important this year, is as I mentioned previously, we're investing in the growth areas both in R&D for cardiovascular, for CAS, for Ardian, and also in sales and marketing to make sure that we capture the opportunities of growth that are provided by these areas. In Q4 what you're going to see is a bit of that investment ahead of the return from a growth perspective.\nThe growth in Q4 is slightly lower than the average of the year. We're looking at roughly 4.5% growth versus the 5% on the full year. We're invested ahead and investing ahead, and we'll reap the benefits of that toward the second half. The final element is there's a little bit of FX headwind into the first quarter that will turn into a tailwind toward the rest of the year. That kind of explains why we have better performance toward the back end.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYour question on the leveraged P&L leveraged EPS growth regardless of FX, I think that was your question. First, just getting to Thierry's point, just one more point is I don't think it's as back-end loaded as last year. We did end up hitting. I remember a year ago we put out guidance that had the back half of the year growing quite a bit, and there was some skepticism from the call.\nWe did end up hitting on the higher end of that guidance across the board. I just want to point that out. But to your other more strategic question, the answer is yes, FX over the years, as you guys always dogged us a bit.\nYes, we believe, and the economists that we're talking to, which is quite a many is that, the FX is going to be a tailwind for us for the next couple of years. That being said, what we're doing here underlying in the operations of the company is creating natural hedges, lowering our exposure to FX through a number of different areas, including something we've already really made a lot of progress on is dynamic pricing in countries that are serial.\nWhere the currencies are devaluing on a consistent basis. That has had a pretty, a fairly meaningful impact, positive impact for us. But in addition to that and expanding that to other countries around the world, paying our teams on kind of actual FX basis, we are making some structural changes that just lower our overall exposure to FX. Then you combine it with our hedging program. I think it's a good formula, but we're putting in place natural hedges.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director of Equity Research, Evercore\n\nSo the answer is yes.\n\nThierry Piéton\n\nEVP and CFO, Medtronic\n\nI just wanted to give some incremental color, maybe to give visibility on the gross margin side, you know, what we're seeing in Q4 and what we'll see for a part of 2026 is really two things that are offsetting each other. We do have a negative impact coming from mix, and that's about 80 basis points. It's a combination of CAS and diabetes. That mix impact is, you know, is offset by the progress that we're making from a pricing and from a cost standpoint, right.\nThe progress we're making on pricing and cost, you know, that's going to carry forward and I'm going to be focusing on what I can do to help accelerate that. The mix effect on CAS and diabetes. Look, the diabetes part, I guess, will be addressed through the portfolio move that we're making, it's not why we're doing it, but it will help.\nThe CAS impact on mix actually translates into good news at the operating profit level, number one. Number two, some of it is driven by the fact that right now a lot of the growth is done on the capital equipment sales. We're shipping capital equipment first and the catheters will come after.\nSo the fact that the mix within CAS is towards the capital equipment is actually good news for the future because as we increase the catheter sales, that's going to alleviate a big portion of that mix effect. The dynamic you should see is the mix getting better and the cost initiatives hopefully accelerating. I hope that gives some additional color on why we should be able to continue to leverage.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director of Equity Research, Evercore\n\nVery helpful. Thank you.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThank you, Vijay. Next question, Wynne.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take the next question from Joanne Wuensch from Citi.\n\nJoanne Wuensch\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nGood morning and congratulations on all the news this morning. I want to pivot here a little bit to products, and I was curious about your commentary regarding the preparation that you're seeing hospitals do for renal denervation and reimbursement. If you could just sort of share a little bit more about what you're seeing, that would be fabulous. Thank you.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nSure. Maybe I'll call on Sean for that one.\n\nSean Salmon\n\nEVP and President of Cardiovascular Portfolio, Medtronic\n\nYeah, certainly, Joanne, thanks for the question. As you imagine, our focus has been about opening centers that are getting ready to take on this new service line. That involves making sure that we train physicians how to do the procedure, of course, and educate them on coding and billing for the current fee-for-service Medicare patients.\nIn addition to that, of course, with the NCD in the frame, that's going to open up a lot of patients. Really it's about focusing as they build a service line, making sure they are able to work the patients up, rule out secondary causes of the disease, and then get them appropriately to the cath lab for renal denervation, which they perform safely.\nThere's a lot of enthusiasm, as you can imagine, from customers who are looking for new service lines to grow their practices and absorb their cath labs. It's really about that. It's training, education, and support for their programs as they build that up. Now upon getting reimbursement, there's more to do to activate patients more directly, and we will channel those patients to a physician finder in geographies where patients can then find their way to the treatment.\nAs you probably recall from the clinical trials, a large proportion of our patients were self-referred by using social media tools, so it's a very efficient way to recruit patients to the effort. But of course, we want to do that when all the reimbursement barriers come down. That's what we're hopeful for as we move forward into the NCD.\n\nJoanne Wuensch\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nThank you. If I could do a follow up. How do you think about this revenue ramping? You sort of paralleled it to PFA adoption. I just want to sort of set, you know, get expectations, set of how to think about that. Thank you.\n\nSean Salmon\n\nEVP and President of Cardiovascular Portfolio, Medtronic\n\nYeah, Joanne, I think that's a very different. PFA is replacing an incumbent procedure, this faster, safer procedure that appears to have just excellent efficacy. It's really a pretty easy switch. It's not so difficult to train on our tools and techniques for that. This is a little bit more involved, of course, because there are other reasons why people have high blood pressure.\nYou have to sort those causes out to get patients into the service line. It's a longer ramp, but it's a long annuity. This is a massive patient population, as you know, and be able to build that practice. I think you've got to think about this as one of those really important, durable growth drivers for the company that will set us up well for a lot of success for a long time.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah. Just to build on that point, Joanne, to build on that point that Sean's making, the larger health systems around the country, I mean, not just the larger ones, but a lot of them are really proactively calling us for partnerships around hypertension.\nBuilding these clinics, a lot of them virtual, some not, and establishing these patient pathways with us jointly investing. This is going to be a big one for us for a long time. Of course, we're going to continue to invest in the innovation around this, too.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThank you, Joanne. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take the next question from Matt Taylor at Jefferies.\n\nMatt Taylor\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHi, thanks for taking the question. I was wondering actually, if you could expand on some of the pipeline ideas that you had for diabetes and about their differentiation and timelines, if you can?\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nSure. I will hand that one off to Que.\n\nQue Dallara\n\nEVP and President of Diabetes Operating Unit, Medtronic\n\nYeah, thanks for the question. If I start with our recent approval of Simplera Sync in the US. We're ramping that we're going to be launching that in a limited fashion in the fall. In Europe, that product has already launched commercially. Just to give you an idea of the volume ramp versus last year, we expect to ramp our volume at least five times what we did last year. We have not really begun to see the potential of Simplera on the business yet.\nThen we have submitted for an ACE pump with iAGC algorithm to FDA in April. We're ready to launch that, working very well with Abbott to make that happen. We're ready to launch soon after we receive clearance on that. Then so that's our CGM options. It's going to address a lot of the Achilles heel of our current CGM lineup.\nThen we also have multiple insulin options. We have InPen in market today. Our next generation durable pump. We expect to submit by the end of this fiscal year and then following the patch will follow after that. What you can see in the lineup is significant improvement to our form factor. You know, that feedback we've been given.\nThat makes it, you know, more wearable with all these pumps having phone control, which is a feature a lot of our customers have asked for. Then in addition to that, we have our third-generation closed-loop algorithm that you know, we believe will be a very exciting development in terms of burden reduction while driving the clinical outcomes that people expect from us.\nWhen you look at the total ecosystem, I would say a couple things. One, the form factors are completely upgraded. Not only that, we've completely rearchitected the software including the algorithm that drives everything. Then you can see the wearability of the entire system.\nYou know, it's not talked about in the product itself, but when you think about the burden of diabetes management, there is something very attractive in burden reduction that patients have to only deal with one company.\nEspecially when things go wrong. Our customer, our tech support, and our customer service, not just for patients, but also physicians is also a differentiator.\n\nMatt Taylor\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nGreat, thank you very much.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThanks Matt. Wynne, we have time probably for three more.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay, we'll take the next question from Matt Miksic at Barclays.\n\nMatt Miksic\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays Investment Bank\n\nHey, thanks so much for taking the question and congrats on the strong finish here. Just to make sure, you know, understand the, you know, the operating line growth, 7%.\nWith about 300 basis points getting you back to 4% EPS growth for the full year. That's inclusive of all the investments that you're talking about. That's inclusive of the sort of gross margin, headwinds around investments, and so on, just to be crystal clear. Is that right?\n\nThierry Piéton\n\nEVP and CFO, Medtronic\n\nYes, that's correct. But it's before the tariffs impact. Right. Just to be clear. Again, the tariffs about 2.2 to 3.2 points on that.\n\nMatt Miksic\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays Investment Bank\n\nRight. And so congrats on that leverage. I mean, I just take a minute to, you know, it's been, you know, difficult getting growth of EPS above sales with other headwinds and so on. Getting that operating line growing. Then on tariffs you mentioned high confidence in getting to the mitigations you've described.\nOpportunity to take those further, and then just maybe if I could drill down a bit on the spine business, just get a sense of above market performance.\nWhere if we were to sort of like for like spine growth, comparing to your pure play peers, you know, where do you see your growth? Where do you see the market? Any color you provide on that would be great as well. Thanks so much.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nSure. First of all, thanks for acknowledging the organic profit growth. We did, like I said, 8% in Q4, and the guide next year 7%. And if you take out the Diabetes, that would go 8%. We built that, we've built that muscle, and that's going to continue.\nYou know, in terms of, you know, the Spine business, again, the markets, I would say the demand is there, the markets have been stable, and technology is a differentiator here and it's pretty extreme. If you go back over the last couple of years, you're seeing a number of our competitors tap out because of the investment and expertise it takes to build out the capital equipment, the enabling technology strategy around this.\nWe've got a big lead here. Like I said in the commentary, the dynamic that we're seeing by us taking this portfolio of enabling technology and integrating the workflow. We've gone from a product story to a solution story. We branded AiBLE AI-enabled technology. As our customers are upgrading, they're upgrading from a product to a, to a broader ecosystem. It's not a linear upgrade, it's more algorithmic and that's giving us, and that is a durable advantage. We're seeing the market growth as stable and we're seeing our competitive advantage growing.\nYou've seen a bunch of our competitors tap out. Like I said, you see our probably primary competitor this quarter, you know, put up some results that, you know, we'll see where it goes from here. But there's a pretty big difference between us and them this past quarter. And we'll see where it goes from here. But we're feeling good about spine, and this is something that Brett's been, you know, highly involved with and leading along with Skip. I mean, Brett, would you like to comment on this?\n\nBrett Wall\n\nEVP and President of Neuroscience Portfolio, Medtronic\n\nYeah, sure, Geoff. You know, Matt, thanks for the question. You know, we're just seeing, as Geoff said, good stable demand, and the ecosystem is driving that. If you look at our enabling technology growth this last quarter, it remains very attractive, very strong, and we just see that stability continuing.\nIt's an attractor for not only. Customers, we're seeing large-scale, important academic centers come to Medtronic for this. We're also getting very good response from other sales reps and other individuals that want to join Medtronic. We're comfortable with how this is moving forward.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nI just think that, you know, I'm glad you asked the question, you know Matt, you know, because we talk a lot about PFA and RDN and robotics, but part of our, a key part of our growth story is the rest of the company. We talked about CST or our spine business, CRM, high single-digit quarter there.\nStrong growth from leadless conduction system pacing, EV-ICD. Again, these are durable growth drivers for us that are going to go out. And then the other thing we mentioned in the commentary, some of the slower growing parts of the company we have plans for, like peripheral vascular as we enter the carotid space with Contego and enter through an organic program into thrombectomy, taking some technology from our neurovascular business to get into that space. And then we've got things like pelvic health.\nWhich will, I think, it's going to surprise people with the growth there. Once we launch this Tibial system, we think that's going to be very disruptive, and we don't see a real answer from our competitors. The rest the growth story is pretty broad at the company. It's not just the lightning bolts of PFA and RDN. So, thanks for the question.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThanks Matt. Two more questions please. Wynne.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take the next question from Danielle Antalffy from UBS.\n\n[Company Representative] (UBS)\n\nCompany Representative, UBS\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Thanks so much for squeezing me in here and echo everyone's congrats on all the news this morning. Just a quick question to clarify on some of the commentary around PFA as a really important growth driver. I think you talked about reaching $2 billion in sales.\nSo essentially, you know, just about doubling. I'm just curious how to think about the ramp from, you know, just over $1 billion to $2 billion in that CAS business. I mean, is that something that, based on your commentary? I mean, it seems like that's more near term versus long term.\nBut anything you can add there as far as how we think about getting from that $1 to $2. I mean, one of your competitors that was first to market here or close to, I mean, you guys came to market about the same time. Sorry about that. But you know, they ramped pretty quickly, so just curious if you could give any more color there.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah, no, they did, they did. They ramped really quickly. You know, I think. We feel very good about our product portfolio here in PFA and what we're seeing right now is just an incredible demand for Affera.\nWe got to get those capital systems out there, which we're doing. You get these high volume centers, they get one and, like I said, I spent the last couple weeks. I'd say 80% of my time or so has been on PFA, just going to Heart Rhythm Society meeting and then a trip to the Northeast United States, just meeting with the leading centers.\nThe dynamic we're hearing is to get the one Affera system, and then there's fighting over that system amongst the different EPs at these systems, and now they're getting their second Affera system.\nThen the catheter sales built from that. Again, it's not a, once you get the installed base, it's not linear, and the systems are getting this technology, they're not being held back by capital constraints. And if that is an issue, we have opportunities here through contracting to eliminate that friction. Then our supply chain has really ramped. Right.\nThis was, we bought Affera, it's a super innovative technology, but then we had to spend quite a bit of time innovating the manufacturing process that wasn't really designed in with the acquisition. That's up and running, and we're scaling that, and we're really happy with that. Then you've got a nice robust demand, a robust pipeline.\nLike I said in the commentary, the only thing that's more exciting than a Sphere-9 catheter out there right now is Sphere-360, and that goes right at the heart of the competition, right at them. Then we've got PulseSelect, which is not under any kind of supply constraints, and it gives centers around the world an option and a way to blend the pricing as well.\nSo especially in the global area where the resources aren't as much, you know, you got PulseSelect, that's a very good system, high quality, very safe, and it's not priced where the Affera is. What I would say is that we strongly believe in doubling the business. We didn't put a specific timeframe on it, but it's not far off. I mean it's not far off. I'd say it's more near term.\nOver the next couple of maybe, I don't know if it'll exactly happen in the fiscal year, but we're in that ballpark and really excited about it.\n\n[Company Representative] (UBS)\n\nCompany Representative, UBS\n\nThat's so helpful. Thanks so much.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThank you. Danielle, let's take the last question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from Shagun Singh at RBC.\n\nShagun Singh\n\nMedical Technology Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thank you so much. A couple of follow-ups on the CAS business. You know, impressive growth. Can you talk about the mix of cryo? It seems like it's becoming less and less of a headwind. Any color on pricing there, and then on RDN? Any updated thoughts on what patient subset you think you could get coverage for? Thank you for taking the questions.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nSean, do you want to take the first one?\n\nSean Salmon\n\nEVP and President of Cardiovascular Portfolio, Medtronic\n\nSure thing. So, first of all, on CAS, cryo will become less and less part of the mix, but I think that rate of decline will slow and then that will really aid in the growth of that business going forward. It's still a really valued tool, and particularly in places that don't use general anesthesia and are more cost-constrained. It really is holding up very, very well.\nSo I think it hits kind of a nadir and will stay there and then we'll have growth on top of that. With regard to your question on what we're expecting for coverage or the population of patients, I think what I'd just say is I will front-run the CMS decision makers here, but what we've been presenting to them is what is the evidence and what are the guidelines in professional society saying?\nYou know, those really track pretty closely. To meet the standard of reasonable and necessary for CMS, I think it's going to be very close to what we, what we've studied and what's being recommended by the guidelines.\nThat would be patients that both aren't able to control their blood pressure despite lifestyle medications, but also those patients that are unable to take medications due to side effects and such. I think relatively broad. We'll find out soon enough in July. But I think just following that evidence, an expert opinion, and the commentary that was collected in the public commentary period will lead to that decision.\n\nShagun Singh\n\nMedical Technology Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGot it. If I could just squeeze in one last one, just your strategy around portfolio management. I think, Geoff, at some point you had indicated that you are committed to areas where you can build an ecosystem and Diabetes was one of those areas. You know, you're now looking to separate that. Just how should we think about your portfolio management strategy going forward? Thank you for taking the questions.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nSure. I mean, look, we've been, as I said before, it's a continuous process. We've been at it, we're going to stay at it. Diabetes isn't an end. You know, we exited ventilation for different reasons. We exited ventilation, we exited our heart, our LVAD business. We exited dialysis, and now diabetes. It really comes down to, you know, where do we have these secular growth opportunities, along with a financial profile.\nLike higher margins that works for us, where we have core strengths and those four, they're different degrees, but I think there's other stuff inside the company that is a higher degree of higher margin growth and aligned around our core synergies and capabilities, and that's what's really driving it. We like where we are like I mentioned before, we're in high-growth markets, but we'll continue looking at the portfolio. I want this to be both additions and subtractions. We want to do more deals. I think the fundamentals of the company are the best I've seen them in my nearly 14 years here.\nSo we are, you know, the markets that we're in, the technology that we have, our operational, how we're executing operationally, and we're at a point now where I would like to turn up the heat on some tuck-in M&A to support these strong market positions. That's part of the portfolio piece. Then on the divestiture side, I just talk through that, and it's an ongoing process. On that note, just seeing some of the chatter back and forth here on the Diabetes deal, I do want to clarify the mechanics of it a bit and how this transaction will work, because it is. It is unique and has unique benefits for Medtronic. So, Thierry, could you just hit on that?\n\nThierry Piéton\n\nEVP and CFO, Medtronic\n\nSure, yeah. Thanks, Geoff. So, look, the preferred path that we've laid out really has two steps. The first step is we do an IPO of up to 20% of the shares of the New Diabetes Company.\nWhat that does is it enables us to raise capital to make sure that the New Diabetes Company is fully capitalized. Those proceeds will also cover the costs that are relative to executing the deal overall. It will, you know, in our projections, it will enable potentially to have some of the proceeds go to Medtronic to potentially apply our capital allocation typical policy.\nIt provides an opportunity to do a buyback in the first phase. Then there's a second phase which should occur, I guess, roughly six months after the first phase. In that second phase, we do a split. What that means is, we, post the lockup period, give an opportunity for Medtronic shareholders, some of which will have entered the stock, to participate to the split.\nWe give them the option either to keep a Medtronic stock or to swap for stock in the shares in the New Diabetes Companies. The result of that is that it will reduce the share count of Medtronic on a permanent basis. This is the accretive effect that it will have on EPS. It's not a one-off buyback, I want to be clear, it's a permanent retirement of the shares corresponding to something probably around 80% of the shares of the New Diabetes Company.\nAll this should be a tax-free transaction for US Federal income taxes, and the goal is to get everything done within the next 18 months, which means that we will fully consolidate the diabetes business through 2026 and see the impacts of the deconsolidation and the EPS accretion primarily in 2027.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nRight. That one-time EPS bump, we're not looking at that. We see it for what it is. It's a one-time bump, and we're going to apply our algorithm on top of that and grow that EPS year-over-year like we talked about as part of our algorithm. Then additionally, the other benefit it does reduce with the retired shares does reduce the cash burden on the dividend liability.\nSo that's another benefit of it. It's a unique structure, it's a unique deal, it's a unique structure, and that's why I say it's a, it's a win-win. With that, you know, look, sorry for the little technical challenge at the beginning of the call. Thanks for your patience on that. Thanks for going the extra half hour plus and all the great questions and engagement.\nI'm sure there'll be a lot of conversation throughout the day. We, there's a lot of, lot of news, a lot of good news. I think we're, like I said, I'm as excited about the setup as I've ever been and we're at the early stages of it.\nSo thanks for all the questions and to all of us who joined today, we appreciate your support and the continued interest in Medtronic, and we'll hope that you'll join our Q1 earnings broadcast which we anticipate holding on Tuesday, 19 August, where we'll continue to update you on all the progress here. With that, thanks for spending time with us today and have a great rest of your day."

The way it works with being assessed for DBS is they're looking for patients who respond well to levodopa, the drug, and I think people who don't have memory difficulties. So when I went over there for assessment and came off all medication, which was the first time in 15 years I was medicated free, that was a real shock, seeing me in my default position, most natural, where I was immobile, could hardly walk. And you're taken into a video studio where you're filmed, doing a number of standard Parkinson's tasks, and then the consultant came back and says, \"You're eligible for it.\" Thinking back to it, I would have been really gutted and disappointed if they said no, because by that stage I'd really bought into the idea of DBS.\nIt was only a month after that that I was taken in for surgery. When I met the consultant surgeon, what she explained was this new device. It sensed brainwaves, and this device will measure the brainwaves that will then be used by the clinicians to tailor the strength of the current going into the brain. It felt like a modern piece of equipment, and I thought, Well, let's go with that. It feels good to have the best technology there is out there. I came out of the hospital after two days, and I was up at the rugby club watching my boy train. The recovery was extremely quick. I mean, we're talking two weeks, and the sutures were taken out here, here, and here. You could hardly see anything. I had a month, then post-op recovery, and then I went in for the switch-on.\nIt's quite nervous going in because you think, all this surgery, is it going to work? And it was incredible. Within half an hour or so, they had me walking up and down the corridor, and it was like I didn't have Parkinson's. I was just walking normally. I wasn't falling to the side as such. I wasn't limping. And it was just incredible. Absolutely amazing. Once I was switched on, I then returned a month later. But before doing that, a week in advance of returning, there's a function on the device, the handheld device that you're given that controls the current, that it also records events and records the brainwaves, so that once that data is captured, the specialist will see the data.\nThey had this nifty software which showed graphs, it showed data, it showed the brainwaves, and all that information was used to achieve the right programming. I think the biggest impact this had is, obviously, my movement is much better, but because of that, I feel a lot more confident. Sport and fishing, it means I can keep going and do more of it, and Harriet's becoming a fishing widow. Before DBS, my sons would see me around the house shuffling away, and they'd say, Oh, Daddy's got like a choo-choo train. They haven't said that for a long time now because it stops.\nThey were obviously worried about me having the brain surgery, as you can imagine, but for them, they've seen the impact this had on our lives, not just my life, but on our lives, and I've got more energy to spend time with them playing sport and doing things that we all enjoy. It's taken years off me in terms of my symptoms, and that feels really good. It's like being made younger.\n\n[Unknown Speaker 2]\n\nUnknown Speaker 2\n\nLive life with fewer interruptions with the MiniMed 780G system, now with the Simplera Sync sensor. Simplera Sync is an all-in-one sensor. Insertion takes less than 10 seconds, so you can keep moving. It's the only system with a meal detection feature. If you occasionally forget to enter a meal dose or undercount carbs, it automatically adjusts insulin delivery and corrects glucose levels every five minutes, so you can be more spontaneous, even at mealtimes. Improve your A1C and know that you're covered day and night with an automated system doing the work for you. More automation, more time and range, more spontaneity, more doing what you love. Live life with fewer interruptions with the MiniMed 780G system, now with the Simplera Sync sensor.\nIt seems like with my life, I always had to go to the bathroom a lot, but it was manageable. Now that frequency was becoming a problem, and not only am I going a lot, I got to go like that. From a mental standpoint, I'm constantly worried because, once again, you're trying to hide it. So I didn't venture out to places like that if I wasn't sure what the bathroom facilities were going to be like. I first heard of InterStim from the urologist's office that I attended, and that doctor said, I think you'd be a good candidate for this device. We had a long conversation about what it would do, how it would work, and the fact that we could do a trial period, an evaluation, and see if it would work.\nIt was in the doctor's office, wasn't in the hospital. You're awake, but you're not in any pain because they need to be able to see and tell what you're feeling and where you're feeling it. In my layman's terms, my nerve is being stimulated so that my brain and my bladder will communicate at the right time to tell me when I need to go to the bathroom. The cumbersome part was for the week or 10 days that you had it because everything is pretty much outside your body. For that time frame, you cannot be active. But I understand now why it had to be that way, and I understand why it was so important to have that test period because that really was the catalyst of whether or not you were going to be a good candidate for it.\nThe first two to three days of the test period, it was like night and day. Whoa, you know, no more 20 times a day going to the bathroom. He was ecstatic. Wow, you're an excellent candidate. That led to getting the full-blown device, and that made me even more excited because when he explained those first three days, that's pretty much what your life would be like. I was like, Oh, that's what it's going to be like. I'm in. So now that I have this thing, this therapy, this Medtronic InterStim device, I could probably sum it up in the word freedom.\nI like to read. I love music. I love dancing. And if I'm walking, which I also enjoy doing, I find trails. There's a lot of great trails in the area where I can go walk. And traveling is also something I love, especially road trips. I love a good road trip.\nIf I could talk to the person or persons that developed this therapy that has allowed me to fully live my life in such a free way now, they would get the biggest hug. I give them my heart because without being able to have this therapy, I think I would stay home a whole lot more, and I would not be able to be that adventurous soul that I know is inside.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nGood morning. I'm Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President and Head of Medtronic Investor Relations, and I appreciate that you're joining us for our Fiscal 2025 Third Quarter Video Earnings webcast. Before we go inside to hear our prepared remarks, I'll share a few details about today's webcast. Joining me are Geoff Martha, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Gary Corona, Interim Chief Financial Officer. Jeff and Gary will provide comments on the results of our third quarter, which ended on 24 January 2025, and our outlook for the remainder of fiscal year 2025. After our prepared remarks, the executive VPs from each of our four segments will join us and will take questions from the sell-side analysts that cover the company.\nToday's program should last about an hour. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements, divisional and geographic revenue summaries, and non-GAAP reconciliations. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The presentation can be accessed in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.Medtronic.com. During today's program, many of the statements we make may be considered forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause our actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement.\nUnless we say otherwise, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, and revenue comparisons are made on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency, and third quarter revenue in the current and prior year reported as other.\nReferences to sequential revenue changes compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2025, and are made on an as-reported basis. All share references are on a revenue and year-over-year basis and compare our third fiscal quarter to our competitor's fourth calendar quarter. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. And finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. With that, let's head into the studio and hear about the quarter.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nHello everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We delivered another quarter of mid-single-digit revenue growth for the ninth quarter in a row. We had strong performances in several areas, starting with 22% growth in Cardiac Ablation Solutions powered by our PFA portfolio.\nLeadless pacing, neuromodulation, and diabetes all grew double digits, and structural heart, excluding congenital, and US cranial and spinal technologies both grew high single digits. We advanced our innovation pipeline and are opening up the largest total addressable market in medtech with renal denervation. It's an exciting time as we're stacking growth drivers on top of growth drivers with groundbreaking innovation in some of the most attractive markets in medtech. We overcame a short-term US distributor dynamic and delivered strong earnings power with high single-digit EPS growth coming in ahead of both consensus and the high end of our guidance range, with strong improvements in both our gross margin and operating margin. As we look ahead to our fiscal fourth quarter, we expect our revenue and EPS growth to accelerate as we build on momentum in important growth markets and continue to drive earnings leverage.\nWe expect our formula of delivering durable revenue growth, leveraged earnings, and generating strong free cash flow to create significant value for our shareholders. Now let's turn to the details of our Q3 business results and discuss our performance, starting first with our cardiovascular portfolio, which grew mid-single digits overall. The highlight was our cardiac ablation solutions business. Now we forecasted strong double-digit growth this quarter and CAS delivered meaningful acceleration, growing 22%. Our pulsed field ablation products are driving rapid growth. We've hit a new gear on supply, and demand for our PFA portfolio continues to accelerate. We are the only company with two PFA platforms, Affera and PulseSelect, which gives us flexibility. Affera has separated itself from the pack as the most desired workhorse platform with its integrated high-density mapping, as well as both PF and RF capabilities in a focal catheter.\nThis is increasing our revenue per case as we replace competitors' mapping and RF catheters. We also have PulseSelect, and as customers use this single-shot PFA catheter, they want to use it more and more. PulseSelect gives us just a ton of flexibility to grow the market globally and compete. Across both our Affera and PulseSelect platforms, customers appreciate their ease of use, precision, durable efficacy, and now increasingly their differentiated safety profile. We believe the safety profile of our PFA technology is a significant point of differentiation competitively, and it is one of several factors that gives us high confidence in our outlook. Now, looking ahead, we expect this rapid growth trajectory to continue. For Q4, we expect CAS to accelerate its growth rate and deliver another strong double-digit growth quarter.\nThis will be a billion-dollar business for us this fiscal year, and we have in sight $2 billion as our PFA portfolio expands into new accounts around the world. Next, in structural heart, we grew high single digits, excluding congenital. We continue to see good adoption of our Evolut FX+ TAVR system in the US, and the international launch is off to a very good start. As we look ahead, we have some important upcoming data catalysts as we continue to share long-term evidence on the benefits of our Evolut platform. Our five-year low-risk data will be presented as a late breaker at ACC next month, and two-year data from our smart trial, which is a head-to-head versus our largest competitor, will be shared later this spring. Look, we're at a moment now where we've really solidified this business.\nWith product improvements, important clinical data, and strong execution by the team, it's now in a really good spot. Next, in cardiac pacing therapies, we grew 9%. This business has grown upper single digits for 10 quarters in a row now on the strength of our leadless pacemaker franchise and conduction system pacing technology. In April, we will mark the 10th anniversary of our first Micra leadless pacemaker receiving CE Mark. And now, a decade later, our Micra franchise continues to set the standard, delivering outstanding 24% growth in Q3, and we expect this strength to continue. Now turning to hypertension and our Symplicity blood pressure procedure, we're poised to change the standard of care for uncontrolled high blood pressure. Medicare coding and payment is now in place, and just last month, we had a pivotal development when CMS opened a national coverage analysis.\nThis is exciting news as we will now have Medicare coverage in place within the next eight months. We're activating new accounts across the US and helping them set up Symplicity clinics and establish care pathways so they're prepared to quickly ramp procedures when coverage is in place. And upon coverage, this will be an immediate growth driver and will become a significant source of growth for the company. Nearly half of US adults have hypertension, and one in four of those with hypertension, they just don't have it under control despite the broad availability of numerous generic medications. So as we take a step back, the patient population is large. The current standard of care just isn't working. Patients want this new therapy. Physicians can easily do the procedure, and health systems support it.\nThe opportunity here is just massive, and we're poised to be the leader in addressing this large and unmet need. As we look at the overall cardiovascular portfolio, taking all of these growth drivers together, we expect its growth to meaningfully accelerate in the quarters ahead, starting with Q4. Turning to our neuroscience portfolio, which also grew mid-single digits this quarter, in cranial and spinal technologies, we had another strong quarter with 5% global growth, including 8% growth in the US as we won another point of share. Now, I've been saying for some time now that the basis of competition in the spine market is rapidly changing, and you saw yet another example last month when a major competitor decided to get out of the spine business. We're causing this disruption.\nWe're causing this disruption with our arsenal of differentiated enabling technology, including AI-driven pre-op planning software, imaging, robotics, navigation, and powered surgical instruments. We recently expanded into pre- and post-op imaging through our partnership with Siemens Healthineers. Look, surgeons have to make a choice, and they're standardizing with a company that can offer them this full complement of innovative technologies. Those competitors that can't or can only offer certain pieces, well, we're seeing them either struggle or just exit the market altogether. Our differentiated best-in-class AiBLE ecosystem is attracting the best spine surgeons as well as the best reps and distributors from competitors. As these dynamics continue to play out and we continue to expand our innovation lead, we expect our CST business to deliver sustained above-market growth. Next, neuromodulation grew 13%, well above the market.\nAnd just like in spine, our game-changing innovation and strong commercial execution is disrupting the competitive dynamics. The closed-loop sensing technology that we've developed for both pain stim and brain modulation has been a big engineering feat. We now have therapies that can be personalized at scale, which is better for patients and can lessen the load on the healthcare system. And it raises the bar on what it takes to compete, which is evident in our neuromod growth. In pain stim, we grew 12%, including 17% in the US, on the strength of our Inceptiv closed-loop spinal cord stimulator. On top of being the smallest and thinnest SCS device, Inceptiv instantly adjusts based on neural responses to keep the therapy at an optimal dose.\nAnd it has the best full-body MRI conditional access on the market, which is a very important feature for patients with chronic pain. In brain modulation, we grew 15%, including 26% in the US, driven by the adoption of our Percept DBS systems. Percept and its brain-computer interface technology is transforming treatment for patients with movement disorders like Parkinson's, essential tremor, dystonia, and epilepsy. Last month, we received CE Mark clearance for our BrainSense adaptive DBS for people with Parkinson's. With this groundbreaking technology, Percept devices, through a software upgrade, can become personalized, fully closed-loop systems with real-time automatic therapy adjustments based on brain activity feedback. Now, we expect this launch to drive continued above-market growth for our brain mod business in the quarters ahead.\nNow, turning to our medical surgical portfolio, let's discuss our performance in surgical. This quarter, we experienced a change in US distributor buying patterns, which had a couple of hundred basis points impact on our surgical performance. We expect this to resolve as we start fiscal 2026.\nApart from this distributor dynamic, our US hospital customer purchasing direct from us and through distributors has been stable. While we continue to see market and competitive pressures in our stapling franchise, we're offsetting this by winning share with our LigaSure advanced energy products globally and by driving strong high single-digit growth in emerging markets. With our Hugo soft tissue robotic platform, we're approaching some important milestones, including entering the US market, expanding indications, adding features, and enhancing system performance. In international markets, utilization continues to increase, and we've more than doubled Hugo procedure volume year over year. In the US, we are on track to submit for FDA approval for Hugo with urology indications by the end of next month. I also have some new information to share with you today. We have finished enrollment in our hernia and benign gynecology studies.\nFurther, we recently received FDA approval to initiate our Guine oncology ID study and are actively moving that forward. We're also making progress adding features and instrumentation. We just completed our first cases using our ICG fluorescent imaging, and we expect to add our LigaSure vessel sealing technology to Hugo later this calendar year. So in total, we are confident in our path forward. Hugo will be a growth driver for our surgical business in fiscal 2026 and a meaningful growth driver for Medtronic in the midterm. Finally, in diabetes, we had our fifth quarter in a row of double-digit growth. We printed 10% growth on top of 10% growth in the prior year. Our growth is driven by, one, the overall move of the market from standalone CGM with MDI to AID systems, and two, the strength of our MiniMed 780G system within the AID category.\nWe continue to grow our 780G install base, and we're seeing very high CGM attachment rates as well as strong growth in consumables. In Europe, we're getting excellent user feedback on our Simplera Sync sensor, which is half the size and much easier to apply than our previous sensor. In the US, we've submitted Simplera Sync for FDA approval, and we're also continuing to make progress on the integration work with the Abbott-based sensor. We expect these two new sensors to really accelerate our US growth when fully launched. Beyond sensors, we're also investing heavily in our robust diabetes technology pipeline, including next-gen durable pumps, patch pumps, smart pens, and algorithms. We're also seeking expanded labeling for the 780G, including type 2 diabetes, which is a meaningful new opportunity. We expect to file this with the FDA here in the first half of the calendar year.\nSo across Medtronic, we continue to drive mid-single digit growth, and you're now seeing this translate into strong earnings power. We're delivering leveraged earnings as we focus on disciplined pricing, holding our SG&A growth below sales, and realizing the benefits of our scale, including more than doubling our underlying COGS productivity. Gary will now walk you through a deeper look at our Q3 financial performance and our outlook. Gary, over to you.\n\nGary Corona\n\nInterim CFO, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Geoff. Our Q3 revenue of $8.3 billion grew 4.1% organic. On the bottom line, adjusted EPS was $1.39, up 6.9%. This was $0.03 above both consensus and the midpoint of our guidance. The EPS beat was driven by better-than-expected operating profit on stronger gross margins and a better-than-expected tax rate. We liked the shape of the P&L this quarter, with mid-single digit organic growth on the top line, improved gross and operating margin, strong investment behind our growth drivers, resulting in leveraged earnings growth. We continue to see breadth and diversification in our revenue growth, with double-digit growth in diabetes, and mid-single digit growth in cardiovascular and neuroscience offsetting medical surgical. We continue to see stronger overall growth in our international markets, which grew 5%, including high single digit growth in Japan.\nEmerging markets grew high single digits, including high teens growth in India, mid-teens growth in Eastern Europe, and low double-digit growth in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. Moving down our P&L, our adjusted gross margin was 66.6%, up 50 basis points versus last year and ahead of our expectations. We continue to execute on our COGS efficiency programs, and that's helping to drive margin upside. We also drove the upside with our focus on better pricing and business mix. The improved gross margin translated into an operating margin that was also ahead of our expectations. Our adjusted operating margin was 26.2%, up 100 basis points versus a year ago.\nThe organization remains extremely focused on improving our margins over time.\nWe're also prioritizing investments in our pipeline and important product launch capabilities, like hiring hundreds of mappers to support PFA growth and market development specialists in renal denervation to accelerate RDN growth. At the same time, we're returning significant capital to our shareholders, primarily through our strong and growing dividend and, from time to time, opportunistic share repurchases. Regarding our portfolio, we've increased our focus on finding tuck-in acquisitions that can enhance our growth and margin profile. We're also continuing to actively evaluate our portfolio at the business, product line, and geographic level, all through the lens of maximizing shareholder value. Now turning to guidance, we're reiterating our full-year revenue and EPS guidance today, and both our revenue and EPS growth will accelerate in the fourth quarter. On the top line, we continue to expect FY 2025 organic revenue growth to be in the range of 4.75%-5%.\nFor Q4, given the strong trajectory of our growth drivers and expected acceleration in the cardiovascular portfolio, we're comfortable with current straight organic revenue growth consensus and expect to deliver our 10th quarter in a row of mid-single digit revenue growth. Based on recent rates, FX would have an impact to fiscal 2025 in the range of $275-325 million, including $125-175 million in the fourth quarter. On the bottom line, we continue to expect fiscal 2025 non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $5.44-5.50 and are comfortable with current full-year street consensus. Based on recent rates, our EPS guide factors in five point impact from foreign currency, and we will have a significantly smaller impact than that in fiscal 2026.\nIn Q4, we expect our restored earnings power and strong operating margin expansion to continue, resulting in high single-digit adjusted EPS growth in the back half of our fiscal year, consistent to the commitment that we have been sharing all year. Further details on our guidance can be found in the guidance slide in our presentation. Geoff, back to you.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nThank you, Gary. And I want to thank you for stepping in as CFO over the last few quarters. I know you're going to help ensure a smooth transition as we welcome Thierry, and I look forward to your continued contributions to Medtronic. Now, Thierry will be joining us in a couple of weeks. And as I've heard from several of you in the investment community, it sounds like your checks are confirming what led us to hire him. He has a very strong reputation for his operational focus and ability to lead organizations to drive margin improvement, portfolio management, and earnings power to create shareholder value. Now, before we go to analyst questions, I'll share a few final thoughts. Look, we've made a number of changes to the company, and the turnaround definitely hasn't been overnight. It's been building.\nIt's been building with nine quarters in a row of mid-single digit growth. Now we're clearly entering a new phase with the growth drivers kicking in, and these are big growth drivers. As I said earlier, we're stacking growth drivers on top of growth drivers. We're in the moment with MiniMed 780G and diabetes, closed-loop technology and neuromodulation, and of course, PFA in our cardiac ablation solutions business. We're about to start a massive growth driver with our Symplicity procedure in hypertension. There's even more to come with opportunities like tibial stim for overactive bladder, our Hugo robot, and our transcatheter mitral and tricuspid valves, among many others.\nAt the same time, our earnings power is now kicking in with high single-digit EPS growth this quarter and next. So look, it's a very exciting time to be here at Medtronic.\nI want to close by thanking our employees who are listening today and make all of this possible. You're making a difference every day for patients around the world, innovating and advancing healthcare technology, and improving healthcare access. You're inventing, developing, and deploying meaningful technologies that will change standard of care and create whole new markets. I appreciate your dedication to the Medtronic mission, and I'm really looking forward to what we will collectively accomplish in the days ahead. With that, let's move to Q&A, where we're going to try to get to as many analysts as possible. So we ask that you limit yourself to just one question and only, if needed, a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, you can reach out to Ryan and the investor relations team after the call.\nSo with that, Brad, can you please give the instructions for asking a question?\n\nOperator\n\nFor the sell-side analysts that would like to ask a question, please select the participants button and click raise hand. If you're using the mobile app, press the more button and select raise hand. Your lines are currently on mute. When called upon, you will receive a request to unmute your line, which you must respond to before asking your question. Lastly, please be advised that this Q&A session is being recorded. For today's session, Geoff, Gary, and Ryan are joined by Que Dallara, EVP and President of Diabetes, Mike Marinaro, EVP and President of the Medical Surgical Portfolio, Sean Salmon, EVP and President of the Cardiovascular Portfolio, and Brett Wall, EVP and President of the Neuroscience Portfolio. We'll pause for a few seconds to assemble the queue.\nWe'll take the first question from Patrick Wood at Morgan Stanley. Patrick, please go ahead.\n\nPatrick Wood\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nPerfect. Thank you so much for taking the question. I promise I'll keep it to one. As you guys are moving into fiscal 2026, obviously there's Hugo, CAS is accelerating, Inceptiv doing well, Micra, et cetera. So there's a lot of moving parts. I know it's only Q3, but would it be fair to assume that the base algorithm, call it mid-single digit growth and then high singles on the bottom line, that that's a fair assumption moving into fiscal 2026? Also, can we make that as an exit rate in Q4? Is that a fair assumption?\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nSure. Patrick, thanks for the question. Yeah, obviously, like you've been, we'll give FY 2026 guidance on our Q4 call, but our objective is unchanged. We're committed to doing the things that we need to do to drive profitable growth and operating leverage at Medtronic. So as Gary pointed out in the commentary, we reiterated our guidance for this fiscal year of 4.75%-5% organic revenue growth and high single-digit realized EPS growth in the back half of the year. And as we look into the future, we think that we're still committed to that LRP that you outlined.\n\nPatrick Wood\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nFantastic. Thanks for taking the question.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Patrick. Next question, please, Brad.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take the next question from Larry Biegelsen at Wells Fargo. Larry, please go ahead. Larry, you there?\n\nLarry Biegelsen\n\nSenior Medical Device Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, I'm here. I'm here, guys. Can you hear me, Geoff?\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nOh, okay.\n\nLarry Biegelsen\n\nSenior Medical Device Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, can you hear me?\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah, we can.\n\nLarry Biegelsen\n\nSenior Medical Device Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nSorry about that. Sorry. So thanks for taking the question, guys. I wanted to ask Sean a question on AF solutions, which was obviously a bright spot in Q3. So Sean, talk about the drivers of the acceleration in Q4 and how you're thinking about fiscal 2026 and specifically the ramp of Affera, where you are with supply and your ability to get mapping in the field and that $2 billion line of sight, how quickly can you get there? Thank you.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nLarry, let me take the first swing at that and then have Sean come in on some of the details. First of all, it's great to see the impact PFA is having on patients and also increasing physician and hospital productivity with its speed, efficacy, and safety profile. We're really excited about our positioning in the market, and you're starting to see that in our last quarter's results, as you pointed out. We consider this to be like a hyper growth driver for us, and we're really just getting started. Back to the line of sight question, that's what I wanted to get at, the $2 billion line of sight. Here's what I'll say. First of all, the market is super strong, and we'll continue. We see PFA as a roughly $9 billion market and growing in the high teens.\nWe've got strong demand for both of our platforms, PulseSelect and Affera. This gives us a ton of flexibility as we grow the market globally. As many of you pointed out, Affera is just getting rave reviews. I mean, it's a high demand. As I've traveled the globe here in the first couple of weeks of the year, everybody seems to know that name, Affera. Supply is a lot better across the board. Our suppliers are performing well, and our new factory in Galway is a game changer with an immediate impact for Affera.\nSo I'd say these finances; these are not like the $2 billion line of sight. They're not forward-looking statements. This is in the moment, and we're not stopping at the $2 billion. That's not an end game. That's line of sight, shorter term.\nWhen you get beyond next year, don't forget that Affera will be moving into the single shot space as well. And so we just have a lot of confidence about the near-term and long-term opportunity here with PFA and our two platforms. I don't know, Sean, do you want to? I think Larry had a few other things on there as well. Do you want to jump in?\n\nSean Salmon\n\nEVP and President of the Cardiovascular Portfolio, Medtronic\n\nYeah, sure, Geoff. I think you've covered it pretty well. We are aggressively expanding both capacity within the factory and within the field. It's important that we stay ahead of that as we add mapping in. I think, as Geoff said, we're not just seeing strong demand for Affera. It's launched in Q3 in the United States and has driven a lot of growth. But we also, we're in those hospitals. We're getting a lot of the paroxysmal cases with PulseSelect as well. So it's really a kind of dual platform, multiple use sort of penetration to the accounts.\nWe also see a lot of utility for certain geographies that don't use mapping, where PulseSelect is a really favorite product too because of its precision, its proven and durable efficacy, and increasingly that safety profile, which is really a distinguishing feature for it.\nSo as we step into next year, I think we got lots of growth to look ahead to as we expand out that footprint in the field and have capacity really well ahead of the demand, and we push it forward. So things are going to continue to rock for us within the pulsed field ablation world, and the team's really excited about it, and physicians really appreciate the technology we're bringing.\n\nLarry Biegelsen\n\nSenior Medical Device Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Larry. Next question, please, Brad.\nThe next question comes from Robbie Marcus at J.P. Morgan. Robbie, please go ahead.\n\nRobbie Marcus\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOh, hi. Good morning, and thank you very much for taking the question. There's talk of all these big growth drivers with pulsed field ablation and Hugo, especially now with the trials enrolling and submission coming at the end of the month, and also renal denervation. How do you think about balancing the spend of investing in these programs to make sure they're successful versus being able to continue driving margin expansion like we saw in this quarter? Thanks a lot.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah. Well, thanks for the question, Robbie. Look, I'd say we do have a lot of, I'll call them growth drivers that come with investment opportunities. And the goal here is to be able to do both, right? Is to be able to invest in these things and growth as well as hit our financial algorithm that Patrick asked about. And the gross margin improvement is a key piece of that, right? So over the last couple of quarters and even years, we've really, I think, gotten better at being able to grow the sales number, that mid-single digit, without growing the G&A, the SG&A even, nearly at the same pace.\nAnd that will continue. And then adding the gross margin improvement to that gives us a lot more flexibility. So that. And then finally, I would add tuck and M&A.\nI think tuck-in and M&A, we've got a strong balance sheet, and tuck-in and M&A gives us an opportunity to because the tuck-ins we're doing are just another form of R&D for the most part. And so that's how we do it. But a key for us is stepping up the tuck-in and M&A, I'd say, and continuing the margin improvement. Gary, anything to add to that?\n\nGary Corona\n\nInterim CFO, Medtronic\n\nNo, you hit it, Geoff. It's been our focus. We grew gross margin in the first half of the year on a constant currency basis, and we'll grow gross margin on an FX basis in the second half of the year. And that's really what's going to be key to us being able to deliver the high single-digit EPS while we fund the growth drivers like investing in mappers, as I talked about in my prepared remarks.\n\nRobbie Marcus\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks a lot.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nI mean, but the goal here, we've got some, I mean, some of these growth drivers, we've got to continue to make the investment. We want to play offense at this point in time.\nOkay. Thank you, Robbie. Next question, please, Brad.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Vijay Kumar at Evercore ISI. Vijay, please go ahead.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHey, guys. Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. Geoff, I think I had a two-parter. When it comes to large companies, this is exactly what we wanted to see. Diversified portfolio, we have some moving parts, but we still have the ability to manage the P&L and drive earnings, right? I feel like that's what we got here. When I look at the print here, in surgical, I think you called out a distributor timing impact.\nBut what gives you the confidence this is not a share loss? And I think related to that P&L management, right, this gross margin stood out. Any one-timers in gross margins? Maybe talk about what drove the sequential step-up in gross margins and its sustainability. Thank you.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nSure. Well, thanks for the question. I'd say on the surgical question, first, like I said in the commentary, the performance there was driven by a couple of our larger distributors stepping down their carried inventory levels of Medtronic inventory below their normal levels. Like I said, this dynamic costs us about a couple hundred basis points in Q3 growth. However, we do expect these dynamics to resolve as we enter Q1 when these distributors reach their target inventory level. So when they get to those inventory levels that they communicated that they want to get to us, that's when this resolves, and that's going to be as we enter Q1. Now, your question about share: we do have the ability to see through.\nWe track this very closely, the end customer purchases. And one, we know they're stable. And two, we're not losing share. We continue, I think, to outperform slightly in the non-robotic space. Robotics in the US, obviously, is a headwind for us. So that's what I'd say to that one. And on the second one, I'll let Gary handle the gross margin question.\n\nGary Corona\n\nInterim CFO, Medtronic\n\nThanks. Vijay, thanks for your comments on balancing the puts and takes. As Geoff and I have talked about, we're really focused on delivering the earnings power. On gross margins specifically, we were pleased with the performance, 140 basis points sequentially and 50 basis points year over year on an AFX basis. The drivers, as Geoff talked about, continuing our cost efficiency programs and really improving our operating efficiencies. We continue to be disciplined on pricing. We did see some, actually, in the gross margin line, foreign exchange favorability.\nI will say our second-half gross margins will be up both on a constant currency and an AFX basis. We're really focused on it to not only drive the earnings power, but also to fund the investment, as Geoff talked about.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah. I mean, I think that, like Gary said, the focus on the margins in every aspect of them, whether it be pricing, mix, and of course, our cost-down programs, and those are having an impact in improving the margins. Getting back to surgery, your question on share loss, I'd also say the business is doing well outside the US at mid-single digit growth. In emerging market, we're seeing high single digit growth. And then we're gaining share worldwide in areas like LigaSure and Barb Sutures. And then really what we want to do is get this business back to our corporate average, right? And that, as we look to FY 2026, Hugo accelerates and becomes more of a growth driver for surgical at the surgical level. And as I mentioned in the commentary, Hugo is approaching some important milestones, and some of you have asked about these.\nWe're seeing solid progress on Hugo as measured by, I say, a comprehensive set of leading indicators. It's these indicators that give us confidence. Probably, Mike, maybe Mike Marinaro is in the best position to discuss these. Maybe I'll ask Mike to comment on these leading indicators for Hugo.\n\nMike Marinaro\n\nEVP and President of the Medical Surgical Portfolio, Medtronic\n\nYeah. Thanks, Geoff. And thanks, Vijay, for the question. I think you've commented on some of these in your commentary, Geoff. But when we look at a complex program like Hugo, there's many elements that come together to really make it go: the system, the indications, instruments, of course, and getting into markets around the world. So we're now in over 25 markets around the world. Our procedure volume has more than doubled on a year-on-year basis.\nWe're seeing utilization improve in current programs, which is a really important measure of success. We track external publications, independent publications. There's been over 170 now at this point. So we're looking at the performance and utility of Hugo compared to the market leader. And what we see is that the commentary is broadly comparable, both in procedure times and functionality. So that's obviously a great external measure.\nWe're making progress with our advanced capabilities. So we've just completed our first ICG cases. LigaSure is obviously critical for Hugo. We expect to introduce that this year. And then I think, as Geoff mentioned in the commentary, we are on track to submit to the FDA for the urology indication. And I think at the end of next month.\nBut as importantly, we're increasing our capability in driving the clinical evidence to support multiple indications in the US, having now completed hernia, benign gynecology, moving into GYN onc here near term, which will then give us a cadence of indication opportunity to really have a fully featured product. So we take all of these things together, and you can see that it comes together and really drives the progress and optimism that we see as we're preparing to enter the US market in FY 2026.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHelpful comments. Thank you.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYes. Thanks, Vijay. Next question, please, Brad.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take the next question from Travis Steed at Bank of America. Travis, please go ahead.\n\nTravis Steed\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research and Medical Technology, Bank of America\n\nHey, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to push a little more on the surgical side since it was kind of the one area that was a little bit different this quarter. I guess curious, why do you think the distributors destocked in the quarter? And why didn't you have kind of visibility in that ahead of time? And did you talk to the distributors, and did they say they would kind of return back to normal buying patterns in the quarter? I guess I'm just looking at this US surgery business.\nIt's kind of been below the Medtronic corporate average for about five quarters now. And there's been a lot of one-time things going on there. But I just want to kind of get investors' confidence that this business can return back to growth next year. Is Hugo required, do you think, to get this business back to kind of mid-single digit plus growth?\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah. Okay. Travis, thanks for the question. As I mentioned, this distributor issue that came up, it is temporary. It came in late in the quarter for us. And the distributor's reasons for bringing down their inventory, it's really to hit their goals. I'm not going to get into that. It's specific distributors and two of our larger ones.\nBut that's their own goals. But as they get down to very specific inventory levels, that's when they'll be getting back to that normal trajectory. And like I said, that'll happen as we enter Q1. Now, getting back to your point on the US surgical business, just taking a step back, the competitive issues facing our, really, it's our stapling franchise over the last, call it, several quarters, as you've outlined, has brought the surgical growth levels down below the corporate average, as you've pointed out. However, these pressures aren't new.\nWe're committed to returning the surgical business to a stronger growth profile, more aligned with the corporate average. Mike walked you through our confidence in robotics. That's becoming a growth driver for the surgical business itself in FY26. Beyond, it'll become more of a, in the midterm, a more growth driver at the Medtronic level. At the $33 billion revenue level, you'll start to feel it. In addition, we just got to maintain our strength in emerging markets where we're seeing high single-digit growth. We need to continue to take share with LigaSure and Barb Sutures on a worldwide basis. I already talked about Hugo.\nWe have confidence in this because of the progress we're making and how we're holding in other parts of the business.\nMike, anything you want to add to that?\n\nMike Marinaro\n\nEVP and President of the Medical Surgical Portfolio, Medtronic\n\nI think you've outlined it really well, Geoff. We are focused on our areas of growth that you highlighted, where we can gain share. This dynamic that we experienced this quarter was a bit unique. It did come in late, although we have had conversations. We understand what the objectives are. We expect that when we hit those levels, that we then see more normalized performance moving forward.\nSo that really should address that issue. Then we get it back into our normal sort of rhythm, focusing on the areas of growth that you described.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nThen the guidance that we've given implies both the top and bottom line acceleration in Q4, even though we still have this distributor issue in Q4. This is driven largely by acceleration of CV because cardiovascular will accelerate and drive upside going forward. When you think about cardiovascular, we've had about 10 quarters in a row of mid-single digit growth without much, if any, contribution from CAS or Ardian. Let's refer to this as the CV-based business without CAS and Ardian. We'll continue to see this performance in the base business driven by above-market performance in CRM, think leadless, conduction system pacing, EV-ICD. Again, as I mentioned, the commentary structural heart's in a great place and with strong evidence that we'll keep building upon and product improvements that have come out and Evolut FX+.\nI think just better commercial execution against the main competitor there from our team. I mentioned cardiac surgery, where we've revamped the product lineup, refreshed it over the last two years, and now it's been growing at high single digits. You have all that in this base business that we don't see changing going forward, that mid-single digit growth that we've seen over the last 10 quarters. Now you add the contributions from CAS and Ardian on top of that, that you'll accelerate in Q4. Then as you enter into FY 2026, you pick up the Ardian piece as well, and CAS keeps going.\n\nTravis Steed\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research and Medical Technology, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thanks a lot for that. Yeah, it does. Thank you.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nThank you, Travis. Next question, Brad.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take the next question from Matt Miksic at Barclays. Matt, please go ahead.\n\nMatt Miksic\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThanks so much. I wanted to just follow up on the other sort of soft spot in the quarter here around Peripheral Vascular. It went from a mid-single digit growth in previous quarters to this low single digit decline. And I guess similar to the questions around distributor stocking, is timing for turning that around, confidence that that can kind of turn the corner here, since that really was the only business in CV that pulled down a little bit on a pretty solid mid-single digit growth portfolio average. Thanks.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah. Matt, you broke up a second there. I think you were talking about peripheral vascular. But yeah, that is really a China issue. That is a China DVP issue that we're dealing with there that'll work its way out. China, we've worked through most of the DVP, but there is still a little bit left to go. And it's created, I'd say, a little bit of volatility within the China line. And we've been able to overall do well there and actually do well profitably as well.\nBut you see volatility that shows up in an individual business. And that's what happened for peripheral vascular this quarter. Anything to add to that, Gary or Sean, in terms of? All right. Thanks, Matt. Next question, please, Brad.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Josh Jennings at TD Cowen. Josh, please go ahead.\n\nJosh Jennings\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen",
    "content2": "Thanks so much for taking the question. I was hoping that you guys had talked about the massive global opportunity for the renal denervation franchise. And you laid out the path to unlocking the US. I was hoping to just get an update on the international opportunity, just where the business stands. Should we be thinking, or could we be seeing some coverage and announcements in different countries? And then what do you expect?\nWhat needs to happen in order for that international ramp for the Symplicity Spyral unit going forward? Thanks for taking the question.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nSure. Thanks for the question, John. I'm going to let Sean answer the global question, the international question. But before, I just got a comment on look, the Ardian, it's been a journey for us. As we sit here today, we're really excited. I mean, the NCA is a huge milestone. And now we have a we're going to be going after the basically, we're excited to change the standard of care and the largest chronic disease issue in healthcare with hypertension, the number one contributor to death. And this NCA going to an NCD, we have a lot of confidence. We've gone back and looked over the last decade plus.\nWe haven't seen an example where an NCA doesn't convert to an NCD. And we've got the CMS has laid out really definitive timing for the announcement in July and then take effect in October. So that really unlocks this huge opportunity in the US. And we think it does create a halo effect, not just in the US for commercial payers, but globally. And then that's where your question comes in. So Sean, do you want to talk about the international progress and opportunity?\n\nSean Salmon\n\nEVP and President of the Cardiovascular Portfolio, Medtronic\n\nYeah, sure. Thanks, Josh. Appreciate the question. So like a lot of these reimbursement efforts, you have to do them country by country by meeting the individual expectations. And across Europe, mostly that's a health technology assessment. And we've published numerous cost-effectiveness studies which would support those analyses. The other thing that really drives payment decision at the country level is going to be the guidelines that get published.\nAll those society statements have been very supportive to the European guidelines and ESC guidelines. So we're seeing country by country increases, including France, which has established reimbursement. And then outside the United States and Europe, we've recently gotten approval within China. And then we have to go through the hospital listing price process there. So we'll start in big cities and then go beyond that. And of course, the only outstanding country for approval is Japan.\nAnd we're working on that to gain regulatory approval. And then typically, it's six months from the time of approval to when you get reimbursement for those products. So we're making a good push in every country where we can. But make no mistake about it, the US is going to be the dominant growth driver for renal denervation, given both the prevalence of the disease and the setup we have for both Medicare payment as well as the building commercial insurers' interest in covering this device as well.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nOkay. Thank you, Josh. Next question, please, Brad.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from David Rescott at Baird. David, please go ahead.\n\nDavid Rescott\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nOh, great. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask on FX, Geoff. I think you called out the opportunity recently to more actively manage the FX risk exposure. Maybe could you help us understand exactly how you can do that, maybe the kind of level or magnitude of control these factors ultimately could have on FX, and then over what period you think you could start to mitigate some of that FX risk? Thank you.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nSo thanks for the question, David. I mean, I'd say on that, on your last point, the actions we've taken have already started to mitigate this. And it's been something we've been working on now for quite a while, a couple of quarters, and you're starting to see effects. But I'm going to have Gary outline exactly what we're doing and the opportunity here.\n\nGary Corona\n\nInterim CFO, Medtronic\n\nYeah. David, I'll start with your second question, and then I'll come back to what we're doing about it. I think your second question was just, what are we seeing? What we're seeing this year has been very consistent. There's no new news for FY 2025. Then as I talked about in my prepared comments, as we have visibility into 2026, we'll have meaningfully less of a headwind on the FX line than we did in FY 2025. Thanks for recognizing what we've been talking about.\nAs Geoff said, we're making progress by really taking a greater level of ownership and proactive measures. We're changing our incentive structure to US dollars versus local currency for many of our emerging markets. It drives commercial changes like dynamic pricing. That might mean updating our pricing as often as every month. This was a big change for us.\nAnd as Geoff mentioned, we're seeing the progress. That activity will help our gross margins. And as we talked about earlier, that's the key to driving the earnings power as well as funding the investments in growth while we deliver against our financial commitments. So thanks for the question. I appreciate it. And please know it's a key area of focus for us.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nThe only other thing I'd say to that is, and Gary seems to have done a lot of work on this as well, is our global operations and supply team is creating natural hedges in our supply chain as well, with our suppliers and how we look at supply chain. So it's a comprehensive view, a comprehensive approach, if you will, that is starting to pay off.\nHey, thank you, David. I think we've got time for two more questions, Brad.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Shagun Singh at RBC Capital Markets. Shagun, please go ahead.\n\nShagun Singh\n\nMedical Technology Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thank you for taking the question. Geoff, I was very intrigued by your comments around stacking growth drivers on top of growth drivers. I was wondering if you could put maybe a final point. Some of the drivers here could be pretty meaningful. So anything you can share in terms of magnitude of the incremental growth contribution in year one versus year five, anything there?\nAnd then can you talk a little bit about the specific timing here? So the line of sight to $2 billion, when do you think you can get there? You said that's a first stop. So where does it go over time? In Hugo, you mentioned growth contributor in FY 2026, as well as meaningful growth in the medium term. So can you define that better? And then just on Ardian, you said it'll be an immediate growth driver upon coverage. Just any color on the near-term appetite and what that looks like. Thank you.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nOkay. Yeah, thanks for that. That was a loaded question there, Shagun. Thanks for the question. I mean, I'd say the way we're looking at the growth drivers, look, three, or we define a growth driver as areas where we have high confidence in a fast-growing market that's also a large market, and then confidence in our position in that market. So three that are here now, obviously, diabetes, we've talked a lot about. We've had a number in several quarters in a row of double-digit growth.\nAnd we still have, on the basis of 780G, we still haven't gotten our Simplera Sync in front of the FDA for the US. And we've got a pipeline here of other things like PATCH. We talked about expanded indications for 780G, like type 2, which are meaningful. So there's a lot in diabetes to come.\nBut it's already been growing double digits here for a number of quarters. We talked a lot about PFA and CAS and kind of how we're just moving forward here in that line of sight comment. I answered that earlier that we put a specific time frame around that 2 billion, but it's in the near term as we've unlocked supply here. I came to find out that there was a lot of people had looked at, and this is based on both of our platforms. I know there's a lot of questions around Affera. And there was, I think we've kind of cracked the code, if you will, on supply there.\nAnd this new factory in Galway, Ireland, has really been a game changer for us. And of course, neuromodulation, because I think we're one of the few that's growing in the teens here.\nI think we're the only one. This is maybe not quite as big as some of these other markets, but it's still big, a multi-billion dollar market. We've got a fundamental change in technology here with sensing that, whether it be SCS in pain stim or DBS, the sensing is very differentiated. We feel the basis of competition going forward. That's why we have confidence in this growth profile going forward. The stories that we're getting on the ability to what the sensing means, and particularly when you get to things like adaptive DBS, where you can close the loop, the impact on the patient and the impact on the healthcare system, where it's automatically programmed, is massive. So we see that moving forward. Those are all here right now and contributing.\nAnd then you get into FY 2026, Hugo starts to be a meaningful growth driver for a surgical business like we talked about. Ardian kicks in. We haven't quantified that yet. We have to wait for the Q4 call in terms of the short-term impact on Ardian. But obviously, the NCD really unlocks that. And the patients that we're treating right now, the efficacy is just better than even we expected. And sure, physicians are giving us great feedback. But then you get out beyond that.\nAnd all these growth drivers are going to keep going. But then you add Tibial on that. And Tibial is another one that I think we're one of the only ones talking about it for overactive bladder. We think this will double the size of that business over the next couple of years once we launch it.\nI mean, there's such a pent-up demand for this. It takes this from a, I call it a tibial neuromodulation for overactive bladder. It takes it from more of a medical device to not quite a wearable, but you're getting close to a wearable when you're just going under the skin on the ankle, but above the fascia with a tiny device that, and I'm not going to give away all the, it's a very compelling story that is going to open up that market. So you can see we've got this flywheel going. Robbie's question earlier about the investments, keep it going. We feel good about that, especially with the gross margin improvements and some dry powder we have in M&A to augment that. But that's about the extent of the color I can give at this point.\nI probably left one or two out, but those are the ones that are on the top of my mind.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nOkay. Thanks, Shagun. We've got time for one more question, Brad.\n\nOperator\n\nYep. Our final question comes from Pito Chickering at Deutsche Bank. Pito, please go ahead.\n\nPito Chickering\n\nResearch Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, good morning, guys. I'll make this one quick at the top of the hour. A follow-up question just to Travis's on Medical Surgical. Is there any risk that this is from distributors that are pushing their own privately manufactured products and displacing Medtronic products? And in general, as you look at your portfolio in that division, is that a potential risk for the future? Thank you.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nNo, I'll let Mike answer that question. But I think the short answer is no. But Mike, why don't you tell them why?\n\nMike Marinaro\n\nEVP and President of the Medical Surgical Portfolio, Medtronic\n\nYeah. We've been given no evidence of that at all. We have very active conversations and specific agreements with them around the products that we sell and that they distribute for us. And we're very clear, Pito, on just how that all comes together in the marketplace. And so there's no indication that there's any pressure at all from that front, just based on our work together with them.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nThe other thing I'd augment that answer is that, look, we go through distributors because there's a lot of products here in the surgical business, right? But the contracting, we do a lot of it, it's directly between us and the hospital. So we have very tight contracts that have been tested over time. Like if we have a supply shortage and then a competitor takes up that and we get it back, we get that supply back, we're right back to where we were based on the contracts. These contracts with the hospitals are pretty tight as well. So you have the dynamic Mike said, that these distributors, we have tight contracts with them, but then we have tight contracts that we enter directly with the end user hospital.\nSo, it's the first time I've got that question, but that's not something that we're concerned about in the business.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nOkay. Thanks, Pito. Geoff, please go ahead with your final remarks.\n\n[Unknown Speaker 2]\n\nUnknown Speaker 2\n\nOkay. Well, thanks to all the analysts for the questions and to all that joined us today. We appreciate your support and continued interest in Medtronic. We hope you'll join us for our Q4 earnings broadcast, which we anticipate we're going to be holding on Wednesday, 21 May 2025, where we'll update you on how we finished the fiscal year, including all of our growth drivers, margin expansion, and how that's all tracking, and give you guidance, of course, for FY26. So with that, thanks for spending time with us today and have a great rest of your day."

    "content": "Q1 2025 Medtronic PLC Earnings Call\n\nQ1 2025 Medtronic PLC Earnings Call\n\nMDTNYSEAUG 20, 8:00 AM\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nHello everyone, and thanks for tuning in today. As you saw in our results, we're exceeding our commitments and increasing our outlook for the rest of the year. This is now our seventh quarter in a row of delivering mid-single digit revenue growth, and we drove earnings growth, increasing adjusted EPS to 3% on a reported basis and 8% constant currency.\nWe're tracking to delivering high-single-digit EPS growth on a reported basis as we exit the fiscal year. Our underlying markets are healthy, we're driving operating rigor, and new product innovation is fueling our diversified growth across many large, secular growth markets that matter. At the same time, we continue to invest in our pipeline, which we expect to drive growth in the short, medium, and the long term.\nWe're at the front end of many new product cycles in markets like diabetes, pulsed field ablation, TAVR, neuromodulation, hypertension, and robotics. We're focused on driving scale across our manufacturing, technology, and commercial organizations, and making progress on our ongoing portfolio management work. Now, as we deliver innovation and continue to execute on our transformation, this will lead to strong returns for our shareholders.\nNow let's turn to the details of our Q1 results and discuss our performance. Looking first at our highest gross businesses, combined, they grew 8% and made up 21% of our revenue. We expect their contribution to our overall growth to increase in the coming quarters as we continue to launch new technology. Starting with cardiac ablation solutions, we're at one of those moments in medtech where a new technology is causing a rapid shift in the treatment of a disease.\nIn this case, PFA is that technology for AFib. We've been investing in and developing this technology over many years. We're well positioned here, and we're confident in our ability to execute and take advantage of this opportunity. In line with what we said last quarter, our CAS growth rate accelerated in Q1, growing over 6%. We're seeing rapid market adoption of our PulseSelect PFA catheters, and its growth is more than offsetting cryo declines.\nThe PulseSelect launch has been successful, with more than 550 physicians in 20 countries having treated over 10,000 patients. To meet the strong market demand, we're dramatically increasing our PulseSelect catheter manufacturing capacity and expanding into new accounts. As a result, we expect PulseSelect to meaningfully accelerate our overall CAS growth rate through this fiscal year, including a strong acceleration in Q2.\nThen we have our differentiated Sphere-9 focal catheter. This all-in-one catheter can perform high-density mapping as well as pulsed field, and RF ablations. We expect Sphere-9 will allow us to capture more revenue per procedure, as it will take the place of other competitors' mapping and RF catheters. We're in limited launch in Europe, and we've submitted to FDA for approval earlier this calendar year.\nAs we launch and scale Sphere-9 and our Affera mapping system, we expect our CAS growth will accelerate even further over time as we reach and then exceed market growth in this large and fast-growing $9 billion cardiac ablation space. Next, in structural heart, we continue to deliver high-single-digit growth, excluding the impact of our Harmony pulmonary valve that we relaunched last year.\nDuring the quarter, we started with the limited US launch of our Evolut FX+ TAVR valve and have now begun full market launch this month. FX+ is important for two reasons. One, it allows for easier coronary access due to the large windows in its frame. Two, it creates an additional opportunity to reiterate our positive SMART trial results with our customers.\nSMART showed our superior valve performance in small annuli patients, who are primarily women, and this was just another proof point in our broader focus on health equity. The SMART patient population is sizable, making up about 40% of the TAVR space. With this combination of FX+, our superior four-year low-risk data, and SMART data, we expect to continue to grow at or above the market in the quarters ahead. In surgical robotics, we're investing in building a foundation for future growth.\nIn Q1, our install base continued to grow, and utilization per system steadily increased. In the US, we've now achieved the targeted enrollment for the Expand URO trial. This is a meaningful milestone. Beyond that, enrollment and procedures in our other two US indication studies, hernia and gynecology, are going well. We also continue to make progress bringing our advanced surgical technologies to Hugo, such as ICG fluorescent imaging and LigaSure vessel sealing.\nNext, in diabetes, we had another strong quarter, growing 13%, with double-digit growth in both the US and international markets. In the US, we reached the one-year milestone of the launch of the MiniMed 780G AID system. We're driving high-single-digit growth in pump revenue and over 30% growth in CGM revenue with our high CGM attachment.\nIn international markets, we initiated the full market release of the Simplera Sync sensor, and we're just getting great feedback on it, on the ease of insertion and its usage. This adds to the already high satisfaction of our 780G system, where we've been the number one rated AID system by dQ&A for the past two quarters. We're confident in Simplera and our CGM pipeline.\nTo add to this, two weeks ago, we announced our global partnership with Abbott, where we'll bring to market an integrated CGM based on Abbott's most advanced CGM platform. The sensor will integrate exclusively with our AID and smart MDI systems. It will also allow us to offer more choice to patients, increase our installed base, and grow our diabetes revenue. We expect to do this while maintaining the same revenue per patient and being neutral to diabetes gross margin.\nLook, we're committed to being number one in the fast-growing AID and smart MDI space, and this partnership will help ensure just that. Now, turning to hypertension. Securing broad reimbursement remains key to unlocking the opportunity to our Symplicity blood pressure procedure. We were pleased that CMS has finalized the inpatient payment and has now proposed an outpatient payment. We continue to engage with CMS at the national and local levels to establish coverage, a key enabler so that this therapy can reach patients.\nNow, this is important as hypertension affects more than 1 billion people globally and nearly half of all US adults. Despite the availability of numerous classes of pharmaceuticals, only one in four adults in the US have their hypertension under control. Furthermore, more than 700,000 deaths in the US every year are directly attributable to hypertension.\nThe burden of hypertension costs the US healthcare system between $100 and 200 billion a year. You can see why there's just an important role for our Symplicity procedure to cost-effectively improve public health. Now, turning to our synergistic businesses, neuromodulation was a highlight this quarter, growing 10%, well above the market.\nThis is a business where the investments we've made over several years in sensing technology in the brain and the nervous system are now paying off. Sensing and closed-loop technology is becoming foundational for the neuromod space. It's reinvigorating these markets, and we have a clear lead. First, in pain stim, we grew 11%. This was the first quarter of our Inceptiv launch in the US. Inceptiv is our first closed-loop spinal cord stimulator, and it's transforming the way we treat chronic pain.\nThe device automatically senses and adjusts stimulation 50x a second, 24/7, with no required interaction from the patient. The therapy is delivered from the smallest and the thinnest closed-loop SCS device on the market. It also has the best full-body conditional MRI access. The other big driver of neuromod growth was our brain modulation business, which grew 14% on the continued launch of Percept RC with BrainSense technology.\nPercept transmits electrical signals to specific brain targets affected by debilitating neurological disorders like Parkinson's. It then captures and records these signals, equipping physicians with the valuable data and the insights needed to personalize the therapy. Just last week, we became the first and only DBS company to receive FDA approval to offer DBS surgery while the patient is asleep. Now, this innovation means a less stressful surgery for the patient and potentially shorter procedure times.\nWe look forward to continuing to advance our leadership position in brain modulation. Now, looking at our established market leaders, combined, they made up just under half of our revenue and grew 5%. Collectively, we can depend on this diversification not only for reliable revenue growth, but also their disproportionate contribution to our profits and cash flow that we can then invest in higher growth areas.\nCardiac rhythm management grew high-single-digits with high-single-digit growth in defibrillation solutions and low double digit growth in cardiac pacing therapies. Our Micra leadless pacemaker franchise grew over 20% as the market continues to adopt our latest generation of devices. In surgical, we grew low-single-digits.\nThis was lower growth than prior quarters, primarily driven by the difficult comparison from backorder fulfillments in the first half of the last fiscal year, as well as the Korean market slowdown from the ongoing physician strikes. Now, we expect that surgical will return to more normalized growth in the back half of the fiscal year as these comparisons ease.\nIn cranial and spinal technologies, we grew mid-single digits. Our spine business continues to just really outperform the market with 7% global and 9% US core spine growth. This sustained share capture is being driven by our ABLE ecosystem. ABLE's differentiated features and the sheer scale around the world is a winning formula for our spine business. It's good for patients and surgeons, and it's changing the competitive dynamics in spine.\nABLE is helping us win share and attract the best sales reps and distributors to join our Medtronic team. With that, I now want to welcome Gary Corona, our interim chief financial officer, to his first Medtronic earnings broadcast. Gary's taking over for Karen Parkhill, to whom we wish all the best as she starts her next chapter. Gary joined us a little less than two years ago after an impressive career with General Mills.\nHe's been leading our corporate finance team and has been instrumental in enhancing both our capabilities and our rigor, which has been a key enabler to our beats and raises. As he stepped into the role, we haven't missed a beat. I want to welcome Gary.\n\nGary Corona\n\nEVP and Interim CFO, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Geoff. I too want to thank Karen for all her contributions to Medtronic and her support of me personally. I'm energized to step into this role and continue the momentum that we have as a company. I'm honored to lead our talented global finance team and want to send a big thank you to the entire Medtronic organization for your support. I've been able to hit the ground running, and I'm excited to work together with Geoff and the leadership team to drive performance and achieve our financial commitments.\nI'm looking forward to having conversations with many of you in the investment community over the coming weeks. Now I'll recap our Q1 financials and give you some additional details on our outlook. We started this fiscal year by continuing to deliver on our commitments with revenue growth at 5.3%, a full point above the midpoint of our guidance. This translated into EPS that was $0.03 ahead of our guidance midpoint.\nWe're driving diversified growth, and you can see this strength come through when you look by business or by geography, as both new product innovation and commercial execution is fueling our results. Our cardiovascular portfolio accelerated to high-single-digit growth, and we saw continued momentum in neuroscience and diabetes.\nOur US growth also accelerated on contributions from cardiac rhythm management, PFA, and neuromodulation. Our international markets grew in the high-single-digits, including mid-teens growth in emerging markets. Moving down the P&L, our adjusted gross margin was 65.9%, down 50 basis points, but ahead of expectations. As expected, the decline was entirely driven by the 80 basis point impact of currency. However, we continue to make progress on our underlying margin improvement activities.\nIn Q1, pricing from our new innovation and our cost-out programs offset inflation, resulting in a 30 basis points increase in our gross margin on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted operating margin was 24.4%, in line with expectations. This was a decline of 40 basis points versus last year, but up 60 basis points in constant currency. Turning to capital allocation, our philosophy hasn't changed.\nWe continue to balance investments for future growth, including Tuck and M&A, with returning capital to shareholders primarily through our dividend and from time to time through opportunistic share repurchases. This calendar year, we've seen a significant value opportunity in our shares and allocated more capital to share repurchase. Since our Q4 earnings call in May, we repurchased an incremental $1.5 billion of our shares and in total $4 billion over the past two quarters.\nWe believe these buybacks will have an attractive return, given the conviction we have in growing our revenue, earnings, and free cash flow. As we go forward, we'll continue to focus on Tuck and M&A. Now let's cover guidance. Given our Q1 outperformance and positive momentum, we're raising our full-year revenue and EPS guidance. We now expect fiscal 2025 organic revenue growth of 4.5% to 5%, an increase from the prior range of 4% to 5%.\nFor Q2, we're expecting to deliver another quarter of mid-single digit growth in the top line, and we'd have you model organic revenue growth of approximately 4.5%. Based on recent rates, FX would have an unfavorable impact to fiscal 2025 in the range of $110 to 210 million, including $10 to 60 million in the second quarter. Moving down the P&L, we continue to expect our operating margins to expand this year as we drive efficiencies while also investing behind our product launches and in our long-term pipeline. Based on recent rates, currency becomes much less of an impact to our margins and bottom line after the second quarter.\nTaking this all together, we're raising our fiscal 2025 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance to a new range of $5.42 to $5.50, an increase from the prior range of $5.40 to $5.50. For the second quarter, we expect EPS of $1.24 to $1.26. The fiscal year 2025 guidance range continues to include an unfavorable 5% impact from foreign currency, including an 8% impact in Q2. Further details on our annual guidance can be found in the guidance slide in our presentation.\nTo wrap up, I want to emphasize that we are laser-focused on driving top-line growth and restoring the earnings power of the company. You saw that in our Q1 results, and you see it in our outlook for the rest of the year. We expect our EPS growth to accelerate in the back half as the impact from currency lessens, exiting the year with high-single-digit growth. Geoff, back to you. Al\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nl right. Thanks, Gary. Now, before we go to the analyst questions, I want to close with a few thoughts. Since becoming CEO, we've made a lot of changes to this company, all designed to improve performance. Chief among these strategies is how we allocate capital to disproportionately focus our R&D, our venture, and our M&A investments on the highest growth market opportunities, while still making sure our other businesses are competitive.\nNow you're seeing the payoff as we are at the front end of some exciting new product cycles. You're seeing it in diabetes and in neuromodulation, in TAVR and PFA. As I look at our pipeline, I expect this momentum to continue as we invest heavily in future growth opportunities like hypertension and surgical robotics. We've also been working on the fundamentals. The foundation of this company is now much stronger.\nQuality and operations are in a better spot, and we're investing in enhancing our digital capabilities across the company to improve our speed. We're playing more offense. We're building capacity in strategic growth areas. We're looking to further increase organic investments and are on the hunt for the right tuck-in M&A opportunities. We've integrated a performance-driven mindset and an incentive structure that reinforces this.\nIn some cases, we've changed leadership to add increased operating rigor to our mission-driven culture. Now, taken all together, this is now translating into the top-line growth momentum and improved earnings power that you're seeing in our results. As we continue to execute, this will create meaningful value for society and for shareholders. Finally, I'd like to thank all of our employees around the world.\nI realize that we've driven a lot of change, and that can be uncomfortable. I appreciate all that you've done to embrace these changes, and it's rewarding to see your efforts paying off. As we look to the next 75 years of Medtronic, I'm excited about the possibilities before us. Together, we're building a stronger and more resilient company. Thanks for all that you do to fulfill our mission and to serve patients.\nWith that, let's move to Q&A, where we're going to try to get as many analysts as possible. We ask that you limit yourself to just one question and only, if needed, a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, you can reach out to Ryan and the investor relations team after the call. With that, Brad, can you please give the instructions for asking a question?\n\nBrad Welnick\n\nVP of Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nFor the sell-side analysts that would like to ask a question, please select the participants button and click raise hand. If you're using the mobile app, press the more button and select raise hand. Your lines are currently on mute. When called upon, you will receive a request to unmute your line, which you must respond to before asking your question. Lastly, please be advised that this Q&A session is being recorded.\nFor today's session, Jeff, Gary, and Ryan are joined by Que Dallara, EVP and President of Diabetes, Mike Marinaro, EVP and President of the Medical Surgical portfolio, Sean Salmon, EVP and President of the Cardiovascular portfolio, and Brett Wall, EVP and President of the Neuroscience portfolio. We'll pause for a few seconds to assemble the queue. We'll take the first question from Vijay Kumar at Evercore ISI. Vijay, please go ahead.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Jeff, congrats on a really nice quarter here. Maybe my first question here is the organic execution in the quarter, well above your guidance expectations, I think, north of 100 basis points. It's also above your annual guidance, right? It seems like it was pretty broad-based. Based on your current outlook, it implies your back half should be below what your Q1 performance was, right? Maybe just talk about sustainability of Q1, why these trends can't sustain in the back half. Were there any one-offs that drove Q1 performance?\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nHey, Vijay, good to hear from you. Yeah, let me just answer that question directly. There was no one-offs that drove the performance. Overall, I'd say it's sustainable because, like I said in the commentary, we're in the beginning stages of some really exciting product cycles here into high-growth markets.\nIn our Q1, I'd see a couple of things set up like neuromodulation getting to double digits. That is really all about the new technology, that this is the first quarter we had both our pain stim closed-loop therapy, Inceptiv, as well as DBS closed-loop therapy out there at the same time. That growth is really driven by, we think, that's the new foundational technology sensing in the neuromodulation market.\nThat growth is driven strictly by demand of these new products and pricing uplifts that came with them. Structural heart, there's a lot of questions around the market there. We're seeing consistent market growth as we've signaled in that high-single-digit. We're just really launching FX+, going from limited market release to full market release, which is exciting. Plus, the accumulation of all the data, SMART, low risk, etc., is a real tailwind for us.\nTwo businesses that had a particularly strong Q1 that I'm not sure is going to at that high level throughout the year, one is diabetes. Diabetes should continue to have growth well above the company average. We're now annualizing the US launch of 780G. I can see diabetes in the teens last quarter. I'm not sure we're going to be able to sustain that the whole year.\nCRM also had a really good quarter, some great. We have a really nice product portfolio across all the CRM segments. We're not banking on CRM growing 8% every quarter. Those two, there was nothing one-time about them, but just really strong execution. I think across the company, I could just keep going on the list. There's just a lot of new products out there in the early stages. Overall, we feel good about the underlying fundamentals and where we're headed. We're focused on delivering on our commitments and issuing guidance. I'll end up issuing guidance that sets us up for success.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThat's helpful, Jeff. Maybe one follow-up related to that on the guidance question. Gary, welcome to your first earnings call. The gross margin performance here in Q1, really strong. Your guidance still does assume a pretty meaningful step up in operating margins for back half, right?\nWhen I look at your EPS guidance, low end was tweaked, but it looks like there was some benefit from share repurchases. I don't know if your prior guidance had baked in a $1.5 billion share repo. Maybe just talk about your margin visibility for second half, and did that change over the last three months?\n\nGary Corona\n\nEVP and Interim CFO, Medtronic\n\nYeah, thanks, Vijay. It's nice to meet you. I look forward to having a chance to meet all of you in person. Let me tackle your question about buyback first. I'll take you through the puts and takes of the first quarter EPS. Our EPS starts with our top line. As Geoff mentioned, our revenue growth was really strong, a full point higher than the midpoint of our guide.\nJeff talked about the highlights. The midpoint of our guide, two of the three cents, was really driven by the top line strength that he mentioned. Gross margins were strong, about 40 basis points ahead of consensus, and operating margin was in line. Below the line, there were some moving pieces.\nThat netted to about a penny with the benefit that you mentioned from the share count helping. We also had lower interest income and some pressure on the tax rate. That's a little bit more visibility into Q1. As we think about the leverage, first half,, second half,, the underlying leverage we're driving is pretty similar on a constant currency basis with high-single-digit every quarter. The ramp is really an FX story, significant pressure on H1 due to FX, and that'll wane in back half.\nConstant currency growth ticks up slightly as we drive stronger revenue growth as a number of our therapies get to full market release. As you know, we tend to have a pretty strong fourth quarter on the margin front. That's the story on how the leverage will play out throughout the year.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Vijay. Take the next question, please, Brad.\n\nBrad Welnick\n\nVP of Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nYeah. The next question comes from Robbie Marcus at JPMorgan. Robbie, please go ahead.\n\nRobbie Marcus\n\nMedtech Senior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOh, great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a good quarter. With my one, I wanted to ask about diabetes. This is a pretty big shift in strategy for you. You've always been the provider with both the pump, the algorithm, and the CGM all in one. Now with Simplera about to launch, maybe just walk us through the strategy of why partnering with Abbott was in your best interest. Does this change your strategy at all? How do we think about external versus internal investment in diabetes moving forward? Thanks.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Robbie. Yeah, I'll let Que answer that question. Go ahead, Que.\n\nQue Dallara\n\nEVP and President for the Diabetes Operating Unit, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Robbie. I would say our strategy hasn't changed at all. I think what's really changed in the market is really a widespread recognition that AID really does provide better outcomes than CGM alone or MDI alone. We always knew that there was a large install base of users that wanted access to our technology, our AID system. We still believe in the system benefits exceed the sum of the parts, as you mentioned, wrapping it all together with our algorithm, the CGM, the pumping devices.\nThe typical integration you see in the market puts a technology burden on the part of patients. We wanted to find a way to provide the one Medtronic experience, the one phone number you can call for patients that may prefer a different sensor. We're pleased to say that we found a path that works for patients from an experience standpoint, as well as for Abbott and for ourselves.\nThat's what I would say would be the response to your question. The strategy hasn't changed. We've just found a way to expand access to a broader install base. I think what hasn't changed is really our commitment towards the system, our confidence in our CGM. The Simplera and Simplera Sync launches in Europe have gone very well. We're very pleased with the early experience. We're pleased that we now have FDA approval for Simplera in the US. We're working with the agency to get Simplera Sync approved as well for integration with the 780G system.\n\nRobbie Marcus\n\nMedtech Senior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks a lot.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Robbie. Next question, please, Brad.\n\nBrad Welnick\n\nVP of Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThe next question comes from Travis Steed at Bank of America Global Research. Travis, please go ahead.\n\nTravis Steed\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst of Medical Technology, Bank of America Securities\n\nHey, guys. Congrats on the quarter. I'll ask my one question on TAVR. Just want to get kind of what you're sensing in the market today, given some of the comments from the competitor there. Looking forward, when you think about the FX+ launch, how do you expect that to impact the market, impact the share? Is that going to help you with some of the SMART data and how you see the TAVR market playing out? Thanks a lot.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nHey, Travis. I'm going to hand that one over to Sean.\n\nSean Salmon\n\nEVP and President for the Cardiovascular Portfolio, Medtronic\n\nTravis, thanks for the question. The TAVR market, we think, is pretty solid. I think we're growing in line with the market in high-single-digits right now. Of course, the data momentum that we have, the low-risk data versus surgery, I think that's been very compelling.\nI'm going to roll out five-year on that data in the coming year here as well. Of course, SMART data has really gotten a lot of attention for the right treatment strategy for small annuli, particularly women. That's resonated really globally too, as small annuli is a sort of a function of body habitus as well. Evolut FX+ has done exceptionally well in its early launch. We did a full limited market release in the month of July. We saw that momentum really pick up.\nI think that'll afford the FX+ a really good continued access or continued growth of that part of the segment. What people really like is those bigger windows that you can then align onto the native coronary anatomy. Overlapping the cusps to making sure that you get that commissural alignment and preserving future access. That's all done without any trade-off on deliverability. It's got the features of FX, which really improved the usability of that device.\nOf course, the US is moving into full market launch right now. Within this year, we'll also obtain approvals in other geographies, which will keep the momentum going. For us, I think the market's working really well. We're excited to bring this new technology.\n\nTravis Steed\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst of Medical Technology, Bank of America Securities\n\nGreat. Thanks a lot.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Travis. Next question, please, Brad.\n\nBrad Welnick\n\nVP of Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThe next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with UBS Securities. Danielle, please go ahead.\n\nDanielle Antalffy\n\nEquity Research Associate, UBS Securities\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for taking the question. Good morning, everyone. Congrats on a good start to the year here. Que, I just wanted to follow up on diabetes. Just how should we be thinking about this partnership with Abbott? Appreciating you're not giving timelines here. How are you thinking about it and how it could grow the installed base?\nSort of what are you thinking about? I mean, Abbott has a pretty large installed base today. Should we be thinking about that as low-hanging fruit for the pump side of the business? Any more color you can give on how we should think about this changing the trajectory for the diabetes business? Thanks so much.\n\nQue Dallara\n\nEVP and President for the Diabetes Operating Unit, Medtronic\n\nI mean, I think the most obvious opportunity for a very large install base of users that prefer the Abbott sensor to now have access to our technology. Unfortunately, I can't give you timelines, but rest assured that we're working as fast as we can to incorporate that sensor into our system and really providing that one Medtronic experience where there's one single app.\nPatients can choose between two sensor options, but still experience our AID system and the automation that comes with our algorithm. That's the user experience we want to bring to the market. We think that's pretty differentiated. It allows us to tap into the largest CGM install base in the world, in addition to growing our own install base.\n\nDanielle Antalffy\n\nEquity Research Associate, UBS Securities\n\nThank you.\nThanks, Danielle. Next question, Brad.\n\nBrad Welnick\n\nVP of Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThe next question comes from Larry Biegelsen at Wells Fargo Securities. Larry, please go ahead.\n\nLarry Biegelsen\n\nSenior Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question. For my one question, I wanted to ask about the progress with Hugo for Mike and Geoff. It sounds like you've reached the target enrollment in Expand URO, the pivotal US trial. When are we going to see the data? What's the timeline for US filing? Could we see potential launch this year or next year? Geoff, there's still questions around your commitment to Hugo. Just maybe put any of those concerns to rest here. Thank you.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nAll right. Thanks, Larry. Maybe I'll have Mike answer the first couple of questions, and then I'll come in afterwards.\n\nMike Marinaro\n\nEVP and President, Medical Surgical Portfolio, and Surgical Operating Unit, Medtronic\n\nYeah. Good morning, Larry. On Hugo, we are happy with the progress we're making in the clinical work. As mentioned, we have reached targeted enrollment. There is still work to do as we reach the final endpoints and then completing the filing. We won't be giving a specific date in terms of submission, but very good progress and very appreciative of the work that we're doing together with our surgeon partners and our teams.\nAlso, as noted, we're making good progress in the enrollment of both hernia and the gynecology clinical series that will allow us to then have a cadence of indications, which will be critical to the US launch. Very good work across the clinical series. Again, appreciative of the work of our surgeon partners and teams. Geoff\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah. Look, as Mike said, there's a couple of things on Hugo here, two inflection points that need to happen for us to see the impact at the Medtronic level, the US approval, and then just getting our leading instrumentation onto the robot and other capabilities. As Mike mentioned, we're making progress on both. This is like a midterm growth driver for us, I'd say, beyond the fiscal year. To get back to your question on our commitment, Larry, we're absolutely committed to this. With all due respect, we do think robotics is really across many different surgical areas, including orthopedics, where we play in spine, is a big driver in the space.\nWe're committed to being not just part of it, but helping to lead that like we're doing in spine. I know we're up against a really strong and entrenched competitor here in the soft tissue space. We are committed. We have levers to pull. We have a great surgery franchise. We've learned quite a bit about robotics over the years. Also the understanding that it's more than just the robot.\nIt's a lot of other technology that goes in there: imaging, navigation, the instrumentation, AI, so the digital piece. There's a lot to it, a lot of levers to pull. We're committed, and we're confident. I just point back to a couple of years ago, other franchises that people were questioning, \"Can you compete?\" Whether it's spine or whether it's diabetes or Neuromod. We're focused on it. You've seen those all get to a much, much better spot with the focus and investment.\nThat's where we are on surgery. my level of confidence on this is high because of the levers we have to pull, the team we have in place, the franchise we have. Knowing that the entrenched competitor is very strong. Understanding that, but still having confidence in our team.\n\nLarry Biegelsen\n\nSenior Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nThank you.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Larry. Next question, please, Brad.\n\nBrad Welnick\n\nVP of Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThe next question comes from David Rescott at Baird Equity Research. David, please go ahead.\n\nDavid Rescott\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird Equity Research\n\nOh, great. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the strong start to the year here. Geoff, I heard your comments on being on the hunt for M&A. I'm curious if you could help us kind of understand maybe what areas strategically you think make the most sense in the portfolio when you kind of think about the size of the Medtronic portfolio. I guess, how do you balance that kind of near-term, what can be needle-moving versus what can move the needle over the two to three-year period and three to five-year period? Thank you.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nThanks for the question, David. Yeah. I mean, look, on the M&A side, this is one of the areas. It's part of our larger capital allocation strategy, right? We talk about little-c-cap allocation and big-c-cap allocation. We're talking about allocating our money to the areas of highest growth. The M&A strategy has to play with our organic strategy, and both are pointed towards the highest growth areas.\nAblation, AFib ablation is a case in point where we did the Affera acquisition as well as a needle-crossing acquisition. Those are the areas that we're pointed to. We are still focused on value-creating tuck-in and M&A, so with that growth and margin profile that I just talked about. I don't want to point out specific areas other than the high-growth areas that are whether they be a product tuck into an existing business or an adjacency to an existing business tuck in. That's where we're focused.\nI think nothing's changed there, except that I think over the last year and a half or so, we've had a lot of operational focus areas that we've had. That's been the focus, is really getting the operations footprint in a better spot, our back orders down, things like that, quality in a better spot. We're in a much better spot there. I think can focus more of our energies on M&A. The explanation I just gave is where we'll be focused.\nThanks, David. Next question, please, Brad.\n\nBrad Welnick\n\nVP of Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThe next question comes from Matt Taylor at Jefferies. Matt, please go ahead.\n\nMatt Taylor\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHi. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I wanted to double-click on some of the comments that you made on the structural heart market. I'm really curious about your thoughts on capacity now and going forward. I know you said that you haven't seen signs of a slowdown in the market, but do you have concerns about capacity there longer term or more broadly? Is that a limiting factor in that business or any of your businesses? How would you deal with that as an organization to help free up more capacity to help your therapies run through?\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nWell, look, I'd say overall, I'm going to hand this over to Sean and Matt. The structural heart space, TAVR, and mitral's coming, tricuspid, it's very underpenetrated still. I do see a huge and the patient benefits are clear. Sean mentioned the data, whether it be low risk or now our SMART Trial.\nThe data is clear. It's underpenetrated. I still think this is a strong growth market. I'll let Sean touch again on kind of where we are, where the market is, if you will, on capacity and what we're seeing. Then maybe come back. Go ahead, Sean.\n\nSean Salmon\n\nEVP and President for the Cardiovascular Portfolio, Medtronic\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question. We're not hearing from our customers about capacity constraints. Of course, our sample size may be a little smaller than our competitor. We ask about the future for the service line as they add additional things into the structural heart component of it. It doesn't seem like at the operator level there's concerns.\nIn the US, of course, the freedom of beds for post-procedure that goes beyond TAVR, that's been a challenge. We're seeing some shifting of procedures to lower acuity settings to make room. Of course, the valve clinic, which works these patients up, that's something you just add capacity to when you need future capacity to expand it, and you get a long runway to look at it.\nI think with the expanding indications, we're pursuing a moderate aortic stenosis population, which is about two and a half million people in the US, and transcatheter mitral replacement valves and things like that. We'll work with centers to make sure that they have adequate training of operators and help them to expand capacity if it needs to be. In the short run, I really don't see a challenge. I think hospitals have a long enough runway to plan for space if they need it. I don't think it's a constraint on the future growth prospects of structural heart in total. Yeah.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nlook, I agree with Sean on this one. When we see situations like that, when there's capacity, in the past, we've stepped in and helped our hospital partners with capacity. Like in Europe, several years ago, we helped build out a number of and manage a number of cath labs when there was cath lab capacity constraints across Western Europe. I could see us doing this in the ASC space in the US to help build out that.\nWe talk with the imaging companies because a lot of the capacity is tied to imaging and work with them and work with our healthcare delivery partners to build out that capacity. That's how we would handle it if we were to see an issue. Like Sean said, we're not hearing that in TAVR.\n\nMatt Taylor\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Matt. Next question, please, Brad.\n\nBrad Welnick\n\nVP of Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThe next question comes from David Roman at Goldman Sachs. David, please go ahead.\n\nDavid Roman\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. I was hoping you could go into a little bit more detail on Affera. Geoff, you mentioned that it's still obviously pending FDA review and that you're in limited market release outside the United States. Can you maybe give us a little bit of perspective of what you've seen in Europe now about a year post-CE mark and whether we should use that as a proxy for thinking about how this product ramps in the US?\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nSure. Thanks for the question, David. A lot of interest, obviously, in our CAS business and AFib right now. Maybe I'll go back to Sean on this one.\n\nSean Salmon\n\nEVP and President for the Cardiovascular Portfolio, Medtronic\n\nYeah, David, thanks for the question. The demand for PFA has really been unbelievably strong. We're ramping up our capacity, as Jeff mentioned, to meet that strong and growing demand right now. Those gains that we're seeing are more than offsetting that cryo business, of course.\nWe're really in a unique position having this offering of both a kind of single-shot approach with our PulseSelect and then the point-by-point approach with Affera. PulseSelect, it's really gotten more case volume so far as we're moving that launch both within Europe and the United States. What we're hearing from customers is the precision and predictability of the handling of the catheter.\nImportantly, that it shows up really well both on mapping systems and on ultrasound. That's important because you've got to put the electrodes in the right spot in the tissue so you get good ablation and isolation without doing extraneous injury. That's really been appreciated.\nOf course, the point-by-point approach with Affera is really unique and differentiated for us as well. The same catheter being able to create this beautiful map, and you can use either energy source depending on where you want to be anatomically to avoid things like coronary spasm and the isthmus lines. Also the lattice tip, it's a really maybe underappreciated part of this Sphere-9 catheter.\nIt's got this lattice that has excellent electrode stability, and it's three times wider than a normal kind of ablation electrode you use for RF. The precision and speed of that is really fantastic. Look, on the technology side, everything's going really well. You're asking about ramping in Europe. There are more cost constraints in Europe, of course, than what we see in markets like the US and Japan, where new technology, even at a higher price, seems to get adopted. The uptake of PFA would be relatively slower, but still robust as we go ahead with this technology. I think there's some lingering questions on durability.\nWe'll see some data at the upcoming APHRS meeting where we'll show longer-term durability of our PulseSelect catheters. We've already demonstrated that with the Sphere-9. I'd say, look, the opportunity to offer patients something that's really safe, really effective, lasts a long time, I think really does open up the aperture for more and more patients to flow through. Waiting lists are a challenge for that business. I think having a more efficient procedure with great workflow really helps.\nThen, of course, we can leverage the larger portfolio of Medtronic to help with sort of the economics of this in any country and around the world. Look, I think the future for pulsed field ablation, we're just getting going, but this is going to be a really robust growth market for a long time to come.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYep. Just to emphasize something Sean said, we're really excited to be the only player with differentiated offerings in both the single-shot and this point-by-point segments of the market. Both PulseSelect and Affera have differentiated features. Sean mentioned the handling of the catheter and PulseSelect. That's really ramping for us quite well right now.\nAffera's the ramp, obviously, we don't have approval yet in the US, and the ramp for that will be a little behind where we are with PulseSelect, but PulseSelect is doing really welI. I think you just don't, yeah. I think the analyst community has kind of moved past PulseSelect a little bit. I'm not sure that's the right call. I mean, it's doing really well.\nThanks, David. We'll take the next question, please, Brad.\n\nBrad Welnick\n\nVP of Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThe next question comes from Jason Bedford at Raymond James. Jason, please go ahead.\n\nJayson Bedford\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Raymond James\n\nCan you hear me okay?\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYep, we can, Jason.\n\nJayson Bedford\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Raymond James\n\nOkay. Maybe just to follow along just on the CAS question. One, I guess, do you find that folks are waiting in the US for Affera/Sphere-9? Then second, you did talk about an acceleration in CAS revenue growing forward, an acceleration in growth. Do you expect to be in a position to grow faster than the market exiting the year?\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nSean, you want to take these? Yeah.\n\nSean Salmon\n\nEVP and President for the Cardiovascular Portfolio, Medtronic\n\nYes. I guess my first question, Jason, of course, people really, really want Affera. The vast majority of the ablation market favors point-by-point solutions with mapping in the United States in particular. The appeal of that product is really strong. No one's waiting for it. I mean, we're getting as much usage, maybe actually more from traditional point-by-point users as we are getting from single-shot users.\nAs we bring that technology out, I think the uptake is going to be pretty robust and rapid on top of what we're already doing with PulseSelect. Yes, I think that we've got the opportunity to grow fast in the market within this fiscal year, depending on the launch timing.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Jason. Thank you, Jason. Next question, please, Brad.\n\nBrad Welnick\n\nVP of Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThe next question comes from Joanne Wuensch at Citi. Joanne, please go ahead. Good morning.\n\nJoanne Wuensch\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Healthcare Research, Citi\n\nThank you so much for taking the question. Can we spend some time talking about the renal denervation market and the CMS NTAP for Symplicity? How do you see this market developing now that reimbursement is getting behind the product? Thank you.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question, Joanne. I mean, look, we're, like I said before, I'm super excited about RN. It's good to see the reimbursement taking shape with the CMS, with the outpatient payment determined. I'm sorry, the inpatient payment now determined and the outpatient payment on the table here. It's getting closer to that unlock, that reimbursement unlock. I'll let maybe Sean comment on this as well.\n\nSean Salmon\n\nEVP and President for the Cardiovascular Portfolio, Medtronic\n\nYeah. Thanks, Jeff. Joanne, thanks for the question. The payment is one part of it. We have coding and coverage, most importantly, that need to come. The codes are already established.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nWe've got, as you noted, in NTAP, we have inpatient coding. Outpatient is going to be more of the kind of procedure volume. We think less than 10% of the procedures are going to be done with more than a single midnight stay or on the inpatient setting. Really, it's that TPT or transitional pass-through payment that we're really waiting on.\nWe did hear from CMS on that this summer, just this month, where they're supporting our approach here for that application. This is a breakthrough device. That helps to get into those kind of payment codes. We expect to see that happen pretty soon. Of course, we're working really closely with CMS and with commercial payers on making sure we have coverage policies that are going to facilitate patient access.\nAgain, being a breakthrough technology, that helps you with the kind of urgency and speed at which we'll see CMS move. Look, I think all things on the reimbursement front are pointing exactly in the direction we're hoping to get them. We're excited to ramp this technology up and make it available.\nI will say that the level of excitement we're getting from physicians and from hospital systems about this new service line they can offer, as well as patients, and the early outcomes for patients that have been treated on this sort of case-by-case basis have been really phenomenal. Look, I think that unlock, as we've said all along, is going to be reimbursement. we're marching toward that. We're excited about the opportunity here.\nThank you, Joanne. I think we've got time for maybe two more questions. We'll take the next question, Brad.\n\nBrad Welnick\n\nVP of Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThe next question comes from Matt Miksic, Barclays. Matt, please go ahead.\n\nMatt Miksic\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays",
    "content2": "Hey, thanks so much for the question. If I could, just two quick follow-ups on some of the topics that have already been kind of explored here. The first for Sean, just on TAVR, I seem to remember that with the FX launch, there was some effect of price premium. There was some period of kind of stocking as you got into the launch.\nI'm just wondering if you could shed any light on the sort of shape of the next few quarters as you really begin to roll out FX+. Then the second for Gary on FX, I think there's some questions around the fact that the top-line FX impact actually eased a little bit, but the FX impact on the bottom line, the headwind of 5%, remained the same. You could maybe just flesh out for us again where some of the impacts of FX are in the P&L and how we think about those as the year progresses. Thanks so much.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nSean, you want to take a question?\n\nSean Salmon\n\nEVP and President for the Cardiovascular Portfolio, Medtronic\n\nYeah, sure. We are across the board, we price for value. We think there's more value. A modest price premium is built into our TAVR launch. It really is about picking up more volume on cases, more implants. The dynamics that you typically see when you bring a new product out are customers burning down their shelf inventory as they put a small amount of stocking per valve size, like a PAR level, as they ramp up for new technologies.\nWe saw both those dynamics occur in the early launch accounts where people are picking up a little bit of inventory, but also taking down inventory for the prior model, the FX, in the case of the US. It's always those sort of switching dynamics. I think that that's already baked into everything that we're forecasting for the continued growth of this product.\n\nGary Corona\n\nEVP and Interim CFO, Medtronic\n\nHi, Matt. This is Gary. Yeah, as you mentioned, the US dollar has weakened a bit in Q1. You'll see the benefits of that in the top line where we've communicated improvement in the impact of the FX. If recent rates hold, we now expect FX on revenue to be a negative impact of 120 to 210. That compares to 275 to 375. On the bottom line, the benefit is delayed due to our hedging program.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nBut we do expect to realize the benefits in future years. Where FX will show up for us this year will be a little bit different. It's going to show up a bit more in the gross margin line for us this year. As we mentioned, the impact of foreign exchange will wane in back half. As our strong underlying earnings growth on a constant currency basis continues, after we delivered a really nice shape of the P&L in Q1, we'll see that benefit flow through to reported EPS in back half.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nOkay. Thanks, Matt. We've got time for one more question. If we didn't get to your question, if there's any analysts on the line that still have questions, feel free to follow up with me after the call. We'll go to our last question, please, Brad. Yeah.\n\nBrad Welnick\n\nVP of Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThe final question comes from Patrick Wood at Morgan Stanley. Patrick, please go ahead. Beautiful.\n\nPatrick Wood\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you so much for taking the question. Quite a high-level one. You guys are now, I guess, getting the benefit of some heavy investment in previous years in the base business. I guess the question is, how does that make you feel of the interplay between reinvesting for growth on the product support side, on innovation relative to margins of the next, I don't know, year or two?\nHow do you see that interplay going forward of earnings leverage and investing in the base business versus trying to drive the top line? Any updated thoughts? That would be great. Thanks.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nSure. Thanks, Patrick. Look, we're committed to driving leverage down the P&L. A company of our size, I mean, that's something we should be able to do. We've got a lot of levers to pull to achieve that. At the same time, free up even more money for investment, which I'll get to. We are doing a number of things, measures to hold our kind of overhead and enabling expenses low, flat to low, so that we can reinvest more in the top line.\nWe're doing things that we've really focused on. Just like we have capital allocation focus, we also have a focus on our headcount and allocating human capital and where that goes. We've got that under control in a good spot. We're really trying to hold our G&A flat as a base case. Then target areas we want to add for growth. For example, as the RDN reimbursement comes in, we'll be adding more on our direct distribution for that.\nA very disciplined process to hold our expenses flat as a base case for G&A and then invest in the high growth areas. Also through a number of programs to drive efficiencies in our enabling functions, including the use of AI to drive some of these efficiencies. A lot going on there and really committed to investing back into the business for growth, whether it be on the direct distribution or the sales side, but more importantly, even on the R&D side.\nWe've raised that organic investment. Despite some of the challenges we've had over the last couple of years, we've raised that organic investment. Look, the tuck-in M&A, as I mentioned earlier, we'd like to kind of maybe over time here, increase the cadence of that to support that, because the cash flow of the company is strong to support that organic R&D.\nThat's how we're thinking about it. I think we can drive that leverage down the P&L. We've got a lot of different levers to pull to do that. At the same time, freeing up even more investment both from our income statement into R&D, but also using the strong cash flow from the balance sheet for tuck-in M&A. That's how we're looking at it. Again, prioritizing these high growth areas, but at the same time, making sure that the rest of our businesses are competitive. I feel like we've gotten to a good spot on that. We're seeing the benefits of that now. We're going to continue to see the benefits of that on into the future.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nOkay. Thanks, Patrick. Geoff, please go ahead with your closing remarks.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nOkay. Thanks, Ryan. Thank you. Thanks, everybody, for the great questions. We certainly appreciate your support and interest in Medtronic. We hope you'll join us for our Q2 earnings broadcast, which we anticipate holding on Tuesday, 19 November 2024. Now, that's the week before Thanksgiving in the US this year.\nAgain, as usual, we'll update you on our progress against our long-term strategies and our commitments, both short and long-term. With that, thanks for joining us and have a great rest of your day."

    "content": "Q4 2024 Medtronic PLC Earnings Call\n\nQ4 2024 Medtronic PLC Earnings Call\n\nMDTNYSEMAY 23, 8:00 AM\n\nOperator\n\nOn an as-reported basis, and all references to share gains or losses refer to revenue share in the First Calendar Quarter of 2024 compared to the First Calendar Quarter of 2023, unless otherwise stated. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. And finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. With that, let's head into the studio and hear about the quarter and the year.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nHello everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We delivered a strong finish to the fiscal year with broad strength across our businesses. Each of our four segments delivered mid-single digit or higher revenue growth, and this was on top of a strong mid-single digit performance last year. Throughout fiscal 2024, we delivered consistent mid-single digit revenue growth with over 5% for the full year. At the same time, we're making progress on our commitment to restore our earnings power, which is evident in our fiscal 2025 guidance. We're executing COGS cost-out programs while maintaining pricing and maximizing efficiencies in our operating overhead. We're translating our earnings into strong and improving cash flow, which we're investing to drive future growth and return to our shareholders.\nWe also continue to enhance our operating model to make the company even more resilient, and our global workforce is embracing a performance-driven culture that is translating into durable results. We made solid progress in fiscal 2024, and the momentum we're building into the new year has me very excited for 2025. We're at the beginning stages of new product cycles. The runway from the differentiated technologies we've recently launched, along with the innovation we will launch over the next 12 months, gives me significant confidence in our ability to drive durable growth.\nThese launches put us in a strong position in some of MedTech's most attractive markets, like AFib, structural heart, robotics, neuromodulation, hypertension, and diabetes. And this is further enhanced as we apply AI across our portfolio. All that to say, we are very optimistic about what we can achieve here in fiscal 2025 and beyond. Now let's turn to the details of our Q4 results, where we had a number of standout performances. We looked at our businesses in three categories: established market leaders, synergistic, and highest growth. Our established market leader and synergistic businesses both grew mid-single digits, while our highest growth businesses delivered high single-digit growth. Looking first at our established market leaders, combined, they made up just under half of our revenue and grew 5%.\nThe highlight of the quarter was cranial and spinal technologies. After growing 6% or higher every quarter this year, CST accelerated to 9% growth in Q4. I want to say that one more time: 9% growth in Q4. This was driven by an outstanding quarter for capital sales, with neurosurgery growing 14%. We had double-digit revenue growth in Mazor Robotics, StealthStation navigation, O-arm imaging, and Midas Rex powered surgical instruments. This pulled through in spine implants and biologics with high single-digit growth in biologics and mid-single-digit growth in core spine, including 8% core spine growth in the US. We also continue to see strong adoption of unit-adapted spine intelligence, our integrated AI surgical planning solution. Here, we're taking data and building deep learning models that see patterns and create personalized outcomes for patients.\nAs I've been sharing for several quarters now, our strategy of combining best-in-class implants and biologics with our best-in-class enabling technology and then adding our unique intelligence into the procedure is a winning formula in spine. We call it the AiBLE ecosystem, and it's a big competitive differentiator for us. AiBLE is creating value for patients. It's winning over surgeons all around the world, and it's changing the competitive dynamics of the spine marketplace. It's attracting the best reps to Medtronic to expand our business.\nNext, in Cardiac Rhythm Management, cardiac pacing therapies delivered another strong quarter of high single-digit growth. Our Micra leadless pacemaker franchise grew over 20%, driven by the adoption of our latest generation Micra AV2 and VR2, which improved procedure efficiency and increased battery longevity by 40%, to 16 or 17 years. Now, we hold the vast majority of share in the leadless pacing space. We also continue to expand our pacing leadership as the only company to offer an approved lead for an innovative alternative form of pacing called Conduction System Pacing.\nOur 3830 Conduction System pacing lead grew over 40%. In defibrillation solutions, we're seeing good early adoption of our innovative Aurora EV-ICD, which requires no leads in the heart. Now, as more implanters complete their training, we expect EV-ICD sales to ramp and become a significant driver of CRM growth, taking share from the competitor's SICD system.\nNext, in surgical, we grew 5%. Our advanced energy product lines grew high single digits on the continued launch of our LigaSure XP Maryland vessel sealer. We've now taken energy share from our main competitor for Q6 in a row. Our wound management business also grew high single digits as strong sales of our V-Loc barbed sutures also resulted in continued share gains from our main competitor. In Q4, we expanded the capabilities of our Touch Surgery digital ecosystem. Just as our AiBLE ecosystem is transforming spine, Touch Surgery is transforming laparoscopic and robotic surgical procedures. We collect robust data sets from surgeries, including video, to create models that inject intelligence into these procedures. We've launched 14 new AI-based algorithms on our Touch Surgery performance insights platform just at SAGES last month.\nThese first-in-class algorithms automatically analyze surgical procedures from anatomy to critical structures, enabling surgeons to objectively assess performance. We also launched Touch Surgery live stream, which enables secure and seamless telepresence, including training and proctoring from a procedure room to really anywhere in the world. Overall, adoption of our Touch Surgery ecosystem is accelerating, and it's becoming a very important differentiator for our surgical franchise. Now, turning to our synergistic businesses, combined, they grew 5% in Q4. Cardiac surgery, ENT, and endoscopy all grew high single digits. Pelvic health, coronary, peripheral vascular, and neuromodulation all grew mid-single digits. In neuromod, brain modulation had an outstanding quarter, growing low double digits. This was the Q1 of benefit from the launch of Percept RC with BrainSense technology, the only complete sensing-enabled DBS system on the market.\nHere, we're seeing strong uptake and excitement for this exclusive technology, and it's extending our number one leadership position in DBS in both Europe and in the US. Our Neuromod business also received really great news at the end of Q4, with the US FDA approving the Inceptiv closed-loop spinal cord stimulator. The Inceptiv platform is a game changer in chronic pain therapy. The device automatically senses and adjusts stimulation 50 times a second, 24/7, with no required interaction from the patient. And the therapy is delivered from the smallest and thinnest closed-loop SCS device on the market, along with the best 3T and 1.5T full-body conditional MRI access. Given all these advantages will now be carried in the bags of our very large SCS sales force, we expect PainStim to grow above market in the coming quarters.\nNow let's cover the highlights from the businesses in our highest growth markets. Combined, they made up 20% of revenue and grew high single digits. We expect that their contribution to overall growth will accelerate over the coming quarters as we launch new technology. I'll start this quarter with cardiac ablation solutions, which delivered 21% sequential growth in the quarter, including 23% in the US. This is driven by our pulse-fueled ablation products, which are more than offsetting declines in our cryo product line.\nQ4 marked the Q1 of our PulseSelect PFA catheter launch. It's off to a great start with strong adoption from both focal RF, and single-shot users. As we expand the PulseSelect launch, we also continue to advance our robust pipeline of PFA technology. Last week, US pivotal data for our Sphere-9 focal catheter were presented to HRS and published in Nature Medicine.\nThese data were impressive, especially when you consider we were studying persistent AFib patients, the most challenging to treat. We showed Sphere-9 has an excellent safety profile, superior efficiency, and numerically higher freedom from recurrent AFib compared head-to-head with the market-leading traditional RF ablation technology. Sphere-9 can perform both PFA and RF ablation, as well as high-density mapping, all from a single device. We're looking forward to offering US clinicians this first-of-its-kind wide focal catheter. The output of all this is that we expect our CAS business to continue to accelerate its growth throughout the coming fiscal year as we increase our PFA account training and catheter production to meet the high demand. Over time, we expect our CAS business will reach market growth and then win share.\nThis will be driven by our PFA launches and the pull-through of a broader portfolio, treating the growing population of patients with AFib. Next, in structural heart, TAVR continues to be a very important growth driver for Medtronic, and we grew high single digits in the quarter. Structural heart had two meaningful developments during Q4. First, data from our SMART Trial was published in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at ACC last month. SMART, well, it clearly showed our valve was better than Edwards SAPIEN in small annulus patients, who are primarily women. This is a large segment of the TAVR space, about 40%, which is larger than most realized.\nNow, while it takes time to broadly change clinical practice and change customer contracting, we're seeing early signs from many loyal SAPIEN users that they expect to increase their usage of Medtronic valves, and we're building our business for that growth. The second important development in Q4 was receiving US FDA approval for Evolut FX+, our newest TAVR valve. FX+ has large windows in the frame to allow easy coronary access while providing the same exceptional valve performance of our Evolut platform.\nWe've just started the limited launch now and are receiving really strong positive feedback from physicians. Full market release is expected in August. So when you consider our four-year low-risk data, our SMART data, and our new FX+ valve, we expect this combination to drive our TAVR growth at or above the market, especially as the FX+ launch ramps in our second fiscal quarter.\nTurning to robotic surgical technologies, we're establishing a strong foundation here, and we continue to expand the Hugo Systems installed base. In the US, we are nearing completion of our urology pivotal trial. We also have now started enrollment in two new indication studies, hernia, and gynecology. In addition, our development teams are making progress, bringing our advanced surgical technologies to Hugo, such as ICG and our LigaSure vessel sealing technology. In diabetes, our team delivered another strong quarter, growing 11% globally.\nIn the US, we grew 12% as the rollout of the MiniMed 780G system continues. New US users doubled year-over-year again this quarter. And since launch, we've seen a significant increase in CGM attachment rates, resulting in high teens growth in US CGM revenue in Q4. Users are choosing our differentiated 780G system for the outcomes it delivers, all with less effort and less burden.\n780G is the only AID system that provides both basal insulin adjustments and correction doses every five minutes. It offers flexible glucose targets as low as 100 and features our proprietary meal detection technology. This all leads to 780G users achieving a high time in range, as well as spending more time in automation with our SmartGuard technology. In Europe, we began the limited launch of Simplera Sync with 780G, and we're preparing for a commercial launch this summer.\nThe early users and their healthcare providers are giving us fantastic feedback. Simplera Sync is half the size of our current sensor, is disposable, and it's a lot easier to put on. In the US, I'm pleased to announce that we have now submitted Simplera Sync to the FDA. Look, the turnaround in diabetes is palpable and now becoming a sustained growth story.\nWe're committed to getting the business back to market leadership. This is why we're investing heavily in expanding indications for 780G system and developing next-generation differentiated technology. This includes durable pumps, smart pens, patch pumps, CGM, and software and algorithms. You've seen us execute a steady drumbeat of submissions, product approvals, and expanded indications. This is a cadence we expect to continue. We're the only company building out a complete ecosystem of leading technology for patients who require intensive insulin management.\nWe believe this strategy positions us well and will drive our growth as the market continues to shift to automated insulin delivery and smart dosing. Finally, turning to hypertension, we believe Symplicity will become an important growth driver for Medtronic. Since gaining approval last year, we've been training physicians, and we're getting very favorable feedback from both clinicians and patients.\nWe've also been working very closely with both CMS and private payers in the United States and expect to make significant progress on coverage and payment here in fiscal 2025. With over 1 billion people worldwide living with hypertension, and every 1% penetration into the target market is over $1 billion of revenue, our Symplicity procedure represents a massive opportunity.\nNow, with that, let's go to Karen for a deeper look at Q4 financial performance and our fiscal 2025 guidance. Karen, over to you.\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nEVP and CFO, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Geoff. So recapping our financials, the Q4 was yet another where we delivered on our commitments, growing 5.4% ahead of expectations. We continue to drive durable mid-single digit revenue growth as committed, with more than 5% in fiscal 2024.\nImportantly, we accelerated our comp-adjusted growth every quarter, and adjusted EPS in the Q4 was $0.46, at the upper end of our guidance range and exceeding consensus. The strength of our global business was apparent, with broad-based growth around the world. As I noted last quarter, we expected our US growth to improve as we launched new products, and we delivered that with mid-single digit growth. Our non-US developed markets also grew mid-single digits, including 7% growth in Western Europe and 5% growth in Japan. Emerging markets remained strong, growing 13% and now comprises 18% of our total revenue. Looking down the P&L, our adjusted gross margin was roughly stable at 65.8%, as our cost-out programs offset inflation.\nOur adjusted operating margin declined slightly more than expected, given higher sales incentives on the higher revenue, along with increased investments we've made in SG&A to support upcoming product launches. That said, we delivered operating profit in line with expectations. We also continued to drive strong improvement in our free cash flow during the quarter, as we focused across the organization on working capital. In fact, our free cash flow increased by 14% over last year to $5.2 billion, with a conversion rate well north of 100% in the back half of the year. Looking ahead to fiscal 2025, we expect to continue to drive a year-over-year increase in both free cash flow and our conversion rate. Turning to capital allocation, our robust balance sheet allows us to operate from a position of strength.\nAs you know, we prioritize both investing in our future growth and returning capital to our shareholders. We continue to evaluate tuck-in and M&A opportunities against a high bar as we prioritize profitable growth. And to our shareholders, we remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow. In fact, in FY24, we returned $5.5 billion through both dividends and share repurchases. And over the past few months, we've repurchased over $2.5 billion in the open market, reflecting the confidence we have, as we finalized our plan, in our ability to deliver ahead.\nThis confidence is also evident in the decision by our board to increase our dividend for the 47th consecutive year, which we announced this morning. The yield from our growing dividend is an important component of the total return we generate for our shareholders.\nIt's worth noting that we've been able to grow our dividend by 30% over the past five years and 130% over the past decade. Now, turning to our guidance. After Q6 in a row, we firmly established a track record of delivering durable mid-single digit revenue growth. As Geoff mentioned, we're at the beginning stages of many new product cycles that enable confidence in our top line. Given this backdrop, we'd have you start the year modeling our fiscal 2025 organic revenue growth at 4% to 5%, including 4% to 4.5% in Q1. Our product launches will be ramping through the year, so we expect revenue growth to accelerate through the quarters as well. By segment, we'd expect our three portfolios to be roughly aligned with the corporate average and diabetes to grow above the corporate average.\nOur organic growth guidance continues to exclude revenue reported in other, as well as foreign exchange. I direct you to the guidance slide in our earnings presentation for additional details. Regarding currency, based on recent rates, we would see a full-year unfavorable impact to revenue in the range of $275 to 375 million, including an unfavorable impact of $85 to 135 million in Q1. Down the P&L, we expect expansion in our operating margin as we drive efficiencies in our overhead spend. At the same time, we continue to appropriately invest in R&D to drive future growth. Taking all of this together, we're guiding our fiscal 2025 non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $5.40 to 5.50, including $1.19 to 1.21 in Q1.\nThis includes an unfavorable 5% impact from foreign currency for the full year, with an unfavorable 6% impact in the Q1 based on recent rates. Our fiscal 2025 outlook reflects our commitment to restore our earnings power, with EPS growth at the midpoint of about 5%. Importantly, at current rates, the impact from currency lessens through the year. So we expect to be ending the year with high single-digit EPS growth on a reported basis, in line with our longer-term objective.\nNow, as we close this important fiscal year, I want to take a moment to express my gratitude to the employees of Medtronic around the world. The important results we delivered this year are all due to your hard work, dedication, and commitment to Medtronic and our mission. Thank you for being the driving force behind our success. Geoff, sending it back to you.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nAll right. Thank you, Karen. Now, before we go to the analyst questions, I'll close with a few brief remarks. I hope you're feeling what we are, that the momentum that Medtronic is building, momentum that was set in motion by the comprehensive transformation we embarked on a few years ago. We streamlined our operating model, we put in place performance-driven culture, and we changed incentives. We brought in new leaders, we improved how we allocate capital, and we started the work of driving significant operational efficiencies to leverage our scale. This transformation is taking hold, and you're seeing it in our results. And just in time for a very important Medtronic milestone, we're celebrating our company's 75th anniversary this year. It was back in 1949 that a medical electronics repair business was started in a garage in Minneapolis.\nNow, certainly, a lot has changed over the past 75 years, but what hasn't stopped from the humble beginnings in that garage is our spirit of innovation and our dedication to delivering life-transforming health technology that alleviates pain, restores health, and extends life. As we celebrate our past, we are even more excited about our future. That legacy of invention and market creation continues today. And you see it. You see it with our PFA products in AFib, our sensing products in neuromodulation, and our 780G in Simplera Sync system.\nYou see it with our robotics, with our Evolut TAVR system, and our Symplicity hypertension procedure, and the dozens of new products across our businesses. Our pipeline of breakthrough innovation is impressive, and I'm incredibly excited about the impact that these products will have on patients, on physicians, and on our performance.\nIt's these new product cycles, combined with exposure to secular growth markets and an aging population, that put us in a great spot to continue delivering durable revenue growth. When you add this to our improving earnings power, our strong free cash flow, and dividend growth, you have a great formula for creating shareholder value. Finally, I'd like to join Karen in expressing my gratitude to our employees watching today. We've been through a lot of change, but through it all, your unwavering focus on our mission and performance has propelled our company forward. Your contributions matter, not just for Medtronic, but for the millions of patients around the world that depend on us. As we continue to innovate and grow, I'm confident that together, we will achieve even greater heights in fiscal 2025.\nWith that, let's move to Q&A, where we're going to try to get to as many analysts as possible. We ask that you limit yourself to just one question and only, if needed, a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, you can reach out to Ryan and the investor relations team after the call. With that, Brad, can you please give the instructions for asking a question?\n\nOperator\n\nFor the sell-side analysts that would like to ask a question, please select the Participant button and click Raise Hand. If you're using the mobile app, press the More button and select Raise Hand. Your lines are currently on mute. When called upon, you will receive a request to unmute your line, which you must respond to before asking your question. Lastly, please be advised that this Q&A session is being recorded. For today's session, Geoff, Karen, and Ryan are joined by Que Dallara, EVP and President of Diabetes; Mike Marinaro, EVP and President of the Medical Surgical Portfolio; Sean Salmon, EVP and President of the Cardiovascular Portfolio; and Brett Wall, EVP and President of the Neuroscience Portfolio. We'll pause for a few seconds to assemble the queue.\nWe'll take the first question from Travis Steed at Bank of America. Travis, please go ahead.\n\nTravis Steed\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research of Medical Technology, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask about the EPS guidance. Ex-currency 9% to 11%. I guess buyback maybe adds 1% to 2% there, but still kind of above kind of what Medtronic historically has done. So I wanted to kind of understand the puts and takes better on your EPS guidance and how you're going to get there. And then kind of longer term, you're talking a lot about restoring earnings power. How should we think about kind of the pathway on growing kind of EPS beyond FY25? Thanks for the question.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nWell, Travis, thanks for the question. And I'm going to hand this to Karen in a second, but let me just make a few opening comments on this. Look, the earnings power is something we've been working on for years. For example, we started our aggressive global operations and supply chain transformation over three years ago. We've been improving pricing. You see that in our FY24 results. And we're strengthening this muscle and building on our momentum on pricing going into FY25.\nWe've made some tangible changes to NAICS, like exiting our ventilation business and divesting our dialysis business. These are a couple of examples. I'm sure Karen will go through them in more detail. But the point is, I think they're structural, programmatic, structural changes to the enterprise that are allowing us to achieve top-line growth, but at the same time, growing that earnings power.\nLike I said, they're structural, they're programmatic, and they're giving us the confidence to FY25 and beyond in terms of that earnings power improvement. So Karen, you can walk through some of the details on this.\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nEVP and CFO, Medtronic\n\nSure. Thanks, Geoff and Travis. So I would say in 2025, we're focused on three key things: delivering continued mid-single digit top-line growth while executing on our strong pipeline, investing in our high-priority growth drivers, and restoring the earnings power of the company, as Geoff talked about. Our guidance all starts with confidence and durability on our top line. We've got really high confidence, given the track record that we've had over the last Q6 and the fact that we've got this very robust pipeline coming to market. Much of it's already been approved by regulators, and much of it is also moving from limited market release to full market release. So we expect on gross margins it to be flat year over year on a constant currency basis because we've got costs down and pricing offsetting inflation.\nOn operating expenses, we continue to make appropriate investments in R&D to drive our future growth. We'll really drive leverage in SG&A. That's through programmatic changes that we've implemented throughout the company, including discipline on headcount, focus on discretionary expenses. We've also got increased use of automation and digitization. We've elevated the review and reporting on our expenses and our margins. We've driven some structural changes too, like eliminating our respiratory interventions operating unit. On this expense, we've taken costs out already, and you're seeing the full benefit of it this year. We actually drove this kind of leverage in 2024. It was just masked by the impact of the true-up and incentive compensation that we did from 2023 to 2024.\nAnd then on top of operating leverage, you'll also see a large benefit from reduced share count, which will be a bit offset by incremental interest and tax. But when you put it all together, we expect this 4% to 5% top-line growth, along with operating leverage and share count, to deliver that high single-digit EPS growth for the year. And as our currency headwinds abate, we've said we expect high single-digit actual or reported EPS in the back half of the year. And that goes to beyond this fiscal year. So beyond FY25, we're focused on maintaining this mid-single digit revenue growth and continuing to drive leverage down the P&L to deliver that high single-digit EPS growth.\n\nTravis Steed\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research of Medical Technology, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thanks a lot. I hope that gets at.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Travis. Next question, please, Brad.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Robbie Marcus at JPMorgan. Robbie, please go ahead.\n\nRobbie Marcus\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOh, great. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking those questions. Maybe to start, I wanted to zero in. In the guide, you have accelerating revenue growth, it feels like, throughout the year with Q1 where it is, probably second half better than first half. I was hoping you could spend a minute on some of the products there because there's a lot of moving pieces and how we should think about the sources for upside and your confidence levels around that upside. And then I have one follow-up.\nSure. I'll take a stab at this, Robbie. And Karen can jump in if I missed anything here. Well, first of all, look, we've got a lot, as has been pointed out by many of you on the call here, a lot of approvals here recently and really high-growth areas. And we're in the early stages of these launches. But specifically, to answer your question here, in FY25, some of the one is in structural heart with Evolut FX as it moves from this limited market release in the US to full market release.\nWe're seeing strong uptake.And the SMART Trial continues to build. The SMART Trial results and small annuli continue to build on our body of clinical evidence. And we are seeing it change referral patterns. I mean, it's pretty clear here what to do with these patients.\nIt's a bigger cohort of patients than I think most imagined, 40% of the market. So structural heart, TAVR is one, Evolut FX+ the changing referral patterns from SMART. PFA is another one. We've got PulseSelect here. You saw the results with over 20% sequential growth in the business. We really haven't seen anything from Affera yet that's coming. So PFA is going to be a big one for us. Throughout the year, it's accelerating. Leadless, not only, I mean, look, first of all, we still maintain the lion's share of the market here. We just launched, recently launched, and we're continuing to take share. We just launched Micra AV2 and VR2. The market's expanding. UnitedHealth Group, which you guys know is the largest commercial insurer in the US, just updated its policies to cover leadless pacemakers.\nAnd so you see us performing strong, new launches in an expanding market. So that's some of the cardiovascular-related ones. And then, again, our EV-ICD as well. So there's a lot for FY20 in this fiscal year from cardiology. Neuroscience also has a lot. I mean, spine; you saw the acceleration. We expect that to continue with the combination of the implants plus the enabling technology plus the AI having a real impact. And this has been something we've been building on.\nAnd you're seeing good performance relative to the competition. I mean, I know there's a lot of buys out there on Globus. But when you look at apples to apples, we grew 9%, and they grew 3% on an apples to apples pro form a basis in the year. When you look at the combined invasive and Globus, that's 3%, and we're 9%. That's a pretty big gap.\nWe've got four times the installed base, which is really a key to growth in that market now. ENT continues to do well, and that's accelerating from the continued adoption of Propel and Sinuva that came from the Intersect acquisition. Of course, in Neuromod with the closed-loop technology, Percept RC. In my prepared remarks, you heard DBS growing double digits. Right at the end of the quarter, we got the launch of the approval of Inceptiv, which is our ECAPs, closed-loop stimulator for pain. We think it's a better product that's on the market. With our large sales force, we're going to do some damage there. The diabetes, the 780G, US growth continues, low double digits. I think we're going to continue to surprise people on diabetes and show continued strength.\nAnd then, of course, Hugo and Ardian are both really good leading indicators of growth that you'll be seeing later in the year. So, I mean, there's a lot spread across the businesses. And that's why we have the confidence in the mid-single digit revenue growth. And Karen talked about how that translates to the bottom line.\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nEVP and CFO, Medtronic\n\nYep. I would just add just briefly that our end markets are growing. Our back orders are down. Our supply chain is improved. The impact of VBP in China is largely behind us. Then, obviously, we've got the long list of products that Geoff talked about.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah. And said another way, we're entering the year with a lot less questions too, like risks. Go back a year ago, China, a lot of uncertainty there. We had a high single-digit growth for the year, accelerating throughout the year, double digits in the last Q2. So putting these things, some of these questions, risks, or obstacles behind us is also, I think, another one that just the elimination of those plus the addition of the new products is, you add it all up, it feels good going into the year.\n\nRobbie Marcus\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Maybe a quick follow-up here. Karen, I appreciate the high-level building blocks down the P&L. I was hoping you could put a little more meat on the bone. You talked about gross margin expansion. How should we think about that? It sounds like R&D, D leverage, SG&A. You have a lot of costs. I think that drove the miss in operating margin in Q4. So how do we think about the level of investment versus savings in SG&A? It sounds like that does get us to a positive operating margin expansion. And then how do we think about the level of tax? I know it's going higher, but how much higher? Thanks.\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nEVP and CFO, Medtronic\n\nSure, Robbie. So just on the detail on gross margin, I said we expect it flat on a constant currency basis. We will have some currency headwinds, about half a point of downward pressure on gross margin at recent rates. But as I said, we've got good costs down and pricing offsetting inflation there. And those currency headwinds on the gross margin line should abate as we move through the year and be gone as we exit the year. As we look at R&D and SG&A, I would say in R&D, we're focused on continuing to invest.\nIt's a critical priority to us. I've talked about it being the one line item that's allowed to grow in line or more than revenue in certain years. And we've been focused on driving efficiencies across the company, including in R&D, to enable these levels of investment.\nSome of the recent portfolio moves we've made, like setting up the JV for our renal care or shutting down our ventilator business, has allowed us to reallocate investment into our highest strategic priorities in R&D. So that remains an area of investment. And then on SG&A, we are focused on driving continued significant leverage in SG&A. And I talked about the programmatic savings that we've been driving that you're seeing more this fiscal year than you saw last year. We actually drove this kind of leverage in 2024. I said it was just masked by the impact of the true-up and incentive compensation. So we're excited about what we're going to continue to drive in SG&A. And then on tax, we expect tax to be a bit of a headwind given global tax reform.\nWe're pleased with the work that we've done to offset some of this, both on the tax line and above the tax line. But we expect it to be about a point higher than we had this past fiscal year.\n\nRich Newitter\n\nManaging Director, Truist Securities\n\nWhen you think about FY25, on the bottom line, as Karen mentioned, that's going to come from operating margin actions. And it goes beyond expense management. These are programmatic changes we've made in FY24. And we'll see the full benefit of it. So these are changes that are made in the bank, and you'll see the full benefit of that in FY25. On the gross margin line, which is super important, those programs are underway.\nAnd as Karen mentioned, it's hard to see that because of some of the inflation and FX. But as we get into FY26, as those abate, you'll see that gross margin start to expand as well. So we think we've laid this out the right way and got the programs lined up against it and have been working on it for some time. We'll see those benefits accrue over the next couple of years.\n\nRobbie Marcus\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks a lot.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThank you, Robbie.Next question, please, Brad.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Vijay Kumar at Evercore. Vijay, please go ahead.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And congrats on a nice strong quarter here. Geoff, one on your restoring EPS power comments. What does that mean? What is the right base we should be thinking of? Are we thinking of operating margins perhaps getting back to upper 20s? Is there a timeframe for that? And maybe some clarification on what that means?\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nWell, look, I'm going to have Karen answer that. She kind of hit on that some in her prepared remarks, but have her kind of redo some of that. But like I said just a second ago, on the operating margin, we've got a lot of confidence in that for the year, given the changes we've already made. And the changes we've already made in the gross margin line and our continuing expansion, those will start to hit in the later part of the year and move into next year. I'll let Karen kind of quantify it.\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nEVP and CFO, Medtronic\n\nYeah. And just on restoring the earnings power, Vijay, it means that we are focused on driving that durable mid-single digit top line. It starts there, but then driving leverage down the P&L to deliver high single-digit EPS. And you'll see us exit the year of FY25 doing that. And we're focused on maintaining it and driving it continued from there.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nUnderstood. And just related to that, when you say operating margin leverage this year, is that on an FX basis? Or what's the implied operating margins on a reported basis for fiscal 2025?\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nEVP and CFO, Medtronic\n\nYeah. We're expecting margins around 26% in 2025. That's on a reported basis.\nSo up from where we were.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nYeah.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThank you, Vijay. Next question, Brad.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Larry Biegelsen at Wells Fargo. Larry, please go ahead.\n\nLarry Biegelsen\n\nSenior Medical Technology Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Congrats on a nice quarter here. Hey, Sean, it was great to see the mid-single digit growth in AF solutions in Q4. And congrats on the Affera data. How should we be thinking about the AF business before the Affera launch in the US? Just remind us on the launch timing there and where you are with supply and your ability to get mapping equipment and personnel out there in the field. Thanks for taking the question.\n\nSean Salmon\n\nEVP and President of Cardiovascular Portfolio, Medtronic\n\nYeah. Thanks, Larry. Yeah. First of all, the business is doing exceptionally well. That sequential growth that we've seen and the demand and interest coming out of both HRS and Affera for our new technologies is really astonishingly great. It's really high. And I'd say in the United States, pulsed field is moving pretty fast there. And we're catching that wave, obviously, with our first entry here. And I'd say that as we scale up for further penetration and therapy, there's lots of other approvals we're getting around the world. There's expansion of capacity. And the most important thing to get Affera to the United States was that last module of clinical data, as you saw, that was really pristine, taking on head-to-head the market-leading technology and just narrowly missing on superior efficacy. So that's all boding well.\nTo your point, though, the things we have to get right are scaling up manufacturing. And that's something we've employed a lot of effort toward. We've moved into new Medtronic facilities away from the sort of acquired clean room that we purchased with Affera. And the last point, you'd asked about capital. And that's certainly not going to be a barrier to our success. We have all kinds of ways of helping with capital acquisition, including placing capital, leasing capital costs, things like that, that we'll be availing ourselves to throughout the launch of that product as well. So, look, I think all things are going up. We're really excited about pulsed field ablation. And the customers are really kind of beating the door down for it every single day. So it's exciting to be part of.\n\nRobbie Marcus\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks for taking the question.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Larry. Next question, please, Brad.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Peter Chickering at Deutsche Bank. Peter, please go ahead.\n\nPeter Chickering\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey. Good morning, guys. Quick questions on margins this quarter. The operating margins were a little bit softer than expected due to SG&A pressures. Can you just walk through what the variance was versus expectations? You talked about higher sales comp and corporate product launches. Just want to make sure I understand what happened versus what you were expecting.\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nEVP and CFO, Medtronic\n\nYeah. Thanks, Peter, for the question. You're right. So with the outperformance that we had on the top line, we did have some incremental incentive accruals in the quarter on sales incentive comp. And we've purposely driven investments in our strategic growth drivers as we work to commercialize many of the exciting innovations that we've got heading into 2025. We did all this and absorbed the incremental incentive comp and investments while still delivering on our financial commitments and beating the bottom line. But that's what it was driven by.\n\nPeter Chickering\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. And then Cranial's fine. We're pretty strong this quarter. Can you talk about the durability of that growth and sort of where we should be thinking about that growing in fiscal 2025? Thanks so much.\n\nBrett Wall\n\nEVP and President of Neuroscience Portfolio, Medtronic\n\nYou bet. Hey, Peter. It's Brett Wall. Thanks for the question. We think it's very durable. If you look at where this business is going, as Geoff mentioned, we grew three times our nearest competitor in the space. And that's on a very large base of business. We are recruiting the best sales reps. We have this technology system with AiBLE that is allowing us to change how spine surgery is being done. We are recruiting physicians, sales reps, and our technology is making a difference in the marketplace. We see that as durable for several, several quarters here.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah. Just one final point on that, Peter, is the model in the industry is changing to this capital equipment, this enabling technology. Now, the enabling technology, you have to have good stuff. It has to be integrated. It has to have value. AI is a big piece of that. And accounts are making investments in a company now. The Medtronic ecosystem, AiBLE versus some other ecosystem. And there's not many out there, right? So that's why we keep emphasizing our installed base.\nAnd it's also changing the industry structure because this takes a lot of expertise and capital to build these ecosystems. So you don't have this long tail of tiny spine companies that are preying on docs. Those are going away. And so that's why we think this is durable. And yeah, we're investing heavily in this area and have been for years.\n\nPeter Chickering\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thanks so much.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThank you, Peter. Next question, please, Brad.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Josh Jennings at TD Cowen. Josh, please go ahead.\n\nJosh Jennings\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nHi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I had trouble with the mute button there. I wanted to ask about emerging markets. Almost just under 20% of the revenue base grew double digits in fiscal 2024. Maybe just help us understand some of the puts and takes there. I think Karen, you said most of the VBP headwinds are behind Medtronic now heading into fiscal 2025. China is almost 40% of the emerging market revenue base. Can you just talk about overall emerging market trends, expectations for sustainable double-digit growth, and specifics around China? Can we see acceleration in Medtronic's performance and growth in China? Thanks for taking the question.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nSure, Josh. Thanks for the question. Look, as I think most of you know, I mean, emerging market focus has been something that we've been on for a long time and has been almost like an independent growth driver for us up until basically COVID, right, when certain markets like China shut down and then you had VBP. So the last couple of years have been choppy on emerging markets, I would say. But those fundamentals are coming back, right? VBP is almost like China's a big one there, right? VBP is mainly behind us, not totally. You've seen, I'd say we're 80% of the way there. And you've seen the growth accelerating throughout the year. For us, the last Q2, double digits for China.\nWhen that last, call it, we don't think there's a little bit of, I'll call them, hanging chads on VBP and the timing of those tenders. Some of our smaller businesses, like aortic or peripheral vascular, and there's a little bit left in neurovascular. When those hit, it could impact a quarter. So going from that double digits down to mid-single. But we see in any given quarter, mid-single to high single to double. But China's by and large back, and the procedures are strong. That's a big part of our emerging market business. We're a combination there of import and local. That also gives us some strength, our local product investments. Those local products also can be exported to other parts of the world.\nSo I think the other thing we've done here over the last couple of years is empowered our emerging market leaders a bit more than we had in the past. They're able to allocate resources, I think, more effectively because healthcare is local, and these markets have different emphasis on different clinical areas. Some have more cath labs than others, and that makes a difference, for example. So with our emerging market leaders able to have more influence and control over the resources, that's helped accelerate our growth as well.\nI think the fundamentals are back, especially in China. Some changes we've made to our model and our incentives have helped as well. Our continued investment in value products. You add all that up, and I see this as a continued strength and a continued source of growth for the company over a decade plus.\n\nJosh Jennings\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nAnything else?\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nEVP and CFO, Medtronic\n\nYeah. I would just say on VBP, that can affect a quarter at an OU level, but we don't necessarily expect it to affect total Medtronic.\n\nJosh Jennings\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nJust maybe one quick follow-up. Any product launches that we should be thinking about as we build out or update our model for fiscal 2025, particularly in these emerging markets, but China specifically? Thanks.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nWell, in China, specifically, we did just get approval for Ardian. So that'll take some time to get into all the hospitals, but we think that's going to do well. We think our CST business there, again, separate from, I think, some of the trends you're seeing in the US, we've got a strong local portfolio there and a nice flywheel of local innovation. So a local version of Mazor that's coming out, a local version of our StealthStation navigation that's coming out. So I see strength there.\nAnd then we've also started local manufacturing of some of our cardiology products. I was just there a couple of weeks ago where I saw our local pacemaker coming off the line. Right next to that giant Tesla plant, we have a plant. Not quite as big, but it's a damn good implantable technology plant. We're proud of that. I think those would be some of the areas that I would highlight in China.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Josh. Take the next question, please, Brad.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Rich Newitter at Truist Securities. Rich, please go ahead.\n\nRich Newitter\n\nManaging Director, Truist Securities\n\nHi. Thanks for taking the questions. Congrats on the quarter. Maybe first, just on spine, you continue to put the turnaround in that franchise continues to unfold, high single-digit growth. Following up to an earlier question, I appreciate that you're growing faster than your closest competitor there. You've talked about potential disruption from recent M&A and spine mergers as kind of being a once-in-a-decade opportunity. Can you comment on what, if any, contribution you've been seeing from the M&A environment to your benefit already and what's out in front? You've mentioned rep hires. You mentioned competitive conversions. I'm just trying to get a sense for whether we're at the point where you're seeing those benefits or there's still more to come out in front. We could maybe even see these growth rates accelerate.\n\nBrett Wall\n\nEVP and President of Neuroscience Portfolio, Medtronic",
    "content2": "Yeah, Rich, it's Brett Wall. Thanks for the question. We are seeing contribution now from some of those conversions that we're seeing really across the United States, as you know, which is the largest spine market. We see that continuing over the next several quarters here. As Geoff mentioned, it's a combination of this technology portfolio, including AI surgical planning, including robotics, including powered surgical instrumentation, imaging, and navigation. Putting that all together is creating this very attractive place where very good teams and reps and groups of people want to come together to work with Medtronic. So we have a very active program there. We're getting good contribution now, and we see that contribution continuing as we move forward. We have a very compelling story for those individuals to come along.\nAnd as was mentioned earlier, it's a lot more difficult now for companies that don't have that ecosystem to bring the customers and these individual teams of reps and others along in that process. So we see that continuing. We're going to continue to invest there. And as I mentioned, we have a compelling story for them to join Medtronic.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah. I think, taking a step back also, Rich, on this, this whole ecosystem approach, capital plus consumables, and CST, that's largely informing what we're doing in surgical as well. And how you acquire the capital with innovative financing, earnouts, and things like that, this is helping us. And that's what gives us confidence also in our surgical business as we bring in robotics with Hugo there as well. And the second point I'll make is, look, you're starting to see the turnaround in both diabetes and CST. And the point there is when we focus on these types of opportunities, we're going to get results here. And you're seeing it there. And we're putting that same kind of focus on Hugo and our broader surgical business and our AFib business, CAS. These are two big opportunities that we're focused on.\nAnd I know there's a lot of questions that we get on those two areas. And like CST and diabetes, with the kind of focus we're putting on it at the leadership level of the company, I'm confident you're going to see those be growth drivers for the company as we move forward. And you're seeing it now in CST.\n\nRich Newitter\n\nManaging Director, Truist Securities\n\nOn the robot, In surgical, you're nearing the completion for the Hugo Trial. Just curious if you could provide an estimation timing-wise. Should we be expecting we could see a submission in 2025 and potential launch end of fiscal 2025, early fiscal 2026? Any color there would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nI'll let Mike Marinaro answer that question. Mike?\n\nMike Marinaro\n\nEVP and President of Medical Surgical Portfolio, Medtronic\n\nYeah. So thanks for the question. I won't estimate when we will submit for the urology indication, but I'll also note that we are nearing completion. And in the quarter, we also initiated our indication work for both our GYN indication as well as a hernia indication, which will be really important for us as we move into general surgery. So critical that we are now operating across multiple indications so that as we come into the market, we can have a series of launches across each of those to capture larger and larger pieces of the market. And we're seeing good execution, early execution inside of each of those studies as well. Thank you.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Rich. We are just past the top of the hour, so we'll take one more question, please, Brad.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question will come from Matt Miksic at Barclays. Matt, please go ahead.\n\nMatt Miksic\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. Maybe just a couple of follow-ups on some of the pipeline programs that you talked about. Just to frame expectations around for Ardian, Symplicity, when does that, do you think, start to noticeably show up and start to demonstrate some of the potential that you were describing earlier, Geoff? And then on diabetes, you filed. I wasn't sure if you filed some PMAs with 780G for pediatrics, for adults, for both. And I guess the question is, does that mean that before this coming fiscal is out, that we'll start to see some traction with that new sensor in the US? Thanks.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nThanks for the questions, Matt. I'll have the subject matter experts answer those. I'll start with Sean on Symplicity.\n\nSean Salmon\n\nEVP and President of Cardiovascular Portfolio, Medtronic\n\nYeah. Thanks, Matt. As I think you know, the most important thing for us to establish is reimbursement. That's the catalyst that starts to make things tick upward for us. We'll look toward the final inpatient rule for outpatient reimbursement. That'll be in the kind of late July timeframe to know if that's going to be there. But the vast majority of our procedures are going to occur in the outpatient setting. And we're pursuing both a transitional payment there as well as, most importantly, national coverage determination with evidence development. And we're in active conversations with CMS on that and, of course, private payers. So we expect contribution to begin this year, as Geoff said at the outset. Regarding timing, it's not like we have statutory dates on these things. It's just when these come through.\nSuffice it to say, there's a huge effort to get that reimbursement established and in place. We're also changing guidelines in Europe. We expect that to happen late this summer, which will help with adoption there. We've got new approvals, not just China, but also Canada. Those will be catalysts. It really is the most important thing is to unlock on reimbursement, and that's a full court press for us.\n\nMatt Miksic\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nQ, you want to answer the diabetes one?\n\nQue Dallara\n\nEVP and President of Diabetes, Medtronic\n\nYes. We filed the Simplera Sync, which is the integrated sensor with 780G system in the US, in line with expectations. It's hard to comment on the timing with the agency, but we're eagerly awaiting approval for that system. And just to remind everyone that we had limited launch of the Simplera Sync with 780G in Europe in five countries. That's going very well, and we're looking forward to expanding that to a full commercial launch in the summer. And then, of course, Simplera with InPen, we launched late last year. Late last year, it's now in 15 countries, also doing quite well. So we anticipate that what we're seeing in the OUS markets will also happen in the US.\n\nMatt Miksic\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThank you.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nYeah. Thanks, Matt. Geoff, please go ahead with your closing remarks.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nOkay. Thanks, Ryan. And thanks for the questions, everybody. We definitely appreciate your continued interest in Medtronic, and we hope you'll join us for our Q1 Earnings Broadcast, which we anticipate holding on Tuesday, 20 August 2024, where we'll update you on our progress against all these strategies and our commitments. So with that, thanks for spending time with us today, and have a great rest of your day."

    "content": "Q3 2024 Medtronic PLC Earnings Call\n\nQ3 2024 Medtronic PLC Earnings Call\n\nMDTNYSEFEB 20, 8:00 AM\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nTechnologies all around the globe. At the same time, we've had a rapid cadence of new product approvals, and we're continuing to differentially invest in our pipeline of highest growth opportunities. We're advancing innovative core technologies like robotics, AI, and closed-loop systems. And with five AI products already FDA-approved, we're leading the way in bringing the tech into MedTech.\nWe also continue to make progress on our comprehensive transformation of the company. We're incorporating a performance-driven culture that's based on execution, speed, and playing to win. And we're leveraging our scale to drive efficiencies. So when you look at our financials this quarter, you're seeing the early results of our focus on restoring earnings power and converting our earnings into strong cash flow. And we're using that cash to both invest in high-return opportunities and return value to our shareholders. So we're executing, and we're delivering.\nAnd we expect to continue over the coming quarters and years, given our momentum, our ongoing transformation, our breakthrough innovation, our exposure to strong secular growth markets, and our numerous catalysts across the business. Now, before I get into the details of our Q3 results, I do want to mention that we provided a portfolio management update this morning on our patient monitoring and respiratory interventions businesses. After a comprehensive review, we have decided to exit our unprofitable ventilator product line and retain and bring together our remaining PMRI businesses into one business, which we're calling acute care and monitoring. Now, we've determined it is in the best interest of Medtronic, its stakeholders, the ACM business, both near and long term, to exit Vents because of its increasing unprofitability and market preference shift to lower acuity ventilators.\nNow, as we exit Vents, I want to recognize the strong legacy of our business and the Puritan Bennett brand. We're committed to serving the needs of our customers and honoring our ventilator service contracts. I also want to thank the employees in our ventilator business, who played an incredible role during the pandemic to dramatically expand production to get ventilators to the communities around the world that needed them. While we exit, we do believe that existing manufacturers can meet the customer demand for new ventilators going forward. Now, at the same time, we decided to retain and refocus the remaining PMRI businesses. Three main factors have driven this decision. First, we have strong conviction in our ability to lead and drive growth in acute care and monitoring, given our improved competitive position and our ability to properly fund this business with savings from exiting Vents.\nSecond, the importance of data in this space is changing rapidly. It's becoming the basis of innovation. This fact further improves our competitive differentiation. Lastly, as a company more broadly, we continue to prioritize profitable, innovation-driven growth, and category leadership, and ACM can deliver both. That does not mean we will shy away from additional portfolio moves going forward, but the bar is high for any strategic activity that dilutes our focus on our profit and growth. So you take these decisions together, we're able to provide increased investment for Acute Care and Monitoring, using the savings from Vents and bringing two businesses together, all without creating dilution to our P&L. Now, let's get into the details behind our Q3 results. We continue to look at our portfolio in three categories: established market leaders, synergistic, and highest growth businesses.\nIn this quarter, all three grew in line with our expected growth algorithm. Our established market leader and synergistic businesses grew mid-single digits, while our highest growth businesses posted high single-digit growth, and we expect their contribution to our overall growth to further accelerate in the quarters ahead. Now, looking first at the established market leaders, combined, they made up just under half of our revenue and grew 4%. Starting with cranial and spinal technologies, we're driving consistent above-market growth on the continued adoption of our AiBLE ecosystem. CST delivered high single-digit growth in core spine, mid-teens growth in biologics, and high single-digit growth in enabling technology. We had strong double-digit unit growth in StealthStation navigation, O-arm imaging, and Mazor Robotic Systems, a leading indicator for future growth in this business. We also continue to see strong adoption of UNiD Adaptive Spine Intelligence, our integrated AI-based surgical planning solution.\nNow, with AiBLE, we're offering a complete, robust ecosystem of enabling technologies and associated implants for spine surgeons. Our global footprint, which includes over 10,000 systems, is over four times greater than the nearest competitor. With this scale and extensive and rapidly increasing install base, we're transforming the spine industry. We're leading the way. As more surgeons adopt our integrated spine technologies and in an environment where there is disruption from consolidation, we're attracting the best sales teams to Medtronic to grow and expand our business. Next, in surgical, we grew 3%. Our wound management business won share, growing in the high teens on the strength of our V-Loc Barbed Sutures. We also had solid mid-single digit growth in hernia products as we won share in synthetic permanent mesh with our ProGrip platform.\nAs expected, our surgical growth continued to have a modest impact from declines in bariatric surgery. Now, we still believe this impact will be temporary as more patients become eligible for surgery and as patients seek a more permanent treatment to weight loss. To wrap up our established market leaders, cardiac rhythm also grew 3%, driven by high single-digit growth in cardiac pacing. Our Micra leadless pacemakers continued to post strong results, growing 15%, driven by the launch of our next-generation Micra AV2 and VR2 devices. We're also benefiting from the adoption of conduction system pacing, an alternative to traditional single or dual-chamber pacing. Our 3830 lead, the only one on the market approved for conduction system pacing, continued to grow strong double digits. In CRM, we also began training and the limited launch of our Aurora EV-ICD.\nNow, we expect the EV-ICD to re-accelerate our defibrillation solutions growth in the coming quarters. As I've shared with you in the past, Aurora is a game changer in the ICD space. It delivers the benefits of a traditional ICD, including similar size, longevity, and pacing features, but without the leads in the heart or veins. And these benefits can be realized with one device and only one implant procedure. We expect our advantages will not only displace the competitor's device, we will expand the population far beyond the existing segment and be a strong growth driver for CRM. Now, turning to our synergistic businesses, combined, they grew mid-single digits in Q3. And I'll highlight some of the drivers here. Let's start with aortic, which grew 13% on supply recovery and continued momentum of our Endurant AAA franchise.\nCardiac surgery grew 10%, driven by strength and perfusion and cannula and ECLS oxygenators, given competitor quality issues, and the strong sales in international markets of our Avalus surgical valve. Coronary grew 7%, driven by double-digit growth in both guide catheters and balloons. We increased our drug-eluting stent share in the US and in Europe on the continued rollout of our Onyx Frontier drug-eluting stent. Now, turning to businesses in our highest growth markets. As I mentioned earlier, together, these businesses grew in the high single digits this quarter, and we expect their contribution to our growth to accelerate going forward. Now, diabetes led the way, growing double digits on the global adoption of our game-changing MiniMed 780G system. We're seeing strong sequential momentum, growing 5% over the prior quarter. Our customer base is growing sequentially, and we're driving more revenue per customer.\nIn the US, we not only returned to growth, we grew mid-single digits, driven by nearly 50% revenue growth in insulin pumps. We doubled our new users year-over-year, attracting those on multiple daily injections, as well as users of competitor systems. Users are choosing 780G for the outcomes it delivers. With intensive insulin users, these outcomes matter, and the 780G is highly differentiated. It's the only AID system to automatically adjust and correct sugars every five minutes. It offers flexible glucose targets as low as 100 and features our proprietary meal detection technology. This leads to high time and range for users. And this type of glycemic control is coming with less effort and burden, as users realize the relief that comes from spending more time in automation with our SmartGuard technology.\nIt's worth pointing out that in a recent third-party survey of nearly 2,000 US diabetes pump users, the 780G scored number one in overall pump satisfaction. Among type 1 CGM users, our Guardian 4 sensor mirrored competitor sensors in overall satisfaction. During the quarter, we secured CE Mark for our Simplera Sync sensor for use with the 780G. We look to begin the limited release this spring. In the US, we're planning to submit the 780G with Simplera Sync to the FDA in the first half of this calendar year. Simplera Sync is half the size of our current sensor. It has a disposable design and is much easier to put on. Now, we've been driving the diabetes turnaround for some time, and I got to tell you, it certainly feels really good to return to double-digit growth. But we're not finished here.\nThere is definitely more work to be done as we work to bring to market an even more robust ecosystem of differentiated technology for people living with diabetes, including next-generation durable pumps, SmartPens, patch pumps, sensors, and algorithms. As the intensive insulin management space moves to using smart dosing through either AID or smart MDI, we expect an acceleration in the growth contribution from our diabetes business. Now, turning to cardiac ablation solutions, we delivered 11% growth in international markets, including 9% growth in Western Europe. Our strong international growth, as well as our overall performance, continues to be driven by our leading Arctic Front cryo solution, as pulsed field ablation is still in the early stages. We're seeing, though, a lot of enthusiasm in the market for our PFA products. In Europe, we're the only company with PFA offerings for both the single shot and the focal segments.\nIn single shot, we have now started the limited market release of our PulseSelect PFA system here in fiscal Q4. We're seeing very efficient procedures after just a couple of cases. So the learning curve is really short. The catheter handling and maneuverability has been excellent due to its small shaft and our custom 10 French bidirectional sheath. Clinicians are also reporting no noticeable muscle contraction with our PFA product, which is beneficial for patient experience. In focal, we continue to ramp manufacturing of the Affera mapping system and Sphere-9 catheter and remain in limited market release in Europe. Sphere-9 is the only catheter that can perform both pulsed field ablation and radiofrequency ablation, and high-density mapping. It's really an all-in-one catheter. In the US, our CAS business declined in the quarter.\nWe faced the full Q1 of competition in the cryoablation space, which is a space we created and had been the only player. In addition, many customers actually held back purchases as they awaited the launch of our PulseSelect PFA catheter, which is now commercially available. We do expect to improve from here as we roll out the recently approved next-generation Nitron CryoConsole and PulseSelect, the only PFA catheter FDA approved for both paroxysmal and persistent AF. In addition to the European feedback, clinicians have consistently commented on how well it's visualized and how easily it connects to their mapping system. We're also making progress in bringing our Affera mapping system and Sphere-9 catheter to the US, with the last patient follow-up in our Sphere PFAF pivotal trial now completed.\nWe expect to see the results at a medical meeting in the first half of this calendar year. With an $8 billion market size, expanding our share in this under-penetrated cardiac ablation space is a big opportunity for us. We expect our growth profile to improve over time, first moving towards market growth and then winning share as we bring our rich pipeline of innovation to patients who need this technology. In neurovascular, this quarter, we grew high single digits when you exclude sales in China, where the market is subject to volume-based procurement. We continue to have strong double-digit growth and flow diversion globally. This is being driven by our innovative shield technology for treating brain aneurysms, which is available on both Pipeline Flex and Vantage flow diverters. In robotic surgical technologies, we continued growing the installed base for our differentiated Hugo robotic system in international markets.\nIn the US, our Expand Europe pivotal trial continues to enroll, and we expect to have first enrollment in our hernia trial very soon. We expect Hugo equipped with advanced digital capabilities to be a meaningful growth driver for us in the years ahead. We believe surgeon preference for our open console and modular design, our leading position in minimally invasive surgery and instrumentation, our connected digital ecosystem, and data-enabled insights, along with our world-class surgical training program and partnerships, will meaningfully advance the low penetration of robotic surgery around the world. Now, turning to structural heart, we grew high single digits in the quarter, including mid-single digits sequentially, as we see ongoing adoption of Evolution FX and its improved design and market-leading valve performance. In Europe, where FX was launched for the first full quarter, we grew double digits.\nJapan grew in the low 20s on the continued adoption of FX. I'm pleased to share the news today that we have submitted Evolut FX+ to the FDA for approval. FX+ has three windows in the frame to allow easy coronary access while providing the same dependable valve performance of our Evolut platform. We were also pleased to hear that one-year trial results of our SmartTrial will be presented as a late breaker at ACC on 7 April. We're excited to see the results and are looking forward to having both FX+ and the SmartTrial, as well as the continued strength of our four-year low-risk data, as catalysts for our structural heart business. Now, with that, let's go to Karen for a deeper look at our Q3 financial performance and our fiscal 2024 guidance raise. Karen?\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nEVP and CEO, Medtronic\n\nLooking at our financials, our Q3 was another quarter where we delivered on our commitments. Our revenue grew 4.6% ahead of expectations, and adjusted EPS was $1.30, $0.04 above the midpoint of our guidance range. We attribute the beat to stronger-than-expected revenue growth and gross margin, offset by $0.04 from greater-than-anticipated currency impact, primarily from the devaluation in the Argentine peso in December. We're delivering durable mid-single digit revenue growth and have now for several quarters. As Geoff mentioned, international markets were an important driver for us. Our non-US developed markets grew 6%, including 8% growth in Western Europe and 7% growth in Japan. In fact, we had double-digit growth in several of our businesses across both of those regions. Emerging markets grew 10%. We had high teens growth in the Middle East and Africa, and mid-teens growth in South Asia.\nChina grew low double digits as some of the VBP we expected there continues to be delayed. Eastern Europe grew in the low single digits, given Russian sanctions. In the US, we grew 2%. We have several new product approvals that are at the earliest stages of their launches and expect those launches to positively impact our US growth over the next couple of quarters and beyond. Looking down the P&L, we delivered a strong quarter. Both our adjusted gross and operating margins were ahead of expectations. Our adjusted gross margin of 66.1% improved year-over-year, overcoming a 60 basis points headwind from foreign exchange and continued elevated inflation. We attribute the favorability primarily to the delayed China VBP and lower freight costs. We also continue to see traction from our pricing efforts and an early benefit from our comprehensive COGS efficiency efforts.\nWhile our adjusted operating margin of 25.2% declined 70 basis points, it was entirely driven by currency. In fact, operating margin on a constant currency basis was up 160 basis points from improvement in gross margin and strong SG&A leverage, as we continue to drive efficiencies across the enterprise. Below the operating margin line, our adjusted tax rate was a little higher than anticipated, mainly due to the jurisdictional mix of profits. On the flip side, income on our investments was also a little better than expected, with higher rates. It's worth noting that while our adjusted EPS was flat year-over-year, it grew 8.5% on a constant currency basis from the leverage we drove down the P&L. We also significantly improved our free cash flow and conversion in the quarter. Now, turning to guidance.\nGiven our top and bottom line beat and continued strength in our underlying fundamentals, we're raising our full-year revenue and EPS guidance. We now expect full-year organic revenue growth of 4.75% to 5%. For the fourth quarter, we're expecting organic revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 4.5%. On a comp adjusted basis, this is an acceleration from the third quarter as we continue to ramp our recent product launches. With the exit of ventilators that we announced today, we are moving the associated revenue to the other segment starting in the fourth quarter. As is the case with all revenue in other, we will exclude it from our organic revenue growth. Additional details can be found in our third quarter earnings presentation.\nRegarding currency, based on recent rates, we would see a full-year revenue impact in the range of an unfavorable $15 million to a favorable $35 million, including an unfavorable impact of $70 to 120 million in the Q4. On the bottom line, with the beat in the Q3, we're raising our full-year EPS guidance by $0.04 at the midpoint to a new range of $5.19 to 5.21. I'd point out that given our durable performance, we've been able to increase this guidance by $0.15 at the midpoint from where we initially started the year. For the Q4, we expect adjusted EPS of $1.44 to 1.46. Regarding currency, based on recent rates, we're seeing an unfavorable impact of 7% on full-year EPS, including an unfavorable 5% impact in the Q4.\nLastly, while we'll give our fiscal year 2025 guidance on our Earnings Call in May after we finish our planning, I want to share our early thoughts. You've seen us deliver durable revenue growth for several quarters, and we expect that to continue. Down the P&L, inflation, currency, and tax are currently headwinds to earnings growth, and we expect to continue to increase our investments in R&D. That said, we're very focused on driving offsets where we can and improving the earnings power of the company.\nRegarding the portfolio management decisions we announced today, while the Street's FY2025 numbers didn't yet reflect the potential separation, with today's decision, we're able to increase investment in innovation-driven growth without near-term earnings dilution or an ongoing impact to cash flow, all with a focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value.\nI want to close by expressing my sincere gratitude to all of our employees for your hard work and unwavering commitment to the Medtronic mission. Your dedication was instrumental in achieving our results this quarter and making a difference for so many people around the world. Thank you. Geoff, turning it back to you to take it home.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nOkay. Thank you. But before I wrap up, I want to note that Tom Holloran passed away last week at the age of 94. Tom provided decades of leadership to our company, first as general counsel, then as president, and as a director on our board for many, many years. In the early '60s, Tom was one of the instrumental people who created our Medtronic mission, together with our founder, Earl Bakken. Tom was also a significant leader in the Twin Cities and beyond, and served on several company boards.\nOur thoughts are with Tom's family as they celebrate his life. Now, before we go to analyst questions, I'll close with a few brief concluding comments on our progress. You've seen now for several quarters in a row that we're delivering on our commitments with durable mid-single digit revenue growth. When you look over the last couple of quarters, we've had a rapid cadence of meaningful innovative product approvals, many of which are just getting started, including EV-ICD, both PulseSelect and Affera in PFA, Inceptiv for SCS, Percept RC for DBS, and of course, our new Simplera Sync Sensor in diabetes.\nWe can't forget Symplicity Spyral for hypertension. When you combine these with our investments to enter surgical robotics, along with the strong execution we're having in businesses like spine and diabetes, this is what gives us confidence in our ability to continue delivering durable growth.\nAt the same time, we've been sharing with you our efforts to restore the earnings power of the company. We're seeing those efforts begin to show up in our financials and the comprehensive transformation that we've been working on, streamlining our operating model, aligning incentives, revamping our capital and portfolio management activities, and instilling a performance-driven culture. Well, this is also having an impact. These changes take time, and we're certainly not done, but it's very encouraging to see our progress and where we stand today.\nEqually exciting are the catalysts that we see coming, which we believe will lead to significant advancements for patients and value creation for both healthcare systems around the world and our shareholders. So with that, let's move to Q&A, where we're going to try to get to as many analysts as possible.\nSo we ask that you limit yourself to just one question and only, if needed, a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, you can reach out to Ryan and the investor relations team after the call. With that, Brad, can you please give you instructions for asking a question?\n\nOperator\n\nFor the sell-side analysts that would like to ask a question, please select the participant button and click Raise Hand.

Lastly, please be advised that this Q&A session is being recorded.\nFor today's session, Geoff, Karen, and Ryan are joined by Que Dallara, EVP and President of Diabetes; Mike Marinaro, EVP and President of the Medical Surgical Portfolio; Sean Salmon, EVP and President of the Cardiovascular Portfolio; and Brett Wall, EVP and President of the Neuroscience Portfolio. We'll pause for a few seconds to assemble the queue. All right.\nWe'll take the first question from Larry Biegelsen at Wells Fargo. Larry, please go ahead.\n\nLarry Biegelsen\n\nSenior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the questions, and congratulations on another nice quarter here. I wanted to just focus my one question on the fiscal 2025 comments that Geoff and Karen made. You talked about durable growth. Should we think about that as mid-single digit organic growth? And just help us. I think there'll be some concerns about what we're seeing in the AFib business, given the low double-digit decline in the US.\nWhat are the puts and takes to consider there? And on earnings, Karen, can you quantify those headwinds, inflation, tax, and FX in fiscal 2025? And consensus is at about 5%. Are you comfortable with consensus EPS growth? Thank you for taking the question.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nWell, first of all, thanks for the questions, Larry. Maybe I'll start with the CAS one and then Karen. Maybe Sean and I will take the AFib one, and then Karen can talk about the FY25 questions. So I'm going to phone a friend and tap Sean here in a second here. But on our AFib business, look, we're confident in the investments that we made that are going to bear fruit here.\nWe haven't seen it translate into financials yet, but there's lots of leading indicators here that we're seeing that give us confidence, both in, well, one, in continued, I think, stronger performance than people might think in cryo, but importantly, in PFA for both PulseSelect, our organic program, and then Affera. But Sean, do you want to comment on this a little more specifically for Larry?\n\nSean Salmon\n\nEVP and President of Cardiovascular Portfolio, Medtronic\n\nYeah, sure, Geoff. So Larry, in the US, what we had experienced was the first time ever a competitor in the cryo segment. So we had 100% market share, and we had the competitor ramp up their production. We felt that in Q4. I think there's also some anticipation for some new products we're launching, including a Nitron CryoConsole, a refresh on our capital equipment for cryo.\nAnd of course, the PulseSelect, which just started its launch in the United States after the quarter closed. And that's doing very, very well. The feedback has been exceptional, doing well in the United States, doing well outside the United States. And I think those catalysts of growth have PFA field for both the PulseSelect, that's the single-shot technology, as well as our point-by-point ablation, is driving a lot of enthusiasm. So I think we're going to see return to growth, and into next year, we'll really feel the full force of those launches. So it's a step back, certainly in the United States, but the 11% growth worldwide, or outside the United States, I should say, is giving us a lot of confidence. This is a pipeline that's poised to return us to growth in that segment.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Sean.\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nEVP and CEO, Medtronic\n\nOn FY2025, Larry, I would just start with the fact that we're really pleased with our performance through these last several quarters. Q3 was another solid quarter, our fifth consecutive quarter of solid mid-single digits. I would point out that we drove that mid-single digit growth this quarter off of mid-single digit comps last year. That's what we expect to continue into FY2025. We've been working through our planning process, and we expect to wrap that up in advance of our Q4 Earnings Call. We'll give our guidance in May. Not ready to give you real specifics, but from a high level, we've had no major changes to the puts and takes for next year that we discussed on our Earnings Call in Q2.\nWe're focused on, obviously, setting up guidance that sets us up for success, prioritizes innovation, and allows us to deliver on our commitments. But just on margins and down the P&L, there are puts and takes. We've got inflation that's stabilizing a bit, but it's still higher than historical. Currency is always dynamic, but at recent rates, we are facing a decent headwind from FX, and we'll just have to see how that shakes out.\nGlobal tax reform is likely to be a headwind, but as always, we're focused on driving offsets where we can. As you know, we've made good and real progress on our COGS cost-out work. That started with centralizing our global ops and supply chain and you know, focusing those teams on putting in place tangible programs that we now have in place to drive that cost-out work.\nAnd always, we're continuing to focus on driving pricing as an important lever. We built a new muscle around pricing, and we're just making it stronger and stronger. And then we're always focused on controlling expenses. We've got discipline on our largest driver of our expense, which is our headcount, and we expect that to continue. So really, no major changes from what we laid out last quarter.\n\nLarry Biegelsen\n\nSenior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nOkay.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Larry. And I'll remind the analysts, please stick to one question and a related follow-up if needed. Brad, can we take the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Robbie Marcus at JPMorgan. Robbie, please go ahead.\n\nRobbie Marcus\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOh, great. Thanks and good morning, everyone. Wanted to ask on the patient monitoring business. The original intent was to try and sell it or spin it. You're now keeping it and exiting the ventilator business.\nJust maybe walk us through the thought process, what happened in the market, and why this is the best outcome for Medtronic? Thanks.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nSure. I'll take that one, Robbie. So a couple of things. I'll start with a couple of things have changed. And I'll start with what we do have strong conviction in driving profitable category leadership in this, what we're calling Acute Care and Monitoring business. And a couple of dynamics have changed. And just a reminder, the monitoring component, the patient monitoring component, is the biggest part of those businesses that we intended to spin. I think the biggest thing that changes are you know two things. Our improved competitive positioning is in our monitoring business in particular, changed over the last year. As we were working on the process, we continue to run the business. And it performed well.\nAnd the competitive dynamics versus our main competitor, Masimo, changed significantly for the positive for us. And we believe that we can ensure that that change is durable with the increased investment. And we found a way to make that increased investment, which leads to the decision to wind down the vent business. It's a very difficult decision, but the business became increasingly unprofitable throughout the last year. The growth slowed even more. And the dynamics within the vent segment are changing, moving to lower acuity ventilators. And our kind of, I'd say, unique and worthy contributions are more in the higher acuity, hospital-based.\nAnd so with that market changing and it becoming increasingly unprofitable, our decision to wind that down creates the oxygen, the investment, if you will, that we can fund the monitoring side of the equation here and ensure that our competitive positioning versus Masimo, we feel like we can extend it. And another dynamic that has emerged is the use of data and the importance of data in this space. And that's been changing and becoming increasingly. And actually, I'd say it's the basis for innovation. And our confidence in taking that data and translating that into meaningful iteration, rapid iterations, as well as disruption over time is pretty high, given what we've been able to do with AI and other parts of the company. And so you add all this together.\nI finally say the last thing I'll make a comment on is, as a company more broadly, we continue to prioritize profitable growth and category leadership. And when you take all these factors together, we believe we're able to provide increased investment for this acute care monitoring business, or we're calling it ACM now, using the savings from Viance and also bringing the two, these were two separate businesses, a respiratory interventions business with ventilators in it and our monitoring business. Bringing them together at the leadership level also creates some savings. And then we can fund the incremental investment needed for the monitoring business, all without dilution to our P&L. So you know the last thing I want to say is this was a difficult decision.\nIt doesn't take anything away from our employees who played such a pivotal role during COVID in driving ventilator innovation and responding to the global needs during the COVID pandemic. I also want to give a nod to just the legacy of the Puritan Bennett brand, which has been so strong. We're proud of the rich legacy of this business and Puritan Bennett ventilators. This decision has not been easy. The last thing I'll say is this does not mean that we're going to shy away from additional portfolio moves. So don't read anything into that. But the bar is high for any strategic activity that's going to dilute our focus or our earnings.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nOkay. Thank you, Robbie. We'll take the next question, please, Brad.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Joanne Wuensch, Citi. Joanne, please go ahead.\n\nJoanne Wuensch\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nGood morning. Thank you for taking the question. There are a lot of products that I could ask about. So I'm just going to throw a couple of headline ones out there. Diabetes, congratulations on a return to US growth. Is there a way to peel that apart a little bit on new accounts or new patients versus renewals? And I guess my second question has to do with Hugo. And if you can give us a little bit of a state-of-the-union update on how those systems are going outside the United States. Thanks.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nWell, thanks, Joanne, for the questions. Obviously, we've been working this diabetes turnaround for some time, and it hasn't been a straight line, but we definitely have some momentum here on 780G, that platform, and just our capabilities here to use the data, like I was talking about in the patient monitoring business here as well, to create algorithms that really are differentiated and drive differentiated outcomes for patients. And that's playing out globally and now in the United States. So maybe Que, if you could come in and answer Joanne's to get the \"peel it apart\" a little bit more for Joanne, I'd appreciate it.\n\nQue Dallara\n\nEVP and President of Diabetes Operating Unit, Medtronic\n\nYes. Look, we're very pleased with the progress that we've made every quarter since 780G's launch. And we are seeing new patients grow significantly, as well as renewals. So both are progressing very well.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nCEO, Medtronic\n\nIt will take time to rebuild our installed base, but you can see with the pump growth that we saw in the US, high 40s year-over-year. That's going to be followed by consumables and CGM growth as well. So we expect to continue to make progress every quarter, but pretty pleased with how the market's reacted to the product introduction.\nOkay. Thanks, Que. Mike Marinaro, can you jump in on Hugo here?\n\nMIke Marinaro\n\nEVP and President of Medical Surgical Portfolio and Americas, Medtronic\n\nYeah. And thanks, Joanne, for the question. So we continue to see very good progress with Hugo outside the United States with an expansion of installations in countries around the globe. In fact, we entered into two new subregions in Central and Eastern Europe and are continuing to see very good response to the things we've talked about previously.\nSo the open console, the very crisp visualization, and increasingly very good feedback around our Touch Surgery enterprise platform, which on its own continues to expand and had a very good quarter with installations, both with Hugo and in our broader surgical business. Also, as Geoff noted during the commentary, we continue very good progress with our Expand Euro IDE here in the US and are preparing for our first patient enrollment in the Hernia IDE. So in total, good reception, a sharpening sort of appreciation for the features of Hugo, I think, and an emergence of the digital ecosystem and an appreciation for that as well.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah. I'd say, Joanne, on this one, thanks, Mike, first of all. And I'd say on this one, the robotic system and the features are differentiated and have been well received. But it's broader than that, as Mike pointed out.\nI mean, it's about the digital platform that comes with it, as well as the instrumentation as we transition instrumentation in our laparoscopic business onto the robot, particularly stapling and energy. All these moves build momentum, build capabilities, and momentum over time. And we saw that play out in the spine business.\nWe bought Mazor, and it wasn't an overnight change. You saw where our last couple of quarters have been. But it took the integration of these things, Mazor with our navigation and then imaging and then getting these AI-guided surgical planning systems. All these things coming together, you know, every quarter, more progress have built the ecosystem we have today that's really driving not just the growth for Medtronic, but the growth for the spine industry right now. And we expect to do the same thing in soft tissue surgery.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nOkay. Thank you, Joanne. We'll take the next question, please, Brad.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Travis Steed at Bank of America. Travis, please go ahead.\n\nTravis Steed\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research and Medical Technology, Bank of America\n\nHey. Thanks for taking the question. Can you hear me okay?\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah. Hey, Travis. How are you doing?\n\nTravis Steed\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research and Medical Technology, Bank of America\n\nAll right. Good, good. Hey, Geoff. Curious if you could talk a little bit more on the gross margin productivity, some of the things you're driving there. And can you still get the kind of 2 to 3x annual cost savings on the gross margin line? And last month at the Investor Conference, you talked a lot about leverage EPS growth. I'm curious if that's a comment that applies to FY2025 or if that was more of a longer-term comment.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nSure. Let me tell you, I'll start that off and transition to Karen. On the gross margin, a couple of things that I point out. One is pricing. Karen talked about that. I do think what we're seeing here is a lot of innovation in the industry and a lot at Medtronic. And this innovation we're finding is valued. It drives value in the health system. And I think we've gotten better at showing the health economics of the innovation that applies from the innovation in addition to the clinical value.\nI think in the past, we were pretty indexed on clinical value. And more recently, we keep that focus and then add the health economics. And it's getting paid for. And we're, I think, doing a better job of making those points and getting that pricing. And I do think it's durable. So the pricing has increased, I'd say, for the company overall, 200 basis points or so relative to the past. And I think we're going to keep pushing for even more.\nOn the converse, if you don't have the innovation, be prepared for that as well, because I think hospitals have gotten more sophisticated in their purchasing. Your pricing is going to pay for that if you're not keeping up with the innovation. But given where we are on the product cycles and given this pricing muscle, we feel good about that being incremental, especially to the historical baseline.\nThe other you asked about is Cost of Goods Sold productivity. The short answer to your question is yes. We do think it's sustainable. We've got lots of opportunity here. Because you think about it, we have this pretty big footprint of factories, distribution centers, and too many suppliers, as I've said in the past. Now, with Greg Smith coming in a couple of years ago, and we've centralized that, we can take a strategic look across that portfolio.\nWe have a long list of cost-down programs. Then we've ensured that we've effectively contracted those between our global operations and supply chain team and our operating units because it takes R&D product engineering to make sure that these cost programs can happen that are in our operating units. So we feel good about that, and we feel that that's sustainable. So those are two big changes that impact positively gross margins now and into the future. Speaking of the future, I'll turn it over to Karen to talk about your FY2025 leverage question.\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nEVP and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah. So I'll just add on gross margins too. We're pleased with our performance that we had this quarter. We overcame a 60 basis points headwind from FX and continued inflationary pressures. And a lot of that was driven by strong pricing, which Geoff talked about.\nWe also did have some continued delays in China VBPs in aortic, peripheral vascular, and stapling. Those VBPs could be coming through this coming Q4, this current Q4, and potentially into next year. So that's just something going on in gross margins. As we think about leverage down the P&L, clearly, we're focused on driving leverage. I think we talked about it last quarter, Travis. Clear leverage is where your bottom line grows faster than your top line. We're focused on getting there eventually. We're not ready to talk about that for FY2025. It's still too early for our planning guidance. I've already pointed out lots of different puts and takes for next year.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah. Like Karen said, pricing on the gross margin side, pricing, cost of goods sold productivity, a lot of focus there.\nKaren mentioned earlier in the call about discipline around our G&A. Our people are the number one driver of our costs there. And so we've put a discipline in there that we're holding to. And then finally, just setting up the portfolio for profitable growth. And the decision on, with the changing dynamics, the decision to hold our monitoring business because of the confidence in the profitable growth is evidence of that, is setting up the portfolio the right way. So I'll leave it there on the focus of recovering the earnings power of the company. And we'll provide more details on that FY2025 look next quarter.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nOkay. Thank you, Travis. Next question, Brad?\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Vijay Kumar at Evercore ISI. Vijay, please go ahead.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHi guys. Thanks for taking my question. And Geoff, good morning to you. I guess one on the earnings question here. I look at your peers. Their earnings have grown versus fiscal 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Medtronic earnings have essentially been flattish. Can Medtronic commit to perhaps about trend earnings growth over the medium term as you play catch-up similar to what your peers have done? And I think related to that, Geoff, in the past, you've mentioned about a $400 million drag from investments in RDN, Hugo. Where are we on those investments? Are they still a drag? When can those be profitable to the business?\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Vijay, for the questions. I'll start with the latter question on RDN and Hugo, and let Karen handle the earnings growth ones and further comment on the RDN, Hugo. I'd say on, look, Hugo, the way we're looking at Hugo is a part of our broader surgical franchise, an important part of that. And it needs investment.\nIt is, if you look at Hugo specifically, it is taking a meaningful amount of investment to keep it going here. I love the milestone that we're at now in terms of a robot that's out there that's performing well and has got great features that are valued by physicians globally. The feedback's been strong. But we still got more work to do.\nWe've got to get our instruments on there. We've got to complete the US trial. We've got to continue to build out a capital equipment US sales force. So this is a tall order. But our confidence in executing there is high. And it's important to this huge business, our surgical business, which is our biggest business and drives a lot of profit and cash flow. And I say our confidence is high. I know we're up against a strong competitor in Intuitive.\nBut we like our competitive positioning overall, and especially against the other potential robotic companies there. And the dynamics of this market, we think, play in our favor. So there is investment there. On RDN, by the way, we're really trying to call it Symplicity now. We got to get ready for some consumer education on this hypertension therapy. So we're trying to get rid of the RDN term as much as possible. So we got a swear jar going on around here on that one.\nBut on hypertension, this one, we believe, will start to show some profits here. So it's much less of a drag. And we hope to, in the next couple of quarters in the medium term, this to generate not just revenue, but income. It's a highly profitable product line for us with high gross margins. And it'll be a positive to our overall mix.\nAnd like I said, Hugo is going to take investment. But this one, I think, will provide oxygen, not in the next quarter or two, but over the medium term here. So I'll leave it there and turn it over to Karen.\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nEVP and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah. And I would just say on earnings, we've made good progress on driving the earnings power of the company just in this year. I noted that we've been able to increase our guidance on the bottom line by $0.15 at the midpoint from where we initially started the year. And that's driven by the strong track record that we've driven in the first three quarters of this year. And we do expect that to continue. Over the medium and long term, we are committed to the right earnings growth. There's no debate about that.\nAnd we're focused on overcoming the headwinds that we've got over that timeframe and delivering on that growth. Okay.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Vijay. We probably have time for two more questions, Brad. Take two more.\n\nOperator\n\nSure.The next question goes to Matt Miksic at Barclays. Matt, please go ahead.\n\nMatt Miksic\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nHi. Thanks so much, Geoff, for taking the question. Can you hear me okay?\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah, we can now.\n\nMatt Miksic\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you. So maybe just a follow-up here on some of the products that you mentioned recently approved. And I think some of the products that you hope to see approved in the coming quarters. And I'm thinking of like Aurora, Pulse Select, and maybe some additions to the US-approved products in diabetes. And I know Sean mentioned sort of the rough trajectory for Atrial Fibrillation.\nBut maybe on that business, for example, any additional color around cadence: is this something that we start to see improve in the fourth quarter? Or is this sort of like an early to mid-2025 kind of process? And some of the same commentary for sort of cadence and trajectory in Aurora and, for example, maybe the diabetes business would be super helpful. Thanks.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nSure. So maybe I'll start with Sean. Before I turn it over to Sean, as I pointed out in the commentary, all the puts and takes in our ablation business, what we call cardiac ablation solutions, our AFib business, we do see an acceleration in this business even in the Q4 here. But I'll turn it over to Sean to talk about AFib and then Aurora.\n\nSean Salmon\n\nEVP and President of Cardiovascular Portfolio, Medtronic\n\nYeah. Thanks, Geoff. And Matt, the trajectory is obviously going to be upward for both the EV-ICD as well as the CAS business in total. As you launch these new technologies, there is some training that you have to do to make sure that the physicians are comfortable with how to use the products. And that's, of course, something we're very deliberate about to make sure that there's a good patient outcome and good acceptance of technology. And that's something we do pretty frequently in our business. So we're really, really good at it. And the feedback has been excellent. The procedure efficiency on PulseSelect has been; we're getting these cases done in like a half an hour. And the acceptance on Aurora has been exceptional too.\nSo as I said, I think it's the same story for both those technologies where they push growth now, but into next year with the full impact of these innovations.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nQue, you want to comment on diabetes?\n\nQue Dallara\n\nEVP and President of Diabetes Operating Unit, Medtronic\n\nYeah. Look, we continue to push the pipeline in diabetes, starting with Simplera approved with CE Mark last September, followed by Simplera Sync recently approved that we announced at JPMorgan. And we completed our clinical trials for 780G with Simplera Sync in the US, which we expect to submit in this first half of the calendar year. So that's the cadence that you should expect. And as Geoff mentioned in his opening comments, we have next-generation products that we discussed at ADA last year that we continue to make progress on and aggressively moving to get next-generation Tevid pumps and touch pumps out to the market.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Que.\n\nMatt Miksic\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nThank you.\n\nQue Dallara\n\nEVP and President of Diabetes Operating Unit, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Sean.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Matt. I apologize to the analysts that we weren't able to get to. We have time, though, for one more, Brad.\n\nOperator",
    "content2": "The final question comes from Anthony Petrone at Mizuho Securities. Anthony, please go ahead.\n\nAnthony Petrone\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Mizuho\n\nThanks. Can you hear me okay?\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYep, Anthony, we can.\n\nAnthony Petrone\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Mizuho\n\nOkay. Great.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYep. Anthony, we can hear you.\n\nAnthony Petrone\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Mizuho\n\nOne condolences on passing of Tom to the team and his family. And maybe one just going to Structural Heart, maybe just to set up on the smart study, quick two-part question. One, was that ahead of schedule? Was it expected to be at TCT instead of ACC? So it was delayed, right, or getting approved a surprise. And then maybe just high level, how do you think that study will play out once we have the results? It is head-to-head in TAVR and high-risk symptomatic severe.\nSo just thoughts on how you think that data is received once it's out there post-ACC at that session in the coming weeks. Thanks.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nWell, first of all, Anthony, thanks for the comment on Tom Holloran. And he's a real legend around here and just a great guy. So we're going to miss him. On Structural Heart, two comments before I turn it over to Sean. First, I really applaud the business for their evidence generation in total. We just did our low-risk data, and we publish it every year, not just when it's convenient. And then they had the courage to do a head-to-head, which is not something that's often done in our space. And so I can tell you that I, for one, love that, just the commitment to data and the competitiveness to go head-to-head.\nI'm very much looking forward to the results that are going to come out in early April at ACC. But in terms of the specifics of what you were asking on how it might play out, I'll turn that over to Sean.\n\nSean Salmon\n\nEVP and President of Cardiovascular Portfolio, Medtronic\n\nYeah. Thanks, Anthony. The complete minute of enrollment happened in October 2022. So that's a 12-month endpoint for the study. And that pushes you really out of the window for TCT. So I think we're on schedule, I'd say. Pleased to have been accepted as a late breaker at ACC. But that's really as expected, I'd say. In terms of the trial itself and how it'll be received, I think just right, the momentum that we have on data from the NOTION 10-year data that's low-risk patients out to 10 years showing superior durability of our valve compared to surgical implants.\nAnd then our four-year low-risk study with hard endpoint benefits and a widening benefit on serious outcomes like mortality and disabling stroke. And then, of course, going head-to-head in a really important patient population, those with a small annulus, we say that's about 40% of the global market, really prevalent among women and within smaller patient populations like in Japan, for example. So I think it's really important and compelling data. It's a one-year outcome which portends long-term outcomes. And I think that we're excited for the reception of those results. And we do think that that's a catalyst for growth for us with our really unique position in that particular subset of patients, which is a big chunk of the market at 40%.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nOkay. Thanks, Sean. And so just to wrap it up here, one final comment on the monitoring and ventilation decisions. As a result of these portfolio decisions, Bob White will be leaving Medtronic. And he's been just such an impactful and important leader for the company for a long time. And although the friendship will remain strong, we're definitely going to miss working with him day to day. And I want to wish him well. And I know that comes from the board of directors, the executive committee, and everybody at Medtronic that's interacted with Bob. Just a high-ethical leader and just a good guy. And we wish him well.\nIn terms of today, I just want to thank everybody for the questions. Definitely appreciate your support and continued interest in Medtronic. And we hope you'll join us again for our Q4 Earnings Broadcast, which we anticipate holding on Thursday, 23 May 2024.\nAgain, we'll update you on our progress and how we finished the fiscal year, but also look ahead to FY2025. With that, thanks for spending time with us today. Have a great rest of your day."

Now moving to Surgical, we grew 7%. Supply continued to improve, and this drove high single-digit growth in Advanced Surgical Technologies. We had particular strength in advanced energy as we continue the rollout of our LigaSure XP and cordless Sonicision 7.\nCardiac Rhythm grew 5%, with mid-single-digit growth in Defibrillation Solutions, Diagnostics, and Cardiac Pacing. Now within pacing, we had strong mid-teens growth in our Micra leadless pacemaker franchise. We launched our next-generation Micra devices, AV2 and VR2, in the US.\nThese tiny 0.8 cc devices have a battery life of 16 and 17 years, respectively, 40% longer than our previous generation and well beyond average battery life of competing products. We're also seeing EPs rapidly adopt conduction system pacing as an alternative to traditional single or dual-chamber pacing.\nOur 3830 lead is the only one approved for conduction system pacing in the US, and it grew 45% in the quarter. Looking ahead, we're preparing to launch the Aurora EV-ICD later this year. Aurora is a game-changer for the ICD space. It delivers the benefits of a traditional ICD, including the same size, longevity, and pacing features, but without leads in the heart or veins. Turning to our Synergistic businesses, there were several notable performances this quarter.\nCardiac Surgery grew 8% again this quarter, with strength in Perfusion and Cannulae. Our Aortic and ENT businesses both grew double digits, driven in part by improved product availability. Peripheral Vascular grew mid-single digits, with low double-digit growth in drug-coated balloons and high single-digit growth in superficial vein therapy.\nNeuromodulation grew mid-single digits in both pain stim and brain modulation, driven by new implants of Intellis with DTM and Percept PC with BrainSense. Just last week, we received CE Mark approval for our next-generation spinal cord stimulator, Inceptiv, which will be available in Europe in the coming months. Inceptiv incorporates closed-loop therapy with ECAPs, the result of decades of Medtronic R&D to unlock the ability to listen and respond to signals along the spinal cord.\nBoth our largest and Synergistic businesses had really strong quarters. Our businesses that compete in high secular growth MedTech markets did as well. All combined, these businesses made up 20% of our revenue and grew in the high single digits in Q1.\nWe continue to disproportionately invest in these businesses, and we expect them to become a larger part of our revenue mix and be large contributors to our durable growth in the future. Starting with Structural Heart, Transcatheter valves grew 11% globally, including 12% growth in the US and 21% growth in Japan. We continue to see improvements in the TAVR space and adoption of our differentiated Evolut FX valve.\nEvolut FX combines enhanced and predictable valve deployment with industry-leading durability. Next Monday, we're looking forward to the presentation of the NOTION 10-year data at ESC, which will look at the durability of the CoreValve and Evolut valves compared to surgery over a decade. In Neurovascular, we grew mid-single digits when you exclude China, where the market is subject to volume-based procurement. Global growth was fueled by continued strength in flow diversion.\nWe're seeing strong adoption of our Shield Technology for treating aneurysms, which is available on our Pipeline Flex and Pipeline Vantage Flow Diverters. Cardiac Ablation solutions grew 5%. As you know, Pulsed Field Ablation has become one of the most anticipated technologies in MedTech. We will be leading the way in bringing PFA catheters to market for both focal and single-shot segments.\nWe're continuing the limited market release in Europe for our Affera Mapping and Ablation System, including our Sphere-9 focal catheter. Sphere-9 can perform both PFA and RF ablation and delivers high-density mapping, all from the same catheter. Turning to our single-shot PFA catheter, PulseSelect, we filed for approval with US FDA and expect to be one of the first companies with a PFA catheter in the US market.\nWith our PFA catheters and the Affera Map Nav System, combined with our leading Arctic Front Cryo solution and differentiated AcQCross Transseptal Access system, we're poised to become a more meaningful player in the fast-growing $8 billion EP Ablation space. In robotic surgical technologies, we increased our installed base as we continue the international rollout of our differentiated Hugo Robotic system.\nWe've activated new sites in our Expand URO US pivotal trial, which continues to progress the plan. We expect Hugo to be a meaningful growth driver for us in the years ahead, given its differentiated value proposition, our leading position in minimally invasive surgery, and the low penetration of robotic surgery around the world. In Diabetes, we had a good quarter as we continue to see very strong demand for the MiniMed 780G AID system in markets around the world.\n780G is a true second-generation AID system and is the only one with five-minute adjustments, auto-corrections, and meal detection technology. We're getting great feedback that users are feeling a difference within one to two days. Our real-world evidence indicates that 90% of users are achieving or exceeding their glycemic targets when using our recommended settings, as well as getting burden reduction in their Diabetes management.\nThis differentiated value proposition is showing up in our results. Non-US developed markets grew 18%, our highest growth in four years, driven by both 780G adoption and increased CGM attachment rates. In the US, we're seeing great results and momentum from the 780G launch. First, the launch drove low 30s growth in our US durable pump sales. Second, we're seeing our prescriber base rapidly expand.\nSince we last talked to you at ADA in late June, we've had a 30% increase in unique prescribers, with now over 13,000 since launch. Third, we've had over half of our 770G installed base upgrade or place an order for the 780G since launch. Not only is demand coming from our existing installed base, but we're also getting competitive conversions.\nFinally, we're seeing very high CGM attachment rates in the 780G installed base, which will drive our economics and give us confidence in accelerating growth. The turnaround in Diabetes is real and underway, and I am pleased with the progress the team is making. We're just at the beginning of this inflection point for the business.\nAs we shared with you at our ADA investor briefing in June, we see the intensive insulin space moving from primarily standalone CGM today to one that is smart dosing through either AID systems or Smart MDI. We are well-positioned for this trend. We continue to invest heavily in next-generation durable pumps, smart pens, patch pumps, sensors, and algorithms, with multiple programs under development.\nImportantly, we're the only company assembling this complete ecosystem of differentiated technology for people living with diabetes. With that, I'll turn it over to Karen to discuss our financial performance and our fiscal 2024 guidance raise. Karen?\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nEVP and CFO, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Geoff. As Geoff mentioned, we had a strong start to our fiscal year with 6% revenue growth coming in ahead of expectations. We also had good growth on the bottom line with non-GAAP EPS of $1.20, up 6%. This was $0.09 above the midpoint of our guidance range, with $0.07 coming from better-than-expected operational performance and $0.02 from FX.\nWe're focused on positioning Medtronic to drive durable growth. You've seen that over the last several quarters on the top-line. As we talked about on our last call, stabilizing and then ultimately improving gross margins remains a priority for us. The breadth of our revenue growth this quarter is notable. As Geoff mentioned, each of our four business segments grew 6%. By geography, non-US developed and emerging markets both grew in the high single digits, with the US growing mid-single digits.\nWestern Europe grew 8% again this quarter, with high single-digit growth in cardiovascular and medical surgical, and high teens growth in Diabetes. Emerging markets grew 8% and were affected by new sanctions in Russia and ongoing VBP impact in China. That said, China growth at 4% was better than expected, given some provincial VBP delays to later in the year and strong procedure recovery. Excluding China and Russia, emerging markets grew in the high teens, with mid-teens growth in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, and high teens growth in Latin America and South Asia.\nTurning to margins, our adjusted gross margin was relatively stable year over year and ahead of expectations, with better-than-expected pricing and less-than-expected impact from currency, offsetting inflationary pressures. Our operating margin increased 90 basis points, driven by revenue outperformance and our focus on expense management, particularly in our G&A line.\nBelow the operating profit line, our adjusted nominal tax rate was 15.8%, above expectations, driven by a change in Puerto Rico tax law. The change drove an approximate 120 basis points increase in our tax line, offset by a corresponding decrease in other operating expense. The change was net neutral to earnings. Turning to capital allocation, we're prioritizing investments in innovation as we disproportionately invest in high-growth, high-return opportunities.\nWe do this through multiple channels, including organic R&D, minority investments, strategic partnerships, and disciplined acquisitions. At the same time, we prioritize returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders, primarily through our strong and growing dividend. We also continue to advance our active portfolio management. Last quarter, we moved our Renal Care Solutions business into a joint venture with DaVita. We've been focused on the separation of Patient Monitoring & Respiratory Interventions.\nAs we noted in our 10-K, we now expect to complete the separation in the first half of next fiscal year, if not sooner, as we've been evaluating different types of transactions to maximize shareholder value. We've always said a spin sets a high bar, and it remains the likely way we'll separate these businesses. Now, turning to guidance. With our outperformance in the Q1 and improved underlying fundamentals, we're raising our full-year revenue and EPS guidance.\nWe now expect fiscal 2024 organic revenue growth of 4.5%, an increase from the prior range of 4% to 4.5%. This guidance excludes the impact of foreign currency and revenue from our new Other segment. I direct you to the guidance slide in our earnings presentation for additional details. In the second quarter, we're expecting organic revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 4.5%.\nOn a comp-adjusted basis, this represents an acceleration over the Q1. We expect a steady acceleration in underlying growth in the back half of the year as well. While the impact of currency is fluid, based on recent rates, foreign currency would have a neutral impact on full-year revenue, including a favorable impact of $85 to 135 million in the second quarter.\nMoving down the P&L, as we have said before, we expect inflation and currency pressures this fiscal year. We do expect some of the delayed impact from the provincial VBPs that benefited us in the Q1 to come later in the year. However, you are beginning to see the results from the actions we are taking to drive structural changes in our global operations and supply chain.\nTo give a few examples, we're moving to fewer, more strategic suppliers that are giving us better terms. We're implementing improvements to run our factories more efficiently and reliably. There is more to come, and we expect this will drive stabilization in our gross margin over time and then improve it from there. On the bottom line, we're raising our fiscal 2024 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance to the new range of $5.08 to 5.16, an increase from the prior range of $5.00 to 5.10.\nThis is a $0.07 increase at the midpoint, in line with the Q1 operational beat. The guidance range continues to include an unfavorable 6% impact from foreign currency based on recent rates. The projected 6% annual FX impact is unchanged from May, as the $0.02 of FX upside in the Q1 is now offset later in the year.\nFor Q2, we expect EPS of $1.16 to 1.20, including a 6% unfavorable impact from foreign currency based on recent rates. Before sending it back to Geoff, I'd like to acknowledge our employees who are watching today. I truly appreciate your focus on driving change to execute well and deliver on our priorities. It is that focus that contributes to these results and fulfills our enduring mission to alleviate pain, restore health, and extend life for millions of patients around the globe. Thank you. Back to you, Geoff.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nOkay, thank you, Karen. Now, before we go to the analyst questions, I'll close with a few thoughts. First, Q1 was a strong start to our year, and we're establishing a track record of delivering dependable mid-single-digit growth. We're executing and bringing innovation to the market. We're making progress in countering the impacts that inflation and currency are having on our margins.\nWe expect this to lead to stabilization and then improvement over time. We're also seeing improved underlying fundamentals in our supply chain and in our markets across our businesses and geographies. Like I said earlier, we're at the beginning of an inflection point in our Diabetes business. We're seeing strength in our established market-leading businesses like CRM and Spine. With our pipeline, we have several important growth catalysts that we expect to come to market over the coming quarters.\nWe're on the right path and building momentum. Underneath all of this, what may be less visible to you are the steps we've taken to transform the company, tackling the root causes of what have made our growth less dependable in the past. We're ensuring a performance-driven culture, partially driven by a number of new leaders in the company.\nWe're advancing our capital allocation and portfolio management priorities to take advantage of high-growth opportunities. We're executing on the programs that we believe will lead to scale advantages, whether that's in our now centralized global operations and supply chain organization, or in how we go-to-market with large enterprise customers around the world, or in how we're leveraging core technologies and implementing new innovations across our businesses.\nNow, to accelerate this last area, we created a new position of Chief Technology and Innovation Officer and hired Ken Washington this past quarter to fill that role. Ken was recently at Amazon, where he led Consumer Robotics, and before that was Chief Technology Officer at Ford Motor Company and VP of the Advanced Technology Center at Lockheed Martin Space Systems.\nI look forward to sharing more details in the quarters ahead on how Ken is leading our efforts to leverage technologies like robotics and AI across the enterprise, which we believe will lead to new differentiated therapies for patients and better experiences for our customers. This is an extensive transformation. Yes, there's still work to be done, but you're seeing some of the benefits in our results.\nYou should expect to see more of this over time as we continue to work toward delivering durable revenue and earnings growth, which combined with a growing dividend is a winning formula for creating value for our shareholders. Now, let's move to Q&A, where we're going to try to get to as many analysts as possible. We ask you to limit yourself to just one question and only, if needed, a related follow-up.\nIf you have additional questions, you can reach out to Ryan and the investor relations team after the call. I also want to note that today is the first time we have Mike Marinaro, who runs our Surgical and our Endoscopy businesses, joining us for the Q&A. Now, Bob White's focus is on the PMRI businesses as we separate, which is a heavy lift. We have Mike focused on the other two Med-Surg businesses.\nToday, if you have questions on Surgical or Endoscopy, direct them to Mike. PMRI questions can go to Bob. With that, Brad, can you please give the instructions for asking a question?\n\nOperator\n\nFor the sell-side analysts that would like to ask a question, please select the Participants button and click Raise Hand.

We'll pause for a few seconds to assemble the queue. We'll take the first question from Vijay Kumar at Evercore ISI.\nVijay, please go ahead.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Geoff, congrats on a good quarter, good execution. Maybe my first one on Diabetes here, the 30% US growth numbers here. I think that's a revenue number. Do you know what the pump growth number was in the US and how much of this was existing customers? How much of this growth is driven by existing customers operating, the 770G users operating versus new customers?\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Vijay, for the question. Yeah, well, first off, let me just say we're really pleased with the momentum we have in Diabetes. I mean, and I think we're on the kind of early stages of a growth acceleration there. We're seeing great outcomes in patients. Like I mentioned in the commentary, a significant increase in unique prescribers, a much higher attachment rate of CGM, which will really impact our economics.\nThat's where a lot of the profit comes from. We think this is durable and in line with the market trends of time and range and moving to Automated Insulin Delivery. We've got a nice pipeline coming down the path as well. But to answer those specific questions, I'm going to turn to Que, as you know, runs that business. Que, do you want to touch on Vijay's specific question?\n\nQue Dallara\n\nEVP and President of Diabetes Operating Unit, Medtronic\n\nYes. Thanks, Geoff. Thanks, Vijay. We're really pleased with the momentum we're seeing in the US so far. In terms of what's driving the low 30s AID growth in the US, it's both our existing installed base of 770G users that have upgraded. We've had more than 50% of that cohort upgrade or in the process of upgrading. But we're also seeing growth coming from new patients. We've had the highest new patient growth in three years, and that's coming from MDI as well as competitors, which is.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThat's helpful to hear. I mean, Geoff, one quick follow-up. A lot of questions here on China. The new anti-corruption campaign, we're seeing some headlines, a lot of questions on how this would impact device companies. Maybe just talk about the high-level interest in China. What was the VBP impact in the quarter and any signs of perhaps the channel pausing here because of this new anti-corruption campaign? Thank you.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nI think you asked about the anti-corruption and VBP, so in China. Look, on the anti-corruption, I recognize that there are concerns out there. Look, we're actively monitoring the situation, which is fluid in nature. But I'll say that thus far, we're not seeing any material headwind for our business. It is kind of pivoting to there's a linkage to VBP.\nIt's worth noting that you could argue that we're somewhat a bit insulated from some of this anti-corruption with the coverage under VBPs. I mean, volume in this case is contracted, and with the hospital, pricing is determined with VBP. We're less reliant on the field team and distribution, which has also allowed us to take cost out to mitigate the price impact. No impact at this point from the anti-corruption campaign that you read about.\nThen regarding VBP, I mean, we feel it's a two-and-a-half-year kind of impact here. For us, that kind of fully takes effect in this fiscal year, FY 2024. It's all in our guidance. As Karen pointed out in the commentary, the China growth this past quarter was at 4%, which is slightly higher than we expected, still well below what it used to be, but in where we think it's going to get back.\nAs we kind of lap these last couple of VBP areas in FY 2024, we expect this revenue to get back to historical high single-digit, low double-digit growth for us. I hope that answers the question. I mean, this is something, as you look forward, it's a multi-billion dollars of revenue for the company that over the last couple of years has been negative, more recently flat, now starting to get positive.\nAs we get out of FY 2024, again, we expect a tick up in this growth. That's coming.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nYeah, thanks for the questions, Vijay. We'll take the next question, please, Brad.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Robbie Marcus at JPMorgan. Robbie, please go ahead.\n\n[Company Representative] (JPMorgan)\n\nCompany Representative, JPMorgan\n\nOh, great. Good morning. Congrats on a good quarter. Maybe to start for Geoff or Karen, as we think about guidance for the rest of the year, you raised the organic sales growth from the low end of four to four and a half up to four and a half. You did six in the Q1. Maybe just walk us through why growth is going to decelerate for the rest of the year, and what are some of the factors affecting what could drive you above that? Thanks.\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nEVP and CFO, Medtronic\n\nThanks for that question, Robbie. Appreciate it. Q1 was a really great start to our year, and we're really pleased with the breadth of our performance. As Geoff mentioned, it's the third consecutive quarter that we've had of solid mid-single-digit growth. We're carrying the beat that we had in Q1 and raising our Q2 guide to 4 to 4.5%. All of that puts our FY 2024 guidance at 4.5.\nIt's still early in the year, and we're focused on providing guidance that sets us up for success. I've talked about some of the puts and takes that we've got. We're a little more optimistic on China. Geoff talked about it. We've had procedure volume recovery. We also had some of the VBP impacts that we expected in the Q1 delayed into later in the fiscal year.\nWe're expecting Russia to be a bigger drag given the new sanctions that were put in place in late May. But we're focused on offsetting that just as we did in Q1. We feel good about the improved underlying fundamentals. And we're intensely focused on hitting our commitments. Just on the acceleration for the rest of the year, on a comp-adjusted basis, Q2 represents an acceleration from Q1. And then we expect continued acceleration into the back half, each quarter of the fiscal year into the back half. Hopefully, that answers your question.\n\n[Company Representative] (JPMorgan)\n\nCompany Representative, JPMorgan\n\nYeah, great. Thank you. Maybe just one more on margins. Margin expansion or the upside in the quarter came from gross margin. SG&A, I know you had some reductions in the headcount. As we just try and think about operating margins for this year and going forward, how should we think about how much more there is to come out of SG&A and how much more upside there is in gross margin moving back towards where we were pre-COVID? Thanks a lot.\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nEVP and CFO, Medtronic\n\nYeah, thanks for the question, Robbie. Clearly, we're focused on driving margin expansion and ultimately on the gross margin getting back to pre-COVID levels over time. We saw improved margins this quarter. We're increasing our full-year guidance on gross margin expectations given some of that outperformance. But in Q1, we did have some better-than-expected currency and pricing.\nSome of that was due to timing, with some provincial tenders in China being delayed a bit. Some of the FX improvement that we saw this quarter, we expect FX to impact us a little bit more in the back half of the year. As we think about margins, we are making investments in our global operations and supply chain to drive cost out of the organization.\nI mentioned a couple of examples where we're consolidating our suppliers and focused on improvements in our manufacturing operations to drive continued improvement. Over time, we're focused on stabilizing and improving our margins. That will continue to impact us on the operating margin line. On SG&A, as you mentioned, we're focused on continuing to drive leverage in our SG&A line, as you've seen us do for a long period of time.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nOkay, thank you, Robbie. We'll take the next question, please, Brad.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Larry Biegelsen at Wells Fargo Securities. Larry, please go ahead.\n\nLarry Biegelsen\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess too, for Sean, given the upcoming events here with the Symplicity AdCom and then the Affera Pulse data this weekend, Sean, how are you feeling about the Symplicity panel tomorrow? If we see a positive recommendation, help us think about timelines for approval and the ramp in the US for Renal Denervation.\nSecond, we're going to see the Affera Pulse data this weekend as well. You guys are growing mid-single digits, looks like a little bit below the market right now. What should we be looking for in the Affera Pulse data? And how are you feeling about being able to grow your AFib business at or above the market going forward? Thank you.\n\nSean Salmon\n\nEVP and President of Cardiovascular Portfolio, Medtronic\n\nThanks for the question, Larry. I guess starting with the AdCom panel, obviously, we've been very confident about the prospects of US approval, and we're exquisitely well prepared for that panel. I'm not going to handicap the timing, but typically, it's three to four months post-panel recommendation that you tend to see things. I'd say an approval in the second half of fiscal year 2024 is certainly in order with that kind of timing.\nThe ramp itself, of course, is going to be dictated by the pace of reimbursement. And we're well prepared on that front as well. As far as our pulsed field ablation, we're looking forward to seeing the results like everyone else's. This is a randomized trial, as you know. That comparative efficacy compared to both Cryo and RF Ablation for the populations being studied will be of interest to us.\nI think our distinction really in pulsed field is that we are the only player that has both a focal solution as well as an anatomic solution in the bag. The anatomic solution or single-shot market is about 15% of the market. The other 85% is what the point-by-point ablation will bring to us. Certainly very confident in both technologies, both the PulseSelect and the Affera Mapping and Sphere-9 catheter system, which is very different than everything else that's out there. We look forward to bringing those to customers all around the world.\n\nLarry Biegelsen\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nAll right. Thank you.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Larry. Next question, please, Brad.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Danielle Antalffy at UBS. Danielle, please go ahead.\n\n[Company Representative] (UBS)\n\nCompany Representative, UBS\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats. This was quite a good quarter. Just a quick question on GLP-1s, Geoff. I know this is probably an annoying question for you, but this is something that's been impacting the market broadly. Just curious, you guys touch on many, many areas within medical devices. How are you guys thinking about the impact of GLP-1s over the next, I would say even a few years, but maybe let's focus on more the next year as these drugs get more readily adopted?\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nSure. Thanks, Danielle, for the comments and the question. Yeah, it is interesting. First of all, I'd say it's an important class of drugs. Like, you were monitoring to see how the GLP-1 therapy is being adopted. That said, our initial work indicates minimal impact to our business. When you look at Bariatric, the one area we've seen some modest impact is Bariatric.\nBut this is a really small impact, and this is a relatively small part of our Surgery business. We are hearing from the work we do: our internal analysis plus dialogue that we're having with physicians around the world. We actually operate obesity clinics in Europe as well. They're talking about longer term; this could actually bring in the Bariatric space more patients into the funnel.\nShort term, we've seen some impact, again, modest, Bariatrics are a relatively small part of our Surgery business. Longer term, we'll see how it plays out. There's a bit of optimism there, though. No impact in Type 1 diabetes, which is the vast majority of our Diabetes business. And just overall, I just don't see GLP-1s having a material impact on our business and medical device therapies at large. That's what our work is showing us at this point.\n\n[Company Representative] (UBS)\n\nCompany Representative, UBS\n\nThen I guess just one quick follow-up to that, thinking about, again, the Diabetes business. Type 2 is a big growth area. You guys have an AID pen, too. What are your thoughts specifically on the Type 2 diabetes side of things? Thanks so much.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nThanks. Look, I think this is AID for insulin-dependent patients, whether they're Type 2 or Type 1, is pretty underpenetrated. We see way more upside there than headwinds.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Danielle. We'll take the next question, please, Brad.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Travis Steed at Bank of America. Travis, please go ahead.\n\nTravis Steed\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research and Medical Technology, Bank of America\n\nHey, congrats on a good quarter. I guess I'll ask about TAVR, double-digit growth this quarter. I'm curious how much success you've had with the new valve versus the five-year data. I know your competitor is going to have five-year data out pretty soon. Then the 21% Japan growth really stood out. Just curious if that's sustainable or if that was more of a one-off in the quarter.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nWell, first, before I turn it over to Sean, we are, if you go back the last couple of quarters, we are pleased with how our TAVR business is performing relative to competition and how the new valve is performing, and also the pipeline for the future. But Sean, why don't you give the specifics on that question?\n\nSean Salmon\n\nEVP and President of Cardiovascular Portfolio, Medtronic\n\nSure. Yeah, Travis, the new valve has certainly been well-received wherever we've launched it. It's been launched in the United States and a number of other geographies, and Japan, notably. The other thing that drove Japan growth was that we got a new indication for end-stage renal disease, which is something we've been lacking in Japan. It's a large consideration for that population that really helped drive the performance.\nBut yes, our long-term data have been really the signature of that device. And we'll see more of that this coming weekend as well as the 10-year NOTION data. This is the first 10-year data being reported out for TAVR. We'll be on display. Then, of course, we have four-year data coming up on our low-risk study as well to look forward to this fall. We stand behind the valve performance all the way around.\nWhether it's the acute ease of use or the long-term durability of the valve, it's really shining. We're getting a lot of traction from all of that.\n\nTravis Steed\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research and Medical Technology, Bank of America\n\nThat's helpful. And then the PMRI spend, I assume the time changes more because spends take longer than sells. But maybe some other comments on when we could see the Form 10. Can you confirm the operating margin profile? That business is still kind of slightly higher than overall Medtronic. And then do we need to wait for this to get through to see more on the portfolio management side of things? Thank you.\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nEVP and CFO, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Travis. I think there's nothing to read into this other than we're focused on maximizing shareholder value. We've been taking our time to evaluate the alternatives. We've said all along that it's been set the high bar, and that remains the likely way that we'll separate. We're expecting to close the first half of next fiscal year, if not sooner. In terms of Form 10, you'll see it when you see it. In terms of the margins of the business, yes, they are good margins, and slightly higher than the company. Hopefully, that helps.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nThe business continues to perform well. Like Karen said, the margin profile has remained strong. Actually, the competitive dynamics, and particularly in the Patient Monitoring side of it, have probably improved a bit in our favor. It's a good business. I think with more focus, I think these numbers can even improve.\n\nTravis Steed\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research and Medical Technology, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thanks a lot.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Travis. Next question, please, Brad.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Matt Miksic at Barclays. Matt, please go ahead.\n\nMatt Miksic\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, thanks so much for the question. Congrats on a really strong quarter across the board. There's a lot to talk about, but maybe one question on Diabetes for Que and then one follow-up. Just would love to hear how things are progressing with some of the programs that you talked about at ADA, the next-gen sensor in integrated testing, and the patch pump that you're in the process of acquiring here.\nThen if I could on that, Geoff mentioned something about a next-gen AID pump. I know it's way early to even ask the question, but just curious if you are ready to share any hints about that. Then one quick follow-up if I could.\n\nQue Dallara\n\nEVP and President of Diabetes Operating Unit, Medtronic\n\nYeah, thanks. Thanks for your questions. As you know, Simplera CGM, our next-gen CGM, is under review with the FDA. We're in the process of doing that. It's very difficult to put a precise timeline on when we expect to have approval, but that is progressing. In terms of the integration with 780G, we have completed adult enrollments for the clinical trial in Q1.\nWe expect to complete the peds enrollment in Q2, but that's at the clinical trial stage. In terms of the patch, we're making progress there as well in terms of completing that transaction. We expect that we would close out the EOFlow acquisition at the end of this calendar year. Again, very sorry to disappoint you, but difficult to comment on our further programs. They're progressing as we expect in our internal timelines. But at this stage, it's a bit too early to put details on specific timing.\n\nMatt Miksic\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThat's helpful and understandable. Just one, the follow-up is on sort of seasonality. You've seen July here. I know there's been a number of questions across the sector given what we've seen over the last couple of months.\nEveryone's been year to date in surgeries, procedure volumes, and so on. Just any sense of what kind of summer quarter we should expect, which for you, I guess, just August, but softer than usual, seasonally normal. How would you describe what you've seen in July and what your expectations have built into your fiscal Q2 here? Thanks.\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nEVP and CFO, Medtronic\n\nSo I would just say, Travis, that the first few weeks of the quarter and what we've seen in July are tracking well. We've continued to have strength in the underlying performance. It's tracking to the expectations we set in our guidance.\n\nMatt Miksic\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThat's fair. All right. Thanks so much.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Matt. We'll take the next question, please, Brad.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Chris Pasquale at Nephron. Chris, please go ahead.\n\nChris Pasquale\n\nPartner and Senior Analyst of Medical Devices and Supplies, Nephron Research\n\nThanks. Geoff, one for you. And then quick follow-up for Karen. You mentioned Artificial Intelligence as one of the areas Medtronic is investing in. It's obviously a hot topic in the market more broadly. Could you provide any examples of the work you guys are doing there? Maybe talk about which businesses you see AI as being most relevant for in the near future.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nSure. Well, first of all, I think for the medical device industry, kind of the intersection of traditional biomedical engineering with these digital technologies, whether it be connectivity or data analytics techniques like AI, deep learning, and robotics, these are all just a huge opportunity for the industry. These are areas that we intend to lead in.\nAI specifically, we've got a number of businesses that have first-of-their-kind AI-powered solutions that have received regulatory approval by the FDA and other regulatory bodies around the world. What we're seeing here is just from the AI is just improved outcomes and access. It's what it's when you combine the AI with good data, not just quantity, but the quality of data. That data is labeled properly.\nWe're seeing the ability to even personally evolve and improve the efficacy over time through the AI and even personalize it. The FDA has approved a couple of products for us in the Cardiac Rhythm space, Spine and GI, where you have what they call a predetermined change control plan, where you're allowed to kind of improve that efficacy over time. Some of the businesses that are impacted, like I mentioned, are the GI, or now called, Endoscopy space, where we have AI in the colonoscopies.\nYou're kind of redefining traditional colonoscopies, where the AI is finding polyps that physicians were missing. This is a significant amount of polyps. It's obviously good for patient outcomes because there's a high correlation to colon cancer from these polyps. It's also economically aligned with a hospital's interest as you find more polyps and remove them.\nIn other areas in our Spine business, this is an industry that's being completely redefined by enabling technology, transformed and redefined by enabling technology. We talk about robotics, imaging, navigation, and powered instruments, but AI is a key piece of this. We have thousands of surgeries in our AI that's powering our AI algorithm. With each, spine is a complicated surgery, especially whether it be degenerative or severe deformity, complex cases, highly reliant on surgeon training.\nThe AI is really just improving outcomes here, especially when it's combined with enabling technology. I could go on. In Cardiac Rhythm, in our monitoring and our LINQ monitoring business there, we are cutting down false positives and detecting AFib by 50% using AI. That's creating multiple hours of productivity for these clinics around the country.\nGiven, so it's really driving the deployment of that technology. I'd say it's a huge opportunity. It's a differentiator. I mentioned we hired a new Head of Technology, Ken Washington, to really help us scale this across all our businesses and better partner with some big tech companies. We've talked about our partnership with NVIDIA.\nIn the end, I'd say what we're going to see over the next couple of years is AI is not going to be replacing surgeons. But I tell you what, surgeons who use AI will be replacing surgeons that don't. We are going to be right in the middle of that mix.\n\nChris Pasquale\n\nPartner and Senior Analyst of Medical Devices and Supplies, Nephron Research\n\nThanks for the great examples. Karen, you mentioned price is a contributor to the gross margin strength in the quarter. Could you give us a sense for what price looks like across the company today, maybe how it compares to where you were a couple of years ago, and if you think that it's sustainable as we move into a less inflationary environment going forward?\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nEVP and CFO, Medtronic\n\nYes, thanks for the question. As you've heard us talk about, we have been building a pretty strong muscle around pricing. We're focused on ensuring that we price for the value that we deliver. Typically, historically, pre-COVID, we would experience up to 200 basis points of pricing pressure every year.\nWe've been able to neutralize that these last couple of years, including this quarter. We obviously have had VBP pressure this year. Llast year, we were able to neutralize that as well at the total company level. By quarter, it may not be fully neutralized depending on how VBP hits us. But we do believe that this pricing muscle that we've built is going to be lasting.\nWe fully intend to continue to track, monitor, talk about pricing so that even as we move into a lower inflationary environment, we're focused on continuing this pricing muscle that we've built.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nI just want to reemphasize that last point there on kind of we'll start with on margins, on gross margins. There was a question earlier. Karen went into detail. I'm not going to repeat that. But on gross margins, the pricing muscle that we've been building, I think we intend that to be enduring.\nThen Karen mentioned the cost of goods sold improvements that we're making, productivity around our cost of goods sold line, really driven by our new structure, strategy, and capabilities in our global operations and supply chain. That'll all help gross margin. As you get down the P&L, we're really focused on getting leverage from SG&A. Excited about stabilizing and then improving the margins over time.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nOkay. Thanks, Chris. We'll take the next question, please, Brad.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Jayson Bedford at Raymond James. Jayson, please go ahead.\n\nJayson Bedford\n\nManaging Director of Medical Technology, Raymond James\n\nGood morning. Can you hear me okay?\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah, Jayson, we can hear you.\n\nJayson Bedford\n\nManaging Director of Medical Technology, Raymond James\n\nAll right. Thanks. Not to make this a call all around gross margin, but I did have a question. You mentioned stabilization. I just wanted to put a little context around that. What is the expected gross margin for fiscal 2024?\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nEVP and CFO, Medtronic\n\nYeah. At this point, when we gave our guidance back in May, we said we expected it to be around 65 and a quarter. At this point, we're expecting it to be about 65 and a half. We've seen some improvement in Q1, and we're carrying some of that through.\n\nJayson Bedford\n\nManaging Director of Medical Technology, Raymond James\n\nOkay. Just, Karen, the dropdown for the rest of the year versus Q1 levels, revenue is higher. Is this just strictly a function of the VBP impact hitting more in the back half?\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nEVP and CFO, Medtronic\n\nYes. It's both VBP and currency. You're right. Higher revenue growth clearly helps on the margin front. We have seen some timing on VBP that we talked about. We also have some timing on FX. It was a little bit better than we expected down the P&L in Q1. We expect to give some of that back as we look at the currency impact going forward.\n\nJayson Bedford\n\nManaging Director of Medical Technology, Raymond James\n\nThank you.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Jayson. Brad, I think we have time for two more questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Joanne Wuensch at Citi. Joanne, please go ahead.\n\nJoanne Wuensch\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nGood morning. Thank you very much for taking the question in a nice quarter or nice way to start the fiscal year. Two quick questions. Volumes we've seen throughout MedTech this season have been quite strong, which leads me to wonder, is this sort of a new normalized base or whether or not we're just catching up on some pent-up demand?\nI'd love your opinion on that. Then for Hugo, you talked about activating new sites in the United States. Can you give us maybe an update on the thoughts on timing of a launch in the US? Then anything else you can add for OUS robotic placements would be appreciated. Thank you.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nSure, Joanne. Yeah, good to hear from you. Thanks for the questions. I'll take the first one, and then I'll turn it over to Mike Marinaro to handle the Hugo questions. I think on procedure trends, as Karen mentioned, I mentioned in the commentary, they're definitely improved. I'll start in the US, where we're up about 5% or so.\nBut across the board, we're seeing very good procedural trends. We're largely back to pre-COVID or better. Pre-COVID levels are better. As you know, over the last, I don't know, 18 months or so, the rebound has been, I'd say, held back a bit by staffing issues. Those have seemed to have abated. Like I said, we're getting pretty broad-based procedural pickups and are back to pre-COVID or even better levels. Outside of the US, I'd say it's even stronger. In Western Europe, high single digits.\nThe recovery in Europe is definitely in full swing. Latin America, high teens. Just our emerging market base, when you got to pull out if you pull out China, which is VBP, and like I said before, this is we see kind of the stabilizing year here for VBP, FY 2024. Then as you get into FY 2025, you get back to some higher growth in China like we've seen before.\nBut if you take out China and Russia with the sanctions, we're in the teens, mid-teens, and high teens, actually, in emerging markets. Emerging markets trends are strong. I mentioned Latin America is a standout, Western Europe. Pretty good trends. We're not seeing like this, at least in the areas we're in. I've heard some like Orthopedics, there's been a pent-up demand. We're not seeing it in the areas we're in.\nIt's been a steady flow versus a pent-up demand. I think that's good news for the industry. On the Hugo-specific questions, I'd like to turn it over to Mike Marinaro, who runs our Surgical business, which includes Hugo and also our endoscopy, or formerly called GI business, reports up to him as well.\n\nMike Marinaro\n\nEVP and President of Surgical and Endoscopy, Medtronic\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question, Joanne. Specifically on the US, we did comment that we added sites in the quarter. That's true. We had both sites and enrollments and continue to progress according to plan in our Expand URO study. We're pleased with the progress we're making there and seeing that progress continue here as we've moved into this quarter.\nMore broadly, we've seen good progress really and continue to be encouraged about the progress we're making across the program. We're now selling in five regions around the globe: Greater China, Asia, Western Europe, LATAM, North America, and Canada, and increased our installations again here in this quarter. I think importantly, we've also seen an increasing flow or a steady flow of increasing indication approvals. We received the General Surgery indication in Japan.\nNow we have a full suite of approvals across General Surgery, Gynecology, and Urology in both Japan and Western Europe, which are two of the three largest markets around the globe. Of course, the US is the largest. That's one we remain incredibly focused on. Overall, we're seeing that the growth here in Hugo is contributing to the growth we've seen now in the Surgical business across the last couple of quarters. It will become a more and more important part of our business as we move forward.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah. Really excited about the setup we have for our business. It's a very large business for us where the supply capacity has been an issue; that's in a much better spot. The robots out there, I'll just walk through kind of indication expansion and geographic expansion and update on the US trial. I like the setup and the competitive dynamics going forward over the next couple of years. We got two major competitors, one with robot, one without. We're feeling pretty good about where we are with surgery.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nOkay. Thanks, Joanne. I still see a number of people in the queue, and I apologize that we won't be able to get to all of you today given timing. We've got time for one more question, please, Brad.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from Patrick Wood at Morgan Stanley. Patrick, please go ahead.\n\nPatrick Wood\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley",
    "content2": "Fabulous. Thank you so much. I'll keep it to one given the timing. S&OP and supply chain is obviously not a very sexy topic, but you guys are doing a lot of work on that side. I'm just curious. Typically when we put processes and rationalization in place, there's kind of upfront cost and your dual running systems, and it's kind of difficult for people to transition.\nAre you seeing any slight, let's say, short-term challenges or costs associated with that, where the payback is obviously going to come in the next, I don't know, year or two? Just help us understand how that's looking for the business. Thanks.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nWell, let me just start off by saying I appreciate your question on supply chain. It's been a big focus area for us. I know a couple of thousand people at Medtronic that do think it's a pretty sexy place to be and are pretty proud of the work that we're doing. To answer the question, I'll turn it over to Karen on the cost question.\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nEVP and CFO, Medtronic\n\nYeah. Thanks, Patrick. Yes. When we're working on improving processes and driving better costs down, it does take investment. That investment is included in the guidance that we've given and is part of the reason that our gross margins are not yet stable. We fully expect those investments to pay off over time and to help drive costs down more than inflation as we work to bring our gross margins up. Hopefully, that's helpful.\n\nPatrick Wood\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nAmazing. Thank you.\n\nRyan Weispfenning\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Medtronic\n\nOkay. Thanks, Patrick. Geoff, please go ahead with your closing remarks.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nWell, first of all, thanks everyone for the questions. As always, we appreciate your support and your continued interest in Medtronic. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress on our Q2 earnings broadcast, which we anticipate holding on Tuesday, 21 November. With that, thanks again for joining us today, and have a great rest of your day."

    "content": "Q4 2023 Medtronic PLC Earnings Call\n\nQ4 2023 Medtronic PLC Earnings Call\n\nMDTNYSEMAY 25, 8:00 AM\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nTo invest heavily in R&D to drive future growth. We're confident in delivering durable revenue growth in the year ahead as our recent revenue headwinds dissipate and we drive execution across our businesses.\nLet's turn to the details of our Q4 results. Our growth in the quarter started with a strong foundation from our largest businesses, Cardiac Rhythm, Surgical, and Spine + ENT. These businesses have durable, established leadership positions, and combined, they made up half of our revenue and grew 5%. Organic CRM grew 5% on a one-share basis in the quarter as we continue to see robust double-digit growth in our Micra leadless pacemaker franchise.\nEarlier this month, we received FDA approval for our next-generation leadless pacemakers, Micra AV2 and VR2, which extend the battery life by 40% to a projected 16 and 17 years, respectively, and in high power. We released data on our enhanced EV-ICD algorithm last weekend at HRS, and we're preparing to launch our Aurora Extravascular ICD later this year.\nIn surgical innovations, we grew 4% or 8% when you exclude China given the provincial stapling VBP impacts in the quarter. Surgical procedures continued to recover, and we regained share on supply improvements. Our advanced energy products in particular benefited from improving supply, growing high teens, and we also launched our LigaSure XP and continued our rollout of the cordless Sonicision 7.\nNow cranial and spinal technologies continue to deliver solid growth as well as growing 5%, including 6% growth in US core spine. We're seeing success from our market leading ecosystem of AiBLE enabling technology and the associated pull through of our best in class spinal implants from our AI enabled surgical planning platform to our patient specific spine implants to our imaging, navigation, and robotic technologies. Spine surgeons around the world are increasingly attracted to our differentiated and innovative solutions.\nSo it was a solid quarter for our largest businesses. We also had a strong Q4 in our businesses that compete in high secular growth medtech markets. All combined these businesses made up about 20% of our revenue and grew high single digits organically. And we're feeding these businesses with the investments that they need and as they grow we expect them to become a larger part of our revenue mix and drive our durable growth going forward. So starting with Neurovascular which is now annualizing at over $1.3 billion, we grew 13%.\nWe saw broad strength across the business in both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke with double digit growth in several categories including aspiration and flow diversion.\nStroke is the number two cause of death globally, and combined with low therapy penetration, we see a large opportunity for neurovascular to make a difference in the treatment of stroke, driving meaningful growth with strong margins for years to come. In structural heart, we grew 9% organic.\nWe're seeing improvements in the TAVR space, especially in the latter part of our quarter. Post-spring holidays, we won TAVR share in the US on the strength of Evolut FX, which combines industry-leading durability with enhanced and predictable valve deployment. In Japan, our structural heart business grew low double digits, driven by the mid-quarter launch of Evolut FX. Next, in cardiac ablation solutions, we grew 5% and made significant advances in our pipeline during the quarter.\nIn March, the impressive results of our landmark Pulsed AF pivotal trial studying our single shot PulseSelect PFA catheter were presented as a late breaker at ACC and published in the journal Circulation. The trial had strong efficacy and safety results in both persistent and paroxysmal patients.We filed our PMA with the FDA and we expect to be one of the first companies with a PFA catheter in the US market. We also received CE Mark in March for our Affera mapping and ablation system including our Sphere-9 catheter and we began our limited market release. Sphere-9 can perform both PFA and RF ablation, as well as high-density mapping all from the same catheter.\nSo with our Sphere-9 focal catheter and our PulseSelect single shot catheter, we have the full breadth of PFA catheter technology from PFA to our Affera Mapping and Ablation System to our leading Arctic Front cryo solution, and AcQCross transseptal access system. We're assembling a leading ecosystem of technologies, and we're poised to become a much more meaningful player in the fast growing $8 billion EP ablation space.\nIn surgical robotics, we continue to have positive momentum with the rollout of our differentiated Hugo robotic system in international markets, and we're making progress bringing Hugo to the US as we execute our Expand URO pivotal trial. We also saw meaningful acceleration in sales of our Touch Surgery Enterprise solution, which is the first AI powered surgical video and analytics platform for the operating room.\nWith Hugo and Touch Surgery, we're bringing innovative solutions to surgeons around the world, and given the low penetration of robotic surgery and our strong position as a global leader in the surgical space, we expect to deliver meaningful growth over the coming years.\nAnd in diabetes, it was a big quarter for us as our warning letter was lifted and we received FDA approval of our MiniMed 780G system with the Guardian 4 Sensor. These products drove double-digit growth in Western Europe, and we're very excited to begin shipping them to US consumers next week. We expect our US Diabetes growth to ramp over time as our existing customers come up for renewal and as consumers switch to Medtronic.\nHealthcare professionals and people living with diabetes are really going to appreciate the innovation we're delivering, particularly the advanced meal detection technology. And just this morning we announced our intent to acquire EOFlow, the manufacturer of the EOPatch, a tubeless, wearable, and fully disposable insulin delivery device.\nThe EOPatch is already available in Europe, South Korea, and the UAE and this will accelerate our speed to market in the fast growing patch pump space with a product that has demonstrated manufacturability. In addition, upon close we'll work quickly to integrate our clinically proven meal detection technology algorithm, which is in the MiniMed 780G system, into the EOPatch and seek marketing authorization.\nLook, we have not blinked when it comes to diabetes, and we're shifting to offense as we continue to invest heavily in assembling our ecosystem of durable pumps, smart pens, patch pumps, sensors, algorithms, and customer service with multiple programs under development. Having this ecosystem is really important because we believe the market will move from CGM first to automated insulin delivery, and we are well positioned for that trend.\nWe look forward to updating all of you on these growth opportunities at our Diabetes Analyst and Investor Briefing next month at ADA. Now turning to our synergistic businesses, there were several strong performances in the quarter. Our aortic business grew in the mid-20s as product availability and AAA share improved. Cardiac surgery had a great quarter growing 8% with strength in perfusion and cannula sales.\nCardiac diagnostics had a high single digit growth on the continued adoption of our differentiated AI-enabled LINQ II insertable cardiac monitor, and earlier this month our LINQ II AI technology, which we call AccuRhythm AI, was awarded the 2023 MedTech Breakthrough Award for the best new technology solution in monitoring. Our GI business grew 16% on procedure, volume recovery, and continued strong adoption of GI Genius, another one of our AI-enabled products. GI Genius uses AI during colonoscopies to help physicians detect polyps.\nWe also announced a strategic collaboration in the quarter with NVIDIA and Cosmo Pharmaceuticals to allow third-party developers to train and validate AI models that can eventually run as apps on the GI Genius platform. We're excited about the potentially game-changing solutions this could offer for GI physicians and their patients.\nNow before I go to Karen, I want to note that we continue to focus on the transformation of Medtronic as we reduce complexity, enhance our capabilities, drive efficiency, and improve portfolio management and capital allocation, all with the goal of positioning the company for delivering durable growth, and the progress we're making is beginning to show up in our financial results. I shared with you last quarter that we were planning for significant cost reductions.\nWe began to execute those plans last month, which included reductions in our global workforce. While these are never easy decisions and I am mindful of the personal impact across our teams, these actions were necessary and are allowing us to increase our investments in innovation. They also help us to mitigate the inflationary and foreign exchange impacts on our profitability.\nLook, we're making progress enhancing our global operations, supply chain, and quality systems, which is all yielding results, and we continue to advance our active portfolio management processes. We closed on the divestiture of our renal care solutions business during the quarter, and we continue to work on the separation path for our patient monitoring, and respiratory interventions businesses.\nNow there's still work to be done, but we're making progress setting up the company to deliver durable growth and strong returns. With that, I'll turn it over to Karen to discuss our financial performance and give guidance for fiscal 2024. Karen.\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nCFO, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Geoff. Our Q4 organic revenue increased 5.6% ahead of expectations, and our non-GAAP EPS of $1.57 grew 3%, was at the upper end of our guidance range, and exceeded consensus.\nLooking at our revenue by geography, our international markets remained strong, non-US developed markets in Western Europe grew 8%, and Japan returned to growth following the COVID impacts last quarter growing 5%. Emerging markets, which make up 17% of our revenue, returned to double-digit growth in the quarter growing 11%. China also delivered growth of 3% as procedures recovered from prior lockdowns and the impact to our growth from volume-based procurement improved.\nWe had strong growth in many other markets including low-30s growth in Southeast Asia, low-20s growth in the Middle East and Africa, mid-teens growth in Eastern Europe, and low double-digit growth in Latin America. Turning to margins, our adjusted gross margin was relatively stable sequentially but declined year-over-year due to inflation and a 1-percentage-point impact from currency.\nAs I've noted in prior quarters, the impact to our gross margin from inflationary pressures is delayed by two to three quarters because our incurred manufacturing variances first go onto our balance sheet and then move into our P&L as inventory is sold. While the magnitude of these variances has begun to ease slightly, they do remain high, and as a result we continue to expect pressure on our gross margins over the coming quarters.\nDespite that pressure, we drove a 350 basis points sequential improvement in our adjusted operating margin, and on a constant currency basis, our operating margin improved 50 basis points year over year as we drove expense reduction including reduced incentive compensation below the operating profit line. Our adjusted nominal tax rate was 15.8%. That was above our expectations from incremental taxes owed on the IP agreement that Ryan mentioned up front.\nAlong with our jurisdictional mix of profits in the quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong. We continue to direct capital toward investment and future growth opportunities along with returning a minimum of 50% of free cash flow to our shareholders. We're identifying high return organic R&D opportunities and driving efficiencies across our business and to free up capital to invest in them.\nWe also continue to evaluate opportunities to supplement our organic investments with tuck in acquisitions to accelerate our long term weighted average market growth rate. At the same time, you should expect us to be disciplined with a focus on maintaining or growing our returns on invested capital over the long term. We know our shareholders place strong value in our ability to return capital.\nIn fiscal 2023 we returned $4 billion through dividends and share repurchases, and just this morning we announced that we are increasing our dividend for the 46th consecutive year, reflecting the Board's confidence in our balance sheet and our future earnings power.\nNow, turning to guidance, we've delivered a couple of back-to-back quarters of mid single digit growth, growing 5% in the back half of the fiscal year with 5.6% in the Q4. We're encouraged with the procedure recovery in many of our markets, our product availability is improving, we like our competitive position across our businesses, and we have many new innovative products coming to market.\nAt this point we're setting our fiscal 2024 organic revenue guidance at 4% to 4.5%, and given it's the start of the year, we think it's prudent for you to model at the lower end of that range. This guidance excludes the impact of foreign currency and revenue from our new other segment, and I direct you to the guidance slide in our earnings presentation for additional details.\nIn Q1 we're guiding to the high end of our annual range. We'll see with organic revenue growth of 4.5% which suggests a sequential performance in line with what we have seen historically from our Q4 to our Q1.\nBy segment. There are puts and takes on each one, but they are all roughly aligned to the corporate average for both Q1 and the year, with the exception of diabetes, which we expect will start the year growing below the corporate average and ramp through the year with the US launch of 780G.\nWhile the impact of currency is fluid based on rates at the beginning of May, foreign currency would have a positive impact on full year revenue of $110 to 210 million, including an unfavorable impact of $50 to 100 million in Q1.\nMoving down the P&L, I've been sharing for several quarters now that macroeconomic factors like inflation, foreign currency, and to a lesser extent interest and tax rates would impact our earnings power in fiscal 2024 and we're continuing to prioritize investments in R&D. In fact, when we exclude the separation of our renal care business, we expect R&D to grow above revenue as we've signaled for a while now.\nAt the same time, and as Geoff mentioned, we've been executing our cost reduction plans across the company to lessen the impact of these macro factors on our earnings. Taking all this into account, we expect continued pressure on our margins and are guiding fiscal 2024 non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $5 to $5.10.\nThe range includes an unfavorable impact of roughly 6% from foreign currency based on rates at the beginning of May, and driven by the large benefit last year from our hedging program that we don't expect will repeat this year.\nOn a constant currency basis. Our EPS guidance implies low single digit growth this year. For the Q1, we expect EPS of $1.10 to 1.12 excluding the approximate 8% impact from foreign currency based on rates at the beginning of May. This would imply constant currency growth of 5 to 7%.\nTo close, I want to recognize our outstanding employees around the world who have been helping to drive significant change to transform our company, and they have done this while keeping the Medtronic mission front and center. Thank you for everything you do to make our company stronger and to always put patients first. Back to you, Geoff.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nOkay, thank you Karen. Now, before we go to analyst questions, I'll close with a few thoughts. It was a good quarter with our broad based growth. Our surgical innovations business is back to mid single digit growth tied to the improvement in our supply, and importantly surgeon commitment to our differentiated products remains strong. We continue to see growth in neurovascular and structural heart, and we're nearing an inflection point in both diabetes and cardiac ablation solutions, and both businesses have an arsenal of technologies in their pipeline. At the same time we're seeing durable growth across our other businesses and importantly, no business is losing momentum behind the scenes.\nAs I've shared with you, since becoming CEO, we're really been pushing a comprehensive transformation to set up Medtronic to deliver durable growth and create value for our shareholders. Now, it hasn't been a straight line. Some of that's market factors, and some of that's been on us. But we've made progress and you're starting to see this in our results.\nWe've been making the necessary improvements to ensure long-term durability of our growth. We're investing in our key capabilities like global operations, IT quality, and supply chain to turn our scale into an advantage. We're picking the markets where we're doubling down and redirecting investments to our most important R&D programs, and we're shaping the portfolio, adding tuck-ins, and divesting non-core assets.\nAll of these actions are establishing the strong foundation that will allow us to drive sustainable and consistent growth. Now, there's still work to be done, but we are on the right path, and we're confident in the choices that we've made and continue to make.\nWe're executing and you're starting to see this all come together with our steady improvement. Finally, I'd like to join Karen, expressing my sincere gratitude for our employees around the world. You've played a huge role in creating some of the world's most meaningful healthcare innovations and improving the lives of millions of people every year. Thank you. Thank you for all that you do to serve our Medtronic mission every day. And I am confident that our best days are ahead of us.\nNow let's move to Q and A where we're going to try to get to as many analysts as possible. So we ask you to limit yourself to just one question, and only if needed, a related follow up. If you have additional questions, you can reach out to Ryan and the investor relations team after the call. With that, Brad, can you please give the instructions for asking a question?\n\nOperator\n\nFor the sell-side analysts that would like to ask a question, please select the Participants button and click Raise Hand. If you're using the mobile app, press the More button and select Raise Hand. Your lines are currently on mute. When called upon, you will receive a request to unmute your line, which you must respond to before asking your question.\nLastly, please be advised that this Q and A session is being recorded. For today's session, Geoff, Karen, and Ryan are joined by Q. Dallara, EVP and President of the Diabetes Operating Unit, Sean Salmon, EVP and President of the Cardiovascular Portfolio, Brett Wall, EVP and President of the Neuroscience Portfolio, and Bob White, EVP and President of the Medical Surgical Portfolio. We'll pause for a few seconds to assemble the queue.\nWe'll take the first question from Robbie Marcus at J.P. Morgan. Robbie, please go ahead.\n\nRobert Marcus\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOh great. Good morning everyone and thanks for taking the questions.\nMaybe first question. Geoff and Karen, you can give us a little more color on the guidance here. You're starting off at 4% to 4.5% organic, but want us at the low end of the range. It's a little bit below your long range goal of 5% organic sales growth and then a declining EPS for the year.\nSo maybe just walk us through how? You ended up at that range. Why are we starting at the bottom and how do you plan to return to EPS growth?\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nCFO, Medtronic\n\nThanks so much for the question, Robbie. You know, when we were thinking through our guidance for the fiscal year, we thought it was prudent to start the year with guidance that sets us up for success. You know, Geoff talked about it. We have a lot going on at Medtronic, and we're intensely focused on delivering on our commitments.\nAnd while, you know, doing so, while we continue to transform the company, you know, we have puts and takes as we always do on the year, but there are no new issues from a growth perspective. In FY24, when we look at our geographies, China remains a drag from lingering VBP, but that's improving over last year. And we're really encouraged by our second half 23 performance of 5%. And as we look early in May, we see good momentum.\nOur supply chain continues to improve, our markets continue to recover.\nWe've got a pipeline that we're really excited about, and it's weighted toward the latter half of the fiscal year. We've got 780G in the US. We've got the full suite of cardiac ablation with Affera. We've got our robot continuing to ramp, and we've got Artyon that's hopefully coming to market too.\nYou know, so we don't have any new material risk to call out. We feel really good about the coming year. You know, on EPS, we've highlighted for the past few quarters that we've got significant headwinds to EPS growth. That includes mid-single-digit inflation that's impacting our gross margins. I talked about currency of approximately 6% as a headwind, and interest and tax is around 1%.\nSo when you combine all of these factors, they're a double-digit headwind to EPS growth. But our guidance is just a mid-single-digit decline. So we've driven significant savings that allow us to protect and fund important R&D and help offset those headwinds. Just like we've talked about, you know, as we think about our long-range plan, you know, we've got work to do to improve the bottom line.\nAnd that's going to be impacted by gross margin, which is obviously impacted by inflation and currency. But over time we expect our gross margin to stabilize and then improve and that's going to be one of the key things that will help drive our bottom line into the future. But longer term, our goals have not changed. We're just going to take it one year at a time.\n\nRobert Marcus\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Maybe just a quick follow up. Karen, you have a pretty big divergence between first half comps and second half comps. How do you want us to think about the growth rates and, more importantly, the exit rate for next year at the low end of the guidance to start? Thanks.\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nCFO, Medtronic\n\nYeah, so Robbie, the comps are easier in the first half but our pipeline's weighted toward the back half. And so when we take all that together, you can think about Q2 through Q4 growth rates all being on about the lower end of our full year guidance. That's how we're thinking about it right now.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nThank you, Robbie. We'll take the next question, please. Brad,\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take the next question from Vijay Kumar at Evercore ISI. Vijay, please go ahead.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nHey guys, congrats on a nice introduction here and thanks for taking my question.\nKaren, maybe first one for you or perhaps Geoff, can you talk about the cadence of procedures here? You know how the Q shakes out. I think some of your peers noted a strong start to the year, and perhaps they slowed down exiting the Q. I'm just curious on what kind of trends into our Q4.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nSure Vijay, thanks for the question. Good to talk to you. Well, yeah, procedure volume was a tailwind. For us relative to prior quarters. I mean, Europe in particular recovered well and was out in front. US lagged a little bit, but it began to accelerate in April and May.\nSo like I said, Western Europe, high Single-digit growth and staffing issues improving. Beyond that, better product availability resulted in a strong back half of the Q4 for us in Western Europe. But clearly, staffing issues getting better. Emerging markets grew 11%, mid-teens if you exclude China and then Japan was mid single digits.\nSo we're seeing around the world a strong pickup, like I said, US lagged. You know, we saw a strong April and into May pick up there. That's how I characterize the procedures.\nIf you kind of look at it. Beyond geography, if you look at it. Maybe by therapy or product area for us. You know, surgical and GI path procedures in Med Surg as well as TAVR procedures, and some more elective procedures like pain stem picked up, I think, due to improved staffing. CRM was notable, with good initial implant growth.\nFor Medtronic specifically coming out of areplacement headwind, maybe one outlier might be coronary, still behind in procedure volume recovery. That's how I look at it by geography and by therapy area. Overall, we're pleased with all this. Like I said, overall, pleased with the acceleration and all this is kind of confirmed with what we are seeing in April and even into May.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nUnderstood. No, that's a helpful comment, Geoff. Maybe one related on the fiscal 2024 guidance, I think on the EPS, Karen has been pretty clear on some of the headwinds Medtronic is facing. My question was more on top line. You have utilization improving to your point, surgical innovation, I think supply chain is getting better, comps are easy.\nDiabetes, I think the approval is an upside surprise versus the prior assumptions post AF, I think that's going to be incremental. When you look at these, the tailwinds, right, why is 4% to 4.5% perhaps the right range? Geoff, are there any headwinds? I think China's 50 to 100 basis points. Anything else that we're not aware of, or it's just more perhaps being conservative and prudent perhaps.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah, I'll let Karen answer that one.\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nCFO, Medtronic\n\nYeah, so I think, Vijay, you know, just as we talked about it, we just think that 4% to 4.5% for the full year is a good starting point. You know, we have no new risk to call out. You know, you named a lot of the great things that are happening in tailwinds, but for us it's only Q1, and we just think it's a good place to start.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nUnderstood, thank you.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nAppreciate the question. Vijay, thanks, Brad. We'll take the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Larry Biegelsen at Wells Fargo. Larry, please go ahead.\n\nLarry Biegelsen\n\nStock Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the strong finish to the fiscal year here. Yeah, I'd like to ask about, excuse me, the EOFlow acquisition, specifically the timelines for two. The timelines for an AID system in the US and Europe. I thought we saw that a competitor won an injunction in Germany recently.\nWhat made you comfortable, you know, with the IP? I'd love to hear at a high level any thoughts on how this product's differentiated, and just maybe for Karen, maybe any update on the patient monitoring spin? I think people are interested to know how you're going to use the proceeds to offset dilution. We've seen media reports as you potentially selling the business, and depending on the tax basis and the use of proceeds, that could be dilutive as well. How should we be thinking about this? Thank you.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Larry, for the questions. I think I'll turn it over to Que to answer the EOFlow questions.\n\nQue Dallara\n\nEVP and President, Diabetes Operating Unit, Medtronic\n\nGood morning. We're very excited about the EOFlow acquisition. As you know, we're very familiar with the technologies in the patch space, as well as the manufacturing challenges there. From a strategic perspective.\nWe are the only integrated player in the diabetes technological space with both CGM, our algorithms, as well as dosing systems, and very well positioned for AID. Our portfolio is very holistic. We want to meet patients where they are, and this acquisition accelerates the introduction of an AID patch into the market. We expect to be the next to market with a differentiated product.\nOur intention is to combine EOFlow's device with the meal detection algorithm that you see today in the semi AID system, along with our next generation sensor, and expect that to be a very differentiated offering that's next to market in terms of the, I think that addresses the product differentiation and timing. In terms of the IP, as you know, I think it's been disclosed previously that we have a covenant not to sue with Insulet, and so we're very confident about our IP position, and this is a very differentiated device with Medtronic's algorithms and sensor technology.\nSo. We're very confident in the product differentiation in the market.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah, I just build on Que's comments in terms of beyond just the product, just the trend here of going from CGM first to AID automated insulin delivery. With our differentiated algorithms there. The meal detection technology, we believe this is big.\nWe're seeing it outside the US with 780G, and we want to have that same technology across a host of insulin delivery devices, whether it be a pen. Smart pen, a pump system, and a patch.\nSo this adds to that armamentarium. We're excited about it. Que's brought a lot of just. Better execution to the business as well.\nThat also helps our confidence in doing a deal like this. Looking forward to the future for our diabetes business. I'll have Karen answer the question around the patient monitoring and respiratory interventions separation.\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nCFO, Medtronic\n\nYeah, thanks for that question, Vijay. We continue to work on the separation of Patient Monitoring and Respiratory Interventions. When we announced the separation last year, we said that a spin sets a high bar because it minimizes the tax leakage, and it allows our shareholders to participate in what we believe is going to be a significant value creation opportunity. We also said we would consider alternatives, and a sale was possible because we do believe that this new co could be an attractive asset to many parties. We also said that the spin bar is really high because it's got attractive attributes for it.\nAny divergence from the spin path, you know, would really need to provide a greater value creation opportunity. Whatever course we take will be in the best interest of our shareholders. You know, how we manage dilution on this will ultimately be determined by the potential transaction. You know, we'll provide details as we have them, you know, at a later date.\n\nLarry Biegelsen\n\nStock Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nThanks Larry.\nThanks, Larry. Appreciate the questions. Just a reminder to the analysts to please stick to one question and one follow-up if needed. Brad, we'll go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Matt Miksic at Barclays. Matt, please go ahead.\n\nMatt Miksic\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, can you hear me okay?\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah, we can, Matt.\n\nMatt Miksic\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you, and thanks for taking the questions, and congrats on a nice finish to, and kind of navigating through, the resetting of the bar here for fiscal 2024. Just wanted to, given that we came out of HRS last weekend and there was a fair amount of news flow and presentations for Medtronic. Obviously, the big.\nMain topic of the meeting was PFA, as I think everyone knows. I know you expect to be one of the first to the US market. If you could talk maybe a little bit more about how you expect the timeline for that is, as specific as you can, and then how you expect to sort of navigate this perceived pressure on the single shot market. I just have one follow up if I might. Sure.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah. Well, thanks for that, Matt.\nIt's exciting for the industry, and we believe we're well positioned in those tailwinds you just mentioned.\nIt is good to see and I'm going to ask Sean to answer the specific questions around PFA and how we're positioned there.\n\nSean Salmon\n\nEVP and President, Cardiovascular Portfolio, Medtronic\n\nYeah, Matt, we really like our position. As you know, we've obtained CE Mark for our point by point solution in Europe, and we just filed the PMA for our single shot product in the United States, and we'll have a data readout sometime next year. We completed enrollment for Affera's persistent AF trial in December. We expect that one year endpoint will be reached mid of this fiscal year. In terms of how we see the shift, obviously we've got 85% of the market to play in point by point, and we have the other segment that we've been really strong in with Cryo at 15%, and I think as we initially launch into Europe, that's a much bigger opportunity for us.\nWe go to point by point solutions, and when we come to the United States being among the first in PFA solutions, all of those are going to be anatomical or single shot. I think that will garner interest from that 85% of the market that really wants to get to PFA, and they do not need to do that. I think while you have the potential for some erosion of your base in anatomical, you also have the attraction of having the very first PFA offering coming in for anatomical solutions that will pull interest from the 95% pool. Of course, we launch Affera globally, we will have, you know, the opportunity to play in a bigger swimming pool. Yeah, I think the concerns about cannibalization are overblown, frankly. There is far more greenfield for us than I think people are appreciating.\n\nMatt Miksic\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThat's super helpful. Just one quick follow up to Larry's question on diabetes. You know, congrats again on the warning letter and the pump approval, and Guardian sensor approval. Simplera is intriguing. I think a lot of folks are wondering what are your thoughts on timing and see potentially some data from that platform, given that can move you kind of more to the forefront of sort of sensor technology. Thanks.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah, thanks Matt.\n\nQue Dallara\n\nEVP and President, Diabetes Operating Unit, Medtronic\n\nThanks.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nAs I say, Simplera is definitely a jump forward. Now have Que jump in and answer that.\n\nQue Dallara\n\nEVP and President, Diabetes Operating Unit, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Geoff. We're very excited about Simplera. It's an all-in-one disposable sensor. It's half the size of the Guardian 4 sensor, no finger sticks, and a two-step insertion process compared to our current sensor technology. As you know, we submitted to CE Mark last year, last summer, and also to the FDA earlier this year. We hope that, you know, obviously we've got to go through the regulatory process, but we're anticipating that this fiscal year we should be able to get approval. That's the best we have in terms of timing.\n\nMatt Miksic\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks, Matt, for the questions. We'll take the next questions, please.\nThe next question comes from Travis Steed at BofA Global Research. Travis, please go ahead.\n\nTravis Steed\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, can you hear me okay?\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah, we can Travis, good to hear from you.\n\nTravis Steed\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nAll right, great. Maybe Karen, if you could talk about some of the cost savings stuff that you've built into this 5 to 5 to 10% EPS growth and we had estimated like $0.50 offset from the cost savings side and then some of the R&D investments, just a little bit more color on some of the puts and takes and what you have built in on the EPS guide and then on FY25 EPS. Should we think about that as more of a transition back to the 8% plus or just kind of early comments on how to think about the out year EPS?\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nCFO, Medtronic\n\nYeah, thanks for those questions, Travis. On our cost savings, you know, we said that we were driving significant cost savings. You know, we're not disclosing the exact amount, but just to give you a sense, I mentioned we have mid single-digit inflation on our gross margins. We have currency impact of approximately 6%, and we have interest and tax of around 1%. All those combined are a double-digit headwind to EPS. Our guidance is just a mid single-digit decline. The savings are significant, and obviously they allow us to protect and fund important R&D innovation. You know, when we think about R&D, we've said all along that our goal is to protect and to grow.\nAlign with revenue or above revenue when we can. If we look at this coming fiscal year and we strip away the investment that we had in R&D and RCS in our renal care business that we're separating, you know, our revenue is growing, our R&D expense, we expect it to grow higher than revenue. We did protect it. It is important to us. Then on FY25, you know, we're just starting FY24, so we're not ready to really talk about FY25.\nYou know, I mentioned that these last 18 months have been really busy for us. We've been strengthening our core with new people and new structures, we've been understanding our investment needs, we've been driving portfolio moves, we've been cutting expenses, we've been managing through our own setbacks.\nThe transformation that we've been driving amidst all of this is starting to have an impact on our results. You've seen us already move back to mid single digit growth on the top line, and we're intensely focused on, you know, delivering on our FY24 commitments and driving a lasting turnaround at Medtronic. You know, that's our priority right now.\nLonger term, our goals have not changed. You know, we're focused on that durable mid single digit revenue growth. We have continued work to do to stabilize and then improve our gross margins. We have both the plans and the work in place to do that. Ultimately, we're committed to driving a strong and leveraged P and L. We're going to take this one year at a time because that's just where we are right now. I hopehat gives you some context.\n\nTravis Steed\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nSuper helpful.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nOne finer, getting back to Karen's earlier. The answer earlier part of the answer on the cost actions.\nI think we're focused on striking the right balance, as she mentioned, between offsetting or mitigating some of the headwinds out there that affect EPS with the durability of a revenue growth. Think about reinvestment in some of the top areas in medtech, diabetes, robotics, EP for PFA. These are exciting opportunities.\nWe've got to balance mitigating some of these headwinds with making sure that we're making the right investments. She walked through the R&D growth to make sure that our revenue is durable.\n\nTravis Steed\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThat's super helpful. A quick follow-up on the EOFlow. I know they had a pipeline for a seven-day patch, and they actually had a CGM in their pipeline too. Is that something you're going to keep? Just a quick update on that.\nI did want to ask about TAVR mid single digit growth in the quarter taking share. Maybe just an update on the overall TAVR market and the trends that you're seeing there would be helpful as well. Thank you.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nQue, you want to take the EOFlow question?\n\nQue Dallara\n\nEVP and President, Diabetes Operating Unit, Medtronic\n\nYes. Look, our plans right now are to integrate our mood detection technology algorithm, as well as our next generation Simplera sensor, to bring an AID patch into the market. We think it's important for patient choice, and we want to do that as soon as possible. We can't really comment any further on additional pipeline details at this point.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nThanks Que. Sean, quick response on the TAVR question.\n\nSean Salmon\n\nEVP and President, Cardiovascular Portfolio, Medtronic\n\nSure, Charles. The market's getting better and better. I'd say we saw really nice recovery within Europe, procedures coming back, particularly in France and Germany, really strong recovery there. The United States started out a little sluggish in the quarter.\nHad a little bumpy ride from spring breaks. As you know, there's a lot of consolidated volumes, so little bits of that matter. We exited the quarter really strong. We tracked something called implant rates, just the number of cases we supported, and we're seeing really good recovery trends, which we think will continue through the year. Right now, I'd say low double to high single digits is about what the fundamentals are for the underlying market.\n\nTravis Steed\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nPerfect. Thank you.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Travis. Yeah, appreciate the questions, Travis. Just a reminder to the analysts, one question and one related follow up if needed. Brad, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Matt O'Brien at Piper Sandler. Matt, please go ahead.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nHey, Mattie there. we got a little bit of feedback.\nYeah, I think we've got a problem with your audio, Matt. We'll check that and we'll come back to you. Can we take the next question, please, Brad?\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Peter Chickering at Deutsche Bank. Peter, please, go ahead.\n\nPeter Chickering\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGood morning, guys. Can you talk about PFA adoption trends in Europe? Specifically, the interplay between PFA growth, PFA pricing versus losses from cryo market share. When you put it all together, I guess, how was European ablation growing for you guys?\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nSean, you want to take that one?\n\nSean Salmon\n\nEVP and President, Cardiovascular Portfolio, Medtronic\n\nYeah, we've done well. I mean, it's early. Early innings for our PFA offerings. You know, we're just really trying to scale up both training and operations for that. A little too early to comment on that, I'd say. You know, there's been really continued underlying growth. Just ablation in general continues to grow of all flavors. Of course, PFA will grow the fastest. We'll keep you apprised as to how that's going. We're seeing really good, strong trends, though, within Europe, and overall, it's a very robust market.\n\nPeter Chickering\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay, quick follow up here on the last TAVR question. You're talking about low double, high single digits in the marketplace. What do you guys assume within your market share for 2024?\n\nSean Salmon\n\nEVP and President, Cardiovascular Portfolio, Medtronic\n\nI don't think we're giving share guidance, Peter, but we think we're in good shape with the momentum we have with FX. We look to launch the FX into Europe in the back half of the year. We've done well in the United States, and we've done well in Japan. The product is excellent and being well received.\n\nPeter Chickering\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat, thanks so much.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nThanks, Peter. Next question, please. Brad.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Matt Taylor, Jefferies. Matt, please go ahead.\n\nMatt Taylor\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Jeffries\n\nHi. Sorry. Thanks for taking the question. Can you hear me? Yes, can you hear me okay?\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah, we can now. Yeah, we can.\n\nMatt Taylor\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Jeffries\n\nOkay, great. I think I was just on mute. Okay. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about EOFlow. Just reading that release, and it talks about 1% dilution to earnings for the first few years, and neutral to accretive thereafter. I guess I was hoping maybe you could touch on the run rate of the business today, how you assume that ramps revenue wise over the next couple years. What are some of the assumptions that go into that dilution assumption for the first couple years, and what are some of the key guideposts that we should be looking for out of that business as you acquire it?\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nWell, the business I could say, Matt, is. It's new and the revenue is retty small right now, and it's just in Europe.\nI'll let Karen. Talk about the dilution assumptions.\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nCFO, Medtronic\n\nYeah, the key here is to integrate this patch pump with our algorithm, and we'll be spending on that. That's what drives the dilution. That's the key for the first few years. Que, you want to talk about run rate from there,\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nAny milestones that you might want to look for?\n\nQue Dallara\n\nEVP and President, Diabetes Operating Unit, Medtronic\n\nI think the critical milestone to watch out for is really, you know, some development work to integrate our algorithm. You know, we have that already as part of the 780G system. We're obviously going through our sensor approvals today. That will be variable. There's a bit of development work, not a lot. EOFlow has proven manufacturability at scale. The manufacturing exists, and it is a relatively straightforward integration and approval process to get that to market. Once that EOPatch system is available in market with our next generation CGM, we think, obviously, we go through the commercialization and launch process.\nYou know, we believe it's a very strong offering, and second to market with this wearable disposable patch solution.\n\nMatt Taylor\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Jeffries\n\nGreat. Thanks for the feedback. I appreciate that.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nThank you, Matt. Next question please, Brad.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Rich Newitter at Truist. Rich, please go ahead.\n\nRichard Newitter\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nHear me?\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYes, Rich, how are you?\n\nRichard Newitter\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nCan you hear me?\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah, we can. Can you hear us? Rich.\n\nRichard Newitter\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nCan you hear me?\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYes. Yeah, I don't know, maybe we might have some connection issues with Rich. We'll go to the next question and come back to him.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Shagun Singh at RBC Capital Markets. Shagun, please go ahead.\n\nShagun Singh\n\nStock Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Can you hear me okay?\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYes.\n\nShagun Singh\n\nStock Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nOkay, perfect. Quick one on China. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about your outlook for that business. There seems to be some initial talk of COVID cases. You know, how concerned are you at this point, and you know, if it does become something larger than anticipated, you know, what areas of impact are you worried about? Secondly, I just wanted to get your thoughts on M&A.\nIt's encouraging to see you call out something on the M&A front this quarter, and I think you previously indicated that you would hold off for about 12 to 18 months until the separation has been announced to be more active on that front. Has anything changed? Perhaps you can just talk about your appetite for M&A deal size and areas you may be interested in. Thank you for taking the question.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic",
    "content2": "Well, thanks for those questions. I'll start with the China one and then get to the M&A on China. Yeah, we've heard about the some of the COVID, I wouldn't call it an outbreak, but signs of COVID in China.\nYou know, we haven't felt any impact of that at this point, in talking to some of our healthcare, some of our customers, they're not at this point too worried about it, but we're going to watch that closely in terms of our overall view on China. I was just there and looked at the economy's back, the health care procedures are back.\nObviously we're still working through volume based. Procurement, it's going to be the largest health care market in the world. It's an area that we're investing in, as we talked about before this volume-based procurement we believe by the end and as we exit this next fiscal year, as we exit this FY24, we believe we'll have been through that reset from volume-based procurement and then grow from there and get back to that double-digit growth. We've adjusted by taking out some costs in China, now that the business is more contracted, it's allowed us to take out some sales and marketing costs, and so it's still a profitable business for us that we'll get back to that double-digit growth.\nObviously we're going to have to watch the geopolitics here between the two countries, but it's encouraging some of the more recent conversations two countries are having and we spend a lot of time on this in China with the US Government. And are optimistic that this will continue to be a good market for us.\nYou know, in terms of M&A.\nYeah, obviously the EOFlow acquisition, you know, looks like one of our, you know, is one of our traditional tuck. In type of deals and a high growth area that we have a strong positioning you asked about, and that we still have a lot of appetite for those type of deals. I would say we are focusing on those deals that we believe are going to have a bigger impact on Medtronic deals like the Intersect ENT deal, deals like for ENT. The Affera deal in our AFib business for PFA that had mapping and navigation. And Some PFA technology. This EOFlow fits right into that kind of mold, bringing a patch technology to our diabetes business.\nIn terms of divestitures, I would say nothing's changed. I mean, you know, we just completed the dialysis, you know, joint venture with DaVita. So we're excited about that and closed that officially, and that's off and running.\nCalled Mozarc is the new company's name, and we're working through, as Karen walked you through the patient monitoring and respiratory interventions separation, which is a large body of work, and in terms of those type of large scale divestitures where the analysis and the thought process continues to look at our portfolio and see where opportunities are. But we're pretty focused right now executing on that one from an execution standpoint.\nAs you look forward, our appetite. Our focus is still these tuck-ins deals and think of the three examples I gave, you know, and that kind of size is, you know, you could be a little bigger than that a little smaller. Those, those are the focus areas. You know, something bigger comes along, you know, we look at it, but it's not what we're, you know, hunting for, if you will. I hope that answers your question on M&A. Karen, If you have anything to add, or I cover it.\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nCFO, Medtronic\n\nYou covered it well.\n\nShagun Singh\n\nStock Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you so much.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nThanks for the question, Shagun. Brad. Why don't we try to go back to Rich if we can, and then we'll take a final two questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Rich Newitter at Truist Securities. Rich, please go ahead.\n\nRichard Newitter\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nHi. Thanks for coming back to me. I apologize for the issues there. So maybe just wanted to start off with spine.\nI know, you know that you guys really have seen a nice turnaround there in the last year or so. Can you talk a little bit about the trend you're seeing there? Any potential disruption that may be emerging, you know, leading up to potential competitor M&A between Globus and NuVasive and then what's going on on the capital front with Mazor? I'd love to hear kind of any updates on that and the, you know, some of the capital in that business next?\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nSure. Thanks for the question, Rich. I'm going to turn over to Brett in a second to talk about the details of capital and some of the other spine trends. But I'll just start with one is.\nWe've seen this trend and I don't know, if I'd call it disruptive. It's been moving for a number of years now. This trend of the value proposition being in the industry, centering around enabling technology, navigation, imaging, robotics, powered instruments, AI-based surgical planning, and bringing that all together.\nWe brought that all together in our ecosystem called AiBLE. You are now seeing the impact of that in the marketplace and you're seeing. What it's doing to the marketplace around consolidation. This is where the business is heading. The industry is heading. It takes a lot of technology prowess and it takes a lot of balance sheets do this, and it's having a big impact on consolidation that you're seeing. As we move forward, we're really excited about our position.\nBut Brett's been overseeing this business for a number of years now and has a, I'll let him talk about more detail on the value proposition and also get into the capital dynamic.\n\nBrett Wall\n\nEVP and President, Neuroscience Portfolio, Medtronic\n\nYeah, thanks Geoff and Rich, thanks for the question. When we look at overall core spine, some really good trends there, we're seeing procedures getting back to, you know, normal, which is extremely helpful. We've had now multiple quarters of expansion in core spine, which reflects the development, as Geoff mentioned, of a broad-based ecosystem in the capital environment. And that ecosystem that we put together is taking the procedure and changing the procedure with robotics, navigation, imaging, power, surgical tools, AI, and surgical planning. It is the broadest, most extensive, most complete, most comprehensive system in the world of spine today.\nWhat you'll see with competitors, I think you mentioned, you know, one transaction that the two organizations are in the middle of, are trying to actually put these teams together and we're seeing that transformation in spine and more consolidation. If we look at capital in and of itself, we have an exceptionally strong capital footprint across the entire world. What we've seen with capital is continued good growth with capital.\nBut we've also seen now in the United States a bit of a transition. That transition is into buyout or lease agreements. We've seen a higher preponderance of that as we've been in the last few quarters, given some of the current situations, across the current economic situations. The good news about that is we're getting those sockets. We're converting that into.\nAn earn out type of situation where we get implants on top of the socket. And then we've also seen globally very strong performance in our hardware. So this capital component is critical to the business. It's also critical to the growth. And I think we're just seeing that with some of the other consolidations. But the Medtronic footprint here is extensive, strong, and very capable.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nAll right, thanks, Rich. Thank you, Rich. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Joanne Wuensch, Citi. Joanne, please go ahead.\n\nJoanne Wuensch\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nGood morning. A nice way to end the year and start the next. Briefly, my memory is that you had two patch pump products in development. Are those going to be shut down or are those also continuing along? I'll ask my second question. Hugo, could you sort of give us an update on where the launch is outside the United States, and should we be thinking about this as number of robots in the field or amount of revenue that it generates for the total Medtronic family? Thank you.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nOkay, thanks, Joanne. Two great questions. Que, do you want to take the patch question?\n\nQue Dallara\n\nEVP and President, Diabetes Operating Unit, Medtronic\n\nYes. We have a complementary organic program. If anything, we're stepping on the gas on that program that continues. It's complementary with next generation features that we're not prepared to go to at this point for competitive reasons. But that program will help expand our market access, including type 2. The type 2 market.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah, Just real quick, before I turn it over to Bob, talk about Hugo. I just think, just to reemphasize what Q just said, there is that we've never, although our business hasn't performed well over the years, the last couple years, we've never lost faith in our technology. And now with the better execution at Que and her new leadership team, we're bringing, we are putting our foot on the gas and doubling down on this business.\nThe patch segment's an important segment. So we feel good about having multiple shots on goal there.That's all I'll say on diabetes. Bob White, do you want to talk about Hugo?\n\nBob White\n\nEVP and President, Medical Surgical, Medtronic\n\nYeah. Thanks, Geoff. And thanks, Joanne, for the question. So we really like our momentum. Remembering Joanne, as you know, that less than 5% of procedures that could be done robotically assisted are actually done that way. So a tremendous market development opportunity. And importantly, you know, every quarter we sell and install more Hugo systems than we did the prior quarter. You know, the modularity and the Interoperability of the Hugo system with our leading surgical franchise is really being recognized by our customers. And, you know, it's really about the ecosystem. So in response to your question, I would look at both.\nRight. We look at the number of robots, but we don't disclose that. And as Geoff pointed to, we look at this as a meaningful growth driver for Medtronic overall. So we like our position, we like our feedback, and we're excited about our opportunity ahead of us.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nOkay, thanks, Bob. Thanks, Joanne, for the questions. Brad will go to the final question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from Anthony Petrone at Mizuho Securities. Anthony, please go ahead.\n\nAnthony Petrone\n\nManaging Director, Equity Research, Mizuho\n\nThank you. Can you hear me okay?\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nYeah. Anthony,\n\nAnthony Petrone\n\nManaging Director, Equity Research, Mizuho\n\nHello.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nHappy belated birthday, by the way.\n\nAnthony Petrone\n\nManaging Director, Equity Research, Mizuho\n\nThank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.\nA couple questions here. One just on the volume picture, underlying volumes. Is there anything you could share on April and May in particular, you have about a 5.5% organic growth. 4% to 4.5% is the bridge to guidance. So maybe just a little bit of color on underlying volumes. You know, certainly in Q1 it did seem like we had favorable comps, but an underlying improvement in many markets. So just your comments on underlying volumes. And then in the 4% to 4.5%, you know, is there anything of note just on 780G, you know, how much of that is baked into the guidance? Thanks again.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nWell, I might ask Sean to comment on the underlying volumes in a second, because we see it. Across cardiology, a lot. But I would just say, Anthony, that the underlying volume is definitely getting stronger and accelerated for us through our Q1 into April and May. As I mentioned earlier, we've been seeing strong growth out of Western Europe for quite some time. Japan came in and all throughout this last quarter, we saw strong growth in emerging markets.\nUS has lagged, but has picked up. I think some of it, we're seeing some of that pickup in particular in surgical procedures and our surgical business, but also across a couple of different cardiovascular procedure lines. I don't know, Sean, if you have any comments on that?\n\nSean Salmon\n\nEVP and President, Cardiovascular Portfolio, Medtronic\n\nYeah, Geoff, you said it. Well, we saw a really nice recovery in Europe in particular, as I mentioned before, across the board, and in our procedures in the US, we saw cardiac surgery was kind of a leading indicator that really grew well in the United States for procedure volume. And throughout the quarter, we saw improving improvement, including coronary stents, which has been curiously below the pre-COVID levels for a long time now. So we saw that come up to about 95% of pre-COVID levels toward the back half of the year or back half of the quarter. So look, I'm encouraged. May looks strong. We're, we're moving into a better procedure space for sure globally.\nIt was also impressive to see how fast China snapped back after both the shutdown and the COVID stuff that had happened and then it happened. I think all the trends are looking up globally, and I think the US is the place we're most encouraged by as we see the recovery of procedure volumes in cardiology. We saw that with large joints, of course, and I think we're starting to see it in cardiology, too, now, which is encouraging.\n\nKaren Parkhill\n\nCFO, Medtronic\n\nAnthony, on your question on the annual guidance and anything of note on 780G, you know, we expect diabetes to return to good growth in this fiscal year, and we noted that we expect it to begin the year below the corporate average, but obviously ramp throughout the year as we bring the 780G to more more patients in the United States.The consumable revenue off of that comes with it.\n\nAnthony Petrone\n\nManaging Director, Equity Research, Mizuho\n\nVery helpful. Thank you. Yeah.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks, Anthony. Geoff, please go ahead with your closing remarks.\n\nGeoff Martha\n\nChairman and CEO, Medtronic\n\nOkay, thanks, Ryan. All right. Well, okay, everyone, thanks for the questions as usual. We really appreciate your support and continued interest in Medtronic. And as I mentioned earlier, we'll be coming to you from ADA on June 25th with an update on our diabetes business.\nWe hope you'll join us for our Q1 earnings broadcast, which we anticipate holding on Tuesday, 22 August, where we'll update you on our progress across the company.\nWith that, thanks for spending time with us today and have a great rest of your day."

I'm Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President and Head of Medtronic Investor Relations. Welcome to Minnesota, where signs of spring are in the air. I appreciate that you're joining us today for Medtronic's fiscal 2023 Third Quarter Earnings Video Webcast.\nBefore we go inside to hear our prepared remarks, I'll share a few details about today's webcast. Joining me are Geoff Martha, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer. Geoff and Karen will provide comments on the results of our third quarter, which ended on January 27, 2023, as well as our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. After our prepared remarks, the executive VPs from each of our four segments will join us, and will take questions from the sell-side analysts that cover the company. Today's program should last about an hour.\nEarlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and divisional and geographic revenue summaries. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The presentation can be accessed in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com.\nDuring today's program, many of the statements we make may be considered forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could to cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement.\nUnless we say otherwise, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis and revenue comparisons are made on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency, and revenue from our Q1 acquisition of Intersect ENT, references to sequential revenue changes compared to the second quarter of fiscal '23 and are made on an as-reported basis, and all references to share gains or losses refer to revenue share in the fourth calendar quarter of 2022 compared to the calendar quarter of 2021, unless otherwise stated.\nReconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. And finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year.\nWith that, let's head into the studio and hear about the quarter.\n(presentation)\n\nGeoffrey Straub Martha\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Medtronic Plc\n\nHello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We reported our Q3 results this morning, and we executed to deliver a top and a bottom line that were ahead of our guidance and Street expectations. We are urgently forging the path to durable growth, and there are many proof points of our progress in these results.\nOur cardiovascular and our neuroscience portfolios had strong high single-digit organic growth as we launch new products and demonstrated continued strength in our established market-leading cardiac rhythm management and spine franchises. And at the same time, some of the recent revenue headwinds that have held back our growth are subsiding, including product availability in businesses like Surgical Innovations, Cardiac Diagnostics, Aortic and ENT.\nThe aggressive transformation at Medtronic is advancing. We're focused on reducing complexity, enhancing our culture, improving capital allocation and portfolio management and upgrading our global manufacturing operations and supply chain capabilities. At the same time, we're progressing on our plans for significant cost reductions. These are aimed at partially mitigating the continued impacts from macro conditions such as inflation and effects on our profitability and cash flow.\nThese cost reductions also create room in our P&L so that we can increase our growth investments, and I'm very encouraged by the rebound in our revenue growth despite procedure volumes remaining a little softer in a few markets and volume-based procurement in China. We are confident in delivering durable revenue growth over the coming quarters as recent revenue headwinds continue to dissipate and we execute across our businesses.\nSo let's take a closer look at our Q3 results. As I highlighted at an investor conference last month, we're thinking about our portfolio of businesses in three groups: highest growth, synergistic and established market leaders. So I'll start with our established market leaders, a group of our largest businesses that make up about half of our revenue. Both our cardiac rhythm and spine businesses had really good quarters, growing 8% and 5%, respectively.\nIn CRM, we continue to see strong market adoption of our micro-leadless pacemakers, which grew 14%, and our Defibrillation Solutions business grew 7% as replacement headwinds are moderating. And just last week, we received CE Mark for our Aurora Extravascular ICD.\nIn Cranial & Spinal Technologies, we delivered another strong quarter, with 6% growth in Core Spine, including 12% growth in the United States and 8% growth in Neurosurgery. This is driven by our market-leading ecosystem of Aible-enabling technology and the associated pull-through of our best-in-class spinal implants. From our AI-enabled surgical planning platform to our patient-specific and differentiated spine implants, to our imaging navigation and robotic technologies, we're differentiating ourselves with spine surgeons around the world.\nTurning to our Surgical Innovations business. SI grew sequentially as we made solid progress recapturing the share that we lost due to supply challenges over the last 3 quarters. Year-over-year, SI declined as a result of expected stapling BBP tenders in China. But excluding China sales, SI grew 5% in Q3.\nLook, surgeons around the world prefer our advanced surgical products, and we expect them and we're seeing in SI to continue. In particular, in our leading advanced energy franchise, we're seeing strong adoption of our recently launched cordless Sonicision 7, and we're preparing to launch our recently approved LigaSure XP. So we're on the right path with our established market leader businesses. And at the same time, we're advancing our position in high secular growth med tech markets. These businesses are contributing about 20% of our revenue today and collectively growing above our company average. We're investing disproportionately in these businesses and expect them to become an even bigger part of our growth over time.\nSo starting with Structural Heart. While the TAVR market continued to be impacted by health care staffing challenges and COVID in Japan, we drove 11% growth in Q3, including 12% growth in the United States. We're seeing great physician reception for our Evolut FX system, which just completed its full quarter of launch in the U.S. Evolut FX combines industry-leading durability with enhanced and predictable valve deployment.\nAnd in addition, data was presented during the quarter at PCR London Valves, showing Evolut FX's commissural alignment has improved significantly, which is important for coronary access and valve hemodynamics. Now looking ahead, we will continue to bring Evolut FX around the world and we are currently seeking approval in the Japanese and European markets.\nIn Cardiac Ablation Solutions, we grew 3% globally as provincial China VBP tenders weighed on our results. Outside of China, CAS grew in the high single digits, including low double-digit growth in the United States on the continued strong adoption of our leading Arctic Front cryoablation technology.\nWe're also advancing what we believe will become the leading pulse field ablation portfolio. And in 2 weeks, highly anticipated data for our PULSED AF pivotal trial will be released in the Late-Breakers session at ACC. The trial is evaluating our PulseSelect PFA catheter in both paroxysmal and persistent patients, and this will be the first results from an IDE trial in the PFA space, and we're on track to be one of the first companies with a PFA catheter in the U.S. market.\nWe also continue to make progress on bringing our Affera mapping and navigation platform and Sphere-9 catheter to the market as we completed enrollment in our pivotal trial in the quarter. Sphere-9 can perform high-density mapping and deliver either PFA or RF energy, all from the same catheter. And given Sphere-9 is a focal point PFA catheter, it is highly complementary to our PulseSelect anatomical PFA fitter. Finally, our CAS business just launched the AcQCross transseptal access system with a zero exchange workflow and the only system approved for both mechanical and RF crossings.\nSo when you think about our Arctic Front cryo solution, our DiamondTemp RF catheter, our PFA catheters, our left heart access solutions and our Affera map nav system, we're assembling a leading ecosystem of technologies to meaningfully increase our participation in the fast-growth 8 billion EP ablation space.\nIn Surgical Robotics, we're making good progress as the second major player in this exciting space. We continue to see positive sales momentum with the rollout of our differentiated Hugo robotic system in many international markets. And we started our U.S. IDE trial for our urology indication during the quarter. Given less than 5% of surgical procedures globally are done robotically we expect our surgical robotics business to become a meaningful growth driver for Medtronic.\nIn Neurovascular, we grew 9% and would have grown a couple of points more, if not for the China VBP. We continue to see very strong growth in several categories, including flow diversion, aspiration and stent retrievers. Given stroke is the #2 cause of death globally, and there is still very low therapy penetration, we see a long runway for high growth in this market that is approaching $4 billion.\nAnd in Diabetes, we continue to see strong international growth, offset by declines in the U.S. where we lack our latest products. We remain focused on resolving our FDA warning letter and are ready for reinspection. We also remain in active review with the FDA on our submission of the MiniMed 780G system with the Guardian 4 sensor.\nOutside the U.S., our Diabetes business grew 18% on continued strong sales momentum of 780G and Guardian 4. The 780G is now launched in over 90 countries, up from 60 last quarter. We're seeing strong CGM attachment rates, which drove CGM growth up 34% outside the U.S. We continue to invest heavily in assembling our ecosystem of durable pumps, smart pens, patch pumps, sensors, algorithms and customer service with multiple programs under development, all with the intent of restoring strong growth of our important Diabetes franchise over the coming years.\nAnd in our synergistic businesses, we also had strong performances across several businesses. We grew double digits in Cardiac Diagnostics as we ramped up production of LINQ II. In Neuromodulation, we grew 12% in pain stim and the market continues to recover. And our GI business grew high single digits on strong adoption of GI Genius, which uses artificial intelligence to help physicians detect polyps during colonoscopies.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Karen to discuss our third quarter financial performance and our guidance. Karen?\n\nKaren L. Parkhill\n\nEVP, CFO, IT & Enterprise Excellence, Medtronic Plc\n\nThank you, Geoff. Our third quarter organic revenue increased 4.1%, exceeding our guidance and representing a significant acceleration from our first half results as we begin to put the acute supply chain challenges behind us. Our non-GAAP EPS of $1.30 landed above our guidance by $0.03 on higher revenue growth and increased interest income, and $0.06 if we take into account a larger currency headwind than expected at the beginning of the quarter.\nLooking at our revenue from a geographic perspective, U.S. grew 2%, and our non-U.S. developed markets increased 6%, even with a 3% decline in Japan as COVID affected procedure volumes. Excluding Japan, non-U.S. developed markets increased 8%. Emerging markets grew 5%, impacted by an 8% decline in China from COVID and VBP provincial tenders in stapling, cardiac ablation and neurovascular. Outside of China, emerging markets actually grew 17%.\nI would also note that China represented a 110 basis point headwind on our total company growth, which highlights the strength of the recovery in our other markets. VBP has affected us, more than many of our competitors, given the size and breadth of our business in China. However, we do expect that we are now through the majority of the impact.\nOur adjusted gross margin declined in the quarter as we faced impacts from inflation and currency with currency driving about 1/3 of the change. These declines were expected and a result of inflationary pressures that occurred 2 to 3 quarters ago. Our incurred manufacturing variances have continued to be significant in the past few quarters. And as they roll off our balance sheet on to our P&L, we expect continued gross margin pressure in Q4 and next year. The gross margin impact translated into a decline in our adjusted operating margin as well. Although this was partially muted by expense control, and the benefit of our currency hedging program.\nOur balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to execute our enhanced capital allocation and portfolio management work, balancing future growth investments with returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders, primarily in the form of our dividend. We see strong opportunities for organic growth investments internally, leading us to target R&D growth at or above revenue growth. And we continue to focus on supplementing our organic investments with tuck-in acquisitions.\nWe've also announced this fiscal year three businesses we intend to separate that account for about 8% of our revenue. And we're making progress towards completing those transactions. We expect to close our Renal Care joint venture with DaVita here in the fourth quarter, and continue to progress with the separation of our patient monitoring and respiratory interventions businesses, which we expect to occur sometime in the second half of next fiscal year.\nWe have also closed on acquisitions that will contribute to our growth in the years ahead, including Affera, which expands our presence in cardiac ablation, and Intersect ENT, which adds unique sinus implants to our ENT portfolio. We have driven these moves to not only focus and streamline our portfolio, but also to improve our weighted average market growth rate over time.\nNow turning to our guidance. Given our top and bottom line beat in the third quarter, we are raising our full year revenue growth and EPS outlook. On the top line, we expect our fourth quarter organic revenue growth to be in the range of 4.5% to 5%, which is unchanged from what was implied by our second half guidance that I gave last quarter.\nI would note that our organic growth guidance excludes the impact of currency and revenue from our Intersect ENT acquisition. And it also now excludes revenue from our Renal Care Solutions business as we expect the separation to occur during the fourth quarter. If recent exchange rates hold, foreign currency would have a negative impact on our fourth quarter revenue of $165 million to $215 million. Taking into account currency, Intersect ENT revenue and the partial quarter of Renal Care Solutions revenue, our guidance would imply reported revenue in the range of $8.2 billion to $8.3 billion.\nWe are also maintaining the fourth quarter revenue growth segment expectations that were implied by the back half guidance I gave last quarter. We continue to expect Cardiovascular to be up 5.5% to 6%, Medical Surgical to grow 2.5% to 3%, Neuroscience to increase 6.5% to 7% and Diabetes to decline in the low single digits, all on an organic basis.\nOn the bottom line, we continue to drive significant expense reductions to partially offset the impact of inflation and foreign currency. Given our third quarter $0.03 beat, we raised the lower end of our fiscal '23 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance by $0.03 to the new range of $5.28 to $5.30, including an unfavorable currency impact of approximately $0.21 at recent rates.\nFor the fourth quarter, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.57. At recent rates, FX is about a $0.09 headwind to fourth quarter EPS. While we won't give guidance this fiscal year until our fourth quarter call in May, I did give some color on last quarter's call, and we'll remind you of it today.\nWe're encouraged by our recent progress on revenue growth. At the same time, current macro factors and our imperative to protect R&D investment are expected to create significant EPS headwinds next fiscal year. At recent rates, FX is a few hundred million dollar tailwind to fiscal '24 revenue and an approximate $0.27 headwind to EPS, which translates to a 5% headwind to EPS growth.\nWhile inflationary pressures are starting to moderate, we still see significant mid-single-digit inflationary impacts on our cost of goods sold as wage and raw material price increases continue to roll off our balance sheet and into our P&L. We are working to partially mitigate these headwinds through significant cost reductions. But both inflation and currency and to a lesser extent, interest and tax, are all looking to be headwinds that reduce our earnings power in fiscal '24.\nI would summarize by saying that as we navigate this period of increased macro headwinds, we will be driving disciplined cost reduction, and we are committed to investing in our future growth drivers and our turnaround as we firmly believe these important investments are necessary to drive durable revenue growth and long-term value creation.\nBefore I hand it back to Geoff, I want to take a moment to thank the thousands of employees across Medtronic who delivered this quarter. You are executing with excellence and accountability, leveraging our scale with differentiating capabilities and managing our resources to accelerate innovation. It is because of your efforts that we will create a durable growth company powered by our people as we continue our mission-driven work of alleviating pain, restoring health and extending life.\nBack to you, Geoff.\n\nGeoffrey Straub Martha\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Medtronic Plc\n\nThank you, Karen. Now before we open the lines for questions, I'll make a few closing remarks. Last quarter, I noted that our aggressive agenda to transform this company would take time, and that's still true. But I hope you'll take away that we are operating with a high sense of urgency, which you can see reflected in our results this quarter.\nWe're reducing our complexity, enhancing our capabilities and augmenting our management team with new leaders that bring an outside diverse perspective. We're also exercising decisive capital allocation and portfolio management, devoting more capital to high-growth opportunities and divesting noncore assets.\nThere is an intense focus from me, our Board, our management and our employees to create a company with sustainable growth that you can count on. We're in attractive markets with growing populations globally that can benefit from our therapies. And we fully expect to deliver durable revenue growth and turn our scale into a long-term competitive advantage and through this process, create tremendous value for our shareholders.\nNow let's move to Q&A. We're going to try to get as many analysts as possible, so we ask you limit yourself to just one question and only if needed, a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, you can reach out to Ryan and the Investor Relations team after the call.\nWith that, Brad, can you please give the instructions for asking a question?",

I'm Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President and Head of Medtronic Investor Relations, and welcome to snowing Minneapolis. I appreciate that you're joining us today for Medtronic's Fiscal Year 2023 Second Quarter Earnings Video Webcast.\nBefore we go inside to hear our prepared remarks, I'll share a few details about today's webcast. Joining me are Geoff Martha, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer. Geoff and Karen will provide comments on the results of our second quarter, which ended on October 28, 2022. And as well as our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. After our prepared remarks, the executive VPs for each of our 4 segments will join us, and we'll take questions from the sell-side analysts that cover the company. Today's program should last about an hour.\nEarlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and divisional and geographic revenue summaries. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The presentation can be accessed in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com.\nDuring today's program, many of the statements we make may be considered forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement.\nUnless we say otherwise, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis and revenue comparisons are made on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency and revenue from our Q1 acquisition of Intersect ENT.\nReference to sequential revenue changes compared to the first quarter of fiscal '23 and are made on an as-reported basis and all references to share gains or losses refer to revenue share in the third calendar quarter of 2022, compared to the third calendar quarter of 2021, unless otherwise stated.\nReconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com.\nAnd finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. With that, let's head into the studio and hear about the quarter.\n(presentation)\n\nGeoffrey Straub Martha\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Medtronic Plc\n\nHello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we discuss our Q2 results and outlook. Our Q2 organic constant currency revenue growth of 2.2% came in about 1 point below expectations due to a slower-than-expected recovery in both procedure volumes in certain markets and in our supply chain. In terms of reported revenue, the continued strength of the dollar over the course of the quarter drove over half the difference to expectations.\nNow despite the top line results, we were able to control expenses and deliver EPS at the high end of our guidance range. We also issued guidance for the back half of our fiscal year this morning. We expect continued acceleration in organic revenue growth in the second half, although less than previously anticipated, and this partially flows through to EPS. Now this is something that I don't take lightly, delivering on our expectations is important to building and maintaining trust and credibility with you.\nKaren will walk you through the details, but some of our markets and some of our supply constraints recovered more slowly than we expected in the quarter, and that, along with incremental China volume-based procurements, led us to reduce our expectations. While the current operating environment remains challenging, we had strong growth in several businesses in geographies, where our strategy, our operating model and execution are yielding solid results.\nWe have near-term product catalysts in our pipeline. We are decisively allocating capital internally and selectively making focused acquisitions. We're making improvements to the operational health of the company, and we're streamlining the company's structure and taking cost out. All of this gives us confidence that we're on the path to creating durable growth and shareholder value.\nNow diving deeper into our Q2 results. For reported revenue, as I said earlier, currency drove over half the miss to consensus. Organically, the miss was primarily split evenly between 2 challenges. One, procedure volumes in some markets have been slower to return to normal levels. And two, some of our supply challenges have persisted longer than we anticipated.\nWith regard to procedural volumes, in addition to an incremental China VBP, we are still seeing lower volumes in elective coronary PCI, GI procedures, TAVR, spinal cord stim and some less emergent surgical procedures. The slower-than-anticipated recovery in procedural volumes primarily occurred in developed markets as health care systems continue to work through staffing and other challenges.\nNow with regard to supply, we've made meaningful recovery and many of the most acute issues are now behind us, including the acute packaging issues, which we highlighted last quarter. But some of the improvements did come later than we expected in Q2, and as a result, we missed cases in businesses like surgical innovations and it has delayed our expected momentum.\nNow focusing beyond challenges impacting our markets and product availability, we have a number of businesses where our strategy and execution are yielding results. Recall that we moved to the new operating model 2 years ago, we created highly focused, accountable and empowered operating units that can move with greater speed and decisiveness. And today, we're clearly seeing the benefit of this model across many of our businesses.\nStarting with cranial and spinal technologies. CST grew 5%, and this is despite a large negative impact from China VBP. In fact, our U.S. Core Spine business grew 15%. Additionally, this quarter, we launched our spine technology ecosystem, which we call Aible at the NASS conference. From planning to our best-in-class implants, to navigation and robotic assistance, to interoperative imaging and surgical tools up to and including patient follow-up, Aible brings spinal surgery together in one seamless and connected platform.\nAnd another highlight was our Structural Heart business, where our TAVR business grew 15% globally, including 17% in the United States. The launch of our Evolut FX valve drove 18% sequential revenue growth in our U.S. TAVR business, despite being at full market launch for only the last month of the quarter. So we expect Evolut FX to drive momentum for us over the coming quarters.\nOur Cardiac Rhythm Management business continues to execute and win share with 4% growth in this quarter. Within CRM, our pacing business grew 6%, well above the market, with 18% growth of our micro family of leadless pacemakers. And we're looking forward to the commercial introduction of our AURORA EV-ICD in the back half of this fiscal year.\nSo while we have businesses where the changes we've made over the past couple of years are clearly having a positive impact, we're also focused on ensuring these efforts translate into improved performance in all of our businesses. It's worth highlighting a few businesses where we are making strong progress to drive future growth over the near to midterm and some of that already have immediate momentum.\nLet's take cardiac ablation solutions, a business that we expect to be a strong future growth driver. Pulsed field ablation represents a large market opportunity and we're looking forward to seeing our PULSED AF pivotal trial results in the first half of the next calendar year, putting us on the path to be one of the first companies with the PFA catheter in the U.S. market, which we think is underappreciated. This is a meaningful growth opportunity for Medtronic in the next 18 to 24 months.\nAnd as you know, we closed our acquisition of Affera in August and Affera's differentiated mapping and navigation system gives us the breadth and differentiation that we need to win share in cardiac ablation. And we expect to complete enrollment this quarter in the pivotal. This fully integrated system will be the first of its kind to offer a unique catheter that can perform high-density mapping and deliver both pulse field and radiofrequency ablation in a single device.\nNow in diabetes, we remain focused on resolving our warning letter. We've now completed 100% of our warning letter commitments and have informed the FDA that we're ready for reinspection. We also remain in active review with the FDA on our submission of the MiniMed 780G system with the Guardian 4 sensor. And outside the U.S., we continue to receive positive customer feedback on the performance of the 780G, which is now available in over 60 countries.\nIn Q2, 780G drove mid-teens growth for our Diabetes business in international markets. And across Diabetes, we're investing heavily in the development of multiple next-generation insulin delivery and sensor technologies, and we remain focused on restoring strong growth to this important franchise over the coming years.\nTurning to our Hugo surgical robot. Now I'm sure we're going to get into this in Q&A, but we saw a lot of positive momentum this quarter as we scale manufacturing production, expand regulatory approvals and ramp installations. In addition, we just received FDA IDE approval last week on our product enhancements. Now this allows us to start our U.S. urology clinical trial by the end of the calendar year and is a catalyst for continued progress with our international sales.\nNow before I talk about our capital allocation and portfolio management, let me share my thoughts on the Ardian opportunity. Despite the impact we believe COVID and medication changes had on the ambulatory endpoint in ON MED, the totality of the data is compelling. The large drop in office blood pressure in the Ardian arm was impressive, and it was consistent with what we've seen in our other trials. Importantly, the current standard of care for reducing blood pressure, it just isn't working, which was evident in the long-term SPRINT trial results published just last month in JAMA Cardiology.\nPatients don't seem to stay on multidrug therapy for long periods of time and eventually just stop taking their medications. And that's the advantage of Ardian, it's always on. We've demonstrated that our Ardian procedure, it's safe, it's effective, and it's durable. Physicians are excited and Ardian is preferred by patients. Now we've submitted our PMA to the FDA, and we're looking forward to working with governments and payers in the U.S. and around the world who are searching for improvements to control high blood pressure and avoid the costly and devastating consequences of this disease.\nIn addition to advancing our pipeline, we're focused on decisively allocating capital and streamlining the company to deliver durable growth. We're freeing up resources to invest more in R&D, feeding our fast-growing businesses in areas where we can see the strongest returns. Cardiac ablation solutions and Diabetes are two clear examples of this.\nWe're also making moves with our portfolio to focus our company and our capital on opportunities that are better aligned with our long-term growth acceleration strategies. Over the past two quarters, we've announced our intent to separate three businesses, that we believe will thrive outside the company. With our Renal Care Solutions business, we're progressing on the separation, forming a new kidney health technology company together with DaVita.\nWe continue to expect this transaction to close in calendar 2023. And last month, we announced our intention to separate our combined patient monitoring and respiratory interventions business. We remain focused on active portfolio management, evaluating both potential additions and subtractions to further accelerate our growth and create value for our shareholders.\nNow with that, I'll turn it over to Karen to discuss our second quarter financial performance and our guidance. Karen?\n\nKaren L. Parkhill\n\nEVP, CFO, IT & Enterprise Excellence, Medtronic Plc\n\nThank you, Geoff. Our second quarter organic revenue increased 2.2%, up significantly from Q1, but below our guidance range, given the challenges Geoff mentioned. Yet with a focus on expenses, our adjusted EPS of $1.30 landed at the upper end of our guidance range. Currency had a significantly unfavorable impact of 5.8% on our reported revenue growth.\nOur FX hedges mitigated that impact on the bottom line with EPS down only $0.01 or 80 basis points from currency. Looking at our results from a geographic perspective, our U.S. revenue grew 1%. Our non-U.S. developed increased 3%, and emerging markets grew 4%. Our emerging markets growth continued to be affected by China, which declined 9%, given the impact of a national tender in our spine business and several provincial tenders in certain other businesses.\nHowever, we continue to see strong double-digit growth in our other markets, including mid-20s growth in Eastern Europe and mid-teens growth in Latin America. In fact, excluding China, our emerging markets grew 15%.\nTurning to our margins. Our adjusted gross margin of 67.6% declined 120 basis points from inflationary pressures in materials, direct labor, freight and utilities.\nWe expect these inflationary pressures to continue and to impact the back half of this fiscal year, more than what we experienced in the first half. Our adjusted operating margin of 26.6% declined 40 basis points, including a 120 basis point benefit from our currency hedging program. Compared to the first quarter, our operating margin improved 270 basis points, given accelerated revenue growth.\nWe expect sequential improvement throughout the fiscal year. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet. I would note that the vast majority of our debt is fixed at low rates as we move into a higher rate environment.\nRegarding our capital allocation, we continue to balance investing for the future with returning capital to shareholders, and we remain committed to our dividend and to returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders.\nNow turning to our guidance. Today, we set our second half revenue guidance at 3.5% to 4% organic, which excludes currency movement and revenue from our Intersect ENT acquisition. If recent exchange rates hold, foreign currency would now have a negative impact on our back half revenue of $930 million to $1.03 billion.\nOur back half guidance translates into a reduction of our annual guidance, driven by a slower pace of market and supply recovery. On market, we are expecting incremental provincial tenders in China, particularly in stapling and cardiac ablation. And Geoff referenced earlier that some procedure volumes in the second quarter didn't recover as quickly as we were expecting. So at this point, we are assuming no incremental improvement in the back half.\nOn supply, while we have had a meaningful recovery, it came later than anticipated, particularly in SI and cardiac diagnostics. And that simply delays our pace of recovery ahead.\nBy segment in the back half, the majority of the reduction is in our medical surgical portfolio, which we now expect to be flat to up 0.5%. We expect cardiovascular to grow 5.25% to 5.75%, neuroscience to grow 6% to 6.5% and diabetes to decline in the low single digits, all on an organic basis.\nOur total company revenue guidance does assume continued revenue growth acceleration, which we saw in each month of the second quarter. We expect the third quarter growth rate to be better than the second and the fourth quarter better than the third. We will have easing comparisons in ventilators, improving supply in certain businesses like cardiac diagnostics and SI and the benefit from product launches, like Evolut FX and EV ICD.\nIn the third quarter, we expect organic revenue growth in the range of 2.5% to 3%, an acceleration from the second quarter. And assuming recent exchange rates hold, the third quarter would have a currency headwind between $460 million and $510 million.\nBy segment and on an organic basis, we expect Medical Surgical to be down 2% to 2.5%, an improvement from the second quarter, given lesser event headwinds and the impact of the flu season. Cardiovascular to grow 4.75% to 5.25% on the continued rollout of Evolut FX and LINQ II. Neuroscience to grow 5.75% to 6.25%, improving from the prior quarter with less VBP impact in spine and diabetes to decline in the low single digits.\nOn the bottom line, we are driving significant expense reduction throughout the company to help offset the lower revenue and continued inflation impact and now expect fiscal '23 non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $5.25 to $5.30. That range includes an unfavorable impact of currency of approximately $0.18 at recent rates.\nFor the third quarter, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.27, including an FX headwind of about $0.05 at recent rates. Amidst the macro environmental headwinds we face from inflation, China VBP, softer procedure volumes in certain markets and currency, we are laser-focused on driving operational and expense efficiencies. We are also committed to invest appropriately for the long term, allocating capital to our most promising growth drivers and executing tuck-in acquisitions, design to reach more patients and create value for our shareholders.\nAs we approach Thanksgiving, I want to share my gratitude to our employees who have been committed, particularly during these challenging times to deliver on our mission, to alleviate pain, restore health and extend life for millions of people around the world.\nBack to you, Geoff.\n\nGeoffrey Straub Martha\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Medtronic Plc\n\nThank you, Karen. Now before we open the lines for questions, I want you to know that our growth rate and our consistency are not where we want them to be. That's why I shared with you our aggressive agenda to transform this company 2 years ago when I became CEO. We embarked on a plan of implementing a new operating model, eliminating the bureaucracy of our groups and forming more nimble operating units, while at the same time, learning to leverage our scale.\nWe set in motion a new performance-driven culture, and we changed our incentive plans to reward new behaviors and performance. We brought in new leaders to inject new ways of thinking in the organization, and we implemented new capital allocation and portfolio management processes. Now these changes take time, and we face setbacks along the way that have slowed us down. Some are environmental like COVID recovery rates, raw material shortfalls and Chinese procurement policy, while other setbacks are of our own doing, like our quality and operational challenges and the pace of improvement we anticipated.\nLook, I know we have more work to do here, but we understand the root causes that led to the years of underperformance from this company. And our aggressive transformation agenda is designed to fix these issues. I know we will get this right, choosing the right markets, being more efficient and productive with our resources, empowering businesses and increasing accountability, improving our quality, our manufacturing and our supply chain and turning our size and scale into an advantage.\nAnd I know we are on the right path. The progress we've made so far gives me that confidence. We have experienced leaders, a compelling pipeline and positions of strength in some of the most attractive MedTech markets, which address significant unmet needs for patients.\nWe will execute on our plan to deliver durable growth that we began 2 years ago. And as we do, we will create tremendous value for all of our stakeholders.\nSo now let's move to Q&A. We're going to try to get to as many analysts as possible, so we ask you to limit yourself to just one question and only if needed, a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, you can reach out to Ryan and the Investor Relations team after the call.\nWith that, Brad, can you please give the instructions for asking a question?",

I'm Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President and Head of Medtronic Investor Relations.\nI'm inside one of our Medtronic mobile labs, which is making a stop here at our operational headquarters in Minneapolis. These high-tech mobile classrooms will give about 5,000 U.S. clinicians every year the opportunity to train on some of our most advanced state-of-the-art technology, including our O-arm and StealthStation.\nAs you can see, it's on 18 wheels. Our fleet of mobile lab trucks allows us to play big literally as they traverse the United States. In fact, with over 200 stops planned this fiscal year, they're likely coming to a hospital near you.\nNow before we go inside to hear our prepared remarks, I'll share a few details about today's earnings broadcast. Joining me are Geoff Martha, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer. Geoff and Karen will provide comments on the results of our first quarter, which ended on July 29, 2022, and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. After our prepared remarks, the Executive VPs for each of our 4 segments will join us, and we'll take questions from the sell-side analysts that cover the company. Today's program should last about an hour.\nEarlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and divisional and geographic revenue summaries. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The presentation can be accessed in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com.\nDuring today's program, many of the statements we make may be considered forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement.

And finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year.\nWith that, let's head into the studio and hear about the quarter.\n\nGeoffrey Straub Martha\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Medtronic Plc\n\nHello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We reported our Q1 results this morning, and the quarter played out largely as expected. Our organization executed to deliver revenue ahead of our guidance and EPS that was in line with our guidance.\nMacro factors that we discussed with you and forecasted over the past few quarters, like supply chain, inflation and foreign exchange, along with difficult comparisons to the prior year, caused our revenue and EPS to decline. At the same time, there were several bright spots in the quarter across our businesses, including strength in Pacing, Cardiac Surgery, U.S. Core Spine, Neurovascular, Diabetes in Europe and strong overall growth in many emerging markets.\nAnd as we look to the future, we have several near-term pipeline catalysts approaching that will accelerate growth. We're also making progress on our initiatives around quality and operating improvement. And in an uncertain economy, our business is well positioned with our robust balance sheet, strong and growing dividend and leadership positions in many secular growth health care technology markets.\nSo taking a closer look at our Q1 results, as expected, acute supply chain disruptions impacted our performance. Most notably, our Surgical Innovations business. We saw improvement in areas like packaging and resin supply as we progressed through the quarter. We also continue to manage semiconductor shortages across our businesses to minimize their impact on product availability as well as our financial results, and we're expecting these chip shortages to linger throughout our fiscal year.\nOverall, our operations teams have executed and worked closely with our suppliers to minimize impact, improving our order backlogs as we exited the quarter. We expect our overall supply chain issues to continue to improve as we move through the fiscal year.\nOn the demand side, we're still seeing impacts to procedure volumes due to health professional labor shortages. And COVID is still causing procedure cancellations and deferrals in some pockets around the world. We see our hospital and physician customers are doing all they can to manage these dynamics. So while procedure volumes in most of our markets remain at pre-COVID levels, we do have certain procedures or geographies where volumes are still lagging.\nTurning to market share. This is an important metric at Medtronic and is part of our annual incentive plan, along with revenue growth, profitability and free cash flow. And when we look at our quarterly market share performance, acute product availability challenges impacted our share capture opportunities in certain businesses, including Surgical Innovations and high-power CRM implants. We're also facing some competitive pressures in pelvic health and in diabetes, predominantly in the U.S. We're making good progress on the acute product availability issues and have pipeline plans in place to address competitive pressures over time.\nNow let me highlight some of our bright spots. In CRM, our pacing business continues to outperform the market as our Micra leadless pacemaker family is driving strong growth around the globe as we enter new geographies and expand penetration in existing markets. Micra grew 15% in the quarter, including high 70s growth in Japan, mid-teens growth in Western Europe and high 30s growth in emerging markets.\nIn CST, we had a good quarter in U.S. Core Spine, which grew 4%. We won market share on the strength of our overall portfolio, including our UNiD AI-enabled surgical planning platform and patient-specific implants, which had strong double-digit sequential growth in our U.S. user base.\nIn addition, our recently launched Catalyft PL spinal system designed to target the TLIF and PLIF markets drove meaningful results in Q1. And the breadth of our enabling, imaging, navigation and robotic technologies is a key differentiator.\nIn our Neuromodulation business, we are gaining initial implant share in both Pain Stim and DBS. In Pain Stim, the market continues to gravitate toward our Vanta recharge-free and Intellis with DTM rechargeable neurostimulators. And in DBS, customers value the differentiated sensing capabilities of our Percept PC system with our SenSight directional lead.\nIn Diabetes, we continue to see significant growth in markets outside the U.S. due to the increasing user base of our MiniMed 780G insulin pump, combined with our Guardian 4 sensor. The increase in this user base over the past couple of years is now driving significant recurring revenue growth for our CGM sensors and other supplies.\nIn markets outside the U.S. were launched, the 780G and our Guardian 4 sensor has a very positive user experience with no fingersticks and more time and range. Now this is due to its near real-time basal insulin and auto correction boluses every 5 minutes to address underestimated carb counts and occasional missed mealtime boluses.\nNow let's move to our product pipeline, where we're advancing several meaningful technologies that can create new markets, disrupt existing ones and accelerate our growth. We continue to execute on our pipeline, having received over 200 regulatory approvals in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China over the past 12 months. And looking ahead, we have several near-term pipeline catalysts approaching that we expect will enhance the weighted average market growth rate of Medtronic.\nNow starting with our Cardiovascular portfolio and transcatheter valves. The limited U.S. market release of our Evolut FX valve is receiving an overwhelmingly positive customer reception. And we're excited about the impact this next-gen valve can have as we move to full market release this fall.\nEvolut FX enhances ease of use and provides implanters with greater precision and control during the procedure, and it maintains all the industry-leading hemodynamic and durability benefits of the Evolut platform. When you combine the FX launch in U.S., PRO+ launch in Europe and Evolut PRO launch in China, we feel really good about the opportunities in our TAVR franchise around the globe.\nTAVR is one of the largest growth drivers for Medtronic, and we expect the market, which is roughly $5.5 billion today, to exceed $7 billion within the next 3 years and reach $10 billion in the next 5 years.\nIn cardiac rhythm management, we're really looking forward to disrupting the single-chamber ICD market with our AURORA extravascular ICD. Now as you may know, one of our competitors has had a subcutaneous ICD in the market for many years, but it's remained a niche device given its limitations compared to conventional ICDs.\nWith AURORA, we've created a true game changer where the electrophysiologist and the patient don't have to make trade-offs. It will deliver the benefits of a traditional ICD, including having the same size, battery longevity and ability to use proven antitachy pacing in lieu of delivering a painful shock to terminate life-threatening arrhythmias.\nAURORA does all of this without having to place leads inside the heart. Our EV-ICD global pivotal data will be presented this weekend in a late-breaking session at the ESC Congress in Barcelona. We're also awaiting CE Mark approval for AURORA, and we expect U.S. approval next calendar year.\nIn renal denervation, our breakthrough procedure to treat hypertension, we're nearing completion of the 6-month follow-up for the full cohort of patients in our SPYRAL HTN-ON MED study. We'll then analyze the data and plan to present the findings in the next few months. This data will complete the final piece of our clinical module submission to the U.S. FDA as every other module has been submitted, reviewed and closed.\nThe data on our simplicity blood pressure procedure is robust, including strong pivotal trial results and compelling real-world registry data from over 3,000 patients. And more recently, data has been presented that show already in-patient spend nearly double the time and target blood pressure range through 3 years than those who received a sham procedure.\nThis could have a profound effect on public health through the reduction of cardiovascular events, including stroke, heart failure and CV mortality. And we expect to be a leader in this market, which we project to exceed $500 million by calendar year 2026 and $2 billion to $3 billion by 2030.\nMoving to our Medical Surgical portfolio, which includes surgical robotics. We continue to execute on the limited market release of our Hugo robot. We're installing new systems and collecting clinical data in approved geographies, enhancing the system based on surgeon feedback, improving supply chain resiliency and scaling manufacturing production. Feedback and demand continue to be very strong. We've made progress over the last quarter, and we're nearing the start of the U.S. IDE clinical trial for our urology indication.\nWe also continue to increase our user base of Touch Surgery Enterprise, our AI-powered surgical video and analytics platform. With Touch Surgery Enterprise, surgeons can now easily review film from their surgeries to continuously improve and advance patient care. Overall, when it comes to surgical robotics, we're investing heavily to become a major player in the market for the long term, leveraging our decades of experience and leadership in minimally invasive surgery.\nNow turning to our Neuroscience portfolio. In neuromodulation, we've submitted our inceptive ECAPs closed-loop stimulator. We expect inceptive's closed-loop therapy, which optimizes pain relief for patients to revolutionize the SCS market. We're also continuing to ramp our commercial activities to go after the diabetic peripheral neuropathy opportunity with our first cohort of DPN market development reps now trained.\nWe believe DPN is one of the largest opportunities in med tech, and we expect the market to reach $300 million by FY '26 with an annual total addressable market of up to $2 billion.\nIn Diabetes, we're in active dialogue with the FDA on our regulatory submission for the MiniMed 780G with the Guardian 4 sensor and we remain focused on resolving our warning letter. We're making good progress on our warning letter commitments. We've completed more than 90% of the actions we committed to the FDA. This represents substantial progress toward resolving the warning letter and preparing for reinspection.\nIn our CGM pipeline, we submitted our next-generation sensor, Simplera for CE Mark. Simplera is disposable. It's easier to apply, and it's half the size of Guardian 4. The Simplera file is ready to submit to the U.S. FDA, and we're waiting to submit it as we're prioritizing the 780G Guardian 4 review.\nAnd with regards to our overall Diabetes pipeline, we're making considerable investments well above our corporate R&D average. We have a comprehensive pipeline of multiple next-gen sensor and pump programs, including patch pumps. This pipeline gives us confidence that we can restore strong growth to our Diabetes business over the coming years.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Karen to discuss our first quarter financial performance and our guidance. Karen?\n\nKaren L. Parkhill\n\nEVP, CFO, IT & Enterprise Excellence, Medtronic Plc\n\nThank you, Geoff. Our first quarter organic revenue exceeded guidance, decreasing 3.6%. Adjusted EPS of $1.13 decreased 17%, in line with our guidance range. As we outlined on our last earnings call, we faced acute supply chain challenges in the quarter, particularly in our Surgical Innovations business. We also faced tougher underlying growth comparisons, including both strong ventilator sales and good procedure recovery following the third wave of COVID last year.\nLooking at our results from a geographic perspective, our U.S. revenue declined 9% and our non-U.S. developed and emerging markets both grew 2%. Our emerging markets growth was impacted this quarter by China, which declined 9% given COVID lockdowns and volume-based procurement. However, our teams drove strong growth in many other markets, including high teens growth in South Asia and Latin America, mid-teens growth in the Middle East and Africa, and low double-digit growth in Southeast Asia. And when you exclude China, our emerging markets grew 13%.\nTurning to our margins. Our adjusted gross margin declined 230 basis points. The impact of the strengthening dollar drove 50 basis points of the decline, and the rest was primarily due to inflation on labor and materials as well as freight, given fuel surcharges and increased expedited shipments.\nAs we said at the beginning of the year, we expect the impact from inflation and currency to continue to negatively affect our gross margin in the quarters ahead. I want to remind you, when you look at our R&D line, we had a recast of last year's IP R&D that we told you about last quarter. Without that recast, adjusted R&D expense would have grown 4% as we continue to prioritize investment into development programs across our businesses.\nWhile our operating margin declined 320 basis points on lower revenue and gross margin pressures, we do expect to show sequential improvement as our revenue growth accelerates through the year. And our balance sheet remains strong, allowing us to invest in future growth and return capital to shareholders. We continue to target returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders, primarily through our strong and growing dividend. And we supplement these returns through opportunistic share repurchases.\nThis past quarter, we repurchased $336 million, which is on top of the $2.5 billion we repurchased last fiscal year. We also continue to put the cash on our balance sheet to work, investing in tuck-in acquisitions and minority investments that help fuel our near-term and future growth.\nWe closed Intersect ENT in the quarter, and we also began the structured acquisition of the Acutus left-heart access portfolio and expect to begin distribution by the first half of calendar '23. Their advanced Transseptal Access Systems will be an important part of our broad offering to electrophysiologists and interventional cardiologists.\nLast month, we announced a co-promotion agreement and path toward acquisition with CathWorks. We're excited to partner with CathWorks and promote their innovative FFRangio System, which we believe can disrupt the traditional FFR market. We believe that Medtronic can add a lot of value to the technologies that we acquire, and we expect tuck-ins to supplement our organic R&D investment and long-term growth acceleration.\nNow turning to our guidance. With one quarter behind us, we are maintaining our full year revenue guidance at 4% to 5% organic, which excludes currency movement and revenue from our Intersect ENT acquisition. If recent exchange rates hold, foreign currency would now have a negative impact on full year revenue of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, an increase of $400 million over the past quarter. We expect organic revenue growth to improve each quarter, with the second half of our fiscal year much stronger than the first, driven by our expectation that many of the acute supply chain challenges subside and new products drive our growth.\nIt's worth noting that we also face increasingly easier comparisons as we go through the fiscal year. By segment and on an organic basis, we continue to expect Cardiovascular to grow 5.5% to 6.5%, Medical Surgical to now grow 0.75% to 2.75%, given increased volume-based procurement in many of the Chinese provinces. Neuroscience to now grow 4.75% to 5.75%, given a slightly lower outlook for the neuromodulation market. And Diabetes to now decline 3% to 6%, given stronger growth in international markets.\nOn the bottom line, we continue to expect non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $5.53 to $5.65. Inflation and currency are still creating near-term impacts on our margins, and we've seen inflation on raw materials and freight become larger headwinds over the past quarter. We also continue to execute on initiatives to partially offset these macro impacts as well as prioritize our R&D investments to drive future growth.\nGiven these dynamics, and the fact that we are still early in our fiscal year, we would suggest you model closer to the lower end of our EPS guidance range. Our EPS guidance includes an unfavorable impact of foreign currency, which is approximately $0.17 to $0.22 at recent rates.\nIn the second quarter, we expect organic revenue growth in the range of 3% to 3.5%, implying a strong sequential acceleration driven by improved product availability and the cadence of our launches.\nAssuming recent exchange rates hold, the second quarter would have a currency headwind between $365 million and $415 million. By segment, we expect Cardiovascular to grow 5% to 5.5%, Medical Surgical to be down 0.25 point to up 0.25 point, Neuroscience to grow 5.5% to 6%, and Diabetes to be down 3% to 6%, all on an organic basis. And we expect EPS of $1.26 to $1.30, including an FX headwind of about $0.02 at current rates.\nWhile our markets are facing challenges, we're focused on identifying ways to offset their impact to our financials, and we are optimistic about our future as we prepare to create markets and realize new opportunities. In addition, I want to take a moment to recognize and thank our employees at Medtronic, who are unwavering in their commitment to deliver life-saving treatment to people around the world. Back to you, Geoff.\n\nGeoffrey Straub Martha\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Medtronic Plc\n\nThank you, Karen. Now this last quarter, we made a lot of progress on our aggressive agenda of underlying changes that are needed to ultimately accelerate our growth. With supply chain, it's getting better. And our back orders are coming down, not just because of the external environment, but because of the actions we are taking under Greg Smith's leadership, and I expect these improvements will continue.\nWe've co-located our employees with suppliers and are also working closely with sub-tier suppliers. We're managing through the acute issues and making progress on improvements that I'm confident can enhance the resiliency of our end-to-end supply chain.\nOn quality, we've been conducting a large transformation of our quality system over the past couple of years. We're advancing quality in innovative ways, working very closely with our regulators, and this is leading to important progress. We're also making progress on our pipeline and portfolio as these 2 strategies come together to create meaningful growth drivers.\nWe're tucking new products into dependable higher growth businesses like we did by adding Intersect ENT to our ENT business. We're also broadening the product portfolio of some of our businesses so they can become more meaningful growth drivers for the total company, like our strategy in cardiac ablation solutions.\nOverall, the path has not been easy, but I'm confident that these fundamental enhancements that we're making in the company, combined with our op model change, culture changes and incentive changes, are positioning us to deliver a higher level of growth that can be sustained.\nAnd as we overcome the near-term issues and start to put points on the board with the pipeline, I believe the underlying transformation of Medtronic, all the work that we've been doing over the past couple of years will become increasingly apparent setting up a durable value creation engine to fully capitalize on the mega trends in the health care and technology markets, which will benefit all stakeholders.\nSo to close, I want to join Karen in thanking our employees. It's never easy going through change, especially in a challenging macro environment, but our teams have stayed focused and are playing critical roles in helping to alleviate pain, restore health and extend life for millions of people around the globe.\nNow let's move to Q&A. We're going to try to get to as many analysts as possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to just 1 question and only if needed, a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, you can reach out to Ryan and the Investor Relations teams after the call. With that, Brad, can you please give the instructions for asking a question?",

I'm Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President and Head of Medtronic Investor Relations, and I appreciate that you're joining us today for Medtronic's Fiscal Year 2022 Fourth Quarter Earnings Video Webcast.\nBefore we go inside to hear our prepared remarks, I'll share a few details about today's webcast. Joining me are Geoff Martha, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer.\nGeoff and Karen will provide comments on the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022, which ended on April 29, 2022, and our outlook for fiscal year '23. After our prepared remarks, our portfolio executive VPs will join us and we'll take questions from the sell-side analysts that cover the company. Today's program should last about an hour.\nEarlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and divisional and geographic revenue summaries. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance. The presentation can be accessed in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com.\nDuring today's program, many of the statements we make may be considered forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement.\nUnless we say otherwise, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, and revenue comparisons are made on an organic basis, which this quarter includes only adjustments for foreign currency as there were no acquisitions or divestitures made in the last 4 quarters that had a significant impact on total company or individual segment quarterly revenue growth.\nReferences to sequential revenue changes compared to the third quarter of fiscal '22 and are made on an as-reported basis and all references to share gains or losses refer to revenue share in the first calendar quarter of 2022 compared to the first calendar quarter of 2021, unless otherwise stated.\nReconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. And finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year.\nWith that, let's head into the studio and get started.\n(presentation)\n\nGeoffrey Straub Martha\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Medtronic Plc\n\nHello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we reported our Q4 results. Now there were parts of the quarter that played out as anticipated, and there were also some unexpected challenges, more than I would have liked, which caused us to come up short of our expectations.\nAs we anticipated, procedure volumes in most of our markets reached pre-COVID levels by the end of the quarter. We also executed and delivered on recent product launches. However, we faced challenges related to supply chain in China that impacted some of our businesses and were the largest contributors to our shortfall.\nNow I'll get into more detail on these challenges shortly, but you should take away that we understand the root causes and we are well down the path to addressing them. And to be prudent, however, we've assumed that these challenges will persist for the next quarter or 2 in the guidance that Karen is going to walk you through shortly. So let's focus on what happened this quarter.\nThe shortfall to our revenue guidance was primarily due to 2 factors: China, where the extended COVID lockdowns affected our results in the quarter particularly in April, and global supply chain challenges.\nOver the past few quarters, global supply chain challenges have impacted many of our businesses. And as they arise, our teams have worked quickly to resolve them, and prior to this quarter, we have largely mitigated their financial impact.\nHowever, this quarter, one of our largest businesses, Surgical Innovations, was adversely affected by certain raw material shortages, and this resulted in large back orders and caused our SI revenue to come in well below our expectations. Several of our other businesses also face supply challenges in the quarter, but to a lesser extent.\nNow we're down the path of improving our supply chain capabilities, and we're leveraging the expertise that Greg Smith, our new Global Ops and Supply Chain leader brings from the retail, consumer products and automotive industries. Greg and his team are making progress addressing the areas where we can improve, including the management and resiliency of our critical suppliers and manufacturing network.\nThe recent stress of these global supply chain issues has further illuminated the need for the enhancements. We have a new global structure in place that consolidates operations and supply chain functions, which were previously fragmented throughout the organization. Now this is a big move for us.\nAnd there's still a lot of work to be done, but I am confident we will come out of this with a more resilient end-to-end global supply chain that we believe will be a competitive advantage in our industry.\nWhile some of our Q4 challenges will persist in the near term, we expect strong improvement in the back half of our fiscal year, and we remain focused on delivering our long-term strategies. We have made significant changes over the past 2 years to position the company for accelerated and sustained innovation-driven growth.\nOur pipeline is robust and continues to advance with a number of upcoming catalysts and fast-growing MedTech markets. We're committed to creating strong returns for our shareholders, and we're making progress with our enhanced portfolio management and our capital allocation processes. We're investing in future growth drivers, while at the same time returning capital primarily through our meaningful and growing dividend, which we just increased again today by 8%.\nRegarding portfolio management, we are continuing to advance the robust process we began talking about earlier this year. And within that, and as a smaller initial step, we're pleased to announce that we've reached an agreement where we will contribute our Renal Care Solutions business into a new company, which we will jointly own with DaVita.\nAnd in return, we'll receive up to $400 million in value from them and we expect this transaction will close in calendar 2023. The new company is going to develop a broad suite of novel kidney care solutions, including home-based products.\nI'm excited about this for a couple of reasons. First, this business is going to have the focus that it needs. Second, DaVita is a global leader in kidney care and will be a great partner to commercialize and scale this innovative technology. And finally, both Medtronic and DaVita will participate in the expected upside.\nNow turning to market share, product availability affected our performance in the quarter with our overall company share down about 0.5 point. On the bright side, even with our challenges, half of our businesses held or gained share. And as you know, market share is an important metric for us at Medtronic, as it is a driver of our annual variable compensation, along with revenue growth, profit and free cash flow. While I won't go through market share business by business in the interest of time, we'll be happy to take questions in Q&A.\nNow let's cover our product pipeline, where we're advancing several meaningful technologies that can create new markets, disrupt existing ones and accelerate the growth profile of Medtronic. We made great strides with our organic pipeline in fiscal '22, conducting over 300 clinical trials and receiving over 200 regulatory approvals in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China.\nOur recent product launches are starting to make an impact across our businesses. And as we look ahead, we have increasing visibility to upcoming catalysts in the back half of the calendar year that we expect will help accelerate our growth as we go through fiscal '23 and beyond.\nStarting with our cardiovascular portfolio and cardiac Rhythm Management, recently we launched leadless pacemakers, including our Micra AV in Japan and Micra VR in China led to above-market growth again this quarter. We just received approval for Micra AV in China earlier this month. And we expect geographic expansion to continue to drive strong Micra growth.\nIn ICDs, we're preparing to disrupt the single-chamber market with our Aurora extravascular ICD. We continue to drive towards CE Mark approval for Aurora later this calendar year and U.S. approval next year. With Micra and EV ICD, we expect continued strength in CRM.\nIn Cardiac Ablation Solutions, we've been assembling a number of technologies to increase our impact in the $8 billion EP ablation market, building on our leadership in cryoablation. We're continuing the rollout of our DiamondTemp RF system and exclusive cryoablation first-line indication for paroxysmal AF.\nWe're advancing our pulsed field [select] -- the anatomical pulsed field ablation system having fully enrolled our global pivotal trial. We're also expecting to fill competitive gaps in cardiac ablation with our recent announcements to add a differentiated mapping and navigation system and left heart access portfolio including a transseptal access system that can perform both mechanical and RF crossings.\nIn renal denervation, data from our SPYRAL HTN-ON MED pilot study were presented last month at ACC and simultaneously published in The Lancet. These data demonstrated durable and clinically significant blood pressure reductions through 3 years.\nAnd last week, additional data were presented at EuroPCR which showed those receiving RDN spend significantly more time in target blood pressure range, adding to our robust body of evidence.\nIn Q4, we also announced that we completed enrollment in the full cohort of patients in the ON MED study, which we expect to complete the 6-month follow-up in the second half of this calendar year. We'll then look to present the data and submit for FDA approval as ON MED is the final piece of our submission.\nIn Structural Heart, differentiated durability data for our TAVR valves were presented as a late breaker at ACC last month. The data showed that our TAVR platform is the only one to outperform surgical valves and durability at 5 years as measured by SVD or structural valve deterioration. And less SVD was associated with better clinical outcomes, including mortality and heart failure hospitalization.\nAdditionally, durability data were presented from a separate U.K. registry, the first to look at TAVR data past 10 years. And it showed CoreValve had 1/3 the rate of structural valve deterioration compared to SAPIEN and SAPIEN XT.\nAnd data at EuroPCR last week reinforced our excellent clinical outcomes with our cusp overlap implant technique, including 1-day hospital discharge, single-digit pacemaker rates and the absence of moderate or severe PVL.\nIn the quarter, we also continued to launch Evolut PRO+ in Europe and began the launch of Evolut PRO in China, our first entry into this large and underpenetrated market. In the U.S. we're planning to start the limited market release of our next-generation TAVR valve, Evolut FX here in our first fiscal quarter and move into full market release later in the fiscal year.\nWe're also looking to expand our TAVR indications. We had first enrollment earlier this month in our EXPAND TAVR II pivotal trial, evaluating our TAVR platform in patients with moderate symptomatic aortic stenosis. Overall, TAVR represents a large growth driver for Medtronic as we expect this roughly $5.5 billion market to exceed $7 billion within the next 3 years and reach $10 billion in the next 5 years.\nMoving to our Med Surg portfolio and Surgical Robotics, we remain focused on the limited market release of our Hugo robot while we scale production. We completed Hugo installations in Denmark, France and Italy. We also continue to increase our installed base of Touch Surgery Enterprise, our AI-powered surgical video and analytics platform.\nIn our Patient Monitoring business, we just received FDA clearance earlier this month for our next-generation Nellcor OxySoft pulse ox sensor. Now this sensor includes a special silicon adhesive designed to protect fragile skin while enhancing adherence. Its low profile and brighter LEDs improve accuracy and responsiveness for the most challenging neonatal and adult critical care patients.\nNow turning to our Neuroscience portfolio and our Cranial and Spinal Technologies business. We're seeing strong adoption of our unit AI-enabled surgical planning platform with a mid-30 sequential growth in our U.S. user base. The ongoing launch of our Catalyft Expandable Titanium Interbody System and the rollout of our enabling technologies continues to differentiate us in spine. Customer demand for our capital equipment remains strong. And we had record quarters for our Mazor robotics system and StealthStation Navigation System.\nIn Neuromodulation, we're building our commercial teams and have started the initial launch of our Intellis and Vanta spinal cord stimulators to treat diabetic peripheral neuropathy. We believe DPN is one of the largest opportunities in Med Tech, and we expect the market to reach $300 million by FY '26 with an annual total addressable market of up to $2 billion.\nAnd we're also excited about our Inceptiv ECAPs closed-loop spinal cord stimulator, which we submitted to the FDA late last calendar year. We expect Inceptiv's closed-loop therapy, which optimizes pain relief for patients to revolutionize the SCS market.\nIn brain modulation, our ongoing launch of the Percept PC neurostimulator and SenSight Directional Leads is driving new implant share in both Europe and the U.S. And this is the only system that can stimulate and sense brain signals.\nIn Pelvic Health, we received FDA approval of our next-gen InterStim recharge-free device, InterStim X, and that was happened in the fourth quarter. InterStim X features our proprietary fifth-generation battery chemistry that provides 10 to 15 years of battery life without the need to recharge.\nAnd in ENT, we announced earlier this month that we completed the acquisition of Intersect ENT. And we're excited to add their attractive high-growth complementary products into our existing business. We believe we can grow Intersect's products in the double digits over the next several years as we expand use of both the PROPEL and SINUVA sinus implants globally.\nIn Diabetes, our MiniMed 780G insulin pump, combined with our Guardian 4 Sensor continues to be extremely well received in markets where it's available. Now this system has a very positive user experience with no fingersticks and more time and range. This is due to its near real-time basal insulin and auto correction boluses every 5 minutes to address underestimated carbohydrate counts and occasional missed meal doses. Very strong data on 780G and Guardian 4 were presented at ATTD last month, showing improved time and range with less user interaction. Additional data sets on this differentiated system will be shared at ADA next month.\nAnd we also announced that Germany and France began reimbursement of our system in the quarter, which helped drive high-teens sequential international growth in diabetes. And in the U.S., we made substantial progress in meeting our observation and warning letter commitments, and continue to have regular communication with the FDA.\nIn our CGM pipeline, we expect to submit our next-generation sensor, Simplera, for CE Mark and FDA approval this summer. In addition, we're advancing multiple next-gen sensor and pump programs, including patch pumps. We're making considerable investments in our diabetes pipeline with line of sight to restoring strong growth in this business over the coming years.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Karen to discuss our fourth quarter financial performance, and our new guidance for the next fiscal year, Karen?\n\nKaren L. Parkhill\n\nEVP, CFO, IT & Enterprise Excellence, Medtronic Plc\n\nThank you, Geoff. Our fourth quarter organic revenue increased 1.4% below our guidance and consensus. Compared to consensus, about 15% of the difference can be attributed to China, given recent COVID shutdowns and slowing distributor purchases in spine ahead of a potential national volume-based tender.\nAbout 10% of the difference is a result of changes in foreign exchange rates over the course of the quarter. And the remaining difference and the largest driver is due to supply chain issues that Geoff discussed.\nDespite revenue coming in roughly $350 million less than we expected, we reduced the impact that this would have had on our bottom line, resulting in EPS of $1.52, $0.04 below our guidance range.\nFrom a geographic perspective, our U.S. revenue declined 2%. Non-U.S. developed markets grew 4% and our emerging markets grew 7%. Within emerging markets, China declined 10%, given the impact of the COVID lockdowns. But we had very strong growth in many other emerging markets, including high teens growth in Eastern Europe, low 20s growth in Latin America, low 30s growth in the Middle East and Africa, and mid-30s growth in South Asia. In fact, excluding China, emerging markets grew in the low 20s.\nTurning to our margins, our fourth quarter adjusted gross margin improved by 30 basis points year-over-year, driven by product mix with lower sales of ventilators and higher sales of products like Micra. While we were impacted by inflation with increased freight expense, it's worth noting that the full impact from inflation on raw material and direct labor costs will be realized over the next couple of quarters as our inventory rolls off our balance sheet, negatively affecting our gross margin.\nMoving down to P&L, we also drove additional and continued improvement in our adjusted operating margin, which increased by 40 basis points, excluding the benefit from currency. We also ended the year with free cash flow at $6 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 22% and meeting our goal of 80% conversion from adjusted net income.\nOur balance sheet remained strong, and we continue to allocate our capital to investments that we expect will generate solid future growth and shareholder returns. We're investing heavily in R&D, with programs especially targeted for faster-growing Med Tech markets or where we have an opportunity to create new markets. We're also using our balance sheet to complement our innovation-driven growth strategy with tuck-in M&A, utilizing our very active capital committee process that was developed as part of our new operating model.\nIn fiscal '22, we announced 4 acquisitions totaling over $2.1 billion in total consideration. As Geoff mentioned, we closed our acquisition of Intersect ENT earlier this month, and also announced our intent to acquire a left heart access portfolio last month. At the same time, we're investing in promising early-stage ventures to keep our fingers on the pulse of new products and technologies, incubated by companies that one day could become future acquisitions.\nWe're also actively providing strong return to our shareholders, returning $5.5 billion in fiscal '22 through our dividend and net share repurchase. And this morning, we announced that we're increasing our dividend by 8%, reflecting the confidence we and our Board have in our financial strength and future earnings power.\nWe are an S&P Dividend Aristocrat, having increased our dividend for 45 years now, and our dividend is an important component of the total return we generate for our shareholders. This past year, we paid $3.4 billion in dividends and we're supplementing that through opportunistic share repurchase, particularly in periods where we see share price dislocation. In fact, we repurchased over 2.5 billion of our stock in fiscal '22, including 1.4 billion in the fourth quarter.\nNow turning to our guidance and starting with revenue, we continue to expect our recent launches and product pipeline to make a difference in many of our businesses, and Geoff covered many of them earlier. We expect organic revenue growth in fiscal '23 of 4% to 5%. While the impact of currency is fluid, if recent exchange rates hold, foreign currency would have a negative impact on full year revenue of $1 billion to $1.1 billion.\nBy segment, we expect Cardiovascular to grow 5.5% to 6.5%; Medical Surgical to grow 3.5% to 4.5%; Neuroscience to grow 5% to 6%; and Diabetes to decline 6% to 7%, all on an organic basis. While we are hopeful that we can receive approval for 780G and Guardian 4 Sensor in the United States, we've elected not to include it in our guidance.\nIn the first quarter, we would have you model organic revenue to decline in the range of 4.5% to 5.5%, which conservatively assumes no near-term improvement in our supply chain and no major change to underlying fundamentals.\nAssuming recent exchange rates hold, the first quarter would have a currency headwind between $350 million and $400 million. By segment, we expect Cardiovascular to decline 1% to 2%; Medical Surgical to decline 7.5% to 8.5%; Neuroscience to be down 5% to 6%; and Diabetes down 8% to 10%, all on an organic basis.\nMoving down the P&L, I provided early color for fiscal '23 on the last quarterly earnings call, where I talked about the expected impact of inflation, wages, acquisition dilution and foreign exchange headwinds. These still hold, but we've also seen environmental changes since late February.\nInflation and foreign exchange rates have become larger headwinds, and we're now factoring in continued supply chain challenges early in the year. Inflation and FX pressures also create near-term challenges on our margins, although we continue to look for opportunities to offset them.\nAt the same time, we continue to prioritize our long-term investments in organic R&D, with a focus on large opportunities in future growth markets, like renal denervation, robotics, diabetic peripheral neuropathy and transcatheter mitral valves.\nTaking this all into account on the bottom line, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $5.53 to $5.65 in fiscal '23, which includes an unfavorable impact of $0.20 to $0.25 from currency at recent rates, for the first quarter, we expect EPS of $1.10 to $1.14, including an FX headwind of about $0.05 at current rates.\nBefore I send it back to Geoff, I want to thank our employees around the globe who are working hard to overcome the macro challenges we face. Thanks for all you do to fulfill our mission every day. Back to you, Geoff.\n\nGeoffrey Straub Martha\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Medtronic Plc\n\nThank you, Karen. While we spent a lot of time covering the fourth quarter, it's worth briefly reflecting on what we've accomplished in fiscal '22. It's certainly been a difficult environment, and our organization has enacted big changes in such a short period of time and under unique circumstances to better position the company.\nIt was our first full year in the new operating model, and with our enhanced Medtronic mindset of acting boldly, competing to win, moving with speed and decisiveness, fostering, belonging and delivering results the right way. We've also made strides to becoming a more diverse and inclusive organization.\nAnd I was very proud that Medtronic was recognized earlier this month as #10 on Diversity Inc.'s Top 50 U.S. Companies for Diversity. Even with that, we're committed to improving through innovative programs to attract, develop and retain top talent from all gender and ethnic backgrounds. Along those lines, we've made notable hires in fiscal '22, recruiting great talent from health care technology industry and beyond.\nWhile we've implemented a number of changes, this past year has been choppier than I would have liked with some of our growth drivers being pushed out and the impact from the pandemic, quality challenges and supply chain affecting our results. But we have a clear direction -- a clear direction where we're headed as we transform the company.\nLet's start with the top line. We remain laser-focused on accelerating the growth through robust capital allocation and portfolio management. You're seeing our efforts to enhance our future growth through greater investment in organic R&D, as well as portfolio moves.\nWe've already spoken of the organic growth catalysts in front of us, many coming later this fiscal year. We're also executing a healthy cadence of tuck-in acquisitions in faster-growing markets, and we're focused on reducing our footprint in lower growth and lower-margin businesses.\nWe continue to work on additional portfolio moves with the goal of creating a portfolio where we have distinct expertise, synergies across the company and ultimately, higher growth and higher margins. And to aid this effort, we've assembled a dedicated team that is 100% focused on our integrations and divestitures.\nAt the same time, we have the opportunity to improve our global supply chain and operations by centralizing these activities, allowing us to leverage our scale, invest in new technology and ensure we have world-class supply chain experts responsible for our global operations.\nAnd this isn't something new that we're just starting now. Although recent challenges have given us a greater sense of urgency, we've been on this journey for over a year. And while it will take time, I fully expect our efforts to drive lower cost and lead to consistent and reliable quality along with greater product availability, all on a sustainable basis.\nNow well beyond health care, our world is facing a lot of economic uncertainty with questions around inflation, global supply chain challenges and continued impacts from the pandemic and a potential recession. But our business, the business of health care and the delivery of essential life-saving technology is something that continues in good times and uncertain times like these. And demand for our products continues to increase with the aging and growing of our global population.\nWhen you look at health care technology, Medtronic is uniquely situated, particularly in these uncertain times, given our diversified businesses with leading market positions in growth markets, a robust product pipeline, solid free cash flow, strong balance sheet, and a very attractive and growing dividend to add to our return to shareholders.\nWe have near-term challenges that we are overcoming, and the opportunities in health care technology and at Medtronic are immense. We are fully focused on continuing on our transformation journey and making our opportunities a reality as we alleviate pain, restore health and extend life for millions of people around the world.\nFinally, I want to thank our exceptional Medtronic employees. I get to see the outcome of their efforts to fulfill our mission every day. It's inspiring. In addition, their willingness to lean into our new operating model and embrace our new culture have been key to the ongoing transformation of the company.\nI also want to thank our partners in health care, the frontline workers who are at that final step in ensuring patients get our therapies and are dedicating their lives day in and day out. Their incredible efforts to continue care delivery and get us all through the pandemic will be noted as one of the great accomplishments in history.\nNow let's move to Q&A. We're going to try to get as many analysts as possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to just one question and only if needed, a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, you can reach out to Ryan and the Investor Relations team after the call.\nWith that, Brad, can you please give the instructions for asking a question?",

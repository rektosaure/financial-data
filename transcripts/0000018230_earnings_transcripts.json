    "content": "Half Year 2026 Catapult Group International Ltd Earnings Call\n\nHalf Year 2026 Catapult Group International Ltd Earnings Call\n\nCATASXNOV 17, 5:30 PM\n\nWill Lopes\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Catapult's investor conference call for our first half FY '26 results.\nI have with me Bob Cruickshank, Catapult's Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Bob and I will present our results, our strategy and outlook and then take questions from participants on the call.\nIt has been a momentous 6 months for Catapult. Just half a year ago, we reported outstanding FY '25 results, meeting the high bar we had set for ourselves and building on the clear inflection point we had achieved in FY '24. Since then, we've continued to accelerate this trajectory. 5 months ago, we announced the acquisition of Perch, the global leader in velocity-based training, shaping the future of athlete monitoring in the wave room. And just last month, we welcomed Impect, the world's foremost innovator in soccer scouting and tactical analytics, whose end-to-end intelligence platform delivers insights unmatched in the game. It's been an extraordinary stretch, one defined by progress, purpose and performance. And today, with another strong set of financial results, we reaffirm that same commitment to innovation and to the promise of what's still ahead.\nAs you can see on Slide 3, the first half brought another milestone. Our customer base has now grown to more than 5,000 teams worldwide, an increase of 400 teams in just 6 months. While our focus, as many of you know, remains squarely on our professional teams. It's encouraging to see this broader growth. It's a reflection of how Catapult continues to define the global standard for performance technology trusted by athletes and organizations across every level of support.\nNow turning to our results. And before I begin, I'd like to outline that all figures I reference today are reported in U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated. And to provide a clearer picture of our underlying performance, year-over-year growth rates are presented in constant currency, to remove the noise of foreign exchange and reflect the true trajectory of the business.\nThe first half of FY '25 was another period of strong performance for Catapult, building on the momentum we have created and progress we made in FY '25. As you can see on Slide 6, we continue to advance against our North Star, the rule of for reaching a new high of 33% at the end of the half, up from 31% a year ago and a full 12 percentage point improvement compared to where we stood just 2 years ago.\nThis metric is powered by 2 core drivers: the pace at which our subscription base is expanding, reflected in the growth of our annual contract values; and the amount of operating profit we retained measured through management EBITDA. Our top line continues to perform exceptionally well, with ACV now up 19% year-on-year at the end of the half. But what's even more encouraging is the leverage we are generating as we scale.\nOur ability to keep more of every dollar of revenue is growing faster than revenue itself. Management EBITDA reached $10 million for the half. That is a 50% year-over-year increase, delivering an operating profit margin of 14%. That result would have been even stronger were not for an unexpected payroll tax expense of roughly $2 million, which is tied to the strong performance of our share price, something Bob will speak to shortly.\nTurning to the next slide. Our 19% ACV growth has lifted contracted subscriptions to a new record of USD 116 million. Our total revenue, which includes some nonrecurring items, grew 16% year-over-year to USD 68 million. For those of you who think more naturally in Australian dollars, this marks an important milestone for us. It is a first half in which Catapult has generated more than AUD 100 million in revenue. To put this into perspective, when Catapult first listed on the ASX, our full year revenue was AUD 5 million. The business between these 2 numbers as a great deal about just how far we've come.\nCatapult SaaS engine remains in excellent health, as shown on Slide 8. Our ACV retention rate once again exceeded 95% and placing Catapult firmly among the most successful enterprise software companies in the world against this measure. It's a testament to the quality of our product, the stickiness of our platform and the value we are delivering to our customers season after season.\nACV per Pro team, our core ARPU metric grew 8% year-over-year. And as in prior periods, the primary driver of this increase is the continued expansion of customers adopting more than one solution, most often adding a video product from our P&C vertical to wearables product in our performance and health verticals. The number of these multi-vertical customers rose 26% year-over-year, underscoring both the differentiated breadth of our product ecosystem, and the value customers unlock when they integrate wearables with videos, a combination that remains unique to catapult in the market.\nTurning to Slide 9. I you can see the depth of operating leverage in our subscription model and the strength of our unit economics. When excluding the unexpected payroll tax expense in the first half, our incremental profit margin is 56%, meaning we kept $0.56 of every additional dollar of revenue is profit from an operating sense. Bob will discuss further how the payroll tax is primarily a first half expense and our treatment of it going forward.\nBut before I hand it over to Bob, I also want to touch on some of the innovations we have delivered to our customers in the first half as we outlined on Slide 10. The rollout of Vector 8 has been a primary focus in the first half of FY '26. While we are still in the early stages of the process, we are already improving the technology and introducing new features as we go, a pace made possible by the new hardware platform that we introduced. Enhancements that once took months on our previous system are now being delivered in just a matter of weeks.\nIn addition to getting devices and docs into the hands of our North American football customers, we are now extending the rollout into more sports and geographies. And we're also delivering major upgrades to our web experience, including faster editing, more streamlined report creation and time-saving performance analysis. The feedback has been excellent, and the rollout will continue through the second half of FY '26 and well into FY '27.\nSimilar to Vector 8, not only did we launch Hub Pro in the first half, but we have also started to expand its features with a new remote workflow that syncs in real time seamlessly with in-office teams, unifying communication, analysis and a feedback group across the entire coaching staff, no matter where they are in the world. In the first half, as I mentioned, we acquired Perch, and while we've been very focused on the early stages of integration in integrating their velocity-based training technology into our ecosystem. I am pleased to also say that in a very short period of time, the team has introduced Perch Assist, new performance scores and a new enhanced Jim analytics, deepening the sophistication of the technology and strengthening our leadership position in gym technology.\nWe also continue to invest in our game day and sideline solutions to better support teams and leagues in real time. During the half, we expanded focus live beyond game day and into practice, giving teams the same real-time analysis capabilities during training that they rely on during competition. And in recent weeks, we acquired key IP assets from [ Isolix ], a local positioning system provider whose patents were licensed for their use in NFL game date tracking. -- and whose technology has been white labeled by another wearable company as their own LPS solution.\nWhen combined with our existing solutions and IP, we believe that this acquisition not only strengthens the backbone of our live operations but also effectively gives Catapult control of the global patent portfolio required to operate an LPS system for tracking athletes and balls in live competition.\nAnd across our product suite, we're beginning to see the real benefits of artificial intelligence. AI-driven tagging, data cleaning and content generation are already saving coach's time and helping teams reach insights faster. And while we're only scratching the surface, our uniquely rich first-party data, spanning performance, tactics and now global recruitment gives us the raw material that makes AI truly effective. This foundation will allow us to usher in entirely new solutions and unlock new value for customers, something I will touch on a bit more later.\nIn summary, we've entered FY '26 in excellent shape. We are delivering strong top line growth, demonstrating meaningful operating leverage and giving our customers the best tools and solutions to help them perform at their very best. With that, I'm going to hand it over to Bob to walk you through the financials in more detail. Bob?\n\nRobert Cruickshank\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Will, and good morning, afternoon and evening to those of you joining today. I'm very pleased to present what are another great set of results today. I'll begin with an overview of our key SaaS metrics before taking you through our financial performance in more detail, and then I'll hand it back to Will to comment on our strategy and outlook. I'd like to reiterate that unless I state otherwise, the numbers I'm about to talk to are actual reported numbers in U.S. dollars and that our growth rates, which compare our performance year-on-year are in constant currency, removing the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nStarting with the drivers of some of those great numbers will presented earlier, I will begin by focusing on our primary metric on Slide 12 and our annualized contract value, or ACV. In the first half of FY '26, we delivered 19% constant currency growth, finishing the half at $115.8 million. we're normalizing for the onetime impact of closing our Russian business in the second half of FY '25 and the ACV that we acquired with Perch, this was an 18% growth rate.\nOur strong growth has again been driven by the performance of both core SaaS verticals, which can be seen on Slide 13. I'll start with our P&H vertical, which includes both our wearables and Perth solutions. This vertical continues to be a reliable and predictable growth engine that yet again delivered an excellent growth rate growing by 21%, driven particularly by success signing more soccer teams in every region and American football in the United States. Teenage was again where we felt the impact of exiting Russia as our business in that region was almost entirely in this vertical. Going forward, that impact will drop out of the FY '25 comparative period when we report our FY '26 results.\nWe remain very pleased with our P&H growth and the continued global expansion we are seeing from our P&H verticals. Our T&C vertical, which includes our video solutions, generated 16% ACV growth. This was underpinned by continued growth from new and existing customers in soccer in Europe and supported by Catapult's expanded product suite of video solutions launched in early FY '26 in American Football. Going forward, P&C will also include the ACV from Impect, which we're obviously very excited about, not only because of the stand-alone product, it has the potential for strong growth, but because it will also help us unlock more growth from our own Pro video suite.\nAs you can see on Slide 14, our ACV per protein continues to expand, primarily driven by our success in cross-selling. Average ACV per protein increased by 8% year-over-year meaning that our average ACV is now exceeding $28,000 per protein. This is very encouraging to see and entirely consistent with our strategy, whereby we have a midterm target of growing this number to $40,000 per Pro team, but you'll learn more about from Will at the moment.\nThe chart on the right of this slide expands on our cross-selling success. In the first half of FY '26, we experienced a 26% year-over-year increase in the number of proteins using products from 2 or more of our verticals, which up until now consisted almost entirely of wearables in video. One of the pillars of our strategy is to maintain ACV retention rates above 95%.\nAs you can see on Slide 15, we delivered an ACV retention rate of 95.1% in the first half, the inverse of which being a churn rate of 4.9%. It is important to note that this includes the onetime impact of our exit from Russia, which represented around a 1% point impact to this number. This continues to be on par with the best retention rates seen among the world's most successful enterprise software companies. We're incredibly proud of this performance and expect to continue delivering retention rates better than our 95% target.\nAnd Slide 16 now provides a good overview of the SaaS metrics we have spoken about today. These are the leading indicators of our future growth, and they present a very positive picture of the health of our business. There are 2 additional numbers to also call out on this slide. First is lifetime duration, which has increased from 7.6 years to 8.1 years. a 7% increase during a period in which we added approximately 600 new teams year-over-year. It's a great sign that even though we are signing new teams, we're building longer and longer tenure into our customer base.\nAnd second is our Pro team count, which increased 12% year-on-year, an acceleration from the 8% growth we experienced in the first half of FY '25. We now have more than 3,800 proteins as customers, a significant global footprint. And as a reminder, the Pro team count is different from the 5,000-plus total teams mentioned earlier by Will, which includes non-Pro customers.\nLet's now move on to our financial results. And you can see on Slide 17, the impact that our strong top line growth has had in our P&L. SaaS revenue derived from our ACV balance grew 16% year-over-year. Recurring revenue, which is comprised of both SaaS revenue and revenue from our media business grew by 19%. As it implies, our media business has had another very strong half of growth with 41% growth year-on-year. And finally, on that slide, recurring revenue as a percentage of revenue has been consistently above 90% for some time, finishing at 94% in the first half of FY '26.\nNow moving to our cost base. And as you may know, we split our cost buckets into variable costs and fixed costs. Let's start with variable costs on Slide 18. You can see the trend of our variable costs compared to the steady growth of our revenue over the last 2 years, and how these costs are declining as a percentage of revenue. Variable costs are the cost of growth, which are made up of COGS, delivery and sales and marketing expenses. These are the costs that will continue to grow in absolute dollar terms as our revenue grows, while also declining as a percentage of revenue as we gain efficiencies in our business scales.\nAs you can see, we continue to make progress on this metric. While our variable costs increased by $2.6 million year-over-year, they declined as a percentage of revenue from 52% to 49% and corresponding to an improvement in the contribution margin from 48% to 51%. The increase in variable costs was almost entirely COGS related, which increased by 16% and was closely correlated to the growth from our media business. Outside of COGS, our sales and marketing and delivery costs increased by just 4%. This is a tremendous achievement from our team. It means that we are now only 4 percentage points away from reaching our target of 45% of revenue.\nNow moving on to fixed costs on Slide 19. The fixed costs, which reflect our G&A and R&D teams, both expensed and capitalized, increased by 18% year-over-year and were flat as a percentage of revenue at 37%. Our fixed costs were impacted by the larger-than-anticipated payroll tax expense from the vesting of share-based payments, driven by the Catapult share price, which has risen significantly over the last 2 years.\nFixed cost growth was also impacted by the addition of R&D operational costs that came with the acquisition of Purch. Both of these items occurred in the first half of FY '26. Excluding the payroll tax and the purchase impact, Fixed costs otherwise rose by 7% year-over-year, which is in line with our expectations. And if we exclude the tax impact only a nonrecurring cost, our fixed costs would have been 35% of revenue, showing that our core trend of seeing fixed cost leverage with revenue growth is on track. We expect this trend to continue as fixed costs rise modestly in absolute dollar terms, while declining as a percentage of revenue as we continue to make progress towards our 25% target.\nAnd these concepts all come together on Slide 20. And which highlights how our operating leverage is accelerating the growth in our profit margins. You can see the gap that is now opening up between our revenue and our OpEx as a percentage of revenue and the impact that is having on our profit margin at the bottom of the chart. We have now delivered $28 million of positive operating profit margin, management EBITDA in the last few years and we are making great strides towards getting to our target 30% profit margin, delivering a 14% margin in the first half of this financial year. As revenue grows and our variable and fixed costs continue to approach their targets, our operating profit margin is expected to increase.\nAnd on Slide 21, you can see the ongoing improvement in our free cash flow position that has come about because of these increased efficiencies we're delivering in our cost base and are leading to our expanding operating profit margin. Free cash flow increased $3.4 million year-over-year to $8.2 million in the first half when excluding transaction costs. which consists primarily of the $3 million cash component of the purchase price related to the acquisition of Perch, along with related advisory fees. Including this, our cash flow was still a very healthy $4.3 million and meant that at the end of the first half, Catapult had a net cash position of more than $11 million in the balance sheet and with a fully repaid debt facility.\nFinally, moving to our profit and loss summary on Slide 22. We have already touched on many of these numbers, so I will make a few observations on those we have not. The increase in share-based payments is primarily due to the year-over-year increase in our share price which has an impact on the expense recognized due to changes in the accounting valuation methodology as outlined in the FY '24 results. This increase is not reflective of an increase in dilution.\nIncremental depreciation and amortization or D&A includes around $2 million of accelerated expense of S7 devices and Thunder as they approach end of life, along with $1 million of intangible asset amortization related to the Perch acquisition. And finally, the change in interest, taxes and other is primarily due to a tax benefit lower interest costs due to lower utilization of our line of credit and reduced foreign exchange losses year-over-year.\nI want to call out that going forward, we will be separating out the payroll tax related to share-based payments from our management EBITDA. This expense relates to our employee share plan and is unrelated to our operating profit. We fully expect to continue delivering for shareholders. And if our share price keeps rising, payroll tax will continue to create timing noise in management EBITDA that has nothing to do with the underlying performance of the business. For that reason, we'll be making this adjustment going forward.\nIn closing, we have started FY '26 in excellent shape. Our key metrics and targets are world-class and our financial performance continues to go from strength to strength. We are consistently delivering strong profitable growth, progressing even further on the Rule of 40.\nWith that, I will hand it back to Will to discuss our strategy and outlook further.\n\nWill Lopes\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nThanks, Bob. Before we wrap up, I'd like to take a moment to reaffirm the scale of the opportunity in front of us, the strategy guiding us and why we remain so energized about Catapult's role and sport for many years to come.\nSlide 24 highlights the global market opportunity. The professional sports technology market is expected to exceed USD 71 billion by 2030, effectively doubling over the next 5 years. Live sports remains one of the last true pillars of real-time entertainment. And that enduring demand is driving unprecedented levels of investment across leagues, teams and performance infrastructure.\nSlide 25 illustrates how our platform strategy is delivering true differentiated value. Our unified SaaS platform is designed to help teams make faster and smarter decisions. It saves time at connect the data they rely on and fits naturally into the rhythms and workflows of high-performance environments, turning information into an advantage and an advantage into a competitive edge.\nOn Slide 26, you'll see the breadth of the solutions we now offer, including Perch and impact. With each addition, we are becoming an even more integrated partner across the full spectrum of performance and coaching workflows. And across this platform, the deeper impact of artificial intelligence is just beginning to come into focus. Our greatest strategic advantage lies in the quality and the scale of the data we create.\nCatapult generates and manages a uniquely comprehensive body of athlete information, over 5 petabytes from gym and unfilled performance metrics to the custom tactical tagging done by our customers and now the most extensive global data set and soccer recruitment. Because this data originates in our hardware, flows through our software and is enriched inside our analysis tool, we hold something rare in professional sport, a vertically integrated foundation of first-party data that AI can uniquely refine and learn from. This foundation is already creating meaningful value.\nAs I've mentioned, AI-driven tagging, data cleaning and content generation are saving coaches time and accelerating insights across our products. In Formula 1, our computer vision technology delivers real-time track limit detection. In the wait room, Perch is redefining velocity-based training with a computer vision system unmatched in the market. And across our broader ecosystem, machine learning has long-powered player and sport-specific algorithms built on top of data, no one else can access. These capabilities help lead teams uncover patterns and insights that previously required hours of manual analysis. And they increasingly make high-quality performance intelligence, now accessible to new types of customers who lack the resources to uncover those insights today.\nAI is also reshaping how we build. A meaningful share of our production level code today is now generated through AI, expanding our engineering capacity and allowing teams to focus on the inventive high-impact work that pushes our platform forward. In short, our unified vertically integrated system, one that creates and owns the data enriches it through AI and transforms it into actionable insights, continue to strengthen as AI's role and support only grows from here. The value of AI ultimately depends on the richness of the data beneath it, and that foundation is uniquely catapults. This integrated system and our ability to generate differentiated data are also what fuels our excitement around our recent acquisition.\nPerch strengthens our leadership in athlete monitoring by bringing weight room intelligence into our performance and health portfolio. Shred training is the foundation to athletic development. and Bridge is a long-standing divide, enabling us to build a unified view of athlete performance. While we are early in the integration, we are already seeing the impact. Perch has already moved beyond its American football routes, helping us win competitive renewals in Europe, break into new verticals like Elite Volleyball in Asia, along with also helping us sign new customers here in Australia. It's a clear evidence of its broad appeal and immediate commercial traction.\nImpect, even just weeks post transaction is also expanding our platform advantage. It has a scalable data-rich scouting solution powered by a proprietary [ tacky metrics ] that meaningfully elevate decision-making for teams. Impact strengthens our cross-sell engine at soccer deep as our share of wallet and unlocks new growth opportunities for our video products. And like Perch, the acquisition is immediately accretive to our progress in the rotor.\nNow turning to Slide 27. You can see how the pieces of the strategy come together. Catapult has built a competitive moat that is wide, deep and genuinely defensible. Our one-stop platform our proprietary data stack, our global scale and our multisport intelligence are unmatched in the industry. And as the first half demonstrates through the strength of our platform, the sophistication of our technology and the growth of our customer base, the moat is only winding. We are expanding our advantage at the very moment the market itself is accelerating, which is exactly where we want to be.\nSlide 28 outlines our focused go-to-market approach. We land our performance in health, we expand with video and now scouting analysis through tactics and coaching -- we retained more than 95% of our customers annually, and we drive cost efficiencies as we move towards a target of 30% profit margin.\nSlide 29 details the economics that supports this turn. We've built an enviable global SaaS business designed for profitable growth at scale. The ability to drive our contribution margin through cross-sell and product innovation allows us to improve unit economics while leveraging a stable fixed cost base, yielding higher profitability as we scale. 30 brings us back to where I started today, and that's with the Rule of 40. It is how we measure our success both internally and for you, our shareholders.\nAt the heart of this framework are 5 key drivers, each critical input powering our ACV growth and management EBITDA. Together, they shape not just our financial outcomes, but the discipline behind our scale. First, Pro team count. With more than 3,800 proteins today, we continue to see greenfield opportunities across leagues, regions and sports. Second, ACV per protein. We are increasing ARPU through upsell, cross-sell pricing and product expansion, especially as we convert single vertical teams into multi-vertical customers. And this is where new solutions like Perch and Impect will play an increasingly important role as we unlock their potential through our global scaled sales organization.\nThird is ACV retention. We're maintaining retention above 95% by consistently delivering value, service and innovation. And as we add new solutions, we deepen the role we play in helping customers make better decisions. strengthening the stickiness of our platform and to trust a place in us. Fourth is the variable cost efficiencies. We are scaling smart supporting growth while driving productivity and lowering marginal delivery costs. Fifth and lastly, it's fixed cost discipline. With our foundation now in place, we are positioned to grow without layering in equivalent fixed overhead.\nTurning to our outlook on Slide 31. Our objective remains to deliver on our strategic priorities with a continued focus on profitable growth. As we communicated last month in FY '26, we continue to expect ACV growth to remain strong with low churn, continued improvement in cost margins towards our targets and higher free cash flow, excluding transaction costs as our business continues to scale.\nIn closing, we've had a great start to FY '26. We continue to deliver strong profitable growth with a SaaS engine that is driving us forward with a team that is hitting a high expectations that we set for ourselves. With our all-in-one SaaS platform built exclusively for sport, now strengthened by Perch and Impect, we stand alone in our ability to help teams, athletes optimize their performance. I remain confident in the path we're in and in the vital role we play in unleashing the potential that lives inside every athlete and team on earth.\nThank you all for listening, and I will now turn back to the operator for questions.",

Creed\n\nInterim Chief Financial Officer & Vice President-Finance Services Division, Caterpillar, Inc.\n\nThank you, Alex, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Solid performance from our team generated strong results this quarter, driven by resilient demand and focused execution across our 3 primary segments. And as a result, sales growth and adjusted operating profit margin were both slightly above our expectations.\nSales and revenues increased 10% to $17.6 billion, an all-time record for a single quarter. Backlog grew by about $2.4 billion, driven by strong orders in Energy & Transportation. The backlog is now $39.8 billion, which is also an all-time record and positions us for sustained momentum and long-term profitable growth. We also generated $3.2 billion of ME&T free cash flow and we deployed about $1.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the quarter.\nI'll start with my perspectives about this quarter's performance. Then I'll discuss our outlook, along with insights about our end markets. And finally, Andrew will provide a detailed overview of results and key assumptions.\nTurning to Slide 4. Sales and revenues were up 10% versus last year. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume, partially offset by unfavorable price realization for machines. Higher sales volume was driven by higher sales of equipment to end users across our 3 primary segments.\nThird quarter adjusted operating profit margin was 17.5%. For the quarter, the net impact of incremental tariffs was near the top end of our estimated range of $500 million to $600 million. Despite the tariff headwind, adjusted operating profit margin was slightly above our expectation, primarily due to better-than-expected sales volume in Energy & Transportation. We achieved quarterly adjusted profit per share of $4.95.\nCompared to the third quarter of 2024, sales to users increased 12%, led by 25% growth in Energy & Transportation, while machine sales to users increased 6%. For Construction Industries, sales to users were up 7% year-over-year, broadly in line with our expectations.\nLet me take a minute to walk through the sales to users by region. North America increased 11% over the prior year and was better than we anticipated due to growth in both residential and nonresidential construction. While rental fleet loading was down slightly, dealers rental revenue continued to grow in the quarter.\nAn increase in the EAME was primarily due to growth in Africa and the Middle East. We saw a decline in Asia Pacific, which was below our expectations, resulting from softness in a few key subregions. Latin America increased, but slightly lower than we anticipated.\nIn Resource Industries, sales to users increased 6% year-over-year, which was slightly above our expectations. Mining was better than expected due to the timing of deliveries to end customers for large mining trucks and off-highway trucks. Heavy construction in quarry and aggregates were in line with our expectations.\nIn Energy & Transportation, sales to users increased by 25% year-over-year with double-digit growth across all applications. The largest growth came from power generation with a 33% increase, primarily due to demand for reciprocating engines for data center applications. Turbines and turbine-related services also contributed to power generation growth.\nSales to users in oil and gas, industrial and transportation all increased about 20%. The increase in oil and gas was primarily driven by higher demand for turbines and turbine-related services. Industrial grew from a relatively low level and was driven by sales into electric power applications. Transportation increased due to international locomotive deliveries.\nMoving to dealer inventory and our backlog. In total, dealer inventory increased by approximately $600 million versus the second quarter of 2025. Machine dealer inventory increased approximately $300 million, about in line with our expectations. As I mentioned, backlog increased sequentially by $2.4 billion, driven by robust order activity in power generation and oil and gas. Since the third quarter of 2024, our backlog has increased 39%, with growth across all 3 primary segments.\nMoving to Slide 5, I'll now discuss our outlook. I'm pleased with the continued positive momentum in our business. With a record backlog, strong order rates and continued growth in sales to users, our outlook has improved since last quarter. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate strong sales growth versus the prior year. Sales growth is expected to be driven by higher volumes in all 3 segments. We also expect the year-over-year impact of price realization to be about flat in the fourth quarter.\nExcluding the net impact of incremental tariffs, fourth quarter adjusted operating profit margin is expected to be higher versus the prior year. When taking into account the net impact from incremental tariffs, we expect fourth quarter enterprise adjusted operating profit margin to be lower versus the prior year.\nGiven the strength of our 3 -- across our 3 primary segments, we now expect full year 2025 sales and revenues to be higher than we previously anticipated, resulting in modest growth versus 2024. We continue to expect full year services revenues to be about flat versus 2024.\nBased on the incremental tariffs announced in 2025 and expected to be in place by November 1, we expect the full year net impact from tariffs to be between $1.6 billion and $1.75 billion. Tariffs and trade negotiations remain fluid. Our team is continuously evaluating options to further reduce the impact of tariffs going forward, and we fully intend to implement longer-term actions once there's sufficient certainty. I remain confident that we'll manage the impact of tariffs over time.\nExcluding the net impact of incremental tariffs, full year adjusted operating profit margin is expected to be in the top half of our target margin range. Including the net impact from incremental tariffs, we expect full year adjusted operating profit margin to be near the bottom of the target range, corresponding to our current expectation for full year sales and revenues. This margin estimate includes the initial mitigating actions already implemented and currently planned throughout the rest of the year.\nWe also expect ME&T free cash flow to be above the midpoint of the $5 billion to $10 billion target range. Andrew will provide more details on key assumptions for the fourth quarter and full year in a moment.\nTo further support our sales outlook, I'll now share the latest view of our end markets, starting with Construction Industries. As I mentioned earlier, we're encouraged by another quarter of growth in sales to users and strong order rates across many of our regions. Customers continue to be responsive to the attractive rates we're offering through Cat Financial. We continue to anticipate full year growth in Construction Industries sales to users despite softness in the global industry.\nIn North America, overall construction spending remains at healthy levels, and infrastructure projects funded by the IIJA continue to be awarded. We continue to expect full year growth for sales to users. Full year dealer rental revenues are also expected to grow, and we anticipate dealer rental fleet loading will increase in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year.\nIn Asia Pacific, we anticipate full year sales to users to be about flat. China has shown positive momentum to start the year, and we expect full year growth in the above 10-ton excavator industry, but from a very low level of activity. In Asia Pacific outside of China, we expect economic conditions to be soft. Any EAME, we expect growth for the year, driven by healthy construction activity in Africa and the Middle East and improving economic conditions in Europe. With ongoing weaker construction activity in Latin America, we now expect to be about flat for the full year.\nMoving to Resource Industries. We anticipate lower sales to users in 2025 compared to last year as customers continue to display capital discipline. However, we see positive momentum with healthy orders for large mining trucks, articulated trucks and large truck-type tractors. Although most key commodities remain above investment thresholds, declining coal prices have caused an increase in the number of parked trucks. As a result, we continue to expect slightly lower rebuild activity compared to last year.\nOverall, customer product utilization remains high and the age of the fleet remains elevated. We also continue to see growing demand and customer acceptance of our autonomous solutions.\nAnd finally, in Energy & Transportation. We expect strong growth in full year sales for power generation compared to last year. Demand remains robust driven by data center growth related to cloud computing and generative AI. We are also pleased by healthy orders for the prime power applications as evidenced by recent announcements with Joule Capital Partners and Hunt Energy Company. We continue to stay close to our largest data center customers and receive regular feedback on their long-term demand expectations.\nIn oil and gas, we expect moderate growth in 2025. For reciprocating engines and services, we continue to expect softness in well servicing due to ongoing capital discipline, industry consolidation and efficiency improvements in our customers' operations. We do see positive momentum in demand for reciprocating engines used in gas compression applications. Solar turbines oil and gas backlog remains strong, and we see healthy order and inquiry activity.\nWith our ongoing investment to increase large reciprocating engine capacity, we're continually improving manufacturing throughput to meet customer needs across a broad range of applications. Demand for products and industrial applications is improving from previous lows, with order growth being driven by engines sold into electric power applications. Transportation is expected to remain stable.\nThe strong momentum we achieved in the third quarter, combined with the anticipated growth through year-end, sets the stage for exciting opportunities ahead. As a result, I look forward to sharing more about our long-term outlook at our 2025 Investor Day on November 4.\nAnd now I'll turn it over to Andrew for a detailed overview of results and key assumptions looking forward.\n\nAndrew R. J. Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar Inc.\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As usual, I will start with a brief overview of our third quarter results, followed by our segment performance. Then I'll discuss the balance sheet and free cash flow, before concluding with our current assumptions for the full year and the fourth quarter.\nBeginning on Slide 6. Sales and revenues were $17.6 billion, a 10% increase versus the prior year. This was slightly better than we had expected on stronger volume. Adjusted operating profit was $3.1 billion, and our adjusted operating profit margin was 17.5%. Both were slightly better than we had expected.\nProfit per share was $4.88 in the third quarter, compared to $5.06 in the third quarter of last year. Adjusted profit per share was $4.95 in the quarter, compared to $5.17 last year. Adjusted profit per share excluded restructuring costs of $0.07 in the quarter, compared to $0.11 in the third quarter of 2024.\nOther income and expense was favorable by $132 million, primarily due to the absence of an unfavorable ME&T balance sheet translation impact, which occurred in the prior year.\nExcluding discrete items, the global annual effective tax rate was 24%, an increase versus our prior expectation of 23%. The higher rates had an unfavorable impact on our performance in the quarter by about $0.18. This is due to changes in recently enacted U.S. tax legislation. While the changes have a negative impact on the tax rate in 2025, they benefit 2025 cash flow. In 2026 and beyond, we would expect a positive benefit to the tax rate versus the previous estimated tax rate for 2025, subject to a consistent mix of profits.\nThe year-over-year impact from the reduction in the average number of shares outstanding, primarily due to share repurchases, resulted in a favorable impact on adjusted profit per share of approximately $0.17.\nMoving to Slide 7, I'll discuss our top line results for the third quarter. Sales and revenues increased by 10% compared to the prior year, driven by higher volume, which was primarily due to stronger sales of equipment to end users. Changes in dealer inventory acted as a slight tailwind to sales while price realization was a slight headwind. As I mentioned, sales were slightly better than we had expected in August.\nMoving to operating profit on Slide 8. Operating profit in the third quarter increased by 3% to $3.1 billion compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating profit increased by 4% versus the prior year to $3.1 billion. Stronger volumes -- stronger sales volume and favorability in other operating income and expenses was more than offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs, unfavorable price realization and higher SG&A and R&D expenses. The unfavorable manufacturing costs largely reflected the impact of tariffs.\nYou'll note that there was a headwind of $127 million in corporate items and eliminations this quarter compared to the prior year. The unfavorable impact was driven by higher short-term incentive compensation expense and accrual for incremental tariffs and corporate items, which I will discuss in a moment. This was partially offset by the proceeds from an insurance claim.\nThe adjusted operating profit margin was 17.5%, a decrease of 250 basis points compared to the prior year. The margin was slightly higher than we had anticipated mainly due to better-than-expected sales volume in Energy & Transportation.\nAs Joe mentioned, the net impact from incremental tariffs was near the top end of our estimated $500 million to $600 million range for the third quarter. Excluding tariffs, adjusted operating profit margin was slightly higher versus the prior year. This compares favorably to our expectations of a similar margin to the prior year, excluding tariffs.\nTariffs impacted all 3 primary segments. And as I mentioned, part of the charge was recorded in corporate items, similar to what we saw in the second quarter. This timing impact reflects the additional tariffs that were announced within the quarter, which we noted in the 8-K filing on August 28.\nMoving to Slide 9, I'll review the performance of the segments. Starting with Construction Industries, sales increased by 7% in the third quarter to $6.8 billion. The sales increase was about in line with our expectations. The 7% sales increase was primarily due to higher sales volume and favorable currency impacts, partially offset by unfavorable price realization.\nBy region, Construction Industries sales in North America increased by 8% versus the prior year. Sales in the EAME region increased by 6%. In Asia Pacific, sales increased by 3%. And in Latin America, sales decreased by 1%.\nThird quarter profit for Construction Industries was $1.4 billion, a 7% decrease versus the prior year. The segment's margin of 20.4% was a decrease of 300 basis points versus the prior year. The decrease was mainly due to unfavorable price realization and increased manufacturing costs, largely due to tariffs, while the profit impact of higher sales volume provided a partial offset. The net impact of incremental tariffs in Construction Industries had a negative impact on the segment's margin of around 340 basis points. Excluding this impact from tariffs, the margin was slightly higher than the prior year and about in line with our expectations.\nTurning to Slide 10. Resource Industries sales increased by 2% in the third quarter to $3.1 billion. Sales were about in line with our expectations. Note that sales to users were slightly stronger than we had expected due to timing as shipments originally expected to occur in the fourth quarter were delivered to customers early. This resulted in a decrease in dealer inventory. Compared to the prior year, the 2% sales increase was primarily due to a higher sales volume, partially offset by unfavorable price realization.\nThird quarter profit for Resource Industries decreased by 19% versus the prior year to $499 million. The segment's margin of 16% was a decrease of 430 basis points versus the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to unfavorable manufacturing costs from tariffs and unfavorable price realization. This was partially offset by the profit impact of higher sales volume. The net impact of incremental tariffs on Resource Industries margin was approximately 260 basis points. Excluding the impact from tariffs, the margin was lower versus the prior year and about in line with our expectations.\nNow on Slide 11. Energy & Transportation sales of $8.4 billion increased by 17% versus the prior year. Sales were stronger than we had expected due to higher sales volume. The 17% sales increase versus the prior year was mainly due to higher sales volume, including higher intersegment sales. Also price realization was favorable. By application, power generation sales increased by 31%; oil and gas sales increased by 20%. Sales in industrial and transportation each increased by 5%.\nThird quarter profit for the Energy & Transportation increased by 17% versus the prior year to $1.7 billion. The increase was primarily due to the profit impact of higher sales volume and favorable price realization, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs primarily due to tariffs. The segment's margin of 20% was an increase of 10 basis points versus the prior year. The net impact of incremental tariffs on Energy & Transportation's margin was approximately 140 basis points. Excluding this impact from tariffs, the margin was higher versus the prior year and slightly stronger than we had expected.\nMoving to Slide 12. Financial Products revenues were approximately $1.1 billion in the quarter, a 4% increase versus the prior year due to a favorable impact from higher average earning assets in North America. This was partially offset by an unfavorable impact from lower average financing rates across all regions except Latin America.\nSegment profit decreased by 2% to $241 million. The decrease was mainly due to a higher provision for credit losses at Cat Financial, higher SG&A expenses and an unfavorable impact from equity securities at insurance services. This was partially offset by a favorable impact from higher average earning assets.\nOur customers' financial health remains strong. Past dues were 1.47% in the quarter, down 27 basis points versus the prior year, the lowest third quarter in over 25 years. The allowance rate was 0.89%, remaining near historic lows.\nBusiness activity at Cat Financial remains healthy. Retail credit applications increased by 16% and retail new business volume grew by 7% versus the prior year. In addition, used equipment levels remain low and conversion remain above historical averages as customers choose to buy equipment at the end of their lease term.\nMoving to Slide 13. ME&T free cash flow was about $3.2 billion in the third quarter, approximately $500 million higher than the prior year as stronger operating cash more than offset higher CapEx spend. We continue to anticipate CapEx spend of around $2.5 billion this year.\nMoving to capital deployment. We deployed about $1.1 billion to shareholders in the third quarter. Our quarterly dividend payment was $700 million, with the remainder reflecting share repurchases in the quarter. Average balance sheet and liquidity positions remain strong. We ended the third quarter with an enterprise cash balance of $7.5 billion. In addition, we held $1.2 billion in slightly longer-dated liquid marketable securities to improve yields on that cash.\nNow on Slide 14, let me start with a few comments on the full year. Based on what we see today, we are optimistic about our top line momentum, supported by healthy demand signals, including a robust backlog and growth in sales to users. Against this supportive backdrop, we now expect full year 2025 sales and revenues to increase modestly versus 2024, a slight improvement compared to our expectations last quarter.\nNow moving on to margins. Excluding the net impact from incremental tariffs, the full year adjusted operating profit margin is expected to be in the top half of our margin target range. Including the net impact from incremental tariffs, we expect full year adjusted operating profit margin to remain near the bottom of the target range. Given our improved sales and revenue expectations, adjusted operating profit margin should be slightly higher than we anticipated when we filed the 8-K on August 28.\nBased on the tariffs announced in 2025 and expected to be in place on November 1, we expect the impact from incremental tariffs for 2025 to be around $1.6 billion to $1.75 billion, net of some mitigating actions and cost controls. This assumes that the net incremental impact of tariffs will be greater in the fourth quarter than in the third, primarily due to the timing of tariff rate changes.\nAs Joe mentioned, we expect ME&T free cash flow will be above the midpoint of the $5 billion to $10 billion target range. We continue to expect restructuring costs of approximately $300 million to $350 million this year.\nOn taxes, as I mentioned, we now anticipate our 2025 global annual effective tax rate to be 24%, excluding discrete items.\nTurning to Slide 15. To assist you with your modeling, I'll provide our fourth quarter assumptions. Based on what we see today, we anticipate strong sales growth versus the prior year, with higher sales volume across all 3 primary segments. We expect machine dealer inventory to decline slightly in the quarter, compared to a $1.6 billion decrease in the prior year, which should result in a sales tailwind for the fourth quarter. We expect price to be roughly flat for the enterprise.\nBy segment, in Construction Industries, we expect a strong sales increase in the fourth quarter versus the prior year on volume growth, driven mainly by the dealer inventory tailwind previously mentioned. Higher sales to users should benefit volume as well, while we anticipate the year-over-year price impact to be about neutral.\nIn Resource Industries in the fourth quarter, we expect stronger sales versus the prior year, primarily due to higher volume driven by changes in dealer inventory. Note that we anticipate unfavorable sales to users in the fourth quarter in Resource Industries due to the timing impact that I mentioned a moment ago. The impact of price in Resource Industries is expected to remain unfavorable, but to a slightly lesser extent compared to what we saw in the third quarter versus the prior year.\nIn Energy & Transportation in the fourth quarter, we anticipate strong sales growth versus the prior year, driven by continued strength in power generation. We also expect higher sales in oil and gas driven by solar turbines and turbine-related services. Price realization should remain favorable as well.\nLet me provide some perspective on our expectations for Energy & Transportation. While we expect sales to increase sequentially in the fourth quarter, the increase will likely be different than the typical seasonal pattern. This reflects the impact from robust third quarter sales, which have tempered the usual fourth quarter uplift. As a result, the sequential sales growth rate between the third and fourth quarters is projected to be slightly lower than last year's level.\nNow I'll provide some color on our fourth quarter margin expectations. Excluding the net impact from incremental tariffs, we expect the fourth quarter enterprise adjusted operating profit margin will be higher versus the prior year. We anticipate stronger sales volume will be partially offset by higher manufacturing costs. As I mentioned, price realization for the enterprise should be roughly flat in the fourth quarter.\nIncluding the net impact from incremental tariffs, we anticipate a lower enterprise adjusted operating profit margin in the fourth quarter versus the prior year. As I mentioned, the tariff headwind should be larger than it was in the third quarter. We anticipate a net cost headwind of about $650 million to $800 million in the fourth quarter. At this point, we expect tariffs to have a minimal impact to corporate items in the fourth quarter as our current assumptions are based on tariffs announced and expected to be in place on November 1.\nNow I'll make a few comments regarding our segment margin expectations for the fourth quarter. In Construction Industries, excluding the net impact from incremental tariffs, we expect a higher margin compared to the prior year. This is driven primarily by the profit impact from higher sales volume, though the benefit within volume is lessened by unfavorable product mix compared to the prior year. Now including the net impact from incremental tariffs, we anticipate a lower margin in Construction Industries versus the prior year. We expect about 55% of the fourth quarter net incremental tariff impact will be incurred in Construction Industries.\nIn Resource Industries, excluding the net impact from incremental tariffs, we anticipate a higher margin versus the prior year, mainly due to higher sales volume, partially offset by unfavorable price realization. Including the net impact from incremental tariffs, we anticipate a lower margin in Resource Industries versus the prior year. We expect about 20% of the fourth quarter net incremental tariff impact will be incurred in Resource Industries.\nIn Energy & Transportation, excluding the net impact from incremental tariffs, we anticipate a higher margin versus the prior year, mainly due to a higher sales volume and favorable price realization. Higher manufacturing costs should act as a partial offset. Including the net impact from incremental tariffs, we anticipate a slightly lower margin compared to the prior year. We expect about 25% of the fourth quarter net incremental tariff impact will be incurred in Energy & Transportation.\nSo turning to Slide 16, let me summarize. We remain optimistic about our underlying business and now anticipate modestly higher sales for the full year, including a strong fourth quarter. Business activity and customer financial health remain strong as do our balance sheet and liquidity position. Including the net impact from incremental tariffs, we expect to remain near the bottom of our target range for adjusted operating profit margins, and we expect to be above the midpoint of the target range for ME&T free cash flow. We continue to execute our strategy for long-term profitable growth.\nAnd with that, we'll take your questions.\n\nAlex Kapper\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThis is Alex. Just one quick clarification before we jump into the Q&A. The operating profit in the third quarter actually decreased by 3% to $3.1 billion compared to the prior year, and adjusted operating profit actually decreased by 4% versus the prior year to $3.1 billion.\nAnd with that, we'll take your questions.",

Creed\n\nInterim Chief Financial Officer & Vice President-Finance Services Division, Caterpillar, Inc.\n\nThank you, Alex, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. The Caterpillar team demonstrated solid operational performance in a fluid environment this quarter. Sales were in line with our expectations, and we delivered adjusted operating profit, and adjusted operating profit margin above our expectations. We continue to see strong orders across our segments as demand remains resilient supported by infrastructure spending and growing energy needs. As a result, backlog grew by $2.5 billion with increases across all three primary segments.\nOur strong ME&T free cash flow allowed us to deploy about $1.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. As you know, the environment continues to be dynamic, the net impact of tariffs was around the top end of our estimated range for the quarter and is likely to be a more significant headwind to profitability in the second half of 2025. We'll provide more details in a moment. I'll start with my perspectives about this quarter's performance, then I'll discuss our outlook along with insights about our end markets. And then finally, Andrew will provide a detailed overview of results and key assumptions, including the net impact of incremental tariffs looking forward.\nTurning to Slide 4. Sales and revenues were down 1% versus last year. The decrease was primarily due to unfavorable price realization, partially offset by higher sales volume and higher financial products revenues. Second quarter adjusted operating profit margin was 17.6%. Although the net impact from incremental tariffs is around the top end of our estimated range, lower-than-expected manufacturing costs resulted in adjusted operating profit margin above our expectations. We achieved quarterly adjusted profit per share of $4.72.\nCompared to the second quarter of 2024, machine sales to users were about flat. Energy & Transportation continued to grow as sales to users increased 9%, driven primarily by power generation and industrial applications. For Construction Industries, sales to users were up 2% year-over-year, in line with our expectations. In North America, [indiscernible] 3% higher than the prior year and better than we anticipated due to growth in both residential and nonresidential construction, partially offset by lower rental fleet loading. However, despite lower rental fleet loading, dealers' rental revenue continued to grow in the quarter. Sales to users increased in EAME primarily due to growth in Africa and the Middle East. However, overall growth in EAME was below our expectations due to weakness in Europe. In Asia Pacific, sales users declined slightly. Although China was about flat versus the prior year, the second quarter was below our expectations due to lower activity following a stronger-than-expected first quarter. Sales to users in Latin America declined but were slightly better than we anticipated.\nIn Resource Industries, sales users declined 3%, which was in line with our expectations. While mining was slightly worse, primarily due to the timing of off-highway truck deliveries, sales to users in heavy construction, and quarry and aggregates were slightly better than we anticipated.\nIn Energy & Transportation sales to users increased by 9%. Power generation grew by 19%, primarily due to demand for reciprocating engines for data center applications. Turbines and turbine-related services for power generation were down slightly due to timing. Oil and gas sales users increased overall with the increase in turbines and turbine-related services partially offset by a decrease in reciprocating engines due to the timing in gas compression. Industrial sales to users grew from a relatively low level and were driven by sales into electric power applications. Transportation decreased due to lower marine sales to users, and the timing of international locomotive deliveries.\nMoving to dealer inventory and our backlog. In total, dealer inventory increased by approximately $100 million versus the first quarter of 2025. Machine dealer inventory was down approximately $400 million, in line with our expectations. As I mentioned, backlog increased sequentially by $2.5 billion, driven by strong order rates in all three of our primary segments. Our backlog is at a record level of $37.5 billion.\nMoving to Slide 5. I'll now discuss our outlook. Looking ahead to the second half of 2025, I'm increasingly optimistic about the top line expectations. I'm pleased with another quarter of increased ordering activity and backlog growth, continued sales to users growth in Construction Industries, and strong demand in power generation. However, as I mentioned, the incremental tariffs announced in 2025 and expected to be in place by August 7 will be a headwind to profitability during the remainder of the year.\nWhile we have taken initial mitigating actions to reduce the impact, tariff and trade negotiations continue to be fluid. We will remain flexible and we intend to implement longer-term actions once there are sufficient certainty. We are considering all options to further reduce the impact of tariffs going forward.\nFor the third quarter, we anticipate sales to grow moderately versus the prior year. Sales growth is expected to be driven by higher volumes in all three segments. Excluding the impact of incremental tariffs, third quarter adjusted operating profit margin is expected to be similar to the prior year. Including net impact from incremental tariffs, we expect third quarter enterprise adjusted operating profit margin to be lower versus the prior year.\nGiven the strength of our record backlog, we expect full year 2025 sales and revenues to increase slightly versus 2024. This represents an improvement since our outlook last quarter, and our full year outlook from the beginning of the year. Full year services revenues are expected to be about flat versus 2024. This is slightly lower than our previous expectations due to lower-than-anticipated machine rebuild activity throughout the year.\nExcluding the impact of incremental tariffs, full year adjusted operating profit margin is expected to be in the top half of our target margin range. Including the net impact from incremental tariffs we expect full year adjusted operating profit margin to be in the bottom half of the target margin range. This estimate includes the initial mitigating actions already implemented and currently planned throughout the rest of the year. We also expect ME&T free cash flow to be around the middle of the $5 billion to $10 billion target range. Andrew will provide more details on key assumptions for the third quarter and full year in a moment.\nTo further support our sales outlook, I'll now share the latest view of our end markets. Starting with Construction Industries. As I mentioned earlier, we're encouraged by another quarter of sales to users growth, strong order rates across many of our regions and backlog growth. Customers continue to be responsive to the attractive rates we're offering through Cat Financial. And as a result, we anticipate full year growth in Construction Industries sales to users despite softness in the global industry.\nIn North America, overall construction spending remains at healthy levels and infrastructure projects funded by the IIJA continue to be awarded. We now expect full year growth for sales to users, which is an improvement from the outlook we provided in January. Full year dealer rental revenues are also expected to grow as dealer rental fleet loading is expected to increase in the second half of the year.\nIn Asia Pacific, we anticipate full year sales to users growth. China has shown positive momentum to start the year, and we expect full year growth in the -- in the above 10-ton excavator industry, but from a very low level of activity. In Asia Pacific outside of China, we expect economic conditions to be soft.\nIn EAME, we expect moderate sales to users growth for the year driven by healthy construction activity in Africa and the Middle East and improving economic conditions in Europe. Despite weaker construction activity in Latin America, we expect sales to users growth for the year.\nMoving to Resource Industries. We currently anticipate lower sales to users in 2025 compared to last year as customers continue to display capital discipline. However, we see positive momentum with strong order rates and backlog growth, particularly for large mining and articulated trucks. Although most key commodities remain above investment thresholds, declining coal prices have caused an increase in the number of park trucks. As a result, we expect slightly lower rebuild activity throughout the second half of the year.\nOverall, customer product utilization remains high and the age of the fleet remains elevated. We also continue to see growing demand and customer acceptance of our autonomous solutions. We believe the evolving energy landscape will support increased commodity demand over time, providing further opportunities for long-term profitable growth.\nAnd finally, in Energy & Transportation. The backlog growth was driven by robust order activity in power generation, oil and gas, and transportation. We expect full year growth for power generation as demand remains strong for both prime and backup power applications driven by increasing energy demands to support data center growth, related to cloud computing and generative AI. We continue to stay close to our largest data center customers and receive regular feedback on their long-term demand.\nIn oil and gas, we expect moderate growth in 2025. For reciprocating engines and services, we continue to expect softness in well servicing due to ongoing capital discipline by our customers, industry consolidation and efficiency improvements in our customers' operations. We do see positive momentum in demand for [indiscernible] engines used in gas compression applications. Solar turbines oil and gas backlog remains strong, and we see healthy order and inquiry activity. With our investment to increase large engine capacity in process, we're continuously improving manufacturing throughput to meet customer needs across a broad range of applications. Demand for products and industrial applications is expected to improve from previous lows and transportation is expected to remain stable.\nBefore turning the call over to Andrew, I want to briefly reflect as I approach my first 100 days as CEO. I'm optimistic and excited about the possibilities ahead. As I visit with customers, employees, dealers and investors around the world, I'm proud to see our global impact, the Caterpillar team's relentless commitment to customer success. I'm also pleased that [ Christy Pambianchi ] joined the executive office on May 1 as Chief Human Resources Officer to focus on recruiting and developing the best talent to deliver our strategy for long-term profitable growth. I look forward to sharing more about our strategic priorities and the incredible growth opportunities that lie ahead during our upcoming Investor Day in November.\nNow I'll turn it over to Andrew for a detailed overview of results and key assumptions looking forward.\n\nAndrew R. J. Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar Inc.\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a summary of the second quarter and then provide more detailed comments, including some [indiscernible] the performance of the segments. Next, I'll discuss the balance sheet and free cash flow before concluding with comments on our current assumptions for the remainder of the year, and in particular, the third quarter.\nBeginning on Slide 6. Sales and revenues were $16.6 billion, a 1% decrease versus the prior year. This was in line with our expectations. Adjusted operating profit was $2.9 billion, and our adjusted operating profit margin was 17.6%. Both were better than we expected. Profit per share was $4.62 in the second quarter, compared to $5.48 in the second quarter of last year. Adjusted profit per share was $4.72 in the quarter, compared to $5.99 last year. Adjusted profit per share excluded restructuring costs of $0.10 in the quarter.\nOther income and expense was unfavorable by $71 million versus the prior year, primarily driven by an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $122 million from ME&T balance sheet translation in the quarter, compared to a favorable impact of $20 million last year. Excluding discrete items, the estimated annual effect of global tax rate was [ 23.0% ]. The year-over-year impact from the reduction in the average number of shares outstanding primarily due to share repurchases, resulted in a favorable impact on adjusted profit per share of approximately $0.17.\nMoving to Slide 7. I'll discuss our top line results for the second quarter. Sales and revenues decreased by 1% compared to the prior year, primarily due to unfavorable price realization, which was partially offset by higher sales volume and financial products revenue growth. As I mentioned, sales were in line with our expectations.\nMoving to operating profit on Slide 8. Operating profit in the second quarter decreased by 18% to $2.9 billion. Adjusted operating profit decreased by 22% versus the prior year to $2.9 billion, mainly due to unfavorable manufacturing costs that largely reflected the impact of higher tariffs, and the impact of [ comparable ] price. Deferred compensation expense also negatively impacted operating profit in the quarter due to strength in the equity markets. This is an item we do not forecast as it is offset by the total return swaps, which we'll report as income in other income and expense.\nThe adjusted operating profit margin was 17.6%, a decrease of 480 basis points compared to the prior year. Margins exceeded our expectations primarily due to favorable manufacturing costs driven by cost absorption. As Joe mentioned, the net incremental impact from tariffs was around the top end of our estimated $250 million to $350 million range for the quarter. With the decrease in certain tariff rates during the quarter, we lifted some holds on inbound shipments, such that the high inbound shipment volumes more than offset the lower tariff rates.\nTariffs impacted all three primary segments, and part of the charge was not allocated to the segments recorded in corporate items. Also, please keep in mind the impact is net of mitigating actions in the quarter, which were of the no regrets type, mainly short-term actions around cost controls.\nMoving to Slide 9. I'll review the performance of the segments. Starting with Construction Industries, sales decreased by 7% in the second quarter to $6.2 billion, primarily due to unfavorable price realization. Sales were about in line with our expectations as favorable currency impacts roughly offset unfavorable price realization. Despite sales to users growth, volumes are slightly negative due to [ a dealer ] inventory headwind.\nPrice was more unfavorable than we had anticipated as our attractive merchandising programs stimulated higher-than-expected sales to users in North America. By region, construction industry sales in North America decreased by 15% versus the prior year. In Latin America, sales decreased by 20%. Sales in the EAME region increased by 13%. In Asia Pacific, sales increased by 6%.\nSecond quarter profit for Construction Industries was $1.2 billion, a 29% decrease versus the prior year. The segment margin of 20.1% was a decrease of 600 basis points versus the prior year. The decrease was mainly due to unfavorable price realization. In addition, the net impact of incremental tariffs in Construction Industries had a negative impact of around 170 basis points. Excluding this impact from tariffs, the margin was slightly lower than we had anticipated primarily due to the headwind from price realization, which I mentioned a moment ago.\nTurning to Slide 10. Resource Industry sales decreased by 4% in the second quarter to $3.1 billion. Sales were about in line with our expectations. The 4% sales decrease was primarily due to unfavorable price realization. Second quarter profit for Resource Industries decreased by 25% versus the prior year to $537 million. The segment's margin of 17.4% was a decrease of 500 basis points versus the prior year. This was mainly due to unfavorable price realization, the net impact of incremental tariffs, and the profit impact of lower sales volume, including unfavorable product mix.\nThe net impact of incremental tariffs in Resource Industries was approximately 230 basis points. Excluding this impact from tariffs, the margin was slightly higher than we had anticipated due to favorable manufacturing costs, including freight and material.\nNow on Slide 11. Energy & Transportation sales of $7.8 billion, increased by 7% versus the prior year. Sales were in line with our expectations. The sales increase versus the prior year was mainly due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization. By application, power generation sales increased by 28%. Oil and gas sales increased by 2%. Industrial sales increased by 1%, and transportation sales were lower by 7%.\nSecond quarter profit for Energy & Transportation increased by 4% versus the prior year to $1.6 billion. The increase was primarily due to favorable price realization and the profit impact of higher sales volume, partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs, largely due to tariffs. The segment's margin of 20.2% was a decrease of 60 basis points versus the prior year. The net impact of incremental tariffs in Energy & Transportation was approximately 110 basis points. Excluding this impact from tariffs, the margin was slightly higher than we had anticipated due to favorable price realization and manufacturing costs.\nMoving to Slide 12. Financial Products revenues were approximately $1.0 billion in the quarter, a 4% increase versus the prior year, primarily due to a favorable impact from higher average earning assets in North America. These were partially offset by an unfavorable impact from lower average financing rates mainly in North America. Segment profit increased by 9% to $248 million. The increase was mainly due to a favorable impact from equity securities, and a favorable impact from higher average earning assets, partially offset by higher provisions for credit losses and an unfavorable impact from lower net yield on average earning assets. The increase in the provision primarily reflected the absence of a nonrecurring reserve release, which was a benefit in the prior year.\nOur customers' financial health remains strong. Past dues were 1.62% in the quarter, down 12 basis points versus the prior year. This is the lowest second quarter in over 25 years. The allowance rate was 0.94%, remaining near historic lows. Business activity at Cat Financial remains healthy. Retail credit applications and retail new business volume both grew by 5% versus the prior year. Retail new business volume is at its highest [ level ] for a second quarter in over 10 years, reflecting the attractiveness of our sales merchandising programs. In addition, used equipment inventory levels remain low and conversion rates remain above historical averages, as customers choose to buy equipment at the end of their lease term.\nMoving on to Slide 13. ME&T free cash flow was about $2.4 billion in the second quarter approximately $100 million lower than the prior year, a stronger operating cash was more than offset by higher CapEx spend. We continue to anticipate CapEx spend of around $2.5 billion for the year.\nMoving to capital deployment. We deployed about $1.5 billion to shareholders in the second quarter. Share repurchase spend accounted for about $800 million, with the remainder reflecting our quarterly dividend payment. In June, we announced a 7% dividend increase, our fifth consecutive year with a high single-digit quarterly increase.\nOur balance sheet and liquidity positions remain strong. During the quarter, we issued bonds totaling $2 billion at attractive financing rates, and net debt in ME&T was $5.2 billion. We ended the quarter with an enterprise cash balance of $5.4 billion. In addition, we held $1.2 billion in slightly longer-dated liquid marketable securities to improve yields on that cash.\nNow on Slide 14, let me start with a few comments on the full year. We are increasingly optimistic about our top line expectations based on what we see today. As Joe mentioned, demand signals have remained healthy, including backlog growth across our three primary segments. Against this supported backdrop, we now anticipate slightly higher sales this year with a stronger second half than is typical. This represents an improvement since our outlook last quarter.\nTo explain, we anticipate higher machine volume, including sales to users growth in the second half versus the prior year. Also, we continue to expect machine [ dealer ] inventories will be about flat for the full year, which implies some net build in the second half, versus a decrease in the corresponding time period in 2024. Energy & Transportation sales should grow in the second half as well, driven by the strength of our backlog and robust order activity. We expect some adverse price realization in the second half versus the prior year, although this will be at a lower level than in the first half.\nNow moving on to margins. Excluding the impact of incremental tariffs, the full year adjusted operating profit margin is expected to be in the top half of our margin target range. However, including the net impact from incremental tariffs, we now expect full year margins will be in the bottom half of the target range, on slightly higher sales and revenues versus 2024. Excluding this tariff impact, our second half margins are expected to be stronger than the prior year. However, we anticipate there will be lower when incorporating the net impact of incremental tariffs.\nBased on the incremental tariffs announced in 2025 and expected to be placed on [ August 7 ], we expect the net impact from incremental tariffs for 2025 will be around $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion, net of some mitigating actions and cost controls. This assumes higher net incremental tariff impacts in both the third and fourth quarters compared to the second quarter level.\nDue to the timing of recent rate changes, the headwind is likely to be larger in the fourth quarter when compared to the third quarter. As Joe mentioned, we expect ME&T free cash flow will be around the middle of the $5 billion to $10 billion target range, or around $7.5 billion. We now expect restructuring costs of approximately $300 million to $350 million in 2025. This is higher than we previously expected due to the timing of an anticipated loss on the divestiture of non-U.S. entities.\nOn taxes, we are evaluating the impact of recently enacted U.S. legislation and do not currently expect this change to have a material impact on our 2025 effective global tax rate, which we have previously estimated to be 23.0% for 2025, excluding discrete items.\nTurning to Slide 15. To assist you with your modeling, I'll provide our third quarter assumptions. Based on what we see today, we anticipate third quarter sales will grow moderately versus the prior year, with higher volumes across all three primary segments. By segment, in Construction Industries, we expect sales increase in the third quarter versus the prior year on volume growth driven by strong sales to users. The year over price comparison begins to ease this quarter. We expect our sales merchandising programs will continue yielding results, supporting strong sales to users, but a headwind to our price realization in the quarter with the unfavorable impact, roughly half the size we saw in the second quarter of 2025. This headwind should continue to diminish in the fourth quarter.\nIn Resource Industries in the third quarter, we expect slightly higher sales versus the prior year, primarily due to higher volume, partially offset by an unfavorable price realization. The impact of price is expected to be similar to what we saw in the second quarter versus the prior year.\nIn Energy & Transportation in the third quarter, we anticipate sales growth versus the prior year driven by continued strength in power generation. We also expect higher sales in oil and gas driven by solar turbines and turbine-related services. Price realization should remain favorable as well.\nNow I'll provide some color on our third quarter margin expectations. Excluding the net impact from incremental tariffs, we expect the third quarter enterprise adjusted operating profit margin will be similar to the prior year with higher sales volume above offset by unfavorable price realization and higher SG&A and R&D costs. Including the net impact from incremental tariffs, we anticipate a lower enterprise adjusted operating profit margin in the third quarter versus the prior year. As I mentioned, the tariff headwind should be larger than the second quarter, which reflected just a partial quarter's impact. We anticipate a net cost headwind of about $400 million to $500 million in the third quarter.\nNow I'll make a few comments regarding our segment margin expectations for the third quarter. In Construction Industries, excluding the impact from the incremental tariffs, we expect a similar margin compared to the prior year with higher sales volume, but offset by unfavorable price realization. Including the net impact from incremental tariffs, we anticipate lower margins in Construction Industries versus the prior year. We expect about 55% of the third quarter tariff impact will be incurred in Construction Industries.\nIn Resource Industries, excluding the impact from incremental tariffs, we anticipate a lower margin versus the prior year, mainly due to lower price realization and higher SG&A and R&D costs. The net impact from incremental tariffs will reduce it further. We expect about 20% of the third quarter tariff impact will be incurred in Resource Industries.\nIn Energy & Transportation, excluding the impact from incremental tariffs, we anticipate slightly higher margin versus the prior year, mainly due to higher volume and favorable price realization, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs. Including the net impact from incremental tariffs, we anticipate similar margins compared to the prior year. We expect about 25% of the third quarter tariff impact will be incurred in Energy & Transportation.\nSo turning to Slide 16, let me summarize. We are increasingly optimistic about our underlying business and now anticipate slightly higher sales for the full year, including a stronger second half. Business activity and customer financial health remains strong, as do our balance sheet and liquidity positions. With the net impact from incremental tariffs, we expect to be within the bottom half of our target range for adjusted operating profit margins, and around the middle of the target range for ME&T free cash flow. We continue to execute our strategy for long-term profitable growth.\nAnd with that, we'll take your questions.",

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Will Lopes, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director. Please go ahead.\n\nWill Lopes\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to Catapult's investor conference call for our FY '25 results. I have with me Bob Cruickshank, Catapult's Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Bob and I will present our results, our strategy and outlook and then take questions from participants on the call.\nToday, I am pleased to share another strong set of results for Catapult. But before we get into the numbers, I think it's worth taking a step back to remind ourselves of what we're building and why it matters. Catapult is setting the global standard in performance technology for professional sports. Over the past 12 months, we've grown to serve more than 4,600 teams across 40 sports in over 100 countries. That is an increase of nearly 400 teams year-over-year. And these aren't just any teams. They are the elite, competing in the world's biggest stages and choosing Catapult because they know what's at stake and they demand the very best.\nThis year alone, we welcomed the Brazilian National Soccer Federation, the Saudi Pro League and the English National Rugby Union to our roster, organizations that represent the pinnacle of professional sport. Their decision to join us is not just a signal of trust, it's a signal of where the market is going. The best are choosing Catapult, and that speaks volume. It validates our product leadership, our commitment to innovation and the clarity of our long-term vision. And it gives us great confidence as we look ahead to FY '26 and beyond.\nBut before we look ahead to FY '26, let's talk about the amazing performance we've just delivered in FY '25. First, a quick note on the numbers. All figures I will reference today are reported in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise indicated. And to provide a clearer picture of our underlying performance, year-over-year growth rates are presented in constant currency to remove the noise of foreign exchange and reflect the true trajectory of our business.\nLet's begin with Slide 6. FY '26 was a milestone year for Catapult. The Rule of 40 remains our North Star, a single powerful benchmark that captures the health of our growth engine and the path to profitability. Two years ago, we were at 3%. Today, we are at 31%. That is a 28-point gain and an all-time high. That kind of progress doesn't happen by accident. It's the result of disciplined execution, sharp focus and a maturing business model, delivering consistent results.\nOur free cash flow tells a similar story. When we reported FY '24 results, we crossed a key threshold, positive free cash flow for the full year. At that time, we set ourselves a new goal to grow that figure meaningfully in FY '25, and we did exactly that. Free cash flow nearly doubled, reaching $8.6 million, up $4 million from FY '24.\nIn just 2 years, we've improved our free cash flow by more than $30 million. That's just not a financial turnaround. It is a structural shift. We are now operating well above cash flow breakeven with a stronger, more resilient financial foundation, one that enhances our capacity to scale and more importantly, to lead. It is a transformation both operationally and strategically.\nThe driver behind this performance transformation is simple, a disciplined focus on profitable growth. If we move to Slide 7, you can see our key leading indicator, annualized contract value, or ACV, grew by 18% year-over-year, reaching USD 101.2 million by the end of the year. When normalized for a onetime impact of ceasing operations in Russia during this past second half, ACV growth was even stronger at 19%. That momentum carried through the top line. Total revenue grew 19% year-over-year, reaching $117 million, a clear indication that our business is scaling with speed and consistency. And that scale is showing up where it matters most in profitability.\nOur management EBITDA margin, our key measure of operating performance, hit a record 13%, driven by a growth of $11 million year-over-year. We're not just growing, we're growing with leverage, and that's the hallmark of a SaaS business hitting its stride.\nCatapult's SaaS engine remains exceptionally strong, as you can see on Slide 8. Our ACV retention rate came in at 96%, a figure that places us alongside the most successful enterprise software companies in the world. It's a testament to the stickiness of our platform and the value it delivers season after season.\nI'm also pleased to report that ACV per Pro team, this is our core ARPU metric, rose 12% year-over-year, and that's up from 7% growth in FY '24. That kind of acceleration is the result of disciplined execution and increasing adoption of our multi-solution offerings. In fact, the number of pro teams using more than one Catapult solution or what we call multi-vertical teams grew 53% in FY '25.\nWe added nearly 300 of these teams over the past year alone. This expanding cross-sell success not only reflects growing customer trust, but it's also fueling the outstanding unit economics you see in today's results.\nSlide 9 underscores the depth of operating leverage in our model and the strength of our unit economics. At the heart of our approach to profitable growth is a focus on incremental profit margin, a metric that reveals how effective we were converting growth into value. When we exited our investment-heavy growth phase in FY '23, we set a clear target to retain at least 30% of every new dollar of revenue to profit. In FY '24, we surpassed that goal with a 43% incremental profit margin, a strong sign of momentum. But in FY '25, we took another major step forward. And this year, I am pleased to report an incremental profit margin of 65%, a record for Catapult over a 12-month period. To put it plainly, we've kept $0.65 of every new revenue dollar as profit. That's just not financial discipline. It's sustainable operating leverage at scale. And it's positioning us exceptionally well for the road ahead.\nNow before I hand it over to Bob to unpack the underlying drivers of these results, I want to take a moment to spotlight some of the innovations we've been delivering for our customers. We move to Slide 10.\nAs many of you know, we've launched several exciting new initiatives in recent months. After years of focused R&D, we announced the launch of Vector 8, a transformative leap in athlete performance monitoring and a defining moment for us at Catapult. Vector 8 brings a new level of real-time decision-making to elite sports. At its core is a next-generation wearable built with the most advanced microprocessors and inertial sensors in the industry. It is paired with the most powerful smart dock we have ever engineered, combined with a new receiver and relay network, our new system now supports up to 120 athletes across a coverage area that is 70% larger than before. This is live data at scale with a fidelity and speed the industry has never seen.\nWe're in the early stages of rollout and the initial feedback has been exceptional. The first deployments have been focused on American football, particularly during their off-season, a deliberate strategy that gives us a strong proving ground before expanding into other sports and regions. Vector 8 doesn't just move the category forward. It redefines what's possible.\nWe also launched Hub Pro, our next-generation coaching platform, designed to unify the best of Catapult's legacy and new video solutions into a single powerful experience. Built for scale and precision, Hub Pro integrates seamlessly with MatchTracker to form the most advanced video and data capture system in sport. This is more than a product release. It's a strategic step in building familiarity with Catapult's next-generation video technology, ensuring that transition from our legacy system, particularly for our American football and ice hockey clients are frictionless and future-ready.\nWith Hub Pro, coaches can tag key moments, ingest third-party data, analyze player metrics and work across multi-angle video feeds, all within a fast, intuitive environment designed to elevate how teams teach, review and adapt. We're excited to put this tool in the hands of many teams and coaches this year. It's another example of how we're relentlessly improving the experience and impact of our technology on the ground.\nJust before our FY '24 results, we had partnered with the SEC to launch Focus Live, a groundbreaking sideline video solution purpose-built for American Football game day. In its debut season, Focus Live quickly proved to be a competitive advantage, delivering SEC coaches and players a meaningful edge over non-SEC opponents. In FY '25, we are now expanding on that foundation and introducing Focus Live for practice, a new module designed specifically for training environment. For the first time, our sideline video technology integrates directly with our wearable tech, creating a unified system that links live video in real time with real-time athlete data. This is a major leap forward. It equips teams with a holistic view of performance from drills to game day and unlocks entirely new coach -- new workflows for coaching, analysis and decision-making.\nLike Hub Pro, Focus Live is yet another example of how we're turning innovation into competitive advantage. And we're focused on getting this as well on the hands of more teams in the year ahead.\nNow despite the launch of Vector 8, we continue to extend our leadership in the vertical, rolling out a steady cadence of innovation over the past 12 months. We released new AI algorithms that pushed the science forward, including advanced metabolic power measurements and sports-specific parameters tailored for basketball, rugby and tennis. These enhancements were the result of deep collaborations between our R&D teams and the evolving needs of elite athletes and coaches. We also worked closely with leagues and federations to deliver live insights in high-stake environments.\nAt UEFA, we automated matchtracker workflows for Euro 2024, making real-time performance data accessible to pundits and decision-makers during every match. In partnership with the French Rugby League, we delivered live performance data from our Vector Pro devices directly into the broadcast experience, bringing fans closer to the action and showcasing the power of data and storytelling.\nAnd we didn't stop there. As you'll see in the bottom right of the slide, we expanded Vector core product commonly used by our academy teams into more sports and added new language support across French, Spanish, Portuguese and Japanese, broadening its accessibility and reach. All of this reflects years of focused investment in R&D, and FY '25 was the year it came together. Now as we head into FY '26, we're excited to deliver these innovations into the hands of more teams, more sports and more geographies than ever before.\nIn summary, we closed FY '25 in a position of real strength. Our SaaS business continues to deliver, driving top line growth, accelerating free cash flow and converting revenue into record incremental profit margins. At the same time, our long-term investment in R&D is bearing fruit. The innovations we brought to market this year are not just advancing the industry, they're embedding Catapult more deeply into the daily workflows of the world's best teams.\nAs I said at the half year, and it's even more true today, it is an incredibly exciting time to be at Catapult. And with that, I'm going to hand it over to Bob to walk us through the financials in more detail.\n\nRobert Cruickshank\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Will, and good morning, afternoon and evening, everyone. I'll start by saying that I'm thrilled to have another great set of results to share with you all. I will begin with an overview of our key SaaS metrics before taking you through our financial performance in more detail, and then I will hand it back to Will to talk about our strategy and outlook.\nI'd like to reiterate that unless I state otherwise, all the numbers we are presenting today are actual reported numbers in U.S. dollars and that our growth rates, which compare our performance year-on-year are in constant currency, removing the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nNow starting with the drivers of some of those great numbers Will presented earlier. I'll begin by focusing on our primary metric on Slide 12, our annualized contract value, or ACV. In FY '25, we delivered 18% constant currency growth, exceeding $100 million for the first time. As Will mentioned earlier, this was a 19% constant currency growth rate when normalizing for the onetime impact of closing our Russian business in the second half. More on that in a minute. But for those of you who are interested in translating that 18% growth rate into a constant currency ACV number, it would have been $102.1 million.\nOur strong growth rate this year was driven by the performance of both core SaaS verticals, which can be seen on Slide 13. I'll start with our P&H vertical, which includes our wearables business and continues to be a reliable and predictable growth engine. It yet again delivered an excellent growth rate, growing by 18%, driven particularly by success signing League deals in soccer across EMEA and LatAm and continued growth from baseball and basketball across North America.\nNow P&H was where we felt the impact of exiting Russia as our business in that region was almost entirely in this vertical. Normalizing for this impact, our growth rate would have been 20% for P&H. We are very pleased with our P&H growth and very excited by the opportunities that our new Vector 8 device will create in FY '26 and beyond as there remains a significant addressable market in this segment.\nNow our T&C vertical, which includes our video solutions, continues to deliver on the investments we have made in our video products. In FY '25, our T&C vertical experienced 18% ACV growth. This is the highest growth rate we've generated from our video solutions in the last 6 years. Importantly, this was also off of the biggest base, which goes to show just how strong our performance has been this year. Our new video solutions continue to drive this overall growth rate, growing at an impressive 42%. This was underpinned by strong growth in American football, driven by Catapult's groundbreaking sideline video solution, Focus Live for American Football, which launched in FY '25. In addition, this growth was supported by continued expansion from new and existing customers in soccer and motorsport. As Will mentioned, with more new video products entering the market in FY '26, I'm looking forward to seeing the performance in our T&C vertical this upcoming year.\nI also wanted to flag that we're no longer breaking out different video products, legacy versus new video on this chart, albeit we have included this in the commentary at the bottom. As Will outlined earlier, our product suite has developed significantly since we purchased SBG Sports Software 4 years ago, and we've continued to progress toward a unified software platform. So given the increasing blurring of line between legacy and new video, we feel the time is right to simplify our reporting and present our video solutions as one complete vertical.\nAnd now as you can see on Slide 14, our ACV per Pro team continues to expand, primarily driven by our success in cross-selling. Average ACV per Pro team increased by 12% year-over-year, meaning that our average ACV is now approaching $27,000 per Pro team. This is excellent progress and has been delivered through a combination of cross-selling, upselling and pricing with cross-selling our new video solutions having the most significant impact.\nThe chart on the right of this slide expands on our cross-selling success. In FY '25, we experienced a 53% increase in the number of pro teams who are using products from 2 or more of our verticals. This represents fantastic progress year-over-year. And actually over a 2-year period, the number of teams taking 2 or more of our products has doubled, as you can see here. This is an ongoing validation of the investment we have been making in our new video solutions and the success of our go-to-market strategy in getting those solutions into the hands of our customers and educating them on the value proposition.Also, as I communicated at the half, but we'll mention again, we are no longer including runoff products in this chart for the simple reason that we have now end of life those products.\nOne of the core elements of our top line growth strategy is to maintain ACV retention rates above 95%. As you can see on Slide 15, we delivered an ACV retention rate of 95.7% in FY '25, the inverse of which being a rate of 4.3%. This continues to be on par with the best retention rate seen among the world's most successful enterprise software companies, even including the onetime impact of our exit from Russia. But this is not an aberration for Catapult. Since FY '21, we have now consistently reported a year-over-year retention rate greater than 95%, this is a testament to our world-class suite of products, our industry leadership position and above all, the deep and trusted relationships we have built with our customers and partners over the last 25 years. We are incredibly proud of this performance and expect to continue to deliver retention rates of this magnitude.\nAnd finally, Slide 16 provides a good overall view of the SaaS metrics we have spoken about today. These are the leading indicators of our future growth, and they continue to move in the right direction. In addition to what I've already talked about, there are 2 other numbers I'd like to call out on this slide. First is lifetime duration, which has increased from 7 years to 7.8 years, an 11% increase during a period in which we added 400 new teams. It's a great sign that even though we are signing new teams, we are building longer and longer tenure into our customer base.\nAnd the second number is our Pro team count, which increased 9% year-on-year. We now have more than 3,600 Pro teams as customers, a significant global footprint. And as a reminder, the Pro team count is different from the 4,600 total teams mentioned earlier by Will, which includes non-Pro customers.\nAnd now let's move on to our financial results. And you can see on Slide 17, the impact that our strong ACV growth and best-in-class customer retention is having on our P&L. SaaS revenue derived from our ACV balance grew another impressive 20% year-over-year. Recurring revenue, which is comprised of both SaaS revenue and revenue from our media business grew by 21% year-over-year. And like ACV, finished FY '25 above $100 million for the first time at $110 million.\nAs you can see, our media business had a very good year. We were delighted by some of the new opportunities in media this year that generated the growth rate that we saw. But I would call out that it's unclear if these opportunities will continue to present themselves over the course of FY '26. In saying that, we're feeling a bit more positive in this area than we have in the past, however.\nAnd finally, on that slide, you can see that recurring revenue as a percentage of revenue now represents 94% of our overall revenue, an increase from 92% this time last year. A disciplined approach to managing our cost base enables us to take advantage of this recurring revenue growth by improving the efficiency of our growth.\nOn Slide 18, you will see the trend of our variable costs compared to the steady growth of our revenue over the last 3 years and how these costs are declining as a percentage of revenue. Variable costs are the cost of growth, which are made up of COGS, delivery and sales and marketing expenses. These are costs that will continue to grow in absolute dollar terms as our revenue grows, while also declining as a percentage of revenue as we gain efficiencies in our business scales.\nAs you can see, we continue to make progress on this metric. While our variable costs increased $4.7 million year-over-year, they decreased as a percentage of revenue from 54% to 51%, corresponding to an improvement in the contribution margin from 46% to 49%. This improvement was driven by strong revenue growth in conjunction with driving efficiencies from our delivery and sales and marketing teams. And that means we are now only 6 percentage points away from reaching our target of 45%.\nAs we grow at scale, we continue to see our fixed costs declining as a percentage of revenue toward our target of 25%, as you can see on Slide 19, where our revenue is steadily growing on the foundation of our stable cost base. Fixed costs consist of our G&A and R&D costs, and importantly, R&D costs include costs both expensed and capitalized. These costs are increased by -- these costs increased by less than 3% in FY '25 to $43 million and combined with revenue growth, improved fixed cost as a percentage of revenue by 5 percentage points, decreasing from 42% in FY '24 to 37% in FY '25.\nFixed costs support our business at scale and are expected to rise modestly in absolute dollar terms while declining as a percentage of revenue as we continue to make progress toward our 25% target. And these concepts all come together on Slide 20, which highlights how our operating leverage is accelerating the growth in our profit margin. You can see the gap that is now opening up between our revenue and our OpEx as a percentage of revenue and the impact that is having on our profit margin at the bottom of the chart. We have now delivered $19 million of positive operating profit margin, management EBITDA in the last 2 years, and we are making great strides towards getting to our targeted 30% profit margin, delivering a 13% profit margin this past financial year. As revenue grows and our variable and fixed costs continue to approach their targets, our operating profit margin is expected to increase.\nAnd on Slide 21, you can see the significant improvement in our free cash flow position that has come about because of these increased efficiencies we're delivering on our cost base and with our top line growth. We generated $8.6 million in free cash flow in FY '25, almost doubling the free cash flow delivered in FY '24 and a $30 million turnaround from 2 years ago.\nSignificantly, growth in our free cash flow means that we have further strengthened our balance sheet. We closed the year with a debt balance of $3.5 million, which combined with $10.8 million of cash on the balance sheet now puts us in a net cash position of just over $7 million. This is a great place to be and demonstrates that we are now firmly in charge of our own destiny.\nFinally, moving to our profit and loss summary on Slide 22. We've already touched on many of these numbers, so I'll make a few observations on those that we have not. Management EBITDA, Catapult's measure of profitability, climbed to $14.8 million, an improvement of $10.6 million year-over-year. This was again driven by strong revenue growth and very little growth in our cost base as we benefited from these efficiencies I outlined earlier. Share-based payments increased by $2.3 million year-over-year. And as a reminder, that was not reflective of an increase in shareholder dilution. Rather, the cost increase is primarily due to the increases in our share price over the last year, along with changes in the accounting valuation methodology for this expense that we outlined 12 months ago.\nOn the depreciation and amortization line, in FY '25, we made the decision to reduce the useful life of [indiscernible] vests from 4 years to 2 years. This decision was based on a review of wear and tear, usage intensity and vest replacements and resulted in a $900,000 nonrecurring depreciation charge in that line you can see on the table in FY '25.\nAnd finally, interest, taxes and other improved by $1.8 million year-over-year. This was the result of a $3 million tax benefit or credit related to adjustments to our deferred tax positions as we approach profitability and partially offset by foreign exchange movements that had a negative impact in FY '25.\nIn closing, we made tremendous progress in FY '25. All our key metrics and targets continue to trend in the right direction and because of that, ensuring that Catapult's financial performance continues to go from strength to strength. The resilience we have built into our business is positioning us to continue executing on our objective of delivering strong, profitable growth and progress on the Rule of 40. With that, I will hand it back to Will to discuss our strategy and outlook further.\n\nWill Lopes\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nThanks, Bob. It's genuinely inspiring to be here today presenting our FY '25 results. The performance Bob just walked us through reflects the incredible passion, discipline and execution of our team. People who are showing up every day with a deep commitment to helping professional teams unlock the full potential of athletes through our technology. Before I continue, a brief note. Several of the next slides will be familiar, especially to those who joined us at Investor Day. I'm going to keep my remarks focused and efficient.\nLet's start with Slide 24. It speaks to the scale of the opportunity ahead. The professional sports technology market is projected to exceed $71 billion by 2030 doubling in the next 5 years. Live sport remains one of the last bastions of live entertainment, and that structural demand is translating into an unprecedented investment in our industry.\nAs many of you know, our U.S. team is based in Boston, so it didn't go unnoticed when in late March, the Celtics were sold for $6.1 billion, a record in American sports. It's a signal that investment in sport is accelerating. And as a global category leader, Catapult is uniquely positioned to ride that tailwind.\nSlide 25 should also be familiar. It illustrates how our platform strategy is delivering differentiated value. Our unified SaaS platform is built to help teams make faster, smarter decisions. It saves time, it contextualizes data and integrates seamlessly into team workflows, turning information into a competitive edge.\nOn Slide 26, you'll see the breadth of our solutions that we offer. We're not just a vendor. We're an integrated partner across every major performance and coaching workflow. No one else in this space and industry provides the same level of horizontal capability with vertical precision.\nSlide 27 highlights a foundational truth. Catapult now has built a competitive moat that's wide, deep and defensible. Our one-stop platform, our proprietary data stack, global scale and multisport intelligence is now unmatched. And we're not standing still. Our aim is to continue to widen this moat as our market continues to expand.\nSlide 28 outlines our focused go-to-market approach. We land in performance and health. We expand with our video solutions through tactics and coaching. We retain more than 95% of our customers, and we drive cost efficiencies as we move towards a 30% target profit margin.\nSlide 29 details the economics that support this journey. We've built a SaaS business designed for profitable growth at scale. Our ability to drive contribution margin through cross-sell and product innovation allows us to improve unit economics while leveraging a stable fixed cost base, yielding higher profitability as we grow.\nAnd Slide 30 brings us all back to the Rule of 40. And I believe this offers one of the clearest summaries of how we measure success, both internally and for our shareholders.\nAt the heart of this framework are 5 key drivers, each a critical in powering our ACV growth and/or our management EBITDA. Together, they shape not just our financial outcome, but the discipline behind the way we scale.\nFirst is looking at how Pro team counts grow. With more than 3,600 Pro teams today, we continue to see greenfield opportunities across leagues, regions and sports. Second, it's about ARPU or ACV per Pro team, and we're increasing that ARPU through upsell, cross-sell, pricing and product expansion, especially by converting single vertical teams into multi-vertical customers.\nNext is about retention, particularly around ACV. We're maintaining rates above 95% by consistently delivering value, service and most importantly, innovation. Next is about efficiencies around our variable cost of growth. We're scaling smart, supporting growth while driving productivity and lowering marginal delivery costs. And last but not least, it's our discipline around fixed cost. With our foundation in place, we are positioned to grow without layering in equivalent fixed overhead.\nSo now let's turn to our outlook on Slide 31. Our objective remains to deliver on our strategic priorities with a continued focus on profitable growth. For many of you, this slide will feel familiar, and that's the point. Our strategy is completely unchanged in FY '26, and we're targeting the same successful outcomes that we delivered in FY '25. So in FY '26, expect ACV growth to remain strong with low churn, continued improvement in cost margins towards our target and higher free cash flow as our business continues to scale.\nSo to summarize, FY '25 was an exceptional year. Catapult is in a position of strength, powered by a disciplined focus on profitable growth and by the kind of operating leverage that defines the very best SaaS companies. Our product engine is firing. Our unit economics are best-in-class, and we are building a platform that's just not growing, but it's compounding in value over time. And this all-in-one SaaS platform, purpose-built for sport is uniquely positioned to help the best teams perform at their peak. I'm confident in the trajectory and in the increasingly vital role we're playing in unlocking the potential of every athlete in every organization through data, science and innovation.\nI'd like to thank you all for listening, and I will now turn it back to the operator for questions.

Now, let's advance to slide three and turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Jim Umpleby.\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar\n\nThanks, Alex. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Since the beginning of the year, we have been celebrating our centennial at facilities and trade shows around the world. Earlier this month, we commemorated Caterpillar's founding on 15 April by hosting events across the company, and I had the honor of ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, surrounded by all living past CEOs of Caterpillar. It was a historic celebration. On the same day, we also announced that Joe Creed will succeed me as CEO tomorrow, 1 May. The announcement followed a multi-year succession planning process by Caterpillar's board of directors.\nI have great confidence in Joe and the rest of the executive office to lead Caterpillar going forward. It's been a great honor and privilege to serve as Chairman and CEO for the past eight years, and I look forward to my new role as Executive Chairman. Now, moving to slide four, I want to thank our global team for another quarter of solid results, which reflect the benefit of the diversity of our end markets and the disciplined execution of our strategy for long-term profitable growth. Although sales were broadly in line with our expectations when excluding the negative impact from currency, we delivered adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin above our expectations. Very strong order rates resulted in backlog growth of $5 billion, an all-time record for organic backlog growth in a quarter. The backlog increased for all segments and was led by Energy and Transportation.\nOur strong balance sheet allowed us to deploy over $4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. As you know, the current environment is dynamic, and we will discuss the potential impacts to 2025 in a moment. But to start, I'll share my perspectives about this quarter's performance. Joe will then discuss the second quarter outlook and our full-year scenarios. Finally, Andrew will provide a detailed overview of results and key assumptions looking forward. For the first quarter, sales and revenues were down 10% versus last year. The sales decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume and unfavorable price realization versus the first quarter of 2024. Lower sales volume was primarily driven by the impact from changes in dealer inventories. Total dealer inventory increased by about $100 million in the first quarter of 2025 compared to about $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2024.\nMachine sales to users were stronger than we expected in first quarter, resulting in flat machine dealer inventory versus our expectation for growth in dealer inventory during the quarter. First quarter adjusted operating profit margin was 18.3%, above our expectations primarily due to favorable manufacturing costs. We achieved quarterly adjusted profit per share of $4.25. Turning to slide five, as I mentioned earlier, sales and revenues declined 10% in first quarter to $14.2 billion. Compared to the first quarter of 2024, machine sales to users, which includes Construction Industries and Resource Industries, declined by 1% but were better than our expectations. Energy & Transportation continued to grow as sales to users increased 13%, driven primarily by power generation. Sales to users and Construction Industries were up 3% year-over-year. In North America, sales to users were slightly higher than the prior year and better than we expected.\nGrowth in sales to users for residential construction more than offset a slight decline in non-residential and lower rental fleet loading. Rental fleet loading was in line with our expectations, and dealers' rental revenue continued to grow in the quarter. Sales to users increased in the EAME, driven by better-than-expected sales to users in Africa and the Middle East. In Asia-Pacific, sales to users declined in line with our expectations. Sales to users in Latin America continued to grow and at a higher rate than anticipated. In Resource Industries, sales to users declined 10%, which was better than we expected. Mining, as well as Heavy Construction and Quarry and Aggregates, were both better than expected, primarily due to off-highway trucks placed into service sooner than anticipated. In Energy & Transportation, sales to users increased by 13%.\nPower Generation sales to users grew significantly by 58%, primarily due to demand for reciprocating engines for data center applications. Turbines and turbine-related services for Power Generation also grew. Sales to users of reciprocating engines declined in oil and gas applications due to softness in well servicing. Turbines and turbine-related services for Oil and Gas declined due to a difficult comparison versus the first quarter of 2024 and some delay in timing of deliveries in the first quarter of 2025. Transportation sales to users increased, and industrial sales to users grew slightly from a relatively low level. Moving to dealer inventory and our backlog. In total, dealer inventory increased by approximately $100 million versus the fourth quarter of 2024. Machine dealer inventory was about flat and grew less than we had anticipated due to better-than-expected machine sales to users in Construction Industries and Resource Industries.\nAs I mentioned, backlog increased versus year-end 2024 by $5 billion, or 17%, driven by strong order rates in all three of our primary segments. Our backlog of $35 billion is a record. Moving to slide six, we generated ME&T free cash flow of $200 million in Q1. The decline versus last year is primarily due to lower profit. We deployed $4.3 billion to shareholders through nearly $3.7 billion of share repurchases and about $700 million of dividends paid. We remain proud of our dividend aristocrat status as we have paid higher annual dividends for 31 consecutive years. We continue to expect to return substantially all ME&T free cash flow to shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases. Now, I'll turn it over to Joe.\n\nJoe Creed\n\nCOO, Caterpillar\n\nAll right. Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone.\nI'll start today with a discussion of our second quarter outlook and a range of scenarios for the full year before discussing our end markets. The first quarter ended with positive momentum after another quarter of better-than-expected sales to users, and record organic growth in our backlog. However, the potential impact of tariffs has increased uncertainty, and the situation remains fluid. I'll start with our expectations for the second quarter, where we have the best visibility, and then cover the full year. Based on our current view, we anticipate sales in the second quarter to be similar to prior year. Sales growth in Energy & Transportation will be offset by lower machine sales in both Resource Industries and Construction Industries, primarily driven by unfavorable price, while volume is expected to be about flat.\nWe expect lower enterprise-adjusted operating profit margins versus the prior year without the additional headwind of tariffs, primarily due to lower price realization. Additionally, for the second quartfirst quarter, the tariffs which have been announced and implemented this year are currently estimated to be a cost headwind of about $250 million to $350 million. This estimate is net of our initial mitigation efforts and cost controls, which represent limited short-term actions that we were able to implement quickly. As you would expect, we are evaluating a broad range of longer-term mitigation actions. Many of these actions require more time to implement, are more difficult to reverse, and therefore require more clarity and certainty on the long-term environment around tariffs. As I mentioned, the situation remains fluid, and we will continue to monitor it closely. Throughout our history, we've demonstrated the ability to navigate many different environments.\nI'm confident we're well-positioned to manage the impact of tariffs over time. Caterpillar is a global company, and we have manufacturing locations around the world. Our largest manufacturing base is in the United States, where we employ over 50,000 full-time employees, and we continue to be a net exporter. Caterpillar's business is resilient due to the diversity of our portfolio and the end markets we serve. Moving on to the full year, I remain cautiously optimistic based on how we finished the first quarter. As Jim mentioned, machine sales to users in the first quarter were better-than-expected, especially in Construction Industries. This is a continuation of the positive momentum we saw at the end of last year and evidence that the merchandising programs we put in place are yielding results.\nI'm also pleased with the continued growth in power generation, as well as the Q1 order intake in all three segments, which led to record organic growth in our backlog. As a result, in a pre-tariff scenario, which does not include any impact from tariffs, we would have expected full-year 2025 sales and revenues to be about flat versus 2024. This would represent a slight improvement since our outlook last quarter. In this scenario, we would also expect adjusted operating profit margins to be in the top half of the target margin range based on the corresponding level of sales and revenues. ME&T free cash flow would also be in the top half of the $5 billion to $10 billion target range.\nHowever, due to the tariff announcements and increasing economic uncertainty, we have evaluated a variety of scenarios to estimate the potential impact on our results for the remainder of the year. In the event we see negative economic growth in the second half of the year, we would expect full-year 2025 sales and revenues to only be down slightly versus 2024. This expectation is a reflection of the diversity of our end markets and the strength of our record backlog, especially for large engines and solar turbines, where we have line of sight to production for the remainder of 2025. Before considering additional mitigating actions we might take and assuming the tariffs in place today remain for the duration of 2025, we would still expect to be in the target margin range for adjusted operating profit, as well as in the ME&T free cash flow target range for the year.\nAndrew will provide more details on key assumptions for the second quarter and full year in a moment. To further support our range of scenarios, I'll now share the latest view of our end markets based on current conditions, starting with Construction Industries. As I said earlier, we are encouraged by another quarter of better-than-expected sales to users and strong order rates across many of our regions as customers are responding to the attractive rates offered through Cat Financial. In North America, overall construction spending remains at healthy levels, and infrastructure projects funded by the IIJA continue to be awarded. Sales to users in residential construction, and dealer rental revenues continue to show growth. China has shown positive momentum in the 10-ton and above excavator industry, but from a very low level of activity. In Asia-Pacific outside of China, economic conditions continue to be soft.\nIn the EMEA, weak economic conditions in Europe remain, while conditions are supportive of investment in Africa and the Middle East. Construction activity in Latin America is expected to decline moderately throughout the year. Moving on to Resource Industries, we are starting the year with strong order rates and backlog growth, particularly for large mining trucks. Rebuild activity is expected to remain healthy. Although most key commodities remain above investment thresholds, customers continue to display capital discipline. Customer product utilization remains high, and the age of the fleet remains elevated. We also continue to see growing customer acceptance of our autonomous solutions. We believe the evolving energy landscape will support increased commodity demand over time, providing further opportunities for long-term profitable growth. Finally, in Energy & Transportation, the growth in backlog was driven by robust order activity in both Oil and Gas, and Power Generation.\nDemand remains strong in power generation for both CAT reciprocating engines and Solar Turbines. Our ongoing discussions with data center customers give us confidence in our long-term outlook. We are focused on operational improvements to deliver orders today while increasing our large engine output capabilities through the previously announced multi-year capacity investment. For Oil and Gas reciprocating engines and services, we expect continuing softness in well servicing due to ongoing capital discipline by our customers, industry consolidation, and efficiency improvements in our customers' operations. We do see positive momentum, however, in gas compression. As we previously mentioned, we can leverage our large engine platforms across a variety of applications. Based on current market conditions and well servicing applications, we are able to serve additional power generation and gas compression demand while meeting customer needs.\nSolar Turbines' Oil and Gas backlog remains strong, and we continue to see healthy order and inquiry activity. Demand for products and industrial applications is expected to remain at a relatively low level, while transportation remains stable. With that, I'll turn it over to Andrew for a detailed overview of results and key assumptions looking forward.\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a summary of the first quarter and then provide more detailed comments, including some on the performance of the segments. Next, I'll discuss the balance sheet and free cash flow before concluding with comments on our current assumptions for the full year as well as our expectations for the second quarter. Beginning on slide eight, sales and revenues were $14.2 billion, a 10% decrease versus the prior year.\nAdjusted operating profit was $2.6 billion, and our adjusted operating profit margin was 18.3%, both for slightly better than we had anticipated. Profit per share was $4.20 in the Q1 compared to $5.75 in the first quarter of last year. Adjusted profit per share was $4.25 compared to $5.60 last year. Adjusted profit per share excluded restructuring costs of $0.05 in the quarter. Other income and expense was unfavorable versus the prior year by $49 million, primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency impacts. Excluding discrete items, the estimated annual effective global tax rate was 23%. The year-over-year impact from the reduction in the average number of shares outstanding, primarily due to share repurchases, resulted in a favorable impact on adjusted profit per share of approximately $0.17. Moving to slide nine, I'll discuss our top-line results for the first quarter.\nSales and revenues decreased by 10% compared to the prior year, primarily impacted by lower sales volume. Lower volume was mainly driven by the impact from changes in dealer inventories. In addition, price realization and currency were unfavorable year-over-year. Sales were broadly in line with our expectations if you exclude the impacts of currency movements, which we do not anticipate. The net sales impact of better-than-expected machine sales to users and the lower-than-anticipated machine dealer inventory was about neutral. Price realization was also about in line with our expectations. Moving to operating profit on slide 10, operating profit in the Q1 decreased by 27% to $2.6 billion. Adjusted operating profit decreased by 26% to $2.6 billion, mainly due to the profit impact of lower sales volume and unfavorable price realization. The adjusted operating profit margin was 18.3%, a 390 basis points decrease versus the prior year.\nThis was better than we had anticipated, mainly due to favorable manufacturing costs, including freight, and cost absorption impacted by higher inventory levels in the quarter. On slide 11, I'll review the performance of the segments, starting with Construction Industries. Sales decreased by 19% in first quarter to $5.2 billion, slightly below our expectations due to unfavorable price realization and currency impacts. Price realization was more unfavorable than we had anticipated, mainly due to the higher-than-expected volume of sales to users. Compared to the prior year, the 19% sales decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume and unfavorable price realization. The decrease in sales volume was mainly driven by the impact from changes in dealer inventories. By region, Construction Industries sales in North America decreased by 24%. In Latin America, sales decreased by 15%. Sales in the EAME region decreased by 13%. In Asia-Pacific, sales decreased by 12%.\nQ1 profit for Construction Industries was $1.0 billion, a 42% decrease versus the prior year. This decrease was mainly due to the profit impact of lower sales volume and unfavorable price realization. The segment's margin of 19.8% was a decrease of 770 basis points versus the prior year. The margin was slightly stronger than we had expected, mainly due to the lower-than-anticipated manufacturing costs and lower-than-expected SG&A and R&D expenses. Price realization was slightly unfavorable compared to our expectations and acted as a partial offset. Turning to Slide 12, Resource Industries sales decreased by 10% in the first quarter to $2.9 billion. Sales were slightly higher than we expected on stronger-than-anticipated sales to users, which benefited from the timing of deliveries of our highway trucks. As we compared to the prior year, the 10% sales decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume, unfavorable price realization, and currency impacts.\nLower sales to users drove the sales volume decline. First quarter profit for Resource Industries decreased by 18% versus the prior year to $599 million. This was mainly due to the profit impact of lower sales volume. The segment's margin of 20.8% was a decrease of 210 basis points versus the prior year. Margin was stronger than we had anticipated due to better-than-expected volume, price realization, and manufacturing costs. Now on slide 13, Energy & Transportation sales of $6.6 billion decreased by 2% versus the prior year. Sales were slightly below our expectations due to volume as a result of a delay in an expected delivery and unfavorable currency impacts. The sales decrease versus the prior year was mainly due to lower sales volume and unfavorable currency impacts, partially offset by favorable price realization. By application, power generation sales increased by 23%. Industrial sales decreased by 2%.\nTransportation sales were lower by 10%, and oil and gas sales decreased by 20%. first quarter profit for Energy and Transportation increased by 1% versus the prior year to $1.3 billion. The slight increase was primarily due to favorable price realization, mostly offset by the profit impact of lower sales volume and unfavorable manufacturing costs. The segment's margin of 20% was an increase of 50 basis points versus the prior year. This was slightly stronger than we had anticipated, primarily due to favorable cost absorption and price realization, possibly offset by the lower-than-expected volume. Moving to slide 14, Financial Products revenues increased by 2% versus the prior year to over $1 billion, primarily due to higher average earning assets in North America, partially offset by lower average financing rates, also in North America. Segment profit decreased by 27% to $215 million.\nThe decrease was mainly due to the absence of a favorable insurance settlement that occurred in the prior year and higher provisions for credit losses. The increase in the provision reflected the absence of a non-recurring reserve release in the prior year and a specific reserve related to a single customer that was provided in the current quarter. Our customers' financial health remained strong. Past dues were 1.58% in the quarter, down 20 basis points versus the prior year, the lowest first quarter since 2006. The allowance rate was 0.95%, remaining near historic lows. Business activity at Cat Financial remains healthy. Retail credit applications increased by 13%, and retail new business volume grew by 8% versus the prior year, with increases in all regions. This reflects the attractiveness of our sales merchandising programs.\nIn addition, used equipment inventory levels remain low, and conversion rates remain above historical averages as customers choose to buy their equipment at the end of their lease term. Moving on to slide 15, ME&T free cash flow was about $200 million in the first quarter. This was about a $1 billion decrease versus the prior year, primarily driven by lower profit. The quarter included our annual payment for 2024 short-term incentive compensation and CapEx spend of about $700 million. We continue to anticipate higher CapEx spend this year, likely to be around $2.5 billion. Moving to capital deployment, we deployed $4.3 billion to shareholders in the Q1. Nearly $3.7 billion was for share repurchases, which included a $3 billion accelerated share repurchase, or ASR, that may last for up to nine months.\nThe ASR provides us with favorable pricing, which is finally determined at an attractive discount to the volume-weighted average price, or VWAP, over the full period of the agreement. Our balance sheet remains strong. We have ample liquidity with an enterprise cash balance of $3.6 billion, in addition to $1.2 billion in slightly longer-dated liquid marketable securities to improve yields on that cash. Now on slide 16, let me start with a few comments on the full year. We are closely monitoring the evolving economic conditions. Demand signals were stronger than we had expected in the first quarter, including backlog growth across our three primary segments and stronger-than-expected sales to users, particularly in Construction Industries. These indicators boost our confidence in the resilience of the top line this year.\nAs Joe mentioned, our sales expectations would be about flat for the full year in a pre-tariff scenario, which excludes any impact from tariffs. As a reminder, this compares to our prior expectations for slightly lower full-year sales than we communicated to you a quarter ago. Also, as Joe noted, we have run a number of scenarios to estimate the full potential impact of tariffs for the remainder of the year. Our alternative scenario also assumes negative economic growth in the second half of 2025. This scenario could result in full-year 2025 sales and revenues to be only down slightly versus 2024. This result highlights the resilience of our top line, which is supported by the strength of our backlog and the diversity of our end markets. Now on to margins.\nIn a pre-tariff scenario, which assumes no impact from tariffs, we would have expected full-year margins to remain in the top half of the adjusted operating profit margin range at the expected levels of sales and revenue. We have also assessed potential cost impacts from the current tariffs for the remainder of the year before any additional mitigation actions. Given the uncertainty of what tariff rates could be and the timing of any additional mitigation actions that we may take once the situation becomes clearer, it is not possible to derive an accurate estimate of the net full-year impact of tariffs. However, in our alternative scenario, assuming the tariffs in place today remain for the duration of 2025 and without any additional mitigation actions, which is unlikely to happen, we would still expect to remain within the margin target range at the expected levels of sales and revenues.\nAlso, I want to remind you about two important points impacting our year-over-year comparatives. As we said in January, we expect the impact of negative price realization to be greater in the first and second quarters of the year. This will moderate as we move into the second half. In addition, we also do not expect a significant decrease in machine dealer inventory as we saw in the fourth quarter of 2024, and still expect dealers to hold inventories about flat for the full year. These factors help to underpin our confidence about the second half of the year. Moving on, we continue to expect restructuring costs of approximately $150 to $200 million in 2025, and our anticipated annual effective global tax rate remains at 23% for 2025, excluding discrete items. Turning to slide 17, to assist you with your modeling, I'll provide our second quarter assumptions.\nBased on what we see today, we anticipate second quarter sales will be similar to the prior year as sales growth in Energy and Transportation is offset by lower sales in Construction Industries and Resource Industries. By segment, we anticipate lower sales in Construction Industries in the second quarter versus the prior year, mainly due to lower price, the impact of which is expected to be similar to the headwind we saw in the first quarter of 2025. We expect slightly positive volume effects as partial offset. In Resource Industries in the second quarter, we expect lower sales versus the prior year, primarily due to unfavorable price realization, the impact of which is expected to be larger than we saw in the first quarter of 2025. We also expect a slight decrease in volume.\nAs I mentioned, we anticipate higher sales in energy Generation and in oil and gas driven by solar turbines. We also anticipate favorable price. Now I'll provide some color on our second quarter margin expectations. Compared to the prior year, excluding any tariff impacts, we would have expected margins to be lower than the prior year, primarily due to a net headwind from price realization and some unfavorable manufacturing costs, SG&A, and R&D increases. In addition, as Joe mentioned, tariffs will represent a net headwind of about $250 to $350 million for the quarter. I'll make a few comments regarding our segment margin expectations as well.\nIn second quarter Construction Industries, excluding any tariff impacts, we would have expected lower margins compared to the prior year, where the strong prior year margins make for a challenging comparison. The main driver of lower margins year over year is unfavorable price. While lower than the comparative quarter last year, we would have expected margins to be higher when compared to first quarter of this year. Now, taking tariffs into account, we would expect about 50% of the second quarter net tariff enterprise tariff impact of $250 to $350 million to be incurred in Construction Industries. In Resource Industries, similar to Construction Industries, a strong prior year margin sets a challenging comparison in second quarter.\nExcluding any tariff impacts, we would have expected lower margins versus the prior year, primarily due to unfavorable price, which I commented on a moment ago, and higher SG&A and R&D costs. In addition, Resource Industries would be expected to incur an additional headwind of about 25% of the net tariff costs in second quarter. In Energy & Transportation, excluding any tariff impacts, we would have expected slightly higher margins compared to the prior year, with favorable volume and price realization partially offset by manufacturing costs, SG&A, and R&D increases. For Energy & Transportation, we would be expected to incur an additional headwind of about 25% of the net tariff costs in second quarter. So, turning to slide 18, let me summarize.\nDespite the evolving environment, we would expect the range of sales will be flattish to slightly lower, and we currently expect to be comfortably within our target ranges for adjusted operating profit margins and ME&T free cash flow. Business activity and customer financial health remains resilient, while our balance sheet and liquidity positions are strong. We continue to reward our shareholders deploying $4.3 billion of cash in the quarter. We continue to execute our strategy for long-term profitable growth. And with that, we'll take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you have dialed in and would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and join the queue. Please note we are only allowing one question per analyst. Your first question comes from Michael Feniger at Bank of America.\n\nMichael Feniger\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nYep. Morning, everyone.\nThanks for having me on. Just the cost headwind of the $250 to $350 million you guys identified in Q2, just what are you evaluating in terms of the mitigation as we move through the year? Can we see pricing or cost reduction that can fully offset that as we move through the year? And is there anything you're seeing in the environment right now in terms of surcharges or price increases as we look at the competitive environment where you guys are positioned in terms of your manufacturing footprint versus maybe other OEMs and brands that might have more imports? So just kind of wondering how you're looking at that cost headwind and if we're thinking about pricing as we move to the back half as a lever to mitigate that as we move through the year. Thanks, everyone.\n\nJoe Creed\n\nCOO, Caterpillar\n\nAnd good morning, Mike. This is Joe.\nMaybe I'll take a shot at that, and others can chime in here. There's a lot to unpack in that question. As far as second quarter goes, as I mentioned in prepared remarks, we have taken a number of short-term actions, things that we would call no regrets type of actions that we can be pretty nimble with. Examples of those would be, obviously, some short-term cost reductions. We'll have a look at our overhead costs, things that would fall into the belt-tightening situation. So cutting back on travel, discretionary spending. We're able to slow some inbound shipments for certain products. Keep in mind, and many of you know this, we have three and a half months of sales of dealer inventory on the ground for most products, and in some products, we have more.\nSo by slowing down those shipments, it gives us time to see how this fluid situation plays out. And during COVID, since COVID, we've been working on making our supply chain more resilient and adding some dual sourcing where we can. That's, I would say, a fairly limited opportunity for us, but where we have the opportunity and it benefits us, we're taking advantage of that. We need to see, obviously, in this fluid situation where it shakes out. Some of the longer-term things that we would consider here require investments. They take time to implement, and they're very difficult to change or pivot from once we do that. Those types of things, like significantly moving sourcing or supply chains. We really need to see the amount of the tariff. It's going to depend on the product, the situation, where it's coming from, which market we're talking about.\nWhen we move sourcing on components, particularly critical components, it requires a lot of testing and validation to make sure it meets the Caterpillar quality and durability specs. So those take time. And so we would obviously look throughout the year at potentially deeper cost reductions. Depending on how this plays out, my preference is to protect our investments in our funding for items that we think are going to really help our future growth. And then your question on price, there's a lot of things that go into pricing. And so we need to balance that in context with the amount of tariffs that we can't offset with these other mitigating efforts, along with market conditions, our competitive position. And just sort of remind you, our focus here is dollar OPACC growth.\nThe current merchandising programs we put in place last year are yielding really positive results over the last, starting in the fourth quarter of last year, continued into the first quarter of this year. So any actions we take there, I'm not saying we won't, but we'll have to consider volume impacts with that as well. So it's a fluid situation. I think we would like to see a little more clarity. We're obviously going to take the actions that are required, but we sit in a really good position right now, being able to give you the variety of scenarios and feel comfortable we'll be in our target ranges in any of those scenarios, so. And maybe this is Jim only going to add in, is obviously it's a very dynamic situation depending on what the administration in the end decides to do around tariffs.\nAnd so there have been certain statements made by members of the administration on China, for example, that the current tariff levels are not sustainable. And so, again, we're cautiously optimistic here that there will be some trade deals struck and that the tariff impact will be lower than it is currently. So, again, as Joe mentioned, we're being cautious and prudent here, taking into account all factors that we have to keep in mind.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Rob Wertheimer at Melius Research.\n\nRob Wertheimer\n\nMachinery Analyst, Melius Research\n\nThank you. Just first off, Jim, congratulations to you and really everybody at CAT for a remarkable kind of improvement over the past several years. And Joe, congratulations to you as well. You're taking over in an interesting time. So my question is going to be on construction.\nThere's lots of cross-currents going on with kind of the dealer inventory building de minimis in contrast to a normal quarter, the price being negative despite apparently stronger sell-through, and then maybe full-year dealer inventory not declining. So there's a lot of back and forth. I wonder if you can put color around what customers and dealers are really feeling. Is there just more optimism out there than you expected? And that kind of explains most of it. You would have priced stronger if you thought it was this strong. I mean, maybe just talk about how you're managing construction, what those cross-currents are. Thank you.\n\nJoe Creed\n\nCOO, Caterpillar\n\nYeah. Thanks, Rob. I would say those metrics all sort of coincide with each other. We put the merchandising programs in place last year. They're yielding results.\nWe've had multiple quarters in a row of better than expected sales to users, frankly, better than the industry, which is a positive thing. So those are yielding good results. That caused us, remember, we entered the first quarter on what we felt like was the high side of dealer inventory. So we expected dealer inventory build in the first quarter to be lower than last year, but still have a build. And those higher sales to users caused our dealer inventory to really not have a build in CI. And then also our backlog is going up as a result. So dealers are ordering to replenish, and that will also cause our seasonal pattern to be a little bit different.\nWe probably won't have the level of burndown of dealer inventory in the second half that we saw last year, which gives us confidence in the ranges of sales that we put out there. When it comes to customer sentiment, I think it's the same as everybody. We prefer certainty, but there's cautious optimism, and that's resulted in continuing sales to users, trends, and dealer ordering. I've been personally with a number of our dealers in North America two weeks ago and then once this week with a handful of them. And what they're seeing and saying aligns with the trends and the information we've given you today. So where we sit right now, I feel like we put ourselves in a really good position to manage our way through the uncertainty.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Tami Zakaria at JPMorgan.\n\nTami Zakaria\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.\nAnd congrats, Jim, on your stellar career at Caterpillar, and congrats to Joe. Big shoes to fill, but who else better than you? So my question is on.\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar\n\nThanks, Tim.\n\nTami Zakaria\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nOf course. So my question is on the tariff impact, $250 to $350 million. I just want to understand, how should we think about this for the remainder of the year, as in the back half? Should we just annualize that number for now until this is lapped in first quarter of next year, or this is more like 1Q already had some impact, so $250 and $350 is the right range for 3Q and also 4Q.\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar\n\nYeah. So a couple of things, Tammy and Andrew. First of all, just to remind you that obviously not all the tariffs will impact for the full quarter.\nSome of it will be a little bit later, so that is not a full 100% for the full quarter. Secondly, obviously, as we've said, we have not implemented all the mitigating actions we can take. So hopefully, as time goes on, we'll keep you updated. As we go through the year, we'll be able to mitigate some of that and offset some of that tariff impact as we go through. Finally, also, obviously, as Jim indicated, let's see what the final actual range is, particularly if we do get some deals done. So some of those, for example, around about just over 50% of our tariffs actually come from China, and that obviously is the highest level. Again, if that gets moderated at some point in time, that will actually mean quite a significant reduction in the cost base for us as well.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Kyle Menges at Citigroup.\n\nKyle Menges\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citigroup\n\nThank you. I just wanted to ask a little bit more on pricing within CI and RI, particularly for the back half. I mean, it sounds like you might be exploring some mitigation on price. So, I'm just thinking, could we actually see, as we start to lap these merchandising programs, could we actually see within those segments pricing be flat to positive, just as you lap the merchandising and then also maybe do some mitigation? And then, just could you elaborate on just what you're hearing in the market from just competitors and what they're doing on price so far, especially the international ones that may be experiencing more tariff impacts?\n\nJoe Creed\n\nCOO, Caterpillar\n\nThank you. Yeah. And as I said earlier, this is Joe. What we're seeing in the market, it's obviously a competitive environment. It's going to be different by region.\nWe're happy with the merchandising programs that we put in place and the traction that's gained in better than expected sales to users and better orders for us, which will create better sales volume for us. I'm also pleased that it's not just in North America. We saw healthy activity in Africa, the Middle East, and in South America as well. So it's a competitive environment. We'll continue to watch it like we always do. And when it comes to pricing decisions, a variety of factors always go into that. And so, like I said earlier, I feel like we put ourselves in a really good position to manage our way through this. We'll monitor the situation, and then we'll make any adjustments moving forward.\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar\n\nYeah.\nAs regards the phasing of the year, so in a sort of no tariff scenario, that's basically assuming that there is no price increase in the second half of the year. So effectively, though, we start lapping the impact of the merchandising programs, which started to come through stronger in the third quarter. So there will still be some impact in the third quarter, moderating from where we are currently. And obviously, as we move into the fourth quarter, we'll get year on year about the same. As far as the alternative case, we have not assumed any price increases at this point in time because, as we said, that is not with no mitigation whatsoever. Obviously, it's going to be somewhere between the two as we go through.\nObviously, at this stage, as Joe indicated, we're not taking action until we actually get more clarity, obviously, and then we'll have to weigh those pricing decisions up against what we see from a volume perspective and our competitive situation. So all of those will be part of that equation.\n\nJoe Creed\n\nCOO, Caterpillar\n\nYeah. And I just want to be clear, a lot of that pricing commentary is around CI, which is where I think a lot of the questions are coming. I want to remind everyone, each of our segments and businesses is in a different position, and we'll make the right appropriate decision for that part of the business.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from David Raso at Evercore ISI.\n\nDavid Raso\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHi. Thank you for the time. And obviously, congrats, Joe and Jim.\n\nAlex Capper\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Caterpillar\n\nFor folks looking at the strong order growth and the skeptical comments about, \"Oh, it's just a pre-buy.\" Is it true, though, that you're saying you're not necessarily putting price increases in yet because you're waiting for the tariffs? Is it fair to say that you're not price protecting the backlog? Because I would think if I'm pre-buying, I'm locking in a price. But if I'm putting an order in knowing there is variability on the price, it's a little more reflective of legitimate demand. So are we price protecting the backlog or not? And also on the mitigation factors, right? You mentioned China is a big impact. But it appears you are moving some orders into the US that were coming from China down to Piracicaba. So I would think that's already some mitigating factor.\nSo I'm just trying to think about is that mitigating factor sort of in the guide, or is that something that you're not articulating? So I'm just trying to get a sense of the mitigating factors from the move from China to Brazil. But most importantly, are we price protecting the backlog, the orders that we got through 31 March? Thank you.\n\nJoe Creed\n\nCOO, Caterpillar\n\nYeah. Thanks, David. So this is Joe. I would say, remind you, the two scenarios we gave in the lower scenario, we talked about before any mitigating action. So we'll obviously take what actions we can, and we'll see how this situation that's very fluid plays out, and we'll continue to take the appropriate action. As to the first part of your question, I think there's a few things that I would point out there.\nI guess the specific answer to your question, in the backlog, depending on the part of the business, sometimes we have contractual arrangements in pricing if we have frame agreements or Solar long orders or certain parts of the business. But generally speaking, we have flexibility on pricing in the backlog. Specifically to your question on the potential of a pre-buy, we've seen no evidence of widespread pre-buying. Our team's been on the ground at our OEMs. As I mentioned, I've been with North American dealers two times over the last month, and we just haven't seen that. And if you think about our backlog, right, we saw growth in all three segments. Remember, E&T and RI, the majority of those orders that are in the backlog are backed by a true customer order. They're not dealer inventory stock.\nAnd even in CI, there may be a few customers, right, who will have CapEx budgets, and maybe they're trying to push them up in the year. But by and large, if you don't have work or if you're uncertain about having work in the future, you're not probably going to buy a machine to try to get ahead of any sort of pricing. So again, we don't have any evidence of that right now. And I feel like we're in a really good position with the growth in our backlog.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Jamie Cook at Truist Securities.\n\nJamie Cook\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Truist Securities\n\nHi. Good morning. And congratulations, Jim, and congratulations, Joe. I guess my question. Long period of time and looking at the margin performance of your company and down sales in an uncertain macro.\nI mean, the margins you put up this quarter and what's implied for the year is fairly impressive. You talk to your backlog and your diversity of earnings. But I guess my longer-term question for you is, obviously, you guys have your longer-term margin targets that are pegged to a certain revenue level that's there. But I'm wondering over time, and in particular, Joe, perhaps this could be the story under your leadership. Do you think the market underappreciates? Is there a story potentially for CAT where the volatility of margins over time should decrease? We look at your margin targets, I guess, the 10% to whatever, 20-some percent that over time, margins can be within a more narrow range just because of the diversity of the earnings, the Operational Execution model, the growth in services.\nI'm just wondering if there's a story there where margins can structurally move higher within a more narrow band. Thank you. No pressure.\n\nJoe Creed\n\nCOO, Caterpillar\n\nYep. No pressure. Thanks, Jamie. Thanks for setting me up there. What you say is correct, right? And this is a testament to Jim's leadership the last eight years and the strategy that we all as a team have put in place and continue to execute. We're comfortable with the margin ranges that we have out there. But when you focus on services, why services is such an important part of our strategy, our goal is to dampen some of the cyclicality. We're always going to have cycles in certain parts of the business. We are seeing some tremendous secular trends in power. So the need for power and data centers gives us we're at a record backlog, so we have a lot more line of sight.\nWe've worked really hard through the O&E model to instill discipline. So I would expect all of those things to continue. And obviously, the more we grow, the better shape we're going to be from a margin standpoint.\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar\n\nYeah. And Jamie, let me just add, obviously, the range was set based on a 2010 to 2016 timeframe. So that is obviously adjusted one year for inflation. So that's where the bottom end of the range came from. That does not necessarily mean, as we've made the business more resilient, and the diversity of our end markets, the likelihood of going back to that low end of the range is less likely. So probably the bottom end of that 10% range probably is no longer really valid unless there is some extreme economic scenario where we saw that sort of level of sales again.\nSo given everything we've done, services, and also around other segments, I think we're in a lot better position as well.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Angel Castillo at Morgan Stanley.\n\nAngel Castillo\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. And Jim, wish you all the best. Joe, congrats on the new role. Looking forward to working with you more. Maybe just a little bit of a bigger picture question with the current market backdrop and just the amount of uncertainty out there. Could you just talk about your dealers' rental businesses and maybe what you're seeing more specifically in terms of customers' kind of rent versus buy decisions?\nAnd just really from a longer-term perspective, what does this ultimately mean for your CI business as we think about the potential for growth in that rental vertical versus maybe the potential headwinds either to pricing power or volume as you think about more of a rent versus buy?\n\nJoe Creed\n\nCOO, Caterpillar",
    "content2": "Yeah. What we've seen in first quarter, I can speak to what we're seeing right now, right? I mean, dealer rental load was down a little bit. That was expected. So it was in line with what we expected. But dealer rental revenue continued to grow. So we're in a great position to take care of our customers, whether they want to rent equipment or whether they want to buy equipment. My goal is to make sure they're using CAT equipment. We haven't seen any massive change in that trend. We think rental is a great opportunity for us.\nSo we continue to lean in with our dealer network to have a great rental offering for our customers as we move forward. So I don't have anything really different to report on that front.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Stephen Volkmann at Jefferies.\n\nStephen Volkmann\n\nManaging Drector, Jefferies\n\nThank you, guys. And my congrats to everyone as well. I wanted to drill down into E&T and PowerGen specifically. There's been some concerns around sort of what the adoption curve for various data centers, etc., is going to be. It sounds like you haven't seen any real change there. But I'm curious if you can comment on that. And then also on the capacity side, are you basically kind of sold out at this point, or is there still a little bit more upside in terms of what you can get through the channel? Thank you.\n\nJoe Creed\n\nCOO, Caterpillar\n\nYeah.\nI would say in this year, we're pretty full on large engines related to the data center standpoint. As I mentioned, well servicing is down a little bit, so we could maybe get a little more Power Generation orders out because those engine platforms can move between products. We're focused on getting the capacity in. We have direct relationships with all the hyperscalers and other large data center customers. So we're in constant communication with them. And we're confident in the outlook that we have in front and the need for this capacity. Our goal is to get as much product out to them to support their schedules as we can. There's been a lot of some articles going around, but we move schedules around for customers all the time. Aside from doing things like that that we would normally do, we're not seeing any weakness in our plans there.\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar\n\nAnd maybe just to add in from the Solar Turbines side, one of the things we're quite encouraged by is that we're seeing strong order and continuing very strong inquiry activity to sell Solar Turbines-driven generator sets for prime power for data centers. You recall on our investor day a few years ago, we talked about the opportunity for distributed generation. And of course, it was a number of years ago, and none of us saw the data center opportunity coming as quickly and as significantly as it had. So we're very encouraged by, again, the orders that we've received to provide prime power for those data centers and also the very strong inquiry activity, particularly for our new larger gas turbine, the Titan 350, which is about 38,39MW.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Kristen Owen at Oppenheimer.\n\nKristen Owen\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGood morning. Thank you for the question.\nCongrats to Jim and Joe, you two both. Understanding that it is difficult to assess at this stage, as we are sort of building out our models and assessing some of those sensitivities, wondering if you can help us unpack some of the bigger moving pieces around your demand deterioration assumptions that are in the back half in your tariff scenario. Just help us understand where you could see more or less of that impact, what could potentially be an opportunity, how that's offset with your backlog, just those big moving pieces around the demand deterioration assumption. Thank you.\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar\n\nYeah. So in this scenario, obviously, we've assumed negative economic growth in the second half of the year, which I think actually exceeds what most economists are expecting, and that's globally. So obviously, the most sensitive area obviously would be CI.\nSo that would be where most of the sales deterioration would go from a segment perspective. Obviously, there would be a little bit of impact in both RI and E&T, mostly probably driven by levels of activity. But the vast majority would be within CI, would probably be the bulk of it.\n\nAlex Capper\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Caterpillar\n\nAll right, Audra, we have time for one more question. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nToday's final question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.\n\nJerry Revich\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good morning, and a pleasure to send off Jim with the last question here. Jim, congratulations on everything the team's done in tripling earnings power over the past eight years. Really well done. And Joe, congratulations. Joe, I was hoping to ask you, can you just spend a minute or two just talking about your biggest strategic priorities over the next, call it, two to three years?\nObviously, near term, we're focused on global trade flows. But taking a step back, what are the biggest opportunities that you see going forward and your strategic priorities in the big seat?\n\nJoe Creed\n\nCOO, Caterpillar\n\nYeah. Thanks, Jerry. Obviously, immediately, we're focused on taking care of our customers and executing our strategy. Maybe just as a reminder of my background, back in 2017, when Jim became CEO and put the strategy in place, I was senior vice president of corporate finance, which included running our strategy group. So I was part of the core team along with the executive office that put the strategy that we have today together. I've had the pleasure to execute that strategy over the last six months out in the E&T business. And that strategy served us well, and it's driving good results.\nIt's served us well through some challenging times and COVID and supply chain challenges, and other things. Things that we should expect to continue are focus on services. We have more work to do there to continue to grow services. It's a good thing for our customers. It's a good thing for our dealers and a good thing for us. The O&E model, I believe, is the right framework for us to look at our business and how we allocate resources to growth opportunities. That's instilled a great discipline in our business, which I think has led to the performance and contributed to the margin performance that we have. Our ultimate goal is still going to be growing OPACC dollars. That is what I believe correlates to the best shareholder return over time. Having said that, I'm comfortable with the margin framework as we talked about.\nI think the strength of our strategy is helping us there. Cash deployment priorities, I'm committed to those as well. We're a Dividend Aristocrat. We want to remain that. We'll be consistently in the market with share repurchases. But where I'm really focused is, can we accelerate our growth opportunities? And how are we going to put those resources to work and fund the greatest opportunities there? And we have opportunities in all three segments. The last 18 months, as Chief Operating Officer, I've been able to spend a lot of time with all the segments and the teams. We've mentioned, and you're all well aware of the opportunities in power generation and demand for power, both distributed generation and data centers. We're going to move a lot of natural gas, I believe. We're well positioned there. The long-term need for minerals is going to really benefit RI.\nThen the continued need for critical infrastructure around the globe. We have specific opportunities, I think, to accelerate our growth in CI in certain areas, ECP and rental. We'll continue to try to get more adoption of our technology like autonomy and digital capabilities to support our customers. There's a lot of opportunity. Over the next few months, we'll continue to look at, are there areas that we can really lean in and accelerate the growth in those opportunities while we obviously manage our way through today's environment? I have a lot of confidence in our team and the experienced executive office team members that I have. We've worked together for a really long time. We have an amazing team. We have a talented group of Caterpillar employees around the globe and a great global dealer network.\nSo I'm confident we'll be able to deliver great results moving forward. So with that, I think that was our last question. Maybe before I pass it to Jim, it's just I want to say it's an honor and true privilege to be named the next CEO of Caterpillar and lead an extraordinary company that's been building a better world for 100 years. I'm excited to work alongside our talented team and the CAT dealer network as we focus on serving our customers. I'd also like to recognize Jim for his leadership and success throughout his distinguished 45-year career, and particularly his leadership for us over the last eight years as our CEO. I've really enjoyed working closely with Jim for many years, and I look forward to his support in the future in his new role.\nSo with that, Jim, I'll turn it over to you for final remarks here.\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar\n\nWell, thank you, Joe, and thanks to everyone. We appreciate all your questions as always. I've really enjoyed working with all of you, and you've made us better. Thank you for that. As I step back and reflect on my time as CEO over the last eight years, I'm just incredibly proud of what our team's accomplished and their strong performance. Our strategy for long-term profitable growth has served us well as we focused on serving our customers, investing in the best opportunities for growth, and, of course, rewarding shareholders.

Thank you for joining us. As we close out 2024, I want to thank our global team for their strong execution in delivering another good year. Our results continue to reflect the benefit of the diversity of our end markets and the disciplined execution of our strategy for long-term profitable growth. For the year, we delivered record adjusted profit per share and higher adjusted operating profit margin that exceeded the top of our target range. Although our top line decreased in the year, services revenue grew to a record level. We also generated ME&T free cash flow near the top of the target range.\nOur robust ME&T free cash flow, along with our strong balance sheet, allowed us to deploy over $10 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends during the year. I'll begin with my perspectives about our performance in the quarter and for the full year. I'll then provide some insights about our end markets, followed by an update on our sustainability journey. For the Q4, sales and revenues were down 5% versus last year, primarily due to the lower sales volume. This was slightly below our expectations, mainly due to services growing at a slightly slower rate than we expected, and some delivery delays in energy and transportation. Services revenues did increase in the quarter compared to 2023. Stronger-than-expected machine sales to users drove a higher-than-anticipated dealer inventory reduction, which offset each other, resulting in a minimal impact to sales.\nQ4 adjusted operating profit margin was below our expectations at 18.3%, primarily due to lower volume and an unfavorable mix of products. We achieved quarterly adjusted profit per share of $5.14 and generated $3 billion of ME&T free cash flow. Since last quarter end, our backlog increased by $1.3 billion to $30 billion. For the full year, total sales and revenues were $64.8 billion, a decrease of 3% compared to 2023. Services revenues increased 4% to $24 billion. Adjusted operating profit margin of 20.7% exceeded the top end of the target range, as we expected, and represents a slight improvement from 2023. We achieved record adjusted profit per share in 2024 of $21.90, a 3% increase over 2023. In addition, we generated $9.4 billion of ME&T free cash flow, which was near the top of our target range, as we expected.\nSince 2019, we have generated approximately $40 billion of ME&T free cash flow, of which we have returned substantially all to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, including $10.3 billion in 2024. Our strong and consistent ME&T free cash flow has allowed us to reduce the average number of shares outstanding by approximately 18% since the beginning of 2019. Turning to slide four, as I mentioned earlier, sales and revenues declined 5% in the Q4 to $16.2 billion. Compared to the Q4 of 2023, machine sales to users, which includes Construction Industries and Resource Industries, declined by 3%, but was better than our expectations. Energy and Transportation continued to grow as sales to users increased 2%. Sales to users in Construction Industries were down 3% year-over-year. In North America, sales to users were slightly lower, but better than we expected.\nSales to users grew in residential construction, while non-residential was down slightly. Rental fleet loading was down but in line with expectations, as we described during our last earnings call. Dealers' rental revenue continued to grow in the quarter. Sales to users declined in EAMI and Asia Pacific, in line with our expectations. Sales to users in Latin America continued to grow but at a lower rate than we expected. In Resource Industries, sales to users declined 3%, which was better than we expected. Mining was better than expected due to large mining and off-highway trucks being placed into service earlier than we anticipated. Heavy construction and quarrying aggregates were in line with expectations. In Energy and Transportation, sales to users increased by 2%. Power generation sales to users grew 27% as conditions remained favorable for both reciprocating engines and turbines, and turbine-related services.\nSales to users for reciprocating engines used in oil and gas applications declined primarily due to a challenging comparative to the Q4 of 2023. For Solar Turbines and turbine-related services, Q4 sales were down in oil and gas compared to strong shipments in the Q4 of 2023. Most of Solar Turbines' Q4 decline in oil and gas was offset by growth in power generation. Transportation sales to users increased while industrial declined. Moving to dealer inventory and backlog. In total, dealer inventory decreased by $1.3 billion versus the Q3 of 2024. For machines, dealer inventory decreased by $1.6 billion. The decrease was more than we had anticipated due to better than expected sales to users, particularly for Construction Industries in North America, and Resource Industries. As I mentioned, backlog increased versus the Q3 to $30 billion, led by Energy and Transportation.\nThis is a $2.5 billion increase versus 2023 year-end. Our backlog remains elevated as a percentage of revenues compared to historical levels. We continue to see strong order activity for both reciprocating engines, power generation, and turbines and turbine-related services in both oil and gas, and power generation. Turning to slide five, I'll now provide full year highlights. In 2024, we generated sales and revenues of $64.8 billion, down 3% versus last year. This was due to lower sales volume, partially offset by favorable price realization. Our adjusted operating profit margin was 20.7%, a 20 basis points increase over 2023, despite lower sales and revenues. Adjusted profit per share in 2024 was $21.90. As I mentioned, services revenues increased to $24 billion in 2024, a 4% increase over 2023. Services continue to grow as we focus on making our customers successful.\nWorking with our dealers, we are leveraging over 1.5 million connected reporting assets and digital tools. Our Caterpillar Inc.-designed to allow customers to more efficiently improve uptime, manage their fleets, and transact on our e-commerce platforms. For example, this year we launched an internal generative AI solution designed to optimize the creation of intelligent leads, which we call Prioritized Service Events or PSEs. This tool significantly reduces the time and effort required for service recommendations, helping customers avoid unplanned downtime by clearly identifying the recommended repair options and timing for customers. In 2024, we delivered more than 2/3 of new equipment with a Customer Value Agreement, which remains an important part of our services growth initiatives. We also experienced better than expected growth in our e-commerce platforms and have focused on improving our customer onboarding to include key digital products.\nAlso, in 2024, we saw record usage of VisionLink, our equipment management application, onboarding and activating thousands of new customers throughout the year. Services growth remains resilient despite the decline in our overall top line. We continue to execute our various services initiatives as we strive towards our aspirational target of $28 billion in services revenues. Moving to slide six, we generated robust ME&T free cash flow of $9.4 billion for the full year. We deployed $10.3 billion to shareholders through $7.7 billion of share repurchases and $2.6 billion of dividends paid. We remain proud of our dividend aristocrat status as we have paid higher annual dividends for 31 consecutive years. We continue to expect to return substantially all ME&T free cash flow to shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases. Now, on slide seven, I'll describe our expectations moving forward.\nOverall, we currently anticipate 2025 sales and revenues to be slightly lower compared to 2024. In 2025, we expect continued strength in Energy and Transportation to mostly offset lower sales in Construction Industries and Resource Industries. We also expect services revenues to grow in 2025, including growth across all three primary segments. We currently expect machine dealer inventory to end 2025 at similar levels to year-end 2024. Full-year Adjusted operating profit margin is expected to be lower than 2024, but it is anticipated to be in the top half of the target range based on the corresponding level of sales and revenues. Finally, we expect ME&T free cash flow to be in the top half of our target range of $5 billion to 10 billion. Now, I'll discuss our outlook for key end markets, starting with Construction Industries.\nIn North America, we expect moderately lower sales to users in 2025 versus last year. Construction spend in North America remains healthy, primarily driven by large multi-year projects and government-related infrastructure investments supported by funding from the IIJA. Although we anticipate the combined non-residential and residential construction spend to remain similar to 2024 levels, our current planning assumptions reflect lower demand for new equipment. We also expect lower dealer rental fleet loading compared to 2024, although dealer revenue is expected to grow. Overall, we remain positive about the medium and longer-term outlook in North America. In Asia Pacific, outside of China, we expect soft economic conditions to continue into 2025. We anticipate China to remain at relatively low levels for the above 10-ton excavator industry. In EAMI, we anticipate weak economic conditions in Europe will continue and a healthy level of construction activity in Africa and the Middle East.\nConstruction activity in Latin America is expected to decline moderately. We also anticipate the ongoing benefit of our services initiatives will positively impact Construction Industries in 2025. Moving to Resource Industries, we anticipate lower sales to users in 2025 compared to last year, partially offset by higher services revenues, including robust rebuild activity. Customers continue to display capital discipline, although key commodities remain above investment thresholds. Customer product utilization remains high, the number of parked trucks remains relatively low, the age of the fleet remains elevated, and our autonomous solutions continue to see strong customer acceptance. We continue to believe the energy transition will support increased commodity demand over time, expanding our total addressable market and providing further opportunities for long-term profitable growth. Moving to Energy and Transportation, demand is expected to remain strong in power generation, and we expect growth for both Caterpillar reciprocating engines and Solar Turbines.\nOverall strength in power generation for both prime and backup power applications continues to be driven by increasing energy demand to support data center growth related to cloud computing and generative AI. Through continued focus on improving manufacturing efficiencies, along with initial stages of our investment to increase large engine output capacity, we expect growth in reciprocating engines for power generation in 2025. We also expect growth in Solar Turbines for power generation driven by increased customer demand. For oil and gas, after a flat year in 2024, we expect moderate growth in 2025. We expect reciprocating engines and services to be slightly down in 2025 due to continuing capital discipline by our customers, industry consolidation, and efficiency improvements in our customers' operations. Solar Turbines' oil and gas backlog remains strong, and we see continued healthy order and inquiry activity.\nWe expect growth for turbines and turbine-related services in oil and gas. Demand for products and industrial applications is expected to remain at a relatively low level, similar to 2024. In transportation, we anticipate full year growth driven by rail services. Moving to slide eight, I'll now provide an update on our sustainability journey. Caterpillar's legacy of sustainable innovation spans nearly a century. Throughout that time, we have provided products and services that improve the quality of life and the environment while helping customers fulfill society's need for infrastructure in a sustainable way. Earlier this month, Caterpillar kicked off its year-long centennial celebration at CES 2025 with the theme, \"The Next 100 Years: Experience What's Possible.\" We showcased our continuous investment in the core technologies of autonomy, alternative fuels, connectivity in digital, and electrification.\nOur ability to provide these solutions reflects investments of more than $30 billion in R&D over the past 20 years to deliver best-in-class innovation. Taking center stage at the Caterpillar CES exhibit was the Cat 972 wheel loader retrofitted to be an extended-range electrified machine hybrid technical demonstrator. The demonstrator can run fully battery electric with zero exhaust emissions for several hours. It has an onboard generator and charger that enables full-day uptime without requiring investment in direct current or DC charging infrastructure. In initial testing, the demonstrator maintains or exceeds the performance of a Cat 972 internal combustion machine while providing customers with the benefits of a hybrid system. With that, I'll turn it over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar Inc\n\nThank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a summary of the Q4 and then provide more detailed comments, including some on the performance of the segments.\nNext, I'll discuss the balance sheet and free cash flow before concluding with comments on our high-level assumptions for 2025, as well as expectations for the Q1. Beginning on slide nine, sales and revenues were $16.2 billion, a 5% decrease versus the prior year. As Jim mentioned, sales were slightly lower than we had anticipated, which together with unfavorable mix resulted in lower than expected margins for the quarter. Adjusted operating profit was $3 billion, and our adjusted operating profit margin was 18.3%. Profit per share was $5.78 in the Q4 compared to $5.28 in the Q4 of last year. Adjusted profit per share was $5.14 in the quarter, a 2% decrease compared to $5.23 last year. Adjusted profit per share excluded a discrete tax benefit of $0.46 for a tax law change related to currency translation.\nMark-to-market gains of $0.23 for the remeasurement of pension and other post-employment plans were also excluded, in addition to restructuring costs of $0.05 in the quarter. Other incoming expense was $185 million favorable versus the prior year, mostly driven by a positive currency impact related to ME&T balance sheet translation, which compared to a negative impact in the Q4 last year. As I mentioned previously, we do not anticipate currency translation movements, so the positive impact on the Q4 of 2024 helped offset the impact of operating profit being lower than expected. Excluding discrete items, the provision for income taxes in the Q4 of 2024 reflected a global annual effective tax rate of 22.2%. This was slightly lower than we had expected a quarter ago and benefited the quarter by $0.09.\nFinally, the year-over-year impact from the reduction in the average number of shares outstanding, primarily due to share repurchases, resulted in a favorable impact on adjusted profit per share of approximately $0.24 as compared to the Q4 of 2023. Moving on to slide 10, I'll discuss the top line results for the Q4. Sales and revenues decreased by 5% compared to the prior year, primarily impacted by lower sales volume. Price was unfavorable year-over-year and about in line with what we had expected. Lower volume was driven by the impact from changes in dealer inventories and a 2% year-over-year decrease in total sales to users. Total machine dealer inventory decreased by $1.6 billion in the quarter compared to $1.4 billion in the decrease in the prior year.\nThe decrease in machine dealer inventory was larger than we had expected and is mostly a function of higher than anticipated sales to users across both Construction Industries in North America and Resource Industries. Service revenues increased in the quarter compared to 2023. As I mentioned, the sales decrease in the quarter was slightly larger than we had anticipated. This was mostly due to services growing at a slightly slower rate than we had expected and some delivery delays in Energy and Transportation. Moving to operating profit on slide 11, operating profit in the Q4 decreased by 7% to $2.9 billion. Adjusted operating profit decreased by 8% to $3 billion, mainly due to the profit impact of lower than expected sales volume. As I mentioned, for the Q4, the adjusted operating profit margin was 18.3%, a 60 basis point decrease compared to the prior year.\nThis was lower than we had anticipated, mainly due to a lower than expected sales volume and the impact of unfavorable mix. On slide 12, construction industry sales decreased by 8% in the Q4 to $6 billion. This was slightly below our expectations on lower than anticipated volume. Compared to the prior year, the 8% sales decrease was primarily due to unfavorable price realization and lower sales volume. The decrease in sales volume was mainly driven by lower sales of equipment to end users and dealers reducing their inventory by slightly more than they did during the Q4 of 2023. By region, construction industry sales in North America decreased by 14%. In Latin America, sales increased by 6%. Sales in the EAMI region decreased by 1%. In Asia Pacific, sales decreased by 2%.\nQ4 profit for Construction Industries was $1.2 billion, a 24% decrease versus the prior year. This was primarily due to unfavorable price realization as a result of the impact of the post-sales merchandising programs that we discussed with you in October. The segment's margin of 19.6% was a decrease of 390 basis points versus the prior year. The margin was lower than we had anticipated, primarily impacted by lower volume, and unfavorable mix. Manufacturing costs were also unfavorable versus our expectations, principally due to a headwind from cost absorption as our inventory in Construction Industries declined. Turning to slide 13, Resource Industries sales decreased by 9% in Q4 to $3 billion. This was below our expectations, mainly due to services growing at a slightly lower rate than we had anticipated.\nAs we compared to the prior year, the 9% sales decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume, mainly driven by the impact from changes in dealer inventories. Dealer inventory decreased more in the Q4 of 2024 than it did in the Q4 of 2023. Q4 profit for Resource Industries decreased by 22% versus the prior year to $466 million. This is mainly due to the profit impact of lower sales volume. The segment's margin of 15.7% was a decrease of 280 basis points versus the prior year. This was lower than we had anticipated, primarily due to lower volume. Now on slide 14, Energy and Transportation sales of $7.6 billion were about flat versus the prior year. Sales were slightly below our expectations due to a lower than expected services growth rate, largely in oil and gas, and the timing of deliveries of international locomotives.\nCompared to the prior year, sales were roughly flat as the impact of lower sales volume was mostly offset by favorable price realization. By application, power generation sales increased by 22%. Transportation sales were lower by 1%. Oil and gas sales decreased by 14%, and industrial sales decreased by 14%. Q4 profit for Energy and Transportation increased by 3% versus the prior year to $1.5 billion. The increase was primarily due to favorable price realization, partially offset by the profit impact of lower sales volume. The segment's margin of 19.3% was an increase of 70 basis points versus the prior year. This was lower than we had anticipated, primarily due to lower than expected volume and an unfavorable mix of products.\nMoving to slide 15, financial products revenues increased by 4% versus the prior year to about $1 billion, primarily due to higher average earning assets in North America and higher average financing rates across all regions except North America. Segment profit decreased by 29% to $166 million. This was mainly due to an unfavorable impact from equity securities, in addition to lower margin and a higher provision for credit losses. Our customers' financial health remained strong. Past dues were 1.56% in the quarter, down 23 basis points versus the prior year, and our lowest level since 2005. The allowance rate was 0.91%, remaining near historic lows. Business activity at Cat Financial remains healthy. Retail credit applications increased, and our retail new business volume grew by 3% versus the prior year. This was our highest level since 2012, supported by attractive finance packages for customers choosing to buy Caterpillar equipment.\nWe continue to see proportionally more of our sales financed through Cat Financial. In addition, demand for used equipment remains healthy, and inventories remain at low levels. Conversion rates are above historical averages as customers choose to buy equipment at the end of their lease term. Moving on to slide 16, we continue to generate strong ME&T free cash flow. The $9.4 billion in 2024 was near the top end of our target range and just slightly lower than the prior year, despite a larger payment for short-term incentive compensation and higher capital expenditure. CapEx for the year was about $2 billion, which was in line with our expectations. Moving to capital deployment, in 2024, we returned $10.3 billion to shareholders through repurchased stock and dividends. On share repurchases, we deployed $7.7 billion as we continue to fulfill our objective to be in the market on a more consistent basis.\nOur balance sheet remains strong with an enterprise cash balance of $6.9 billion. In addition, we hold $2 billion in slightly longer-dated liquid marketable securities to improve yields on that cash. Now on slide 17, let me start with a high-level overview of our expectations for the full year. We expect a slight decrease in sales for 2025, with an unfavorable impact from both volume and price. Due to the impact of post-sales merchandising programs, price realization should account for about a 1% decrease in sales for the full year. On margins, the impact of price, together with higher depreciation costs due to the investments we are making, should result in adjusted operating profit margins being in the top half of the target range of the expected level of sales, rather than being above the top end of the range as occurred in 2024.\nOur margin targets are progressive, so while we would expect volume to have an impact on absolute margins, our target is adjusted for lower sales. We expect a slight headwind in other income and expense in 2025, primarily due to lower interest income, mostly due to lower interest rates, as well as the absence of the positive currency benefit from ME&T balance sheet translation that occurred in 2024. As I mentioned, we do not anticipate translation movements in our expectations. We expect restructuring costs of approximately $150 million to $200 million in 2025. We anticipate a global annual effective tax rate of 23% for 2025, excluding discrete items. While the impact of the share buyback should be positive, we expect to have less ME&T free cash flow to deploy in 2025. This implies a less favorable impact of profit per share in 2025 as compared to 2024.\nBy segment, lower sales in Construction Industries and Resource Industries will be partially offset by sales growth in Energy and Transportation. For Construction Industries, we expect lower sales in 2025 based on the outlook Jim described and unfavorable price realization. In Resource Industries, we anticipate slightly lower sales versus 2024, driven by unfavorable price realization and slightly lower volume. Higher volumes and favorable price in Energy and Transportation should drive sales growth, though sales remain constrained until the benefits of the investments we are making in large engines begin to flow through beyond 2025. We also anticipate another year of services growth in each of our primary segments. Currently, we do not anticipate a significant change in dealer inventory machines by the end of 2025. Moving on to ME&T free cash flow, we expect to be in the top half of our target range of $5 to $10 billion.\nThe Q1 of 2025 will be impacted by a $1.4 billion cash outflow related to the payout of last year's incentive compensation. We anticipate CapEx of about $2.5 billion in 2025 as we continue to make disciplined investments that are right for our business, governed by a focus on growing absolute OPACC dollars. This includes the multi-year capital investment to expand our large engine volume output capability that we mentioned last year. Turning to slide 18, to assist with your modeling, I'll provide some color on the Q1. Starting with the top line, we expect lower sales versus the prior year. For perspective, in a typical year, we see our lower sales in the Q1 of the year.\nIn 2025, we anticipate that trend to continue, but be more pronounced as sales in the Q1 should account for a lower percentage of full-year sales than is typical, by about 100 basis points. This decrease is mainly due to our expectations for dealer inventory movements and price, which primarily impacts machines. Energy and Transportation is expected to show normal seasonality, with sales growing throughout the year. Let me explain. Although dealers did reduce machine inventory significantly in the Q4, they remain around the top end of the range as we enter 2025. This compares with dealer inventories in Construction Industries being towards the middle of the range at the beginning of 2024. As a result, we expect them to build correspondingly less machine inventory during the Q1 than the $1.1 billion that they built in the Q1 of 2024.\nAs we expect machine dealer inventory to be about flat by year-end, we should see a tailwind to sales in the Q4 as we don't expect a similar machine dealer inventory change as we have seen in the last two years. We also expect unfavorable price realization for machines in the Q1 due to the impact of post-sales merchandising programs. We would expect these price impacts to be greater for machines in the first half of the year as the noticeable impact of post-sales merchandising programs started in the Q3 of 2024, making for an easier comparison in the second half.\nSo, to pull together the impact by segment, we anticipate lower sales in Construction Industries in Q1 impacted by lower sales to users, the headwind from changes in dealer inventory, and price, the impact of which should be similar to what we saw in Q4 2024. In Resource Industries in Q1, we expect lower sales volume versus the prior year, impacted by lower volume and unfavorable price realization. In Energy and Transportation, we anticipate similar sales in Q1 versus the prior year as continued strength in power generation is about offset by lower oil and gas and transportation sales. Price should be positive for Energy and Transportation. Now I'll provide some color on Q1 margin expectations.\nThough enterprise margins are typically stronger in Q1 compared to the remaining quarters of the year, we do not expect the seasonal trend to occur in 2025. Compared to the prior year, we anticipate a lower enterprise adjusted operating profit margin in Q1 due primarily to lower than usual volume and price. Volume is impacted by the lower build of machine dealer inventory and slightly lower sales to users for machines. Unfavorable price realization for machines is principally due to the factors I've discussed previously, which will be partially offset by favorable price in Energy and Transportation. We expect there will be improvement in Q1 margins, offsetting the volume impact in Q1 due to stronger volume in Q4 than is typical.\nBy segment in Q1 in Construction Industries, we anticipate lower margins compared to the prior year due primarily to lower volume and price. We do not expect to see the margin benefit we typically see in Q1 of the year as compared to Q4 of the prior year, which is generally in the range of 100 to 200 basis points. Again, some of this will be offset in Q4 as volume is favorable and price more neutral. In Resource Industries, we anticipate lower margin in Q1 compared to the prior year, mainly due to lower volume and unfavorable price realization. In Energy and Transportation, we expect slightly lower margin versus the prior year as favorable price realization is more than offset by higher manufacturing costs and unfavorable mix impacts.\nAgain, as a reminder, this detail is provided to help you model Q1 and does not impact our expectations for the full year that I set out earlier, which is a slight decrease in sales and revenues for the year, and margins in the top half of the target range. So, turning to slide 19, let me summarize. Adjusted profit per share of $21.90 exceeded last year's record by 3%. This was our third straight year with record adjusted profit per share. Adjusted operating profit margin of 20.7% exceeded the top of our target range. ME&T free cash flow of $9.4 billion was near the top of the target range of $5 to $10 billion.\nFor 2025, while we expect a slight drop in sales, we expect to be in the top half of the adjusted operating profit margin range and the top half of the ME&T free cash flow target range, and we anticipate another year of services growth. We continue to execute our strategy for long-term profitable growth. And with that, we'll take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you have dialed in and would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and join the queue. If you would like to withdraw your question, simply press star one again. Please note we are only allowing one question per analyst. Your first question comes from the line of Stephen Volkman with Jefferies.\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar Inc\n\nHi, Steve.\n\nStephen Volkmann\n\nEquity Analyst, Jefferies\n\nHello. Good morning. Good morning, everybody. I guess I'll dive in if I could since it's timely. Just, Jim, how are you seeing the data center business now? There's obviously some concern about what that's going to look like longer term. I know you're adding some capacity. Can you just discuss any changes in your view relative to data center demand?\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar Inc\n\nYeah, we continue to see strong demand for both our reciprocating engines and our gas turbines. Just in conversations with customers, it's really all about how quickly can you increase capacity for your reciprocating engines and how quickly can you get us large gas turbines. So we're very encouraged about what we see happening in the marketplace. Many customers are planning orders with us over multiple years to ensure that we can meet their needs.\nAs a reminder, we said that with the investments we're making in our large reciprocating engines, we're expanding capacity by about 125% over 2023. That'll happen over the next several years. With Solar Turbines, we have a new product, the TITAN 350. We're very encouraged by the acceptance in the market that we're seeing for that product. Of course, a lot of it is being driven by data centers. So again, still very, very positive from our perspective.\n\nStephen Volkmann\n\nEquity Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Michael Fenninger at Bank of America.\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar Inc\n\nHi, Michael.\n\nMichael Fenninger\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nHi. Morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just for dealers, just to see the inventory, I think in 2023, machines built $700 million for the full year. 2024, inventory is down $700 million. I know you guys are thinking North America construction and user is down a little bit on 2025.\nSo how do you kind of get comfortable with where those dealer inventories are going to stay the same on the machine side? And did anything change post-election in terms of the views around the inventories? Because I think there were some comments that the sales to users were a little bit better than expected in terms of how it's informing your view on 2025. Thanks, everyone.\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar Inc\n\nYeah. So as you correctly point out, we did see a dealer inventory build for machines in 2023. Most of that actually was in Resource Industries rather than Construction Industries. And in fact, most of the decline this year, year-over-year, actually is in Resource Industries rather than Construction Industries. So that's part of the balance. As we know, with Resource Industries, a lot of that is around timing of commissioning.\nWe did see better than we expected commissioning in Q4, which will have some impact on Q1 2025. But that was a positive, as actually dealers were able to deliver more machines to customers, particularly on the RI side. Overall, on the CI side, based on our conversations, obviously we engage in conversations with dealers. Dealers are independent businesses. They determine what level of inventory they hold. They base that on their expectations for the outlook for the markets. Obviously, our expectation based on what we're seeing today is, as you know, that not all of our markets are exactly in sync, as we think about from a CI perspective. Based on our conversations, we don't expect a material reduction in dealer inventory as we go through the year.\nYes, we did see STUs were slightly better in North America than we expected in Q4. That is probably one of the first times we've actually seen that trend and maybe some benefit from some of our post-sales merchandising programs. But we're not calling that for 2025 yet. We still think that's somewhere where we need a lot of work still to be seen to make sure that we're actually seeing that continue to flow through.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Rob Wertheimer at Melius Research.\n\nRob Wertheimer\n\nDirector of Research, Melius Research\n\nHi. Good morning. Thank you. Hey. So my question is on, you have a large and diverse oil and gas business. I'm wondering if you could characterize, especially if you will, on gas compression, kind of where you think you are on the cycle. Obviously, we've had Europe, we've had Russia, and we've had lots of different demand shifting around. And there may be other growth areas, packer, motor, etc. I just wonder if you could give a little bit of an outlook on oil and gas. Thank you.\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar Inc\n\nYeah, certainly. We are expecting moderate growth in 2025 for oil and gas in total. For Recip, we expect engine services to be slightly down for the year, really driven by gas compression and well servicing. We did see some order pickup in recent gas compression in late 2024. On the Solar Turbines side, very healthy backlog, healthy order intake, and inquiry activity. We do expect growth in oil and gas in the year. We are seeing, to your specific question about gas compression, Solar Turbines does have a lot of activity around gas transmission, gas compression, particularly in the United States. So many pipeline customers are adding compression to existing pipelines.\nSo again, that business is quite strong and a lot of quotation activity as well.\n\nRob Wertheimer\n\nDirector of Research, Melius Research\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to David Raso at Evercore ISI.\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar Inc\n\nHi, David.\n\nDavid Raso\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHi. Thank you for being here. Hi. Hi, everybody. Thanks for the time. Curious, obviously trying to think about margins for '25 for the segments. And I was a little surprised by price cost being negative, right? The manufacturing cost had been a positive year-over-year. All of a sudden, the comp gets harder, right? That's why the Q4 wasn't going to be as easy. But to see the cost up, I noticed you called out E&T, but does that imply CI and RI manufacturing costs were still a benefit year-over-year and all the cost is in E&T?\nAnd maybe if you can just provide that kind of framework from the Q4 to how to think about full year 2025 price cost.\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar Inc\n\nYeah. David, if you recall actually my comments, I did call out within CI a negative absorption in the Q4 as we did reduce CI inventory. So manufacturing costs were also negative in CI. In E&T, most of that was a function actually of putting more labor in the factories to get more machines out the door or more engines out the door at the end of the year. And that obviously reflects the demand we're seeing. And obviously, remember that we are still trying to build up capacity, particularly on the large engine sides. And that really is what's driving that in particular. On material costs, our expectations are that material costs will decline in 2025.\nHowever, there are some offsets within manufacturing costs which go the other way. Some of that relates to volume and absorption as a result of that, which means that we don't get the cost-price benefit offset that we've had in previous years. So most of that is the reason and the rationale by segment for that. So yes, material costs will be favorable, but manufacturing costs will be broadly in line with our expectations. Remember, also other things come in, mix and so forth as well. And finally, just one thing to remember, the depreciation I called out, actually most of that is within manufacturing costs as well.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Jerry Revich at Goldman Sachs.\n\nJerry Revich\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYes, hi. Good morning, everyone.\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar Inc\n\nMorning, Jerry.\n\nJerry Revich\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, Jim. Andrew, I'm wondering if you could just talk about your Solar Turbines lead times and how are you thinking about potentially adding additional roofline capacity for turbines specifically? We're hearing optimism on the TITAN 350 from the customer base, and assuming what we saw earlier this week is a blip on the radar. I'm just wondering, how are you thinking about capacity for that range of products?\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar Inc\n\nYeah. As I mentioned earlier, we're seeing strong backlog and strong inquiry and order activity for Solar Turbines for both power generation and gas compression. We can increase capacity without building new factories since you use the roofline. You mentioned the roofline in your question. So certainly, there are things that we can do within our facilities. One is just increasingly manufacturing.\nYou can do things like add an additional test cell to an existing facility, maybe add an engine build pit, things like that. One of the big issues, of course, is working with suppliers to ensure that we get enough components from suppliers. And of course, just given the strength of the business, there's a lot of companies out there working with those same suppliers. So that can be a bit of a limiting factor. But in terms of actual investments required to increase capacity based on what we see coming, we don't see a need to build a brand new facility or anything like that.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Chad Dillard at Bernstein.\n\nChad Dillard\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question.\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar Inc\n\nHi, Chad.\n\nChad Dillard\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nSo my question's on, hey, how are you? So my question's on the 2025 operating profit guide.\nSo you're guiding to the top end of the range for a given level of revenue for the full year. You've been guiding that way, I think, for the last year, and actually, I've been hitting it. So I guess what would give you what do you think would drive you to bring that guide back to the midpoint? Is it price-cost normalizing? And in that same vein, I guess how are you thinking about the evolution of price-cost through 2025? I guess when does that pressure peak and comps get easier?\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar Inc\n\nAnd maybe I'll start, then I'll kick it over to Andrew. Firstly, I believe what we said is we expect to be in that top half of the range for margins for 2025.\nOf course, our key measure here for our team is to grow absolute OPACC dollars because we believe that most closely aligns with TSR over time. Of course, OPACC being operating profit after capital charge. So getting a return on the capital that we invest. So again, a reminder, what we expect for 2025 is being the top half of the range. With that, I'll turn it over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar Inc\n\nYeah. So on the price realization point, this really is relating to the post-sales merchandising programs we discussed a little bit in the Q3. Remind you just that, as I explained in the Q3, that will take about a year to flow through.\nThat relates to the fact that obviously, in a world where demand is normalizing and supply is less constrained, obviously, we have merchandising programs to offer customers, particularly things like buying down interest rates. As we said before, that's also an attractive option for us because obviously, we get some margin benefit from that within Cat Financial over the term of the financing deal. What that does mean, though, is as you saw from the Cat Financial numbers, new business volume is very high. Actually, their share is up. So effectively, over time, we'll recover a little bit through Cat Financial, but we will have some margin pressure in the short term from those as those programs normalize. That mostly impacts machines, mostly impacts the Q1 and Q2, first half of the year. Once we get past Q3, we'll be past that.\nActually, then return probably much more to the normal evolution of price and cost, which obviously we always try and work to make sure we can offset the two.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Jamie Cook at Truist Securities.\n\nJamie Cook\n\nManaging Director, Truist Securities\n\nHi, good morning. My question relates to E&T. Hi, how are you? My question relates to E&T. I guess first, you called out sort of delays in shipments, I think, in the Q4. Can you just give us color on that, how big that was, and when that hits in terms of 2025? And then I was also surprised just your top line growth wasn't better in 2024. So how do we think about top line growth in 2025 and the incremental capacity coming online and how that helps your top line?\nJust any color there, and how much your, I guess, top line in E&T was constrained in 2025 because of lack of capacity. Thank you.\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar Inc\n\nI'll answer the second part of the question first, and I'll kick it to Andrew for the first part. So as we've mentioned, we're making that investment to increase our capacity and larger certificated engines by 125%. That takes some time. I think we talked about a four-year period to increase that capacity. So it does take time. So we did not expect that to be complete and to have an impact on 2024. And that's the case. So we could, in fact, ship more if we could build more, but we're working hard to increase that capacity.\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar Inc\n\nYeah. And as regards the Q4, most of the impacts, as I indicated in my comments, was relating to services, particularly in oil and gas. That we'll need to see how that pans out as we go through the Q1. With regards to the OE side, most of that was international locomotives, and that should hit early in the first half of 2025. And overall, just to remind you, we do expect E&T sales growth in 2025.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Mig Dobre at Baird.\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar Inc\n\nHi, Mig.\n\nMig Dobre\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nThank you. Good morning. Good morning, Andrew. Just a very quick clarification on your comments for CI. At least as I heard it, as I understood it, the relative pressure that we've seen in Q1 might be associated with the segment. So can you give us a sense for how you see this segment revenue and margin progressing sequentially, so relative to what you had in the Q4? Thank you.\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar Inc\n\nYeah. So obviously, normally what you would see in CI is a Q1 benefit on sales and revenues, mainly due to dealer inventory builds. Last couple of years, that's been around $1 billion. We expect that to be significantly less in Q1 of this year. Correspondingly, we've actually seen quite a significant dealer inventory reduction in Q4. That will be a little bit less. So this is really just a non-operating. Actually, as we look at underlying sales to users, they will be pretty much aligned throughout the whole of the year and will be down slightly for the full year. So that is the sort of underlying characteristics on the top line. The other overlay is really around price. Price will impact H1. Impact on price, if you saw in the Q4 for CI, was around $300 million.\nThat will be the impact in the, we estimate, impact on the Q1. Obviously, as we go through the rest of the year, and particularly in the second half, the comps become easier, and that will actually neutralize as we get into the second half. So it's really just overall, just really a timing issue relating to dealer inventory mostly, and the timing of price. When you take those two things out, effectively, sales to users should actually be broadly much the same first half, second half. There is no demand change we're expecting as we go through the year.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll move to Tami Zakaria at J.P. Morgan.\n\nTami Zakaria\n\nHead of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks. Hi, how are you? So the order growth in the Q4, I'm curious, how did construction and resources orders do sequentially in the quarter versus the Q3? It seems like E&T was strong, but would love any directional commentary on the other two segments if you're able to provide.\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar Inc\n\nYeah. So Tami, overall, as E&T was the major driver, we did see some improvement in orders in resource industries, particularly related to some large contracts that we've announced previously. And then in CI, it was broadly flat for the quarter, year-over-year.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Tim Thein at Raymond James.\n\nTim Thein\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Raymond James\n\nThank you. Good morning. Maybe, Andrew, just back to, you had mentioned within the commentary around CI, the issue of inventory absorption or the headwind from it. As you think about just CAT more broadly, should we in an environment where the top line is slightly lower, should we think about that as a headwind more broadly for CAT as a whole in 2025, just given where inventory levels are for the company?\nIs that something we should be factoring in in terms of that discussion around material costs, or is it less of a headwind as you kind of think about the margin outlook? Thank you.",
    "content2": "Andrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar Inc\n\nYeah. Yeah, Tim, thanks. I think as I tried to indicate to David, there are other factors within manufacturing costs which go the other way. Absorption will be one of them slightly going against, obviously, because our intention would be effectively to reduce volume next year, which will impact our rate of absorption and potentially inventory as well. Inventory is a little bit of a more difficult subject. Just to remind you, we are a very large complex company. We have hundreds of products that we hold inventory for, and not all of those products have exactly the same lead time.\nSome of the longer lead time projects are where we have strongest at the moment, things like solar and also large engines. So some of those may actually continue to build inventory where we may see some inventory trimming within CI, for example, with slightly lower volumes and also RI as we go through the year. So it's going to be a little bit of a mixed bag, but there may be some impact on absorption that was built into the fact that obviously we're not going to see a favorability from material costs coming through manufacturing costs added to the depreciation I talked about a moment ago as well.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Angel Castillo at Morgan Stanley.\n\nAngel Castillo\n\nHead of US Machinery and Construction Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Hi, how's it going?\nJust wanted to maybe go into the competitive environment a little bit more as you think about Q1 continuing to see some of the flow through of the merchandising programs that you mentioned. I guess as we evolve into the second half, I get the comps getting easier. I guess maybe what gives you confidence, though, that the pricing and competitive environment doesn't worsen? And maybe if you could overlay on that, just any views on kind of Trump policies and implications on kind of construction activity in the US and how you kind of see that impacting demand overall.\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar Inc\n\nYeah. So on the merchandising programs, some of that is actually within our control. It's not just, but obviously, our focus is actually growing absolute OPACC dollars, remind you. So we don't necessarily focus on margin per product, but obviously, we'll take that into account.\nPricing takes into account the value we provide customers and a lot of other things. Obviously, this is relating to the price we're talking about, which is relating to the merchandising programs, and we don't expect those to change much from where we have them today. In fact, actually, in a lower interest rate environment, actually, they will become less of the total. So may actually be the opposite if interest rates do start to fall as we go through the year based on that being buying down of interest rates.\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar Inc\n\nYeah. Just in terms of the administration, certainly, if the push for deregulation and other kinds of changes from a regulatory perspective helps increase economic growth, particularly in the United States, that should be a positive again. But we'll have to see how that all plays out, but that certainly has the potential to be positive for us.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll move to Kristen Owen at Oppenheimer.\n\nKristen Owen\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGood morning. Thank you for the question. I wanted to come back to sort of the margin target guidance coming in at the upper half of the range. You did make some adjustments to that margin target when we were at the height of the supply chain dislocation. Just given the strong performance since then, the outlook, even inclusive of that negative price impact, I'm wondering how we should think about this range. Is it still valid, or should we be actually thinking about an upward shift in that range over time? Thank you.\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar Inc\n\nYeah. Again, as we think about 2025, we're talking about being in the top half of that range. So certainly for this year, we're not anticipating changing it.\nAnd again, just as a reminder, as I mentioned earlier, our driver here is really absolute OPACC dollars because that most closely, we believe, corresponds to increased TSR over time. And so what we try to do is give investors that guide to give you a sense of where we'll be. We make various investments to grow our business profitably. And for 2025, we said we'd be in the top half of the range. And as we always do, a year from now, we'll reassess and let you know what we think for 2026.\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar Inc\n\nYeah. And Kristen, just the other point to always remember is our margin targets are very progressive at the top end of the range. Margins have to effectively the margin is around about 40% at the top end of that target range, which is well above our average gross margin for our products across the whole.\nSo it does require a lot of operating leverage. So that is one of the reasons, again, why we took into account the fact that while performance has been strong, we're back in the range now, and we still think that actually is a valid range for us to work with.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Steven Fisher at UBS.\n\nSteven Fisher\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThanks. Good morning. I know it's still very early to really understand exactly all of the policies coming out of the administration. But wanted to ask a little bit about tariffs if it hasn't been asked already. And curious about how you're thinking about contingency plans and strategies for managing tariffs on the products that you import from China into the US. I know generally have a strategy of producing for local, but I think there's maybe some products coming in from China.\nJust curious how you think about the contingency plans and strategies for that. Thank you.\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar Inc\n\nYes. I'll give that a shot. So certainly, it's going to take time to see how this plays out. Certainly, a lot of discussions going on around tariffs, and we'll have to see what actually gets put into place in the end. We are a global manufacturer, but our largest manufacturing presence is in the United States, and we are a net exporter outside of the US. And that positions us pretty well versus many other companies out there. Having said that, as you say, we do tend to try to produce in region for region, but yes, some products and components, particularly, move around. But as you can imagine, something we keep a close eye on, and we'll deal with it.\nWe've been around 100 years, and we've seen many different administrations with different attitudes on these issues, and we'll deal with it. But again, the fact that we have such a large US manufacturing presence, I think, positions us pretty well.\n\nAlex Kapper\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Caterpillar Inc\n\nAudra, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nToday's final question comes from the line of Kyle Menges from Citi.\n\nKyle Menges\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nThanks for taking the question. I was hoping if you could provide a little bit more color on what you're seeing in RI. You talked about some order improvement in Q4. Just how are customer conversations progressing in orders so far in Q1? And maybe just talk a little bit about some of the pricing actions you're taking in RI. I think you said it would be negative in Q1, so I would just love to hear some color on those items. Thanks.\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar Inc\n\nYep. Certainly, as I mentioned earlier, our customers continue to display capital discipline, but we are encouraged by the fact that the key commodities that our products help our customers produce remain above investment thresholds. Kind of some of the things we look at to get a gauge of what's happening in the industry. We look at product utilization, how the hours that are being put in our machines, and those are high. The number of parked trucks is relatively low. The age of the fleet is relatively elevated as well. Again, we're continuing to invest in our autonomous solutions, and we continue to see strong customer acceptance of that. If you stop and think about some of the things that are happening, we talked about data center buildouts and all the rest.\nI mean, again, you think about commodities like copper, that should be a positive for that over time. Having said that, again, customers are displaying capital discipline in terms of price.\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar Inc\n\nPrice. We do expect some marginally negative impacts in Q1, as we said, and that would be mostly due to the fact that obviously we are also putting merchandising programs, particularly where we think about things like heavy construction, quarry, and aggregates, are the major areas that will be affected there.\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar Inc\n\nOkay. Great. Well, I just want to thank everyone again for joining us. We always appreciate your questions. I'd like to once again thank our team for their strong performance in 2024, delivering record adjusted profit per share and strong ME&T free cash flow.\nWe've been around 100 years, and so as we kick off our centennial year this year, we certainly remain committed to serving our customers. We'll continue to execute our strategy and invest for long-term profitable growth. With that, I'll turn it over to Alex.\n\nAlex Kapper\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Caterpillar Inc\n\nThank you, Jim, Andrew, and everyone who joined us today. The replay of our call will be available online later this morning. We'll also post a transcript on our investor relations website as soon as it's available. You'll also find a Q4 results video with our CFO and a SEC filing with our sales to users data. Click on investors.caterpillar.com, and then click on financials to view those materials. Finally, I'd like to thank Ryan for his support through our transition, and I wish him the best as he moves on to another role in Caterpillar.\nIf you have any questions, please reach out to me or Rob Rengel. The investor relations general phone number is 309-675-4549. Now, let's turn it back to Audra to conclude our call.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes today's call. Thank you for joining.

James Umpleby\n\nChief Executive Officer, Caterpillar, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ryan. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'd like to start by thanking our global team for delivering another strong quarter, including higher adjusted operating profit margin record adjusted profit per share and strong ME&T free cash flow. Our strong balance sheet and ME&T free cash flow allowed us to deploy a record $5.1 billion of cash for share repurchases and dividends in the first quarter. Our results reflect a continuation of healthy demand for our products and services across most of our end markets. We remain focused on executing our strategy and continuing to invest for long-term profitable growth. I'll begin with my perspectives about our performance in the quarter. I'll then provide some insights about our end markets, followed by an update on our sustainability journey.\nIt was another strong quarter. Sales and revenues were about flat in the quarter versus last year, broadly in line with our expectations. Services revenues increased in the quarter. Our adjusted operating profit increased by 5% to $3.5 billion. Adjusted operating profit margin was slightly better than we expected and improved to 22.2%, up 110 basis points versus last year. We achieved record adjusted profit per share of $5.60, up 14%. We also generated strong ME&T free cash flow in the quarter of $1.3 billion. In addition, our backlog increased to $27.9 billion, up $400 million versus the fourth quarter of 2023.\nWe continue to expect 2024 sales and revenues to be broadly similar to the record 2023 level. We have revised our full year 2024 segment expectations to reflect a slightly stronger top line in Energy & Transportation, offset by softening in the European market for Construction Industries. We anticipate services to be higher in 2024 as we strive to achieve our 2026 target of $28 billion. For the year, we continue to expect adjusted operating profit margin in ME&T free cash flow to be in the top half of our target ranges. Turning to Slide 4.\nIn the first quarter of 2024, sales and revenues remained about flat at $15.8 billion. Compared to our expectations, sales volume was slightly lower, while price realization, including geographic mix, was better than we anticipated. Compared to the first quarter of 2023, overall sales to users decreased 5%. This was slightly lower than we expected, mainly due to weakness in Europe for Construction Industries. Energy & Transportation continued to show strength where sales to users increased 9%. For machines, which includes Construction Industries and Resource Industries, sales to users declined by 9%.\nFocusing on Construction Industries sales to users were down 5%. In North America, our largest geographic region for Construction Industries, sales to users increased as expected and demand remained healthy for both nonresidential and residential construction. Construction projects as well as government-related infrastructure continue to benefit nonresidential demand. Although residential sales to users in North America were down slightly, demand for new housing remains strong. Sales to users declined in EAME, primarily due to weakness in Europe related to residential construction and economic conditions. Latin America and Asia Pacific sales to users also saw some declines.\nIn Resource Industries, sales to users declined 17% in the first quarter compared to a very strong first quarter in 2023. Mining as well as heavy construction and quarry and aggregates were lower mainly due to softness in off-highway and articulated trucks that we mentioned during our last earnings call. In Energy & Transportation, sales to users increased by 9%. Oil and gas sales to users benefited from strong sales of turbines and turbine-related services. We also saw increased sales of reciprocating engines in the gas compression and well servicing oil and gas applications. Power generation sales to users grew as market conditions remain favorable, including strong data center growth. Transportation sales to users increased, while Industrial declined as we expected from strong levels last year.\nIn total, dealer inventory increased by $1.4 billion versus the fourth quarter. For machines, dealer inventory increased by $1.1 billion, which was slightly higher than our expectations, largely due to sales to users being modestly lower than anticipated. The increase in machine dealer inventory is consistent with normal seasonal patterns of which Construction Industries products accounted for the majority of the increase. The total level of machine dealer inventory is comfortably within the typical range. As I mentioned, backlog increased to [ $27.9 billion ] [ of ] $400 million versus the fourth quarter of 2023 led by energy and transportation. Backlog remains elevated as a percentage of revenues compared to historical levels. Adjusted operating profit margin increased to 22.2% in the first quarter, a 110 basis point increase over last year, which was slightly better than we anticipated. This was primarily due to better-than-expected manufacturing costs mainly related to freight. Moving to Slide 5.\nWe generated strong ME&T free cash flow of $1.3 billion in the first quarter. We deployed $5.1 billion of cash for share repurchases and dividends in the first quarter including the initiation of a $3.5 billion accelerated share repurchase program, which may last up to 9 months. We remain proud of our dividend aristocrat status and continue to expect to return substantially all ME&T free cash flow to shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases. Now on Slide 6, I'll describe our expectations moving forward.\nWe expect a continuation of healthy demand across most of our end markets for our products and services. We continue to anticipate 2024 sales and revenues to be broadly similar to the record 2023 level. As I mentioned, we expect services to continue to grow in [ 2024 ]. We currently do not anticipate a significant change in dealer inventory of machines in 2024 compared to a $700 million increase in 2023. This is expected to be a headwind to sales in 2024. As a reminder, dealers are independent businesses and manage their own inventories.\nThe vast majority of dealer inventories in energy and transportation are backed by firm customer orders. The timing of these products being recognized as sales to users is impacted by dealer packaging and commissioning, which is why it's difficult to predict dealer inventory in E&T. This is why we have become more explicit about the differentiation between machine dealer inventory and total dealer inventory. As I mentioned, we anticipate that our 2024 results will be within the top half of our target ranges for both adjusted operating profit margin and ME&T free cash flow. Our strong results continue to reflect the diversity of our end markets as well as the disciplined execution of our strategy for profitable growth. Now I'll discuss our outlook for key end markets, starting with Construction Industries.\nIn North America, after a very strong 2023, we continue to expect demand in the region will remain healthy in 2024 for both nonresidential and residential construction. We anticipate nonresidential construction to remain at similar levels to slightly higher demand levels compared to last year due to construction projects as well as government-related infrastructure. Residential construction demand is expected to be flat to slightly down versus last year which remains strong in comparison to historical levels. In Asia Pacific, outside of China, we are seeing some softening in economic conditions. We anticipate demand in China will remain at a relatively low level for the above 10-ton excavator industry.\nIn the EAME, we anticipate that weak economic conditions in Europe will continue somewhat offset by strong construction activity in the Middle East. Construction activity in Latin America remains mixed, but overall, we are expecting modest growth. In addition, we expect the ongoing benefit of our services initiatives will positively impact Construction Industries in 2024. Next, I'll discuss Resource Industries.\nAfter a strong performance in 2023 in mining, as well as heavy construction and quarry and aggregates, we anticipate lower machine volume versus last year, primarily due to off-highway and articulated trucks. In addition, we anticipate a small decrease in Resource Industries dealer inventories during 2024 versus a slight increase last year. While we continue to see a high level of quoting activity overall, we anticipate lower order rates as customers display capital discipline. We expect to see higher services revenues, including robust rebuild activity. Customer product utilization remains high, the number of parked trucks remains low and the age of the fleet remains elevated and our autonomous solutions continue to see strong customer acceptance. We continue to believe the energy transition will support increased commodity demand over time, expanding our total addressable market and providing further opportunities for long-term profitable growth. Moving to Energy & Transportation.\nIn oil and gas, we expect reciprocating engines and services to be about flat after strong 2023 performance. We expect reciprocating gas compression demand to be higher in 2024 than it was in 2023. While servicing demand in North America is expected to soften. Cat reciprocating engine demand for power generation is expected to remain strong, largely due to continued data center growth relating to cloud computing and generative AI. Last quarter, I mentioned we are making a multiyear capital investment in our larger reciprocating engine division, including increasing capacity for both new engines and aftermarket parts. This investment will approximately double output for large engines and aftermarket parts as compared to 2023.\nWe leverage these large engines across a variety of applications, including data centers, oil and gas, large mining trucks and distributed power generation. For Solar Turbines, our backlog and quoting activity both remained strong for oil and gas and power generation. As we said previously, industrial demand is expected to soften relative to a strong 2023. In transportation, we anticipate high-speed marine to increase as customers continue to upgrade aging fleets. Moving to Slide 7. I'll provide an update on our sustainability journey.\nWe are contributing to a reduced carbon future and continue to invest in new products, technologies and services to help our customers achieve their climate-related objectives. In January, we announced the signing of an electrification and strategic agreement with CRH to advance the deployment of Caterpillar's 0 exhaust emission solutions. CRH is the #1 aggregates producer in North America and the first company in that industry to sign such an agreement with Caterpillar. The agreement is focused on accelerating the deployment of Caterpillar 70 to 100 ton-class battery electric off-highway trucks and charging solutions at a CRH site in North America. Through the agreement, CRH will participate in Caterpillar's early learner program for battery electric off-highway trucks.\nIn February, Caterpillar oil and gas announced the launch of the Cat hybrid energy storage solution to help drillers and operators cut fuel consumption, lower total cost of ownership and reduce emissions in oil and gas operations. The custom designed energy storage system stores excess power from the job site and then discharge it as needed. In a hybrid system that combines the Cat hybrid energy storage solution in a natural gas fuel generator set, the transient response is even quicker than the conventional deal only rigs. Depending upon site configuration the hybrid energy storage solution has proven to deliver up to 30% fuel cost savings with natural gas, 85% fuel cost savings with fuel gas and up to an 80% reduction in nitrogen oxides. Carbon dioxide equivalent reductions up to 11% and 7% are possible with natural gas and field gas, respectively. In addition, we look forward to issuing our 19th annual sustainability report in May. The material in our report reinforce our ongoing commitment to sustainability.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew R. J. Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin by commenting on the first quarter results, including the performance of our segments. Then I'll discuss the balance sheet and ME&T free cash flow before concluding with a few comments on the full year and our assumptions for the second quarter. Beginning on Slide 8.\nOur operating performance was strong with both adjusted operating profit margin and adjusted profit per share being better than we had expected. Sales and revenues of $15.8 billion were about flat compared to the prior year, broadly in line with our expectations. Adjusted operating profit increased by 5% to $3.5 billion and the adjusted operating profit margin was 22.2%, an increase of 110 basis points versus the prior year, which was slightly better than we had expected. Profit per share was $5.75 in the first quarter compared to $3.74 in the first quarter of last year. Adjusted profit per share increased by 14% to $5.60 in the first quarter compared to $4.91 last year. Adjusted profit per share excluded net restructuring income of $0.15 per share. This compares to restructuring expense of $1.17, which was excluded in the first quarter of 2023.\nOther income of $156 million for the quarter was higher than the first quarter of 2023 by $124 million. This is primarily related to favorable ME&T balance sheet translation. The provision for income taxes in the first quarter, excluding discrete items, reflected a global annual effective tax rate of 22.5% compared with 23% in the first quarter of 2023. Included in profit per share and adjusted profit per share was a benefit of $38 million or $0.08 for a discrete tax item related to stock-based compensation. A comparable benefit of $32 million or $0.06 per share was included in the first quarter of 2023.\nThe year-over-year impact of a reduction in the number of shares, primarily due to share repurchases over the past year had a favorable impact on adjusted profit per share of approximately $0.24. This included a favorable impact from the initial shares we received to the $3.5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement that Jim mentioned earlier. Before I move on, you will have seen some additional detail on the earnings release segment commentaries. We continue to highlight the primary drivers of year-over-year changes in sales and profit by segment, as we have done previously, but in addition, we are now also quantifying those significant variances. You will also find some additional information on historical dealer inventory, including at the machine level in the appendix of today's slides. Moving to Slide 9. I'll discuss our top line results in the first quarter.\nSales remained about flat compared to the prior year as lower volume was largely offset by favorable price realization. The decline in volume was primarily due to lower sales to users. As Jim mentioned, the 5% decrease in sales to users was slightly more than our expectations, mainly driven by weakness in Europe for Construction Industries. Changes in total dealer inventories did not have a significant impact on sales as the increase of $1.4 billion in the quarter was similar to the increase last year. As Jim mentioned, the $1.1 billion increase in machines was slightly higher than we had anticipated, primarily as sales to users were modestly lower than we had expected. As compared to our expectations for the quarter, sales were broadly in line. Sales volume was slightly lower than we had anticipated, while price realization, including geographic mix, was better than we had expected. By segment, sales in Construction Industries were lower than we had anticipated, while sales in Energy & Transportation exceeded our expectations. Resource Industry sales were about in line. Moving to operating profit on Slide 10.\nFirst quarter operating profit increased by 29% to $3.5 billion. As a reminder, the prior year included a $586 million charge that rose from the divestiture of the company's longwall business. Adjusted operating profit increased by 5% to $3.5 billion. Price realization benefited the quarter, while lower sales volume acted as a partial offset. The adjusted operating profit margin of 22.2% improved by 110 basis points versus the prior year. Margins were slightly better than we had anticipated, mainly due to favorable manufacturing costs as freight costs were lower than we had expected. Price including a benefit from geographic mix was also better than we had anticipated. Now on Slide 11, I'll review segment performance starting with Construction Industries.\nSales decreased by 5% in the first quarter to $6.4 billion, primarily due to lower sales volume, partially offset by favorable price realization. Sales were slightly lower than we had anticipated. Sales in North America increased by 6% in the quarter. In the EAME region, sales fell by 25%, and in particular, Europe was lower than we had anticipated, impacted by weakness in residential construction and economic conditions. In Latin America, our sales decreased by 1%. In Asia Pacific sales decreased by 14%. First quarter profit for Construction Industries was $1.8 billion, a slight decrease versus the prior year. The decrease was mainly due to lower sales volume, partially offset by favorable price realization and manufacturing costs. The segment's margin of 27.5% was an increase of 100 basis points versus the last year. This was better than we had expected due to favorable manufacturing costs, which largely reflected lower freight costs. Turning to Slide 12.\nResource Industries sales decreased by 7% in the first quarter to $3.2 billion, which was about in line with our expectations. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume, partially offset by favorable price realization. The decrease in sales volume was mainly driven by lower sales of equipment to end users, which Jim explained. First quarter profit for Resource Industries decreased by 4% versus the prior year to $730 million. The decrease was mainly due to lower sales volume, partially offset by favorable price realization. The segment's margin of 22.9% was an increase of 60 basis points versus last year. This is better than we had expected on stronger price and favorable manufacturing costs, driven mainly by lower freight costs. Now on Slide 13.\nEnergy & Transportation sales increased by 7% in the first quarter to $6.7 billion. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume and favorable price. Sales were stronger than we had expected, mostly due to increased deliveries of large engines. By application, power generation sales increased by 26%. Oil and gas sales improved by 19%, Transportation sales were higher by 9%, while industrial sales decreased by 21%. First quarter profit for Energy & Transportation increased by 23% versus the prior year to $1.3 billion. The increase was primarily due to favorable price realization. The segment's margin of 19.5% was an increase of 260 basis points versus the prior year. The margin was significantly stronger than we had anticipated due to lower-than-expected manufacturing costs, higher volume and better price. Moving to Slide 14.\nFinancial Products revenues increased by 10% to $991 million primarily due to higher average financing rates across all regions and higher average net earning assets in North America. Segment profit was strong, increasing by 26% to $293 million. The increase was mainly due to an insurance settlement and a favorable impact from equity securities. Our portfolio continues to perform well as past dues remain near historical lows at 1.78%, a 22 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter of 2023. This is the lowest first quarter past dues since 2006. In addition, the allowance rate was our lowest on record of 1.01%. Business activity remains strong as new business volume increased versus the prior year, primarily driven by North America. We continue to see strong demand for used equipment and inventories remain close to historically low levels, with just slight increases over recent quarters. Moving on to Slide 15.\nAs Jim mentioned, EAME [ ME&T ] free cash flow remained strong. We generated $1.3 billion in the quarter after taking into account the $1.7 billion payments made for 2023 short-term incentive compensation and CapEx spend of about $500 million. Spend for both short-term incentive compensation and CapEx was higher than it was in the first quarter of 2023. For the full year, we expect to be in the top half of our ME&T free cash flow target range, which correlates to between $7.5 billion and $10 billion. We still expect to spend between $2 billion and $2.5 billion in CapEx and we will continue to raise investments around [ ACE ], which is autonomy, alternative fuels, connectivity and digital and electrification. Moving to capital deployment.\nWe continue to expect to return substantially all ME&T free cash flow to shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases. Of the record $5.1 billion of cash deployed in the first quarter share repurchase spend was $4.5 billion, including the $3.5 billion accelerated share repurchase, or ASR. The $3.5 billion were deployed in the first quarter and the ASR agreement may last for up to 9 months. The ASR provides us with favorable pricing as compared to shorter-term ASRs, which we have carried out previously, which makes it more attractive. Prices finally determined relative to the volume weighted average price or VWAP over the duration of the agreement. Approximately 70% of the shares were delivered to the company upfront, but the balance calculated when the agreement is terminated based on the actual average VWAP.\nAs a reminder, our objective is to be in the market on a more consistent basis for share repurchases. So this is a great mechanism for us to use. As I mentioned, our balance sheet remains strong. We have ample liquidity with an enterprise cash balance of $5 billion, and we hold an additional $2.2 billion in slightly longer-dated liquid marketable securities to improve yields on that cash. Moving to Slide 16, I will share our high-level assumptions for the full year.\nAs compared to a quarter ago, our assumptions for the full year generally remain unchanged. On the top line, we anticipate broadly similar sales and revenues as compared to the record 2023 level, consistent with what we mentioned last quarter. Although our top level sales expectations remain the same, segment inputs have shifted a bit. We now see a slightly stronger top line in Energy & Transportation after a strong first quarter, while our expectations have been tempered slightly in Construction Industries due to economic conditions in the European market. We continue to expect slightly favorable price realization versus the prior year. Our expectations on dealer inventory also remain unchanged. We currently do not expect a significant change in dealer inventory of machines in 2024 compared to a $700 million increase in 2023. This is expected to be a headwind to sales.\nWe also continue to anticipate another year of services growth across each of our primary segments as we strive to achieve our 2026 target of $28 billion in services revenues. At the segment level, we now expect construction industry sales to users to be slightly lower compared to 2023 due to the softer economic conditions in Europe. We expect demand in North America to remain at healthy levels, as Jim discussed. We also anticipate changes in dealer inventory to act as a headwind to construction industry sales in 2024. we expect sales service revenues to be positive versus the prior year. In Resource Industries, we continue to expect lower sales impacted by lower machine volume, primarily in off-highway and articulated trucks where the comparison versus the prior year is challenging. We anticipate changes in dealer inventory to act as a headwind to sales in this segment as well.\nIn Energy & Transportation, our 2024 sales expectations have increased slightly after the strong first quarter. We continue to see strong demand for reciprocating engines in power generation as well as healthy order and quoting activity for solar turbines for both oil and gas and power generation. This supports our improved optimism for higher sales in Energy & Transportation in 2024. Also, as typical seasonality would suggest, we expect to see some sales ramp in Energy & Transportation as we move through the full year.\nOn full year adjusted operating profit margin, we continue to expect to be in the top half of the margin target range at our expected sales levels. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect a relatively small pricing benefit to be weighted towards the first half of the year, given carryover from increases in the second half of last year. We now expect flattish manufacturing costs this year versus the prior year as we anticipate more favorable freight costs, although the unfavorable impact from cost absorption could act as a partial offset. As I mentioned a quarter ago, given better availability this year, we anticipate shipping a more normal mix of products this year. We anticipate this dynamic may act as a slight headwind to margins.\nSG&A and R&D expenses are expected to ramp through the remainder of the year as we continue to invest in strategic initiatives [ and to ] long -- future long-term profitable growth. This will be offset by the benefit of lower short-term incentive compensation. In addition, from a segment perspective, keep in mind that margins in Construction Industries tend to trend lower as the year progresses. Finally, we continue to anticipate restructuring costs to $300 million to $450 million this year, and our expectation for annual effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, is now 22.5%. Now on Slide 17, I'll discuss our expectations for the second quarter, starting with the top line.\nWe expect lower sales in the second quarter compared to the prior year as we anticipate a headwind due to changes in dealer inventory of machines which will impact volumes. We expect the dealer inventory machines to decline this quarter in line with normal seasonal trends versus the atypical $200 million increase that occurred in the second quarter of 2023. However, we anticipate a continuation of healthy demand across most of our end markets for our products and services and price is expected to remain positive year-over-year. Following the typical season of the patent, we do expect higher sales in the second quarter as compared to the first.\nBy segment compared to the prior year, we anticipate lower sales in Construction Industries as we expect changes in dealer inventory to act as a headwind. Favorable price should that provide a partial offset. We expect lower sales in Resource Industries versus the prior year driven by lower volume, partially offset by favorable price. In Energy & Transportation, we anticipate similar sales versus the prior year. On Enterprise margins in the second quarter, we expect the adjusted operating profit margin to be similar to the prior year and lower versus the first quarter following the typical seasonal patent.\nAs compared to the prior year, we expect that price will remain favorable from the continued carryover benefit from increases taken in the second half of 2023. We expect flattish manufacturing costs compared to the prior year as favorable freight is expected to offset the impacts of unfavorable cost absorption. We also anticipate an increase in SG&A and R&D expenses related to strategic investments although this will be offset by lower short-term incentive compensation. By segment, in both Construction Industries and Resource Industries, we expect similar margins in the second quarter compared to the prior year as we expect favorable price to be offset by lower volume.\nIn Energy & Transportation, we expect a higher margin versus the prior year on better price and favorable mix. unfavorable manufacturing costs and SG&A and R&D spend related to strategic investments are expected to act as a partial offset in this segment. Note that we expect a headwind to enterprise margins and corporate costs in the quarter where we anticipate unfavorable year-over-year impacts from timing differences. So turning to Slide 18, let me summarize.\nThe strong operating performance continued in this quarter with the adjusted operating profit margin at 22.2% and record adjusted profit per share of $5.60. We deployed a record $5.1 billion of cash for share repurchases and dividends in the quarter. Our assumptions for the full year remain similar, and we expect to be in the top half of our target ranges for both adjusted operating profit, margin and ME&T free cash flow. We continue to execute our strategy for long-term profitable growth.\nAnd with that, we'll take your questions.",

Now let's turn to Slide 3 and turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO Jim Umpleby.\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar\n\nThanks Ryan. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'd like to start by thanking our global team for their strong execution in the first half of the year. In the second quarter we achieved higher adjusted operating profit margin, record adjusted profit per share, and generated robust ME&T free cash flow. Our results continue to reflect the benefit of the diversity of our end markets as well as the disciplined execution of our strategy for long-term profitable growth. I'll begin with my perspectives about our performance in the quarter and will provide an update on our full year expectations.\nI'll then provide some insights about our end markets followed by an update on our sustainability journey. Moving to quarterly results, sales and revenues were down 4% in the second quarter versus last year, slightly below our expectations. Services increased in the quarter. Our adjusted operating profit increased to $3.7 billion, a record. Adjusted operating profit margin was better than we expected and improved to 22.4%, up 110 basis points versus last year. We achieved record quarterly adjusted profit per share of $5.99, up 8%. We also generated $2.5 billion of ME&T free cash flow in the quarter.\nIn addition, our backlog increased to $28.6 billion, up $700 million versus the first quarter of 2024. Before I get into the detail of the quarter and outlook for our segments, I'll update our expectations for the full year based on our first half results. Earlier in the year, we estimated that sales and revenues would be broadly similar for the full year. For the first half, the top line came in marginally below our expectations and ended 2% below the prior year. We now anticipate our sales and revenues will decline at a roughly similar rate in the second half versus the prior year, in part due to our latest assumptions for dealer inventory, principally in Resource Industries.\nOverall sales to users and Construction Industries are running slightly lower than we anticipated, partially offset by stronger than expected sales in Energy & Transportation. Services revenues continue to grow. Although sales and revenues have been marginally below our expectations, adjusted operating profit margins have been stronger than we anticipated. Earlier in the year, we expected our adjusted operating profit margin to be in the top half of the target range at the corresponding level of sales. Due to the strength of our performance in the first half of the year, we now expect overall adjusted operating profit margins to be above the top of the target range for the full year.\nFor the second half, we expect adjusted operating profit margins to be better than we previously anticipated or about flat to second half of 2023, which Andrew will describe. The strength of our performance to date and our improved second half adjusted operating profit margin expectations give us confidence to guide above our target range. Overall, our expectations for full year adjusted operating profit and adjusted profit per share are now higher than it was during our last earnings call. We also anticipate that ME&T free cash flow will remain in the top half of the free cash flow target range.\nTurning to Slide 4 and our second quarter results. In the second quarter of 2024, sales and revenues declined 4% to $16.7 billion. Sales volume declined slightly more than we expected, while price realization, including geographic mix, was better than we anticipated. Dealer inventory also declined in the second quarter. Compared to the second quarter of 2023, overall sales to users decreased 3%, slightly below expectations. For machines, which includes Construction Industries and Resource Industries, sales to users declined by 8%, slightly more than expected.\nEnergy & Transportation continued to show strength as sales to users increased 10%. Sales to users in Construction Industries were down 5%. In North America, sales to users were slightly lower than anticipated, primarily due to weaker than expected rental fleet loading. Government-related infrastructure projects remain healthy. Residential sales to users in North America were up as demand for new housing remained resilient. Sales to users declined in EAME primarily due to weakness in Europe relating to residential construction and economic conditions. Sales to users in Asia/Pacific declined while Latin America increased.\nIn Resource Industries, sales to users declined 15%, a slightly smaller decline than we expected versus a very strong Q2 2023. Mining, as well as Heavy Construction and Quarry and Aggregates were lower mainly due to softness we previously discussed for two products, articulated trucks and off-highway trucks. In Energy & Transportation, despite the ongoing weakness in industrial, sales to users increased by 10% as we continue to see strength across most applications. Oil and Gas sales to users benefited from strong sales of turbines and turbine-related services.\nWe also saw increased sales of reciprocating engines into gas compression while well-servicing Oil and Gas applications were lower. Power generation sales to users grew as market conditions remained favorable, including strong data center growth. Transportation sales to users increased while industrial declined as expected from the strong levels last year. Our results continue to reflect the benefit of the diversity of our end markets as well as the disciplined execution of our strategy for long-term profitable growth.\nMoving to dealer inventory. In total, dealer inventory decreased by $200 million versus the first quarter. For machines, dealer inventory decreased by $400 million and remains within our typical range. As I mentioned, backlog increased to $28.6 billion, up $700 million versus the first quarter of 2024. Energy & Transportation drove the increase as we continue to see strong demand for Solar Turbines and reciprocating engines for Power Generation.\nAdjusted operating profit margin increased to 22.4% in the second quarter, a 110 basis point increase over last year, which was better than we anticipated. Margin exceeded our expectations primarily due to lower than expected manufacturing costs and slightly better than expected price. Moving to Slide 5, we generated ME&T free cash flow of $2.5 billion in the second quarter. We deployed more than $1.8 billion of cash for share repurchases and about $600 million in dividends in the second quarter. In June, we announced an additional $20 billion share repurchase authorization with no expiration date.\nWe remain committed to consistent share repurchases. Since 2019, when we communicated our intention to return substantially all ME&T free cash flow to shareholders over time, our net share count has decreased by approximately 18%. In addition, we increased our dividend by 8% in the second quarter, which is our fourth straight year of a high single digit quarterly increase. We remain proud of our Dividend Aristocrat status and continue to expect to return substantially all ME&T free cash flow to shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases.\nNow on Slide 6, I'll describe our expectations for our three primary segments moving forward. In Construction Industries, after a record 2023, sales to users in the second half are now expected to decline slightly versus last year. In North America, we now anticipate slightly lower Construction Industries sales to users for full year 2024 than we did previously, primarily due to weaker than expected rental fleet loading. Government-related infrastructure projects are expected to remain healthy in Asia/Pacific, outside of China, we still expect soft economic conditions to continue.\nWe anticipate demand in China will remain at a relatively low level for the above 10-ton excavator industry. In the EAME, we anticipate that weak economic conditions in Europe will continue, somewhat offset by continued healthy construction demand in the Middle East. Construction activity in Latin America remains mixed, but overall we are expecting modest growth. In addition, we are expecting the ongoing benefit of our services initiatives will positively impact Construction Industries. Next, I'll discuss Resource Industries.\nAfter strong performance in 2023 in Mining as well as Heavy Construction and Quarry and Aggregates, we continue to anticipate lower machine volume versus last year, primarily due to off-highway and articulated trucks. We currently anticipate a decrease in Resource Industries dealer inventories in 2024 versus a slight increase last year. We expect to see higher services revenues, including robust rebuild activity. Customer product utilization remains high, the number of parked trucks remains low, and the age of the fleet remains elevated, and our autonomous solutions continue to see strong customer acceptance. Customers continue to display capital discipline.\nHowever, we continue to believe the energy transition will support increased commodity demand over time, expanding our total addressable market and providing further opportunities for long-term profitable growth. Moving to Energy & Transportation. In Oil and Gas in total, we expect a stronger year overall in 2024 versus last year. After a strong 2023, we expect reciprocating engine sales in Oil and Gas to be flat to slightly down, primarily due to ongoing softness in well servicing. We still expect gas compression to be up for the full year. However, we expect it to soften in the second half.\nFor Solar Turbines, we continue to expect volume growth in the second half as our backlog remains strong for Oil and Gas. CAT reciprocating engines and Solar Turbines demand for Power Generation is expected to remain strong, largely due to continued data center growth relating to cloud computing and generative AI. Industrial demand is expected to remain at a relatively low level compared to 2023 in the second half. In Transportation, we anticipate growth as the year progresses in both high speed marine and rail services. Moving to slide 7, I'll provide an update on our sustainability journey.\nWe are contributing to a reduced carbon future and continue to invest in new products, technologies, and services to help our customers achieve their climate-related objectives. In April, Caterpillar and Vale signed an agreement to test battery electric large mining trucks as well as to conduct studies on ethanol-powered trucks. Progress has been made on both initiatives since the agreement was signed, including conducting a joint study on a dual-fuel solution for haul trucks operated on ethanol and diesel fuel. We are supporting Vale sustainability objectives.\nIn June, we added CAT CG260 gas generator sets to our portfolio of commercially available power solutions capable of running on hydrogen fuel. Previously, our portfolio with this capability ranged from 400kW to 2,500kW. The addition of the CG260 now provides up to 4,500kW of electric power for continuous prime and load management requirements and is approved to operate on gas containing up to 25% hydrogen by volume. Caterpillar offers retrofit kits to upgrade CG260 generator sets already installed with the same hydrogen capabilities.\nIn addition to our hydrogen capabilities in reciprocating engines, Solar Turbines has been a leader with its ability to burn a wide variety of fuels including hydrogen, natural gas, and biofuels. Today, Caterpillar has a large and growing lineup of technologies to support customers in their sustainability journey. These two examples highlight how we are helping our customers build a better, more sustainable world. With that, I'll turn it over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar\n\nThank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a high-level summary of the quarter, then I'll provide more detailed comments on our second quarter results. Including the performance of the segments. Next, I'll discuss the balance sheet and free cash flow and then conclude with comments on our assumptions for the remainder of the year. Beginning on Slide 8. Although sales and revenues were slightly below our expectations, we had strong operating performance in the quarter, including higher adjusted operating profit margin and record adjusted profit per share, both of which were stronger than we had anticipated.\nSales and revenues of $16.7 billion decreased by about 4% compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating profit increased by 2% to $3.7 billion, and the adjusted operating profit margin was 22.4%, an increase of 110 basis points versus the prior year. Profit per share was $5.48 in the second quarter compared to $5.67 in the second quarter of last year. Adjusted profit per share increased by 8% to $5.99 in the quarter compared to $5.55 last year. Adjusted profit per share excluded restructuring costs of $0.51 per share, mainly due to a loss on the divestiture of two non-US entities.\nThis compares to restructuring costs of $0.05 per share, and a discrete deferred tax benefit of $0.17 per share, which were both excluded in the second quarter of 2023. Other income of $155 million for the quarter was a $28 million benefit versus the prior year and was primarily driven by favorable impacts from commodity hedges. The provision for income taxes in the second quarter, excluding discrete items, reflected a global annual effective tax rate of 22.5% compared with 23% in the second quarter of 2023.\nFinally, the year-over-year impact from a reduction in the average number of shares outstanding primarily due to share repurchases over the past year had a favorable impact on adjusted profit per share of approximately $0.29. Moving on to Slide 9. I'll discuss our top line results in the second quarter. Sales and revenues decreased by 4% compared to the prior year as lower volume was partially offset by favorable price realization. Lower volume was mainly driven by the impact from changes in dealer inventories.\nAs you may recall, we anticipated a sales decline this quarter versus last year as an atypical dealer inventory increase in the second quarter of 2023 made for a challenging comparison. To explain, dealer inventory decreased by about $200 million in the second quarter. In comparison, we saw an increase of $600 million in the second quarter of last year. For machines only, dealer inventory followed the typical seasonal trend this quarter with a decrease of $400 million as compared to a $200 million increase in the second quarter of last year.\nSales were slightly below our expectations due to lower than expected volume being partially offset by better than expected price realization including geographic mix. Moving to operating profit on slide 10, operating profit in the second quarter decreased by 5% to $3.5 billion. This included a $227 million unfavorable impact from higher restructuring costs. Adjusted operating profit increased by 2% to $3.7 billion. Price realization benefited the quarter while the profit impact of lower sales volume acted as a partial offset. The adjusted operating profit margin of 22.4% improved by 110 basis points versus the prior year.\nMargins were better than we expected, mainly due to favorable manufacturing costs, product mix and price. Versus our expectation, price was slightly better than we anticipated, driven by Energy & Transportation. On Slide 11, Construction Industries sales decreased by 7% in the second quarter to $6.7 billion. This was primarily due to lower sales volume partially offset by favorable price realization. Sales volume was impacted by unfavorable changes in dealer inventories. Dealer inventory was about flat in the second quarter of 2024 versus an increase in the second quarter of last year.\nLower Sales to Users also impacted volume. Sales in local Construction Industries were lower than we had anticipated due to lower than expected rental fleet loading in North America and continued weakness in Europe. By region, our sales in North America were about flat. In Latin America, sales increased by 20%. Sales in the EAME region decreased by 27%. In Asia/Pacific, sales declined by 15%. Second quarter profit for Construction Industries was $1.7 billion, a 3% decrease versus the prior year. This is mainly due to lower sales volume partially offset by favorable price realization which benefited from geographic mix effects.\nFavorable manufacturing costs provided some tailwind as well, largely reflecting lower material costs. The segment's margin of 26.1% was an increase of 90 basis points versus last year. Margin was better than we had expected primarily due to favorable product mix and the timing of planned SG&A and R&D spend. Price was in line with our expectations. Turning to Slide 12, Resource Industries sales decreased by 10% in Q2 to $3.2 billion, which was about in line with our expectations. The decline was primarily due to lower sales volume, partially offset by favorable price realization.\nSales volume was impacted by changes in dealer inventories as dealers' inventory decreased more during the second quarter 2024 than during the second quarter of last year. In addition, we saw lower sales to users in the segment as anticipated, given a challenging comparison. Second quarter profit for Resource Industries decreased by 3% versus the prior year to $718 million. This is mainly due to lower sales volume, partially offset by favorable impacts from price realization and manufacturing costs, including lower freight. The segment's margin of 22.4% was an increase of 160 basis points versus last year.\nMargin was better than we had expected, mainly driven by the timing of planned SG&A and R&D spend and a favorable product mix. Now on Slide 13, Energy & Transportation sales increased by 2% in the second quarter to $7.3 billion. The increase was due to favorable price realization, which was partially offset by lower sales volume driven by industrial, which declined in line with our expectations. The segment sales were slightly better than we had anticipated, primarily driven by price. By application, power generation sales increased by 15%. Transportation sales were higher by 7%. Oil and Gas sales improved by 4%, while industrial sales decreased by 21%.\nSecond quarter profit for Energy & Transportation increased by 20% versus the prior year to $1.5 billion. The increase was primarily due to favorable price. The segment's margin of 20.8% was an increase of 320 basis points versus the prior year. Margin was significantly stronger than we had anticipated due to better price and lower than expected manufacturing costs, which largely reflected favorable inventory absorption, lower freight, and lower material costs.\nMoving to Slide 14, Financial Products revenues increased by 9% to about $1 billion, primarily due to higher average financing rates across all regions and higher average earning assets in North America. Segment profit decreased by 5% to $227 million. This was mainly due to a higher provision for credit losses, which largely reflected the absence of a non-recurring reserve release from the prior year. The portfolio remains healthy as past dues of 1.74% are near historic lows and reflect a 41 basis points improvement compared to the prior year. In addition, the allowance rate was 0.89%, our lowest rate on record.\nBusiness activity remains healthy as new business volume increased versus the prior year, primarily driven by North America. We also continue to see healthy demand for used equipment where inventories remain close to historically low levels. Moving to Slide 15. We generated $2.5 billion in ME&T free cash flow in the second quarter. We expect our full year free cash flow to be in the top half of our annual target range or between $7.5 billion to $10 billion. Our expectations for CapEx remain between $2 billion and $2.5 billion for the year. On share repurchases, the more than $1.8 billion deployed in the second quarter included a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement.\nApproximately 75% of those shares were delivered to the company up front, with a balance to be delivered when the agreement is terminated prior to year-end. Note that we also had a ME&T bond maturity of $1 billion in the second quarter and given our healthy liquidity position, we did not issue new bonds. Our balance sheet remains strong with an enterprise cash balance of $4.3 billion. In addition, we hold $1.8 billion in slightly longer dated liquid marketable securities to improve yields on that cash. Now on slides 16 and 17.\nI will show our high level assumptions for the remainder of the year. As Jim mentioned, we now anticipate sales and revenues to be slightly lower this year versus the record 2023 level. This compares to our previous expectation for broadly similar sales. This change reflects an updated assumption of a slight reduction in machine dealer inventory, primarily in Resource Industries, and lower than expected sales to users in Construction Industries, mainly due to lower rental fleet loading in North America. Now, specific to our second half assumptions. We typically see higher sales in the second half as compared to the first, and we expect sales to follow that normal seasonal trend this year.\nAs compared to the prior year. We now anticipate slightly lower sales in the second half driven by lower machine sales to users. Changes in dealer inventories and machines are expected to have a nominal impact as the decrease in the second half of this year should be similar to the decrease observed in the second half of 2023, which was about $1 billion. However, note that machine dealer inventory changes will impact the quarters differently as we expect a sales headwind in third quarter as dealers built their inventories in the third quarter of 2023 and a sales tailwind in the fourth quarter due to a smaller inventory decline than the prior year.\nFinally, we continue to anticipate services growth in the second half of the year as we strive to achieve our 2026 target of $28 billion in services revenues. Moving on to our margin expectations. As Jim mentioned, the strength of our first half performance combined with the more favorable expectations for the second half mean that we now anticipate overall adjusted operating profit margin to be above the top end of the target range for the full year. Specific to second half margins. Despite higher sales, we do expect lower margins versus the first half, which follows the typical seasonal trend.\nHowever, keep in mind that first half margins were record levels and the magnitude of the second half decline may be slightly larger than is typical. As compared to the prior year. We expect our adjusted operating profit margin in the second half will be similar to the prior year level. While we anticipate some favorability in manufacturing costs on improved operational efficiencies, we do expect slightly lower volumes and a slight headwind from price in the second half versus a year ago. On price, the impact of lapping the increases taken in the second half of 2023 means that the benefit in the second half this year will be significantly lower.\nIn addition, we expect that improved availability across the industry will result in the normalization of the pricing environment. To assist you with your modeling for the full year, please note that we now anticipate restructuring costs of around $450 million and that our expectations for the annual effective tax rate excluding discrete items remains at 22.5%. Now on Slide 18, I'll provide a few comments on the third quarter. Starting on the top line, we expect slightly lower sales and revenues in the third quarter compared to the prior year as we anticipate a dealer inventory headwind for machines which will impact volumes.\nWe expect dealer inventory machines to be flattish to slightly lower in the third quarter as is typical, which compares to the atypical $400 million increase in the prior year. We also anticipate lower machine sales to users versus a strong comparison. We expect flattish price realization in Q3 versus the prior year due to the normalization that I mentioned a moment ago. We also anticipate that the ongoing benefit of our service initiatives will positively impact sales in Q3. By segment in Q3 compared to the prior year. We anticipate lower sales in Construction Industries, primarily due to a headwind from changes in dealer inventories.\nIn Resource Industries, we expect lower sales as sales to users are impacted by a challenging comparison similar to that which we have observed in the first two quarters of this year. In Energy & Transportation, we anticipate higher sales versus the prior year supported by strength in Power Generation, Oil and Gas, and Transportation. Lower sales than industrial should act as a partial offset. For enterprise margins in the third quarter, we expect similar adjusted operating profit margin compared to the prior year as we anticipate lower volume will be offset primarily by favorable manufacturing costs.\nBy segment in the third quarter. In Construction Industries, we anticipate lower margin compared to the prior year on lower volume and slightly unfavorable price realization. Favorable manufacturing costs should act as a partial offset. For Resource Industries, we anticipate slightly lower margins in the third quarter compared to the prior year due to unfavorable volume and higher SG&A and R&D spend. In Energy & Transportation. We expect a higher margin versus the prior year on stronger volumes and favorable price realization.\nSo turning to Slide 19, let me summarize. Strong execution and operating performance continued in the second quarter. Higher adjusted operating profit margin of 22.4% offset the decrease in sales and revenues and led to a record adjusted profit per share of $5.99. We now expect overall adjusted operating profit margin to be above the top end of the target range for the full year based on our expected sales levels, which should now be slightly lower than levels in 2023. The net of these factors leads to our current expectation for higher adjusted operating profit and adjusted profit per share as compared to what we contemplated at the beginning of the year.\nME&T free cash flow generation was $2.5 billion in the quarter. We continue to expect to be in the top half of our target range for the full year. We have deployed $7.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in the first half of 2024. We continue to execute our strategy for long-term profitable growth, and with that we'll take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, please press star 1 to place yourself in the queue. Please note we are only allowing one question per analyst. Your first question comes from the line of Chad Dillard from Bernstein. Your line is open.\n\nCharles Dillard\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHi, good morning everyone.\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar\n\nMorning Chad.\n\nCharles Dillard\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nSo I was hoping you could unpack a little bit more the price cost dynamics. As we look through the second half of the year, can you just walk through like a segment basis in an enterprise? How to think about that? And for the full year, at least for the second half, do you think price costs will be positive?\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar\n\nYeah. Overall, so let me start. Obviously, for the full year, price will exceed increases in manufacturing costs. As we look out in the second half of the year, we do expect price to moderate as we've consistently said. However, we are seeing some favorability in manufacturing costs as you saw in the second quarter, we expect that to continue. There will be a continued normalization, particularly in construction of the pricing environment as availability improves and across the industry as a whole. We expect price to be positive in Energy & Transportation in the second half, and that will offset any weakness that we may see in Construction Industries.\nOverall, as I just pointed out in my comments, we do expect favorability in manufacturing costs and that will offset actually the volume decline that we expect our impact on margins in the third quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Jamie Cook at Truist Securities.\n\nJamie Cook\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nHi, good morning, and congrats on a nice quarter. I guess my question pertains to E&T and the E&T margin strength in the quarter. You know, can you help? I mean, given again, Jim, the capacity investments you're making in that business, how we think about the E&T margin potential over the long term relative to Construction and Resource, given you're adding capacity there. And sort of where should we be, Jim, as we're exiting the year, how do we think about the incremental capacity that's coming online? Just trying to figure out how that helps potentially 2025 and 2026. Thanks.\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar\n\nWell, thank you Jamie for your question. And as you noted, we are adding capacity to increase our capability to build both large engines and parts for those large engines. But it's a multi-year project and that project will take some time to play out, so it's not a 12-month program. It lasts longer than that, it takes some time. Having said that, the demand for large engines and for Solar Turbines for both Oil and Gas and Power Generation continues to be quite strong. So the margin increase that you saw is a reflection of higher volume, better price, and also better mix as well, quite frankly.\nSo again, is there potential for margin expansion over time in Energy & Transportation? There certainly is that possibility. Again, a lot of it will depend upon mix and again our ability to increase our capacity in large engines, which we're working very hard to do. But again, the good news is that, again, back to that, the Power Generation market is quite strong. And one of the things we're also bullish about that's possibly a bit farther out is just the opportunity for distributed generation.\nAs more renewables are added to the grid, as there's more grid instability issues, it creates an opportunity for us, we believe, to sell both reciprocating engines and gas turbines and distributed Power Generation applications distributed throughout the grid. And we're very excited about that opportunity. One of the things also to keep in mind is, you know, we have a strong backlog, and the backlog increase that we reported today, of course, E&T was a big part of that, and that includes both Solar Turbines and our large engines.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Steve Volkmann at Jefferies.\n\nStephen Volkmann\n\nEquity Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question, pivoting maybe to Construction Industries. I think you both mentioned lower than expected rental fleet loading in the quarter as one of the trends that you called out. And I'm curious if that is, if you view that as sort of a timing issue and maybe you can give us a sense of where you think the rental fleets are and how much kind of update and re-fleeting needs to be done there?\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar\n\nCertainly, one thing to start with is dealer rental income was actually up for the quarter. And you know, dealers are independent businesses and of course make their own decisions about what kind of machines and how many machines they put into their rental fleets. And there's a whole variety of things they look at there. They think about interest rates obviously, and they think about other aspects. But we, you know, we continue to be bullish on what we see as an opportunity around rental and we're working closely with our dealers to help them increase their rental business over time.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Robert Wertheimer at Melius Research.\n\nRobert Wertheimer\n\nDirector of Research, Melius Research\n\nHi, good morning, everybody. I also wanted to circle around to E&T, where, you know, as you see the rise of data centers, I guess the critical nature of that power backup is, you know, rising in importance. Question is going to be around mix and margin in the E&T segment. Is there any, you know, Oil and Gas, obviously you're running. It's a great business. It's high margin, high mix as well. Is there any anticipated mix impact if Power Gen kind of replaces some of the strength we've seen in Oil and Gas?\nAnd then, more broadly, Jim, I think you mentioned kind of Solar Turbines in Power Gen. I think you've had historical strength in like combined heat and power and things like that. Is that market for Solar Turbines expanding visibly already in Power Gen to more and more applications? I'll stop there. Thanks.\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar\n\nWell, thank you, Rob. And so to answer the last part of your question first, so in Solar we have seen some pretty interesting applications for Solar that you're right. Traditionally over the last 30 years there's been a lot of combined heat and power applications for Solar. But as an example, we relatively recently sold some Solar Gas Turbines in a Power Generation application for continuous duty for a data center in Ireland. And that's something that again we wouldn't have seen 20 years ago.\nSo there are some more opportunities and as I mentioned earlier, as we think about distributed generation for both recip and gas turbines and again our engines and turbines burn a whole variety of fuels, natural gas, biofuels, hydrogen blends, and all the rest. We do see an increased opportunity for those distributed Power Generation opportunities over time, and we think that's a secular growth trend again that we're very excited about. As you think about Energy & Transportation, there's a lot of components there. So when you ask the question about kind of mix in Oil and Gas versus Power Generation generally, we do quite well margin-wise in our large engines.\nSo that's something that we're quite excited about opportunities that we see moving forward. Of course, Solar is a very good business as well. So again there's a lot of things there to think about, not just Power Generation, Oil and Gas, but as we think about Energy & Transportation moving forward and our ability to again to grow that business and achieve strong margins, we feel quite good.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to David Raso at Evercore ISI.\n\nDavid Raso\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nHi. Thank you for the time. I was curious, the retail sales and machines, it sounds like you're expecting to be down again in the second half of the year. But anything you're hearing from dealers to try to be thoughtful about when you would expect retail machines, you know, retail sales to pick back up, is there any indication from the order book or backlog within CI and RI? And with that, also, where do you expect the dealer inventory to end the year on machines? Thank you.\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar\n\nYeah, so let me start and try and help unpack that a little bit. So on the retail sales. Two factors obviously retail sales in the quarter. One, which was in North America, and most of that was actually rental fleet that does go into retail sales, but it actually is rental fleet loading by dealers. So that was most of that, and then Europe itself as well, which was still softer than we expect. Overall, our expectation now, part of the reason why we reduced our estimates for retail sales for the year is mostly due to that rental fleet loading.\nExpectations are that although as Jim said, dealer rental revenue is still growing nicely, they will not load their fleets as much as we had originally expected at the beginning of the year, and that's relatively moderate. Overall on dealer inventory, as I said at the beginning of the year. As you know, dealer inventory is very complex, David. It's multiple segments, multiple business units, multiple dealers. Dealers are independent businesses. We expected the dealer inventory to be about flat for the year. We now expect a small reduction of machine dealer inventory.\nAlmost all of that will be in Resource Industries, which, as you know, is more a function of commissioning rather than anything else. Overall, we expect to end the year with dealer inventory on the CI side about flatish and comfortably within the typical range that we talk about of three to four months.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Michael Feniger at Bank of America.\n\nMichael Feniger\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you for taking my question. I'm curious, when you look at your different segments, if we're entering a lower interest rate environment, a Fed easing cycle, where do you see what segments kind of reacting to a lower rate environment first. And just, just basically following up on that with the construction side with your response to David, just, is the assumption with your comfortability on the inventories, is that assuming that dealer retail sales gets better by the end of the year, or is it assuming where we are today? Thank you.\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar\n\nMaybe I'll start, then I'll kick it over to Andrew just to talk about interest rates a bit. So if you stop and think about our business, there are certain aspects that are not as sensitive to interest rate movements, and think about the build out in data centers around Power Generation, Oil and Gas generally, and government infrastructure as well. We talked a lot about in our previous calls the regulatory environment that has been supporting buildouts in North America, and we still feel good about that, and obviously that is less interest rate sensitive.\nThe parts of our business that are more interest rate sensitive. Think about someone building possibly a warehouse in North America and needs construction equipment for that. Those kinds of activities do tend to be more interest rate sensitive. So if interest rates come down, that certainly has the possibility to improve that business. And then I'll let Andrew.\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar\n\nYeah, just on the dealer inventory thing, just a reminder. Obviously, from today to the end of the year, we expect a reduction in machine dealer inventory as I talked about, which is in line with our normal seasonal trend. Overall, effectively, our assumption of flattish dealer inventory in CI and remaining within the typical range implies is based on our expectations of retail sales and is always a forward-looking retail sales expectation rather than a backward-looking retail sales expectation.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Jerry Revich at Goldman Sachs.\n\nJerry Revich\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYes, hi. Good morning everyone.\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar\n\nHi Jerry.\n\nJerry Revich\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, Jim and Andrew, I'm wondering if you just talk about what your prospect list looks like in Resource Industries based on industry and your competitor data. It looks like we've hit an air pocket in terms of orders, and you know, obviously deliveries have been weaker and we've seen destock. Based on what you're seeing from your customers, when do you expect bookings to reaccelerate for mining trucks and other equipment?\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar\n\nThanks for your question, Jerry. You know, as I mentioned earlier, you know there's a lot of positives in mining. Certainly the utilization of our equipment is high. The number of parked trucks is relatively low. We expect robust service activities. Having said that, our customers are displaying capital discipline, but at the same time, one thing to keep in mind is, you know, one of the reasons that we saw lower sales is that we had a backlog of a couple of products that we talked about in our prepared remarks, articulated trucks and off-highway trucks. And as we worked our way through that, that created a relative comp issue that you're seeing today.\nBut having said that, certainly there's a lot of interest in commodities such as copper, and we've seen areas of strength in things like large mining trucks and that activity as well, and that's positive. We remain bullish about mining just thinking about the energy transition and all of the commodities that our customers will use our products to produce. So again. We're not too concerned about just a quarterly deviation. What we're really focused on is more the medium and long term over time and we remain quite bullish on the mining business.\n\nOperator\n\nI'll take our next question from Tami Zakaria at JPMorgan.\n\nTami Zakaria\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHey, good morning. Thank you so much. So my question is more longer term focus rather than this quarter or year. So can you help us frame how to think about Caterpillar's current portfolio of products that play into the data center market? Aside from backup generators, are there any other products maybe related to microgrids or anything else to call out where you see an opportunity? And related to that, besides E&T as a segment, do data centers provide opportunities for any products or services within CI or RI as well over the medium to long term?\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar\n\nWe do believe. Thank you for your question. We do believe that the data center build out creates opportunities in many areas across our business. So you mentioned backup generators. That's obviously a opportunity which is here today that we're dealing with. In addition, I mentioned earlier the fact that data centers is increasing Power Generation requirements. So in the United States, I think I have the stats right, electricity demand was flat between 2007 and 2022 and now it started to increase. Of course our customers use our products to produce the commodities to satisfy that increasing electricity demand.\nIn addition to that, I talked about the fact that both our reciprocating engines and our gas turbines we believe have the opportunity to be used in what we call distributed Power Generation applications. A lot of that again is tied back to that data center buildout. As electricity demand in the developed world continues to increase, and of course in the developing world, the standards of living increase, Power Generation demands go up as well. And again, that's an opportunity for us as our customers use our products to produce the commodities to satisfy the increasing demand. In addition to that, yes, we do provide microgrids in our Power Generation organization.\nWe work with customers to set up microgrids. That's one of the things that we do have the ability to do. We're pretty uniquely positioned just given our portfolio of products to help our customers do that. Also, you know, as you think about data center buildout, well, of course that requires construction machinery as well, and that helps our construction equipment business. And then, of course, thinking about copper and the other commodities that need to be produced to also support what's happening with increased Power Generation requirements that helps RI. So I believe that the data center build out helps a whole variety of products across our portfolio.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Mig Dobre at Baird.\n\nMircea Dobre\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Just a quick follow up on construction pricing. I guess it sounds like you expect a little bit of erosion here, but maybe we can get some insight in terms of the magnitude. You know, I'm looking back at 2016, that's the last year where I think we saw two, three percentage points. Is that kind of a fair expectation to have going forward? And how do you think about used prices in this market and the potential impact that that might have as we think about 2025 even? Thank you.\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar\n\nYeah, Mig. So absolutely will not be that sort of level of magnitude. We obviously see a normal element of competitive positioning, which obviously impacts pricing. Obviously we don't expect list price changes. This will be really about customer by customer discussions. On the impact of used market. The used market obviously has had some impact, had seen some erosion of price. Actually, quite interestingly, where that impacts us more is around CAT Financial, and actually, although used prices are coming down, they are still relatively high compared to historic levels, and inventories are very low. So we are not expecting that to impact us.\nThe other area obviously does impact used prices would be around rental fleet, and obviously that and higher interest rates are having some impact on rental fleet loading, as we talked about already in the call.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Kyle Menges at Citi.\n\nKyle Menges\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nThank you and good morning, guys. It'd be helpful just to hear a little bit more about the rental fleet loading, kind of changing your expectations there for the second half of the year. I am curious just to parse out just what is kind of demand related, like softening demand in the second half, versus you trying to manage the rental fleets, versus kind of dealers trying to, you know, pushing back a little bit about taking fleet. Just would love to hear kind of what's driving that. Thank you.\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar\n\nYeah, so obviously you know, as Jim mentioned, rental, dealer rental revenue is actually increasing positively as we expected for the year, and that's driven by the level of activity. Our assumption when we started the planning year was that dealer fleet loading would be a certain number. It is slightly less than that, and that's why we have taken it down. It is more around the fact that they are not loading their fleets quite as quickly, and they're managing their fleet. That's what they do. They're independent businesses. They make decisions around how much fleet, how they move the fleet out into the market as well.\nRemember also when you talk about rental fleet, particularly around things like heavy rents. Heavy rents are effectively a long, actually almost rent-to-buy. Often, that market is dependent on the customer choice as well. So it's not just the dealer here, you also have the customer at the other end of that equation as well as to when the timing, when they make that final purchase. So a lot of those things. So it's a little bit complex, and therefore it's just one size fits all. But generally we're still very comfortable, as Jim said, with the opportunity in front of their dealers on the rental side and we're very positive about the long term outlook.\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar",
    "content2": "And maybe just to add in, we want our dealers to have a profitable growing rental business, and utilization is an important part of that. So it's not a situation where we're encouraging them to take more equipment than they need. We don't want them to take more equipment from us than they need. We want them to have a growing, profitable rental business. And we believe that's a growing opportunity for them and for us over time, and again, there'll be quarterly deviations in terms of how much equipment they decide to take into their rental fleets.\nThe point is it's a growing growth opportunity for both us and our dealers and we're very supportive, and are helping them with a whole variety of tools, whether it's digital tools, and also other methodologies to help them grow their rental business.\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar\n\nYeah, just again, just contextualizing sort of from a size perspective because I think sometimes things seem a little bit bigger. Just remind you then in terms of CI, you know, this is still a relatively small number, but it is what is driving some of that change in our outlook, which again is relatively modest. So just before people start worrying that it's a bigger element and a bigger number than it really is, remember Stu's OEM sales? About 40% of our revenues come from services across the business. Only about 60% is original equipment. And again, you know, that does vary by segment. And North America is not 100% of CI sales either.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Steven Fisher at UBS.\n\nSteven Fisher\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThanks. Good morning. You mentioned, Jim, that gas compression is starting to soften a little bit. Curious just kind of where you are in the backlog there. Do you expect your sales in gas compression to actually be down year over year in the second half? And maybe what visibility do you have to rebuilding the backlog there and what it might take? Is it, you know, a next round of big LNG projects? Or how do we think about that? Thank you.\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar\n\nYeah, so we do expect for the year, I believe I said that we expect gas compression year over year to be higher, so higher in 2024 than 2023. We did say we expected a bit of softening in the second half, but still again for gas compression higher in 2024 total than in 2023. You asked about backlog again. We do have quite a strong backlog in our large engines across and our gas turbines around E&T. So again we feel good about that as well. And the comment we made about gas compression, that was really recip Oil and Gas we expected to soften in the second half of the year.\nSolar Turbines also serves Oil and Gas and our comment was about recip engines in Oil and Gas and again, a lot of strength in E&T overall.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next. Angel Castillo at Morgan Stanley.\n\nAngel Castillo\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to maybe unpack the backlog dynamic around CI if you could give us a little bit more color. So kind of three-part question. One, what were the orders in the second quarter for CI? Two, kind of on the backlog, what's kind of the coverage that you have at this point versus your historical levels? Just given that we've had pretty strong demand over a number of years. And then kind of lastly, just can you talk about kind of the price margin mix within that backlog as we kind of have visibility now looking forward versus maybe what was in there before?\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar\n\nYeah, so Angel, we obviously do not break down backlog by segment. So that's just a point. I would say to you though, we did have a higher level of orders in the second quarter in CI of 2023. Part of that was, if you remember, we did see a dealer inventory build in the third quarter. Some of that was ahead of an engine switchover. So it's not a, it is down quarter-over-year. But that is partly because of the comparison. And we actually, you know, as a result of that change in the MPI last year, new product introduction.\nAgain, similarly, you know, mix varies across the businesses, and obviously there are different parts of our business which are more profitable than others. And you did see, we do see favorable product mix in CI, and obviously that does remain, you know, that is a function of what products are being sold and in what proportion. With regards to the backlog, I mean, the backlog for CI reflects availability, and as you know, availability now is pretty good. And that lies in about a 13-week time period, which we would consider to be about the norm of three months.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Tim Thein at Raymond James.\n\nTimothy Thein\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Raymond James\n\nGreat, thank you. Good morning, Jim, maybe a question for you. Just on another CI related one. Just on the balance between market share and pricing, and just thinking obviously over the long term, PINS a very important concept for CAT, and just thinking about how you tie in with that, the ambition to grow services. Just thinking as to, you know, as the market, you know, first time in some time now we're dealing with kind of free flowing supply and maybe, you know, a little bit more competition and capital directed at North America. Just how you balance, how you and the dealers balance that. Again, motivation to grow PINS while also, you know, kind of balancing that price equation. Thank you.\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar\n\nCertainly PINS are very important to us, and we make pricing decisions based on a whole variety of inputs. Obviously, we look at our input costs, we look at our competitive situation, and we're continually working to add more value to our customers, so it's not just a price situation. Price is important, and we need to remain competitive. But again, we have some real advantages. We believe one is our dealer network. Again, one of our most significant competitive advantages. We have a distribution network that none of our competitors have. In addition to that, we continue to invest significantly in technology to help our customers be more successful.\nAll the tools that we're putting into our machines to, for example, allow a customer to hire a relatively inexperienced operator and have them operate a machine like a pro who's been at it for many years. So again, there's a lot that goes into that. A lot of investments in services capabilities, a lot of investments in technology as well. But certainly, yes, we recognize PINS are important and it helps seed the market for future services growth and it's something we're very focused on.\n\nRyan Fiedler\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Caterpillar\n\nHey Audra, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Today's final question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank.\n\nNicole DeBlase\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah, thanks. Good morning, guys.\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar\n\nHi, Nicole.\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar\n\nGood morning, Nicole.\n\nNicole DeBlase\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nJust a couple of follow-ups on CI. I guess I was kind of surprised by the strength in Latin America this quarter. Big year-on-year growth. Can you just talk a little bit about, you know, the drivers there and also what you're seeing in EAME, and is there any signs of life in Europe or things just kind of bouncing along the bottom there? Thank you.\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar\n\nYeah. So Nicole, on Latin America, actually Brazil was strong, which is an important market for us. And that was a, that was part of the reason for the strength, so that was good. And obviously we'll keep an eye out and hope that that continues as we go through the remainder of the year and looking forward. Europe, as we indicated, has been a problem. It's been a problem, I think most of our competitors have made similar comments as well. It does seem to be a little bit on the bottom. Obviously, it's depending on what happens there.\nObviously, you've seen the ECB cut rates. There is, for example, today in the UK, they were talking about construction, actually, growth in construction this last month. So hopefully it is starting to pick up. But our assumption really is that it doesn't pick up that quickly for the remainder of the year.\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar\n\nAll right, well, that will just thank you all for your questions. We greatly appreciate it. I want to just close by thanking our global team for their strong execution in the first half of the year, achieved higher adjusted operating profit margin, record adjusted profit per share, and strong ME&T free cash flow. Our results continue to reflect the benefit of the diversity of our end markets as well as our disciplined execution of our strategy for long-term profitable growth. With that, I'll turn it back to Ryan.\n\nRyan Fiedler\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Caterpillar\n\nThanks Jim, Andrew, and everyone who joined us today. A replay of our call will be available online later this morning. We'll also post a transcript on our investor relations website as soon as it's available. You'll also find a second quarter results video with our CFO and an SEC filing with our sales to users data. Click on investors.caterpillar.com and then click on Financials to view those materials. If you have any questions, just please reach out to Rob or me. The Investor Relations general phone number is 309-675-4549. Now let's turn the call back to Audra to conclude our call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That concludes our call for today. Thank you for joining. You may all disconnect."

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ryan Fiedler. Thank you, and please go ahead.\n\nRyan Fiedler\n\nThanks, Abby. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Caterpillar's Third Quarter of 2023 Earnings Call. I'm Ryan Fiedler, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me today are Jim Umpleby, Chairman and CEO; Andrew Bonfield, Chief Financial Officer; Kyle Epley, Senior Vice President of the Global Finance Services Division; and Rob Rengel, Senior IR Manager.\nDuring our call, we'll be discussing the third quarter earnings release we issued earlier today.

For a reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers to the appropriate U.S. GAAP numbers, please see the appendix of the earnings call slides.\nNow let's turn to Slide 3 and turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Jim Umpleby.\n\nD. James Umpleby\n\nChief Executive Officer, Caterpillar, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ryan. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Before discussing our results, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the tragic events in the Middle East. We are deeply saddened by the loss of life and are hopeful for a quick and peaceful resolution. The Caterpillar Foundation is donating $1 million to the American Red Cross and its network of Red Crescent Societies in the region to support the humanitarian needs of those impacted.\nAs we close out the third quarter, I want to thank our global team for delivering another strong quarter. This included double-digit top line growth, strong adjusted operating profit margin and robust ME&T free cash flow.\nOur results continue to reflect healthy demand across most of our end markets for our products and services. We remain focused on executing our strategy and continue to invest for long-term profitable growth.\nI'll begin with my perspectives about our performance in the quarter. I'll then provide some insights about our end markets. Lastly, I'll provide an update on our sustainability journey.\nMoving to quarterly results. It was another strong quarter. Sales and revenues increased 12% in the third quarter versus last year. Adjusted operating profit margin improved to 20.8%, up significantly year-over-year. We also generated $2.9 billion of ME&T free cash flow in the quarter.\nSales were generally in line with our expectations, while both adjusted operating profit margin and ME&T free cash flow in the third quarter were better than we expected. In addition, we ended the quarter with a healthy backlog of $28.1 billion. Backlog is a function of demand and lead times. As I've mentioned, demand remains healthy in most of our end markets. Due to improving supply chain conditions, product availability and lead times have improved for many products.\nDealers and customers can wait longer to place orders, which has led to a moderation in order rates as expected. In addition, we have seen a reduction in dealer orders for building construction products, which we anticipated due to the changeover to Cat engines that we previously discussed and for excavation in anticipation of dealers reducing their inventories in the fourth quarter. Although our backlog decline is expected, it still remains elevated as a percentage of revenues compared to historic levels. While we continue to closely monitor global macroeconomic conditions, we now expect our full year 2023 results to be better than we anticipated during our last earnings call.\nTurning to Slide 4. In the third quarter of 2023, sales and revenues increased by 12% to $16.8 billion driven primarily by favorable price realization as well as volume growth. Sales increased in each of our 3 primary segments. Compared with the third quarter of 2022, overall sales to users increased 13%, which was below our expectations.\nEnergy & Transportation sales to users increased 34% but was lower than expected due to some supply chain challenges for large engines and the timing of gas turbine and international locomotive deliveries. For machines, which includes Construction Industries and Resource Industries, sales to users rose by 7%, in line with expectations.\nSales to users in Construction Industries were up 6%. North American sales to users increased as demand remained healthy for nonresidential and residential construction. Nonresidential continued to benefit from government-related infrastructure and construction projects.\nResidential sales to users in North America also increased in the quarter. EAME sales to users were up slightly primarily due to continuing strength in Middle East construction activity. In Latin America and Asia Pacific, sales to users declined in the quarter.\nIn Resource Industries, sales to users increased 10%. In mining, sales to users increased with commodities remaining above investment thresholds. Within heavy construction and quarry and aggregates, sales to users also increased supported by growth for infrastructure-related projects.\nIn Energy & Transportation, sales to users increased by 34%. All applications saw higher sales to users in the quarter. Oil and gas sales to users benefited from strong sales of turbines and turbine-related services. We also saw continued strength in sales of reciprocating engines into oil and gas applications such as Tier 4 dynamic gas blending, repowering well servicing fleets and gas compression.\nPower generation sales to users continue to remain positive due to favorable market conditions, including strong data center growth. Industrial and transportation sales to users also increased. Dealer inventories increased by $600 million in the quarter, led by Construction Industries and followed by Energy & Transportation.\nIn Construction Industries, the increase was in North America in some of our most constrained product lines, including BCP and earthmoving. We remain very comfortable with the total level of dealer inventory, which is within the typical range. Andrew will provide more color later in the call.\nAdjusted operating profit margin increased to 20.8% in the third quarter, a 430 basis point increase over last year. Adjusted operating profit margin was better than we had anticipated. Relative to our expectations, we saw lower-than-expected manufacturing costs, including freight as well as slightly favorable price realization, which included a positive impact from geographic mix.\nMoving to Slide 5. We generated strong ME&T free cash flow of $2.9 billion in the third quarter and $6.8 billion in the first 3 quarters of 2023.\nYear-to-date, we returned $4.1 billion to shareholders, which included about $2.2 billion in repurchased stock and $1.9 billion in dividends. We remain proud of our dividend aristocrat status and continue to expect to return substantially all ME&T free cash flow to shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases.\nNow on Slide 6, I'll describe our expectations moving forward. As I mentioned earlier, we now anticipate the full year to be better than we previously expected. We expect our adjusted operating profit margin to be slightly above the targeted range relative to the corresponding level of sales. This positive operating performance increases our expectation for ME&T free cash flow, which we now expect will exceed the $4 billion to $8 billion target range for the full year. This outlook for the adjusted operating profit margin and ME&T free cash flow reflect healthy customer demand and our strong operating performance.\nNow I'll discuss our outlook for key end markets, starting with Construction Industries. In North America overall, we continue to see positive momentum. We expect continued growth in nonresidential construction in North America due to the impact of government-related infrastructure investments and a healthy pipeline of construction projects. Although residential construction growth has moderated, we expect it to remain healthy.\nIn Asia Pacific, excluding China, we expect growth in Construction Industries due to public infrastructure spending in support of commodity prices. As we have mentioned during previous earnings calls, we anticipate continued weakness in China and expect it to remain well below our typical range of 5% to 10% of enterprise sales.\nIn EAME, we anticipate the region will be slightly down as weakness continues in Europe, partially offset by continuing strong construction demand in the Middle East. Construction activity in Latin America is expected to be about flat versus strong 2022 performance.\nIn Resource Industries, we continue to see a high level of quoting activity. In mining, customer product utilization remains high. The number of parked trucks remains low, and the age of the fleet remains elevated.\nOrder rates are slightly lower than we expected at this time, reflecting continued capital discipline by our customers. We continue to believe the energy transition will support increased commodity demand over time, expanding our total addressable market and providing further opportunities for long-term profitable growth.\nIn addition, customer acceptance of our autonomous solutions continues to grow. This is evidenced by the announcement this morning with Freeport-McMoran who will convert their fleet of Cat 793 large mining trucks at an Arizona copper mine to autonomous haulage using Cat MineStar Command. We also expect heavy construction and quarry and aggregates to remain in healthy levels due to major infrastructure and nonresidential construction projects.\nMoving to Energy & Transportation. In oil and gas, we remain encouraged by continuing strong demand for Cat reciprocating engines and gas compression. As we said last quarter, while servicing in North America is showing some short-term moderation, but we remain optimistic about future demand.\nCat reciprocating engine demand for power generation is expected to remain strong primarily driven by data center growth. New equipment and services for solar turbines in both oil and gas and power generation remain robust. Industrial demand is expected to soften slightly from recent high levels but remains well above our historical averages. In transportation, we anticipate strength in high-speed marine as customers continue to upgrade aging fleets.\nAs we've described, we continue to see strength in most of our end markets. Based on our backlog, dealer inventory and current market conditions, we expect to have another good year in 2024. We will provide additional information during our fourth quarter call.\nMoving to Slide 7. We continue to advance our sustainability journey. We're helping our customers achieve their climate-related objectives by continuing to invest in new products, technologies and services that facilitate fuel flexibility, increased operational efficiency and reduced emissions.\nFor example, Caterpillar provides a number of low-carbon intensity solutions to customers. In Construction Industries, the Cat 980 XE wheel loader, which features a Cat-designed and manufactured continuous variable transmission, improves fuel efficiency by as much as 35% and reduces CO2 emissions by as much as 17% compared to the previous model.\nWe also introduced the new Cat G3600 Gen 2 engine, the latest evolution of the powerful G3600 series offering lower emissions. With more than 8,500 Cat G3600 units in the field, the Gen 2 engine is designed to build upon the platform's robust performance to provide a 10% increase in power and lower emissions compared to the previous model.\nWe've also made several joint announcements with customers that demonstrate our commitment to supporting their climate-related objectives. I'll highlight one here.\nIn September, Caterpillar and Albemarle introduced a unique collaboration aimed to support their efforts to establish Kings Mountain, North Carolina as the first-ever 0 emissions lithium mine in North America, while also making lithium available for use in Caterpillar battery production. These examples reinforce our ongoing sustainability leadership and how we're helping our customers build a better, more sustainable world.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew R. J. Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with commentary on the third quarter results, including the performance of our segments. Then I'll discuss the balance sheet and cash flow before concluding with our assumptions for the fourth quarter and full year.\nBeginning on Slide 8, our overall operating performance was strong. Adjusted operating profit margin, adjusted profit per share and ME&T free cash flow all were better than we expected, while sales grew in line with our expectations.\nBased on the strong third quarter and year-to-date operating performance, we now expect that the adjusted operating profit margin for the year will be slightly above the top end of our target range at the corresponding level of sales. We also anticipate that ME&T free cash flow will exceed the target range of $4 billion to $8 billion.\nIn summary, sales and revenues increased by 12% or $1.8 billion to $16.8 billion. The sales increase versus the prior year was driven primarily by price realization as well as higher sales volume.\nOperating profit increased by 42% or $1 billion to $3.4 billion. The adjusted operating profit margin was 20.8%, an increase of 430 basis points versus the prior year.\nProfit per share was $5.45 in the third quarter of this year. This included restructuring costs of $0.07 per share as compared to $0.08 in the prior year. We continue to expect restructuring expenses of about $700 million for the full year.\nAdjusted profit per share increased by 40% to $5.52 in the third quarter compared to $3.95 last year. Other income of $195 million was lower than that -- than the third quarter of 2022 by $47 million. The decline was driven by less favorable currency impact in the quarter related to ME&T balance sheet translation as compared to the prior year along with the recurring increase in the pension expense of approximately $80 million per quarter. Higher investment and interest income acted as a partial offset.\nThe provision for income taxes in the third quarter, excluding discrete items, reflected a global annual effective tax rate of 22.5%, which is the rate we now expect for the full year. The slightly lower-than-expected tax rate along with discrete items added about $0.14 to profit per share in the quarter.\nMoving on to Slide 9. As I mentioned, the 12% increase in the top line versus the prior year was primarily due to price realization as well as higher sales volume. Volume improved as sales to users increased by 13%, while year-over-year changes in dealer inventory acted as a slight offset.\nOverall, the magnitude of the sales increase was in line with our expectations. However, by segment, Construction Industries sales were higher, Resource Industries were in line and Energy & Transportation sales were lower than we had anticipated.\nServices revenues increased in the third quarter. We will update you with our progress towards our services growth target when we report our fourth quarter results and as is our normal practice.\nPrice realization was slightly better than we had expected for the quarter. However, as we anticipated, we did see the magnitude of the year-over-year price effect moderate compared to the second quarter as we lapped prior year price increases.\nVolume was slightly below our expectations. As Jim mentioned, sales to users were lower than we had anticipated, principally in Energy & Transportation. However, this was nearly offset by the increase in dealer inventory versus our expectations of being about flat for the quarter.\nThe increase in dealer inventory was driven primarily by Construction Industries. There, we had stronger-than-expected shipments in North America, particularly in building construction products and earthmoving.\nWithin North America, these products remain constrained and are near the bottom end of the typical dealer inventory range of 3 to 4 months of sales. We also saw some dealer inventory increase in Energy & Transportation within the quarter.\nI'll remind you that dealer inventory in Energy & Transportation and Resource Industries is mainly a function of the commissioning pipeline with over 70% of dealer inventory in these segments backed by firm customer orders. Because dealer inventory is more a function of commissioning in Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation, it is difficult for us to predict in these 2 segments. I will discuss further our full year expectations for dealer inventories a little bit later.\nMoving to Slide 10. Third quarter operating profit increased by 42% to $3.4 billion, while adjusted operating profit increased by 41% to $3.5 billion. Price realization, which included a slight benefit from a shift in the geographic mix of sales, and sales volume were favorable in the quarter.\nOur largest headwinds to operating profit were higher SG&A and R&D expenses and higher manufacturing costs. SG&A and R&D expenses included higher strategic investment spend. Manufacturing cost increases included higher material costs and unfavorable cost absorption as we reduced our inventories compared to a corresponding increase in the third quarter of 2022. Lower freight costs acted as a partial offset within manufacturing costs.\nThe adjusted operating profit margin of 20.8% improved by 430 basis points. This was better than we had anticipated primarily due to favorable manufacturing costs, of which freight was the largest contributor. Also the slightly better-than-expected price held margins.\nNow I'll discuss the performance of the segments. On Slide 11, Construction Industries sales increased by 12% in the third quarter to $7 billion primarily due to favorable price realization.\nBy region, sales in North America rose by 31% due to higher sales volume and favorable price. As I mentioned, supply chain improvements enabled stronger-than-expected shipments in North America, which supported some dealer restocking. Sales of equipment to end users were in line with our expectations for the region.\nSales in Latin America decreased by 31% primarily due to lower sales volume, partially offset by favorable price. In EAME, sales increased by 8% mainly due to federal price and currency impacts. Sales in Asia Pacific decreased by 8% primarily due to lower sales volume driven by lower sales of equipment to end users.\nThird quarter profit for Construction Industries increased by 53% versus the prior year to $1.8 billion. The increase was mainly due to favorable price realization. The segment's operating margin of 26.4% was an increase of 710 basis points versus last year. Margin exceeded our expectations on better volume, price and lower-than-anticipated manufacturing costs, primarily freight.\nTurning to Slide 12. Resource Industries sales grew by 9% in the third quarter to $3.4 billion. The increase was primarily due to favorable price realization, partially offset by lower sales volume. Volume decreases, higher sales of equipment to end users were more than offset by lower aftermarket subparts volume, which reflected changes in dealer buying patterns.\nThird quarter profit for Resource Industries increased by 44% versus the prior year to $730 million mainly due to favorable price realization. Profit was partially offset by the impact of lower sales volume, which included unfavorable product mix.\nThe segment's operating margin of 21.8% was an increase of 540 basis points versus last year. Margin was better than we had expected primarily due to lower-than-anticipated manufacturing costs driven by freight and price.\nNow on Slide 13. Energy & Transportation sales increased by 11% in the third quarter to $6.9 billion. Sales were up across all applications. Oil and gas sales increased by 26%. Power generation sales were higher by 21%. Industrial sales rose by 5%, and transportation sales increased by 6%.\nThird quarter profit for Energy & Transportation increased by 26% versus the prior year to $1.2 billion. The increase was mainly due to favorable price realization and higher sales volume, partially offset by higher SG&A and R&D expenses, unfavorable manufacturing costs and currency impacts.\nSG&A and R&D expenses reflected ramping investments related to strategic growth initiatives. A reminder that most of our strategic investments relating to electrification and alternative fuels occur in the segment, which impacts reported margins.\nThe segment's operating margin of 17.2% was an increase of 210 basis points versus the prior year. Margin was lower than we had anticipated primarily due to lower-than-expected sales volume impacted by supply chain challenges for large engines and delivery delays for solar turbines.\nMoving to Slide 14. Financial Products revenue increased by 20% to $979 million primarily due to higher average financing rates across all regions. Segment profit decreased by 8% to $203 million. The decrease was mainly due to a higher provision for credit losses at Cat Financial. The unfavorable impact reflects a challenging comparison as we had reserve releases in the prior year as compared to a more typical provision expense in the third quarter of 2023.\nOf note though, through the third quarter of this year, provision expense for a comparable 9-month period is at the lowest level for over 20 years. Business activity remains strong with our -- and our portfolio continues to perform well with past dues and write-offs at historic low levels. Past dues in the quarter were 1.96%, a 4 basis point improvement compared to the third quarter of 2022 and a decrease of 19 basis points compared to the second quarter.\nRetail new business volume increased versus the prior year. And though it declined compared to the second quarter, this follows the typical seasonal pattern. In addition, we continue to see strong demand for used equipment, and used inventory remains at low levels.\nNow on Slide 15. Our ME&T free cash flow has been robust this year with another $2.9 billion generated during the third quarter. With $6.8 billion generated through the first 3 quarters of this year, we expect to exceed our target of $4 billion to $8 billion this year.\nFrom a working capital perspective, we had a small inventory decrease of around $200 million in the quarter. Looking ahead, we expect our inventory levels will continue to decrease as we see sustained supply chain improvement.\nCapEx in the third quarter was around $400 million. With about $1.1 billion in CapEx through the first 3 quarters, we continue to expect around $1.5 billion for the full year.\nOur balance sheet remains strong. We have ample liquidity with an enterprise cash balance of $6.5 billion, and we hold an additional $4.3 billion in slightly longer-dated liquid marketable securities to improve yields on that cash.\nNow on Slide 16, I will share some high-level assumptions for the fourth quarter and the full year. During the fourth quarter, we anticipate slightly higher sales as compared to the prior year. Price should remain favorable. We expect sales to users to continue to support good underlying growth though changes in dealer inventories should act as an offset.\nAs a reminder, we saw dealers increase inventories by $700 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 whilst we expect a decrease in the fourth quarter of this year. Specifically in Construction Industries, we do not expect the seasonal sales increase typically seen from the third to the fourth quarter. Those sales to users are expected to increase on both a sequential and year-over-year basis.\nInstead, we anticipate lower shipment volumes as we complete the Cat engine changeover in building construction products and dealers reduce their inventories, principally of excavators. This compares to a dealer inventory increase in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nThough we now expect that dealer inventory in Construction Industries will be higher at the end of 2023 than it was at the year-end 2022, we still expect it to be within the typical 3 to 4 months of sales range. A reminder, this is an average across all dealers and all products in Construction Industries and is difficult to predict with precision, given over 150 independent dealers and hundreds of different products.\nSimilar to last quarter, there are still areas and/or products where dealers would like to have more inventory. As Jim has mentioned, we are very comfortable with the level of inventory held by dealers overall.\nIn Resource Industries, we anticipate slightly lower sales as compared to the third quarter as a result of improvements in availability. We also expect lower sales versus the prior year driven by changes in dealer inventory. In the fourth quarter of 2022, there was an increase in dealer inventories for Resource Industries, while we expect to decrease in the fourth quarter of this year.\nWe expect sales in Energy & Transportation to increase in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter with higher solar turbines and rail deliveries. However, keep in mind that we continue to work through supply chain challenges primarily impacting large engines. We also anticipate some moderation in industrial sales during the fourth quarter compared to recent high levels.\nNow I'll comment on our expectations for margins. We provided our adjusted operating profit margin target chart to assist you in your modeling process. Based on our current planning assumptions, we anticipate the adjusted operating profit margin to be slightly above the target range for the full year 2023. This is based on the corresponding estimated level of sales. Your expectation of total enterprise sales this year will inform where margins could finish for the year.\nSpecific to the fourth quarter, we anticipate the adjusted operating profit margin to be lower than the third quarter. We anticipate lower-than-normal volume leverage, particularly impacting Construction Industries for the reasons I mentioned previously.\nWe also anticipate a negative segment mix impact operating margins as Construction Industries sales will be a lower proportion of total sales as compared to the third quarter. Price realization should remain positive, though we expect the magnitude of the favorability versus the prior year to moderate as we continue to lap more favorable pricing trends from last year. Therefore, the increases in margins that have occurred from price outpacing manufacturing cost inflation should moderate in the fourth quarter.\nIn addition, as you look down the income statement for the prior year, there are a couple of points to note. First, short-term incentive [indiscernible] in the fourth quarter of 2022 was lower than normal due to the true-up for the final outcomes for the financial year. This will be a headwind for year-over-year operating margins. However, this will be partially offset by favorability in other operating income and expense as we do not expect the significant currency translation losses that we saw in the fourth quarter of last year to recur.\nBy segment in Construction Industries, we expect slightly lower margin compared to the third quarter assuming lower volume. We also anticipate lower sequential margins in Resource Industries as is typical, impacted by cost absorption along with higher spend related to strategic investments.\nIn Energy & Transportation, we expect margins will be similar to the third quarter with stronger volume offset by manufacturing costs and an unfavorable mix of products, which includes international locomotive deliveries in rail.\nNow turning to Slide 17. Let me summarize. Adjusted profit per share is $15.98 through the first 3 quarters of the year, which already exceeds our previous full year record by 15%. We generated strong adjusted operating profit margin with a 430 basis point increase to 20.8%. We now expect to be slightly above the targeted range for adjusted operating profit margin for the full year based on our expected sales levels.\nME&T free cash flow remained robust with $6.8 billion year-to-date. We now expect ME&T free cash flow to exceed our $4 billion to $8 billion target range for the full year. We continue to execute our strategy for long-term profitable growth.\nAnd with that, we'll take your questions.",

James Umpleby\n\nChief Executive Officer, Caterpillar, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ryan. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. As we close out the first half of 2023, I want to recognize our global team for delivering a very strong second quarter. This included double-digit top line growth, higher adjusted operating profit margin, record adjusted profit per share and robust ME&T free cash flow. Our results continued to reflect healthy demand across most end markets for our products and services. We remain focused on executing our strategy and continue to invest for long-term profitable growth.\nIn today's call, I'll begin with my perspectives on our performance in the quarter. I'll then provide some insights on our end markets. Lastly, I'll provide an update on our sustainability journey.\nIt was another strong quarter. Sales and revenues increased 22% in the second quarter versus last year. Adjusted operating profit margin improved 21.3%, up sequentially and year-over-year. We also generated $2.6 billion of ME&T free cash flow in the quarter.\nOur second quarter results were better than we expected for sales and revenues, adjusted operating profit margin and ME&T free cash flow. In addition, we ended the quarter with a healthy backlog of $30.7 billion.\nWe continue to see improvement in the supply chain, which allowed us to increase production in the quarter. However, areas of challenge remain, particularly for large engines, which impacts energy and transportation and some of our larger machines. While we continue to closely monitor global macroeconomic conditions, we now expect our 2023 results to be better than we had previously anticipated.\nTurning to Slide 4. In the second quarter of 2023, sales and revenues increased by 22% to $17.3 billion. This was primarily due to higher sales volume and price realization. Sales volumes were higher than we expected, largely due to an increase in dealer inventory relating to energy and transportation, which is supported by customer orders. We saw double-digit increases in sales and revenues in each of our 3 primary segments. Compared with the second quarter of 2022, overall sales to users increased 16%. For machines, which includes Construction Industries and Resource Industries, sales to users rose by 8%. Energy & Transportation was up 47%.\nSales to users in Construction Industries were up 3%. North American sales to users increased and were better than expected as demand remained healthy for nonresidential and residential construction. Nonresidential continue to benefit from government-related infrastructure and construction projects.\nResidential sales to users in North America also increased in the quarter. EAME saw lower sales to users due to weaker-than-expected market conditions in Europe. The Middle East continued to demonstrate strong construction activity. In Latin America and Asia/Pacific, sales to users declined in the quarter.\nIn Resource Industries, sales to users increased 26%. In mining, sales to users increased, supported by commodities remaining above investment thresholds. Within heavy construction and quarry and aggregates, sales to users also increased, supported by growth for infrastructure-related projects.\nIn Energy & Transportation, sales to users increased by 47% in the second quarter. All applications saw higher sales to users in the quarter. Oil and gas sales to users benefited from strong sales of turbines and turbine-related services. We also saw continued strength in sales of [ restricting ] engines into oil and gas applications, such as Tier 4 dynamic gas blending, gas compression and repowering active well-servicing fleets.\nPower generation sales to users continued to remain positive due to favorable market conditions, including strong data center growth. Industrial and transportation sales to users also increased.\nDealer inventories increased by $600 million in the quarter, led by energy and transportation. We are very comfortable with the total level of dealer inventory, which remains in the typical range. Adjusted operating profit margin increased to 21.3% in the second quarter as we saw improvements, both on a sequential and year-over-year basis. Adjusted operating profit margin was better than we had anticipated, primarily due to better-than-expected volume growth and lower-than-expected manufacturing costs, including freight.\nMoving to Slide 5. We generated strong ME&T free cash flow of $2.6 billion in the second quarter. We returned $2 billion to shareholders, which included about $1.4 billion in repurchase stock and $600 million in dividends. In June, we announced an 8% dividend increase.\nSince May of 2019, when we introduced our current capital allocation strategy, we have increased the quarterly dividend per share by 51%. We remain proud of our dividend aristocrat status and continue to expect to return to substantially all ME&T free cash flow to shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases.\nNow on Slide 6, I'll describe our expectations moving forward. While we continue to closely monitor global macroeconomic conditions, our second quarter results lead us to expect that full year 2023 will now be even better than we described during our last earnings call. We now expect adjusted operating profit margins to be close to the top of the targeted range relative to the corresponding expected level of sales. This positive operating performance increases our expectations for ME&T free cash flow, which we now expect to be around the top of the $4 billion to $8 billion range for the full year. Our current expectations for adjusted operating profit margin and ME&T free cash flow reflect continuing healthy customer demand and our strong operating performance.\nNow I'll discuss our outlook for key end markets this year, starting with the Construction Industries. In North America, overall, we continue to see positive momentum in 2023. We expect continued growth in nonresidential construction in North America due to the positive impact of government-related infrastructure investments and a healthy pipeline of construction projects. Although residential construction growth has moderated, we expect the rest of 2023 to remain healthy.\nIn Asia/Pacific, excluding China, we expect growth in Construction Industries due to public infrastructure spending in support of commodity prices. We mentioned during our last earnings call that we expected sales in China to be below the typical 5% to 10% of our enterprise sales. We now expect further weakness as the 10-ton-and-above excavator industry has declined even more than we anticipated.\nIn EAME, we anticipate that it will be flat to slightly up overall, with the Middle East exhibiting strong construction demand, whereas Europe is expected to be down. Construction activity in Latin America is expected to be down in 2023 versus a strong 2022 performance.\nIn Resource Industries, we expect healthy mining demand to continue as commodity prices remain above investment thresholds. As I've mentioned previously, customers remain capital disciplined, which supports a gradual increase in mining over time. We anticipate production and utilization levels will remain elevated.\nWe also expect the age of the fleet and the low level of park trucks to support future demand for our equipment and services. We continue to believe the energy transition will support increased commodity demand, expanding our total addressable market and providing further opportunities for profitable growth.\nIn heavy construction and quarry and aggregates, we anticipate continued growth due to major infrastructure and nonresidential construction projects.\nNow I'll discuss Energy & Transportation. For Cat reciprocating engines and oil and gas applications, although customers remain disciplined, we are encouraged by continuing strong demand for gas compression. Cat reciprocating engine demand for power generation is expected to remain healthy, including strong data center growth. New equipment orders and services for solar turbines in both oil and gas and power generation remain robust. Industrial continues to be healthy. In transportation, we anticipate strength in high-speed Marine as customers continued to upgrade aging fleets.\nMoving to Slide 7. We continued to advance our sustainability journey. Since our last quarterly earnings call, we published our 2022 sustainability report, which disclosed our estimated Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions for the first time. We also published our first-ever task force on climate-related financial disclosures report. We're helping our customers achieve their climate-related goals by continuing to invest in new products, technologies and services that facilitate fuel flexibility, increased operational efficiency and reduced emissions.\nFor example, a customer in Chile is realizing fuel savings and lower emissions after purchasing our CAT D6 XE, the world's first high-drive diesel-electric drive dozer. The customer reported a 30% reduction in fuel consumption versus the previous model working in the same operation. This example reinforces our ongoing sustainability leadership in how we help our customers build a better, more sustainable world.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew R. J. Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with commentary on the second quarter results, including the performance of our business segments. Then I'll discuss the balance sheet and free cash flow before concluding with our assumptions for the remainder of the year, including color on the third quarter.\nBeginning on Slide 8. our team delivered a very strong second quarter as overall results exceeded our expectations on strong operating performance. We saw a healthy top line growth, improved operating margins and robust ME&T free cash flow. For the year, we now expect our adjusted operating profit margin to be close to the top of the targeted range at our anticipated sales level. We also expect ME&T free cash flow to be around the top of our $4 billion to $8 billion target range.\nTo summarize the results, sales and revenues increased by 22% or $3.1 billion to $17.3 billion. Sales increase versus the prior year was due to higher sales volume and price realization. Operating profit increased by 88% or $1.7 billion to $3.7 billion. The adjusted operating profit margin was 21.3%, an increase of 750 basis points versus the prior year.\nAdjusted profit per share increased by 75% to $5.55 in the second quarter compared to $3.18 last year. Profit per share was $5.67 in the second quarter of this year. This included a discrete deferred tax benefit of $0.17 per share, while restructuring costs were $0.05 per share, flat compared to the prior year. We continue to expect restructuring expenses of about $700 million for the full year.\nOther income of $127 million in the quarter was lower than the second quarter of 2022 by $133 million. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by an unfavorable currency impact related to ME&T balance sheet translation and a recurring increase in quarterly pension expense of approximately $80 million, which we initially spoke to you about in January. Higher investment and interest income acted as a partial offset.\nThe provision for income tax in the second quarter, excluding discrete items, reflected a global annual effective tax rate of approximately 23%, which remains our expectation for the full year.\nMoving on to Slide 9. The 22% increase in the top line versus the prior year was due to higher sales volume and price. Volume improved as sales to users increased by 16% and from changes in dealer inventory. Sales for the quarter were higher than we had anticipated, mostly due to volume. The volume outperformance reflected a dealer inventory increase, which was primarily due to our stronger-than-expected shipments in Energy & Transportation, particularly in power generation, which is in line with strong data center demand. Price realization was in line with our expectations for the quarter. As I mentioned, sales to users grew by 16% in the quarter. As Jim has discussed, demand remains healthy across most end markets for all our products and services and is supported by a healthy order backlog.\nMoving to Slide 10. Second quarter operating profit increased by 88%, while adjusted operating profit increased by 87% to $3.7 billion. Year-over-year favorable price realization and higher sales volume were partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, which largely reflected higher material costs. An increase in SG&A and R&D expenses included higher strategic investment spend.\nThe adjusted operating profit margin of 21.3% was better than we had anticipated. Volume exceeded our expectations, which supported the margin outperformance. In addition, manufacturing costs increased less than we expected due to lower freight costs and a lower-than-anticipated impact from cost absorption. SG&A and R&D expenses were about in line.\nMoving to Slide 11. I'll review the segment performance. Construction Industries sales increased by 19% in the second quarter to $7.2 billion due to price realization and higher sales volume. By region, sales in North America rose by 32% due to higher sales volume and price realization. Stronger demand and supply chain improvements enabled stronger-than-expected shipments in North America. This supported stronger sales of equipment to end users and some delivery stocking in what remains our most constrained region.\nSales in Latin America decreased by 11%, primarily due to lower sales volume, partially offset by price realization.\nIn EAME, sales increased by 20%, primarily the result of higher sales volume and price realization. Sales in Asia/Pacific were about flat.\nSecond quarter profit for Construction Industries increased by 82% versus the prior year to $1.8 billion. The increase was mainly due to price realization and higher sales volume. The segment's operating margin of 25.2% was an increase of 880 basis points versus last year. Margin exceeded our expectations, largely due to better-than-expected volume of freight costs, which were lower than we had anticipated.\nTurning to Slide 12. Resource Industries sales grew by 20% in the second quarter to $3.6 billion. The increase was primarily due to price realization and higher sales volume. Volume increased due to higher sales of equipment to end users. Although aftermarket sales volumes were lower, dealer sales to customers for services remained positive.\nSecond quarter profit for Resource Industries increased by 108% versus the prior year to $740 million, mainly due to price realization and higher sales volume. This was partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs, largely material costs. The segment's operating margin of 20.8% was an increase of 880 basis points versus last year. The segment's margin was better than we had expected, primarily due to favorable volume, timing of SG&A and R&D spend and lower-than-anticipated freight costs.\nNow on Slide 13. Energy & Transportation sales increased by 27% in the second quarter to $7.2 billion. Sales were up double digits across all applications. Oil and gas sales increased by 43%, power generation sales increased by 39%, industrial sales rose by 18% and transportation sales increased by 12%. Second quarter profit for Energy & Transportation increased by 93% versus the prior year to $1.3 billion. The increase was mainly due to higher sales volume and price realization, partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs and higher SG&A and R&D expenses. The segment's operating margin of 17.6% was an increase of 600 basis points versus last year. The margin was generally in line with our expectations.\nMoving to Slide 14. Financial Products revenue increased by 16% to $923 million, primarily due to higher average financing rates across all regions. Segment profit increased by 11% to $240 million. The increase was mainly due to a lower provision for credit losses at Cat Financial, partially offset by an increase in SG&A expense.\nBusiness activity remains strong, and our portfolio continues to perform well. Past dues in the quarter were 2.15%, a 4 basis points improvement compared to the second quarter of 2022. This is the lowest second quarter past dues percentage since 2007.\nRetail new business volume performed well, increasing versus the prior year and the first quarter. In addition, we continue to see strong demand for used equipment.\nNow on Slide 15. Our ME&T free cash flow generation was again robust as we generated $2.6 billion in the quarter. This was an increase of $1.5 billion compared to the prior year. With approximately $4 billion generated in the first half, we now expect ME&T free cash flow to be around the top of our $4 billion to $8 billion target range for the full year.\nCapEx in the second quarter was about $300 million, and we still expect to spend around $1.5 billion for the full year. As Jim mentioned, we returned about $2 billion through share repurchases and dividends in the second quarter.\nOur balance sheet remains strong. We have ample liquidity with an enterprise cash balance of $7.4 billion, and we also hold an additional $2 billion in slightly longer-dated liquid marketable securities to improve yields on that cash.\nNow turning to Slide 16. I will share some high-level assumptions for the second half and the third quarter. In the second half of 2023, we expect higher total sales and revenues as compared to the second half of last year. We anticipate both sales to users and price realization will be positive in the second half. Keep in mind that on a comparative basis, we start to lap the stronger price we saw from the third quarter onwards last year.\nCaterpillar sales will be impacted by changes in dealer inventories as dealers increased their inventories in the second half of last year, which is not typical, versus our expectation of a more typical reduction in the second half of 2023.\nI want to spend just a few moments talking about dealer inventories. Dealers are independent businesses, and they make their own decisions around the level of inventory they hold. We obviously work closely with them because this impacts our production levels. As Jim mentioned, we are very comfortable with the levels of inventory that dealers are holding.\nWe talk about dealer inventory in aggregate. This is difficult to predict with certainty as it arises from 3 different business segments, over 150 dealers and hundreds of different products. In Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation, dealer inventory is mainly a function of the commissioning pipeline. Keep in mind that over 70% of dealer inventory in these segments is backed by firm customer orders.\nFor Construction Industries, dealer inventory is principally a function of end-user demand and availability from the factory. In Construction Industries, dealers typically increase inventories during the first half of the year. Around 60% of the $2 billion increase during the first half of this year was from products in this segment. The remaining 40% is in Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation. For Resource Industries and Energy Transportation, we currently anticipate a slight reduction in levels in the second half but this is dependent on commissioning.\nIn Construction Industries, dealers are currently holding around the midpoint of the typical 3- to 4-month range. Some dealers would like to increase inventories of certain products, such as BCP and earth moving due to strong customer demand. Conversely, some dealers would like to reduce the levels of excavated inventory because of high availability.\nIn addition, we are scheduled to replace third-party engines with Cat engines and certain products, which will impact production in these products during the second half. Our current planning assumption for the Construction Industries is that dealers will reduce their overall levels in inventory in the second half of 2023 with a principal focus on excavators. Overall, at the enterprise level, we currently expect dealer inventory should be slightly higher at the end of 2023 versus last year.\nMoving on. On this slide, we provide our adjusted profit margins target charge to assist you in your modeling process. Based on our current planning assumptions, we anticipate full year adjusted operating profit margin to be close to the top of that 300 basis points target range at our expected sales level. Your expectation for total enterprise sales this year will inform you where on the curve margins should finish for the year.\nSpecific to the second half, we anticipate adjusted operating profit margins in the remaining quarters of the year will be above the year-ago levels, although they will be lower than the levels we saw in the first 2 quarters of this year. As compared to the first half, we anticipate a margin headwind from cost absorption in the second half. We do not expect to build our inventory as we did in the first half and anticipate that there will be some inventory reduction if we continue to see sustained supply chain improvement.\nIn addition, spend related to the strategic growth initiatives should continue to ramp. Price realization should remain positive that the magnitude of the favorability versus the prior year is expected to be lower in the second half as we lap the more favorable pricing trends from last year. Therefore, the increases in margins that we have occurred -- that have occurred from price outpacing manufacturing cost inflation should moderate in the second half of this year.\nNow let's move on to our assumptions that are specific to the third quarter. We anticipate third quarter sales to be higher than the third quarter of 2022, but to exhibit the typical sequential decline when compared to the second quarter of 2023.\nIn Construction Industries, as is our normal seasonal end, we expect lower sales [ in ] the second quarter. In Resource Industries, which can be lumpy, we anticipate slightly lower sales compared to the second quarter. We expect sales in Energy & Transportation will increase slightly compared to the second quarter.\nSpecific to third quarter margins versus the prior year, adjusted operating profit margins at the enterprise level and segment margins should be stronger. However, we do expect lower enterprise adjusted operating profit margins in the third quarter compared to the second quarter of this year on lower volume and impacts from cost absorption. We also anticipate investment spend will ramp across our primary segments as we continue to accelerate our strategic investments in area like autonomy, alternative fuels, connectivity and digital and electrification.\nAt the segment level, for Construction Industries, we expect a lower margin compared to the second quarter as is typical. This is largely due to lower quarter-on-quarter volume, increased investment in strategic initiatives and slightly higher manufacturing costs, including a headwind from cost absorption. Favorable price realization will act as a partial offset.\nWe also anticipate lower third quarter margins in Resource Industries compared to the second quarter, primarily due to lower volume quarter-on-quarter. Conversely, we expect third quarter margins in Energy & Transportation will be slightly higher compared to the second quarter on higher volume and stronger price realization, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs and spend relating to strategic initiatives.\nNow turning to Slide 13, let me summarize. We generated strong adjusted operating profit margin with a 750 basis point increase to 21.3%. We now expect to be close to the top of the targeted range for adjusted operating margin -- profit margin for the full year based on our expected sales levels.\nME&T free cash flow generation was robust at $2.6 billion in the quarter. We returned $2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We now expect ME&T free cash flow to be around the top of our $4 billion to $8 billion range for the full year. Lastly, we continue to execute our strategy for long-term profitable growth.\nAnd with that, we'll now take your questions.",

On today's call, we'll also refer to non-GAAP numbers. For a reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers to the appropriate U.S. GAAP numbers, please see the appendix of our earnings call slides. Now let's turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO Jim Umpleby.\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar\n\nThanks, Ryan. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. As we close out 2023, I'd like to start by recognizing our global team for delivering another strong quarter and the best year in our 98-year history. For the year, we delivered record sales and revenues, record adjusted profit margin, record adjusted profit per share, and record ME&T free cash flow. Our results continue to reflect healthy demand across most of our end markets for our products and services. We remain focused on executing our strategy and continue to invest for long-term profitable growth. I'll begin with my perspectives about our performance in the quarter and for the full year. I'll then provide some insights about our end markets, followed by an update on our strategy and sustainability journey. Moving to quarterly results, it was another strong quarter.\nWhile sales and revenues increased 3% in the fourth quarter versus a strong quarter last year, our adjusted operating profit increased by 15%. Adjusted operating profit margin improved to 18.9%, up 190 basis points versus last year. We also generated $3.2 billion of ME&T free cash flow in the quarter. Sales, adjusted operating profit margin, adjusted profit per share, and ME&T free cash flow in the fourth quarter were all better than we expected. For the full year, we generated a 13% increase in total sales and revenues to $67.1 billion. Services also increased by 5% to $23 billion, a record. We generated $13.7 billion of adjusted operating profit in 2023, up 51% from 2022. Adjusted operating profit margin for the full year was 20.5%, a 510 basis points increase over the prior year.\nThis exceeded the top end of our target margin range for this level of sales by 80 basis points. Adjusted profit per share in 2023 was $21.21, a 53% increase over 2022. In addition, we also generated $10 billion of ME&T free cash flow, exceeding the high end of our target range by over $2 billion for the full year. This performance led to continued growth in absolute OPACC dollars, which is our internal measure of profitable growth. As a result of our strong execution and record financial performance, we are increasing our target range for adjusted operating profit margin and ME&T free cash flow. We are increasing the top end of our adjusted operating profit margin range by 100 basis points relative to the corresponding level of sales.\nMoving to ME&T free cash flow, we've generated more than $30 billion over the last five years, including a record $10 billion in 2023. Based on our demonstrated ability to generate strong free cash flow, we are raising our ME&T free cash flow target range to $5 billion–$10 billion up from $4 billion-$8 billion. Andrew will provide additional details around these updated targets. Turning to Slide four, in the fourth quarter of 2023, sales and revenues increased by 3% to $17.1 billion, driven by favorable price realization, and partially offset by lower volume. Both price and volume were slightly better than we expected compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Overall, sales to users increased 8%, slightly better than our expectations. Energy and Transportation sales to users increased 20%. For machines, which includes construction industries, and Resource Industries, sales to users rose by 3%.\nSales to users in construction industries were up 4%. North American sales to users increased as demand remained healthy for nonresidential and residential construction. Nonresidential continued to benefit from government-related infrastructure and construction projects. Residential sales to users in North America also increased in the quarter. Sales to users in the EAME and Latin America were down slightly relative to a strong comparative. In Asia Pacific, sales to users declined in the quarter. In Resource Industries, sales to users increased 1%. In mining, sales to users also increased, and in heavy construction, quarry, and aggregates, sales to users declined against a strong comparative in 2022. In Energy and Transportation, sales to users increased Oil and Gas sales to users benefited from strong sales of turbines and turbine-related services.\nWe also saw continued strength in sales of reciprocating engines into gas compression and Oil and Gas applications, including the Tier 4 Dynamic Gas Blending engines used in well servicing fleets. Power generation sales to users increased. Excuse me. Power generation sales to users continued to remain positive due to favorable market conditions including strong Data Center growth. Transportation sales to users also increased while industrial declined from historically strong levels in 2022. Dealer inventory decreased by $900 million versus third quarter. Machines declined by $1.4 billion, slightly more than we expected. We saw the largest decline in construction industries as dealer inventory decreased across all regions. The largest decline was in excavators. We remain comfortable with the total level of machine dealer inventory which is within the typical range.\nAdjusted operating profit margin increased to 18.9% in the fourth quarter, a 190 basis point increase over last year. Adjusted operating profit margin was slightly better than we had anticipated relative to our margin expectations. We saw higher price realization and higher sales volume, both marginally better than expected. Turning to slide five, I'll now provide full year highlights. In 2023 we generated sales and revenues of $67.1 billion, up 13% versus last year. This was due to favorable price and higher sales volume driven primarily by higher sales of equipment to end users. As I mentioned, we generated $23 billion of services revenue in 2023, a 5% increase over 2022. We continue to see improvement of customer value agreements with new equipment which remains an important part of our services growth initiatives.\nWe saw strong e-commerce sales growth as we continued to enhance our digital tools to make it easier for customers to identify and purchase the right parts. We added more than 100,000 new customers to our online channel. We also exceeded the e-commerce goal we shared at our May 2022 investor day. By combining the data from more than 1.5 million connected assets with our engineering expertise, advanced analytics, and AI, we are helping customers avoid unplanned downtime through intelligent leads, which we call Prioritized Service Events, or PSEs. We continue to execute our various service initiatives as we strive to achieve our 2026 target of $28 billion. Our full year adjusted operating profit margin was 20.5%, a 510 basis point increase over 2022.\nMoving to Slide six, we generated strong ME&T free cash flow of $10 billion in 2023, a $3.7 billion or 58% increase over our previous record. We returned a record $7.5 billion to shareholders through repurchase stock and dividends. We remain proud of our dividend aristocrat status and continue to expect to return substantially all ME&T free cash flow to shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases. Now on Slide seven, I'll describe our expectations moving forward. Overall demand remains healthy across most of our end markets for our products and services. We ended 2023 with a backlog of $27.5 billion, which remains elevated as a percentage of revenues compared to historical levels. We currently anticipate 2024 sales and revenues to be broadly similar to the record 2023 level.\nWe expect continued strength in end user demand, including services growth and a slight benefit from carryover pricing, offset by a dealer inventory headwind, which was a $2.1 billion benefit in 2023. We currently do not anticipate a significant change in dealer inventory of machines in 2024 as compared to an increase in 2023. Now I'll discuss our outlook for key end markets starting with construction industries. In North America after a very strong 2023, we expect the region to remain healthy in 2024. We expect non-residential construction to remain at similar demand levels due to government-related infrastructure investments. Residential construction is expected to remain healthy relative to historical levels in Asia Pacific. Excluding China, we are seeing some softening in economic conditions. We anticipate China will remain at a relatively low level for the above 10-ton excavator industry.\nIn EAME, we anticipate the region will be slightly down due to economic uncertainty in Europe, somewhat offset by continuing strong construction demand in the Middle East. Construction activity in Latin America is expected to increase due to easing financial conditions. In addition, we also anticipate the ongoing benefit of our services initiatives will positively impact construction industries in 2024. Next, I'll discuss Resource Industries. After strong performance in 2023 in mining, heavy construction, and quarrying aggregates, we anticipate lower machine volume versus last year primarily due to off-highway and articulated trucks. In addition, we anticipate a small decrease in dealer inventory during 2024 versus a slight increase in dealer inventory last year. While we continue to see a high level of quoting activity overall, we anticipate lower order rates as customers display capital discipline. We expect to see higher services revenues including robust rebuild activity.\nCustomer product utilization remains high, the number of parked trucks remains low, the age of the fleet remains elevated, and our autonomous solutions continue to see strong customer acceptance. We continue to believe the energy transition will support increased commodity demand over time, expanding our total addressable market and providing further opportunities for long term profitable growth. Moving to Oil and Gas, we expect reciprocating engines and services to increase slightly after a strong 2023. As we said during the last two quarters, well servicing in North America is showing some short term moderation. Gas compression order backlog remains healthy, and overall we continue to remain optimistic about future demand. Cat reciprocating engine demand for power generation is expected to remain strong due to continued Data Center growth. Solar Turbines has a strong backlog and continues to experience robust quoting activity.\nAs we said in the last quarter, industrial demand is expected to soften in the near term from a strong 2023. In transportation, we anticipate high-speed marine to increase slightly as customers continue to upgrade aging fleets. Moving to slide eight, now I'll provide an update on our strategy and sustainability journey. Over the past year we have discussed constraints for our large engines given the robust demand and power generation for Data Centers Oil and Gas. we believe that our total addressable market is expanding due to the secular growth trend for Data Centers relating to cloud computing and Generative AI. We also expect the energy transition to create opportunities for distributed generation as more renewables are added to the grid. Our reciprocating engine and gas turbine generator sets can help provide grid stability.\nWe are making a large multi-year capital investment in our large engine division, including increasing capacity for both new engines and aftermarket parts. This will help us satisfy growing customer demand and contribute to future absolute OPACC dollar growth, which we believe has the highest correlation to total shareholder return over time.\nWe continue to advance our sustainability journey in 2023. I'll highlight some recent announcements demonstrating our commitment to a reduced carbon future. Caterpillar has a goal that 100% of new products will be more sustainable than the previous generation, including by lowering fuel consumption and thus corresponding emissions. One recent example is our 420 XE Backhoe Loader with the Cat C3.6 engine. Through internal testing in a typical mix of applications, it consumed up to 10% less fuel and produced up to 10% less tailpipe emissions than the previous model. Earlier this year, we announced the success of our collaboration with Microsoft and Ballard Power Systems to demonstrate the viability of using large format hydrogen fuel cells to supply reliable and sustainable backup power for Data Centers. The demonstration validated the hydrogen fuel cell power system's performance at more than 6,000ft above sea level and in below-freezing conditions.\nCaterpillar led the project, providing the overall system integration, power electronics, and microgrid controls that form the central structure of the hydrogen power solution. These examples reinforce our ongoing sustainability leadership. With that, I'll turn it over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar\n\nThanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with commentary on the fourth quarter results, including the performance of our segments. Then I'll discuss the balance sheet and cash flow, followed by an update to our target ranges for adjusted operating profit margins and ME&T free cash flow. I'll conclude with our high level assumptions for 2024 and our expectations for the first quarter.\nBeginning on slide nine. Strong operating performance continued in the fourth quarter as sales and revenues, adjusted operating profit margin, adjusted profit per share, and ME&T free cash flow were all better than we had expected. In summary, sales and revenues increased by 3% to $17.1 billion. Adjusted operating profit increased by 15% to $3.2 billion. The adjusted operating profit margin was 18.9%, an increase of 190 basis points versus the prior year. Profit per share was $5.28 in the fourth quarter compared to $2.79 in the fourth quarter of last year.\nProfit per share in the quarter included favorable mark-to-market gains of $0.14 for the remeasurement of pension and OPEB plans and certain favorable deferred tax valuation adjustments of $0.04. It also included restructuring costs of $92 million or $0.13. Adjusted profit per share increased by 35% to $5.23 in the fourth quarter compared to $3.86 last year. The provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter, excluding the amounts related to mark-to-market and discrete items, reflected a global annual effective tax rate of 21.4%. This was lower than we had expected a quarter ago due to favorable changes in the geographic mix of profits. The lower rate benefited performance in the quarter by about $0.24.\nMoving on to Slide 10, I'll discuss top line results in the fourth quarter. The 3% sales increase versus the prior year was primarily driven by price realization partially offset by lower volume as impacts from dealer inventory changes more than offset the 8% increase in sales to users. Both price and volume were slightly better than we had anticipated. The dealer inventory change resulted in an unfavorable sales impact of $1.6 billion versus the prior year. Dealer inventory decreased in the fourth quarter by $900 million overall compared to an increase of approximately $700 million during the fourth quarter of 2022. The dealer inventory decrease in the fourth quarter was led by Construction Industries where the reduction was at the high end of our expectations.\nThe decrease in this segment was led by excavators and the impact of the Cat engine changeover in building construction products that we have mentioned in previous earnings calls. Dealers also reduced their inventories in Resource Industries. Overall, the decrease in dealer inventory of machines was $1.4 billion in the quarter. Conversely, dealer inventory in Energy and Transportation increased mostly due to extended commissioning timelines resulting from strong shipments which were supported by healthy demand.\nAs a reminder, dealer inventory in both Energy and Transportation and Resource Industries is mainly a function of the commissioning pipeline, and over 70% of dealer inventory in these segments is backed by firm customer orders. Looking at sales by segment, sales in Construction Industries and Energy & Transportation was slightly higher than we had anticipated, while sales in Resource Industries were about in line with our expectations.\nMoving to operating profit on slide 11, Adjusted operating profit increased by 15% to $3.2 billion. Price realization and favorable manufacturing costs benefited the quarter, while higher SG&A and R&D expenses and lower sales volumes acted as a partial offset. The increase in SG&A and R&D expenses was primarily driven by higher short-term incentive compensation expense and strategic investment spend. The adjusted operating profit margin of 18.9% improved by 190 basis points versus the prior year. Margins were slightly higher than we had anticipated on volumes and price being marginally better than we had expected.\nNow on Slide 12, construction industry sales decreased by 5% in in the fourth quarter to $6.5 billion due to lower sales volume partially offset by favorable price realization. Lower sales volume was primarily due to the changes in dealer inventories that I mentioned earlier and more than offset the favorable sales to users. The dealer inventory changes impacted all of the regions by region. Sales in North America increased by 4%. In Latin America, sales decreased by 25%. Sales in EAME decreased by 18%. This region accounted for the largest dealer inventory decline in the quarter. In Asia Pacific, sales decreased by 4%.\nFourth quarter profit for construction industries was $1.5 billion and increased by 3% versus the prior year. The increase was primarily due to favorable price partially offset by the profit impact from lower sales volume. The segment's operating margin of 23.5% was an increase of 180 basis points versus last year. This was broadly in line with our expectations.\nTurning to Slide 13, Resource Industries sales decreased by 6% in fourth quarter to $3.2 billion. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume partially offset by favorable price realization. Lower volume was impacted by changes in dealer inventories as dealers decreased inventories during fourth quarter 2023 compared to an increase in the prior year's quarter. Volume was also impacted by slightly lower after market parts sales volume partly due to dealer buying patterns. fourth quarter profit for Resource Industries decreased by 1% versus the prior year to $600 million. The segment's operating margin of 18.5% was an increase of 90 basis points versus last year and was in line with our expectations.\nNow on Slide 14, Energy and Transportation sales increased by 12% in the fourth quarter to $7.7 billion. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization. Sales volume benefited from higher shipments of large engines and Solar Turbines and turbine-related services in the quarter. Oil and Gas sales increased by 23%. Power Generation sales were higher by 29%. Industrial sales decreased by 5%, and Transportation sales increased by 11%. While industrial sales decreased, they remain at healthy levels.\nFourth quarter profit for Energy and Transportation increased by 21% versus the prior year to $1.4 billion. The increase was primarily due to favorable price and higher sales volume partially offset by higher SG&A and R&D expenses, currency impacts, and unfavorable manufacturing costs. The increase in SG&A and R&D expenses reflected ramping investments related to strategic growth initiatives and higher short-term incentive compensation expense.\nAs a reminder, most of our strategic investments relating to electrification and alternative fuels are in Energy and Transportation, which therefore impacts this segment's margin. The operating margin of 18.6% was an increase of 130 basis points versus the prior year. Margin exceeded our expectations on higher volume, including favorable mix and price.\nMoving to Slide 15, financial products revenues increased by 15% to $981 million, primarily due to higher average financing rates across all regions and higher average earning assets. In North America, segment profit increased by 24% to $234 million. The increase was mainly due to a lower provision for credit losses at Cat Financial, higher average earning assets, and a high net yield on average earning assets.\nOur portfolio continues to perform well with past dues near historic levels at 1.79%. We saw a 10 basis points improvement compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 and a 17 basis points improvement compared to the third quarter. This is the lowest fourth quarter past dues percentage since 2006. The year end allowance rate was our lowest fourth quarter rate on record at 1.18% and was the second lowest quarterly rate ever. In addition, provision expense in 2023 was at the lowest level we've seen in over 20 years.\nBusiness activity remained strong as retail new business volume increased versus the prior year and the third quarter. The increase versus the prior year reflected higher end user sales and rental conversions in the U.S. In addition, we continue to see strong demand for used equipment. Though used inventories have ticked up slightly, they remain close to historically low levels. Despite some moderation, used pricing on improved availability, it is still comfortably above historic norms.\nMoving on to Slide 16, the record $10 billion in ME&T free cash flow for the year included $3.2 billion in the fourth quarter, an increase of $200 million versus the prior year. On CapEx, we continue to make disciplined investments that are right for our business, governed by our focus on growing absolute OPACC dollars. We spent about $1.7 billion in 2023. Looking to 2024, we expect CapEx in the range of $2billion-$2.5 billion. This is higher than our recent run rate and includes the investment in large engine capacity which Jim referenced a moment ago. We also plan to invest more around ACE, which is Autonomy, Alternative Fuels, Connectivity and Digital, and Electrification. In addition, we are investing to make our supply chain more resilient.\nMoving to capital deployment, we returned $3.4 billion to shareholders in the fourth quarter, including $2.8 billion in share repurchases. Our net share count has decreased by approximately 14% since 2019 when we shared our intention to return substantially all ME&T free cash flow to shareholders over time and on a consistent basis. Our dividend remains a priority as we increased our quarterly payout by 8% in 2023. You will recall from our investor day in 2022, we shared that we were expected to increase our dividend by at least high single digits for the next three years. The increase in 2023 reflected the second of those three years.\nOur balance sheet remains strong, we have ample liquidity with an enterprise cash balance of $7 billion, and we hold an additional $3.8 billion in slightly longer dated liquid marketable securities to improve yields on that cash. Now on slide 17, I'll discuss our revised adjusted operating profit margin targets. We exceeded our progressive target range in 2023, and we are confident that our strong execution and operating performance supports the potential for higher top end adjusted operating profit margins than were reflected in the prior range. Therefore, we have increased the top end of the range by 100 basis points relative to the corresponding level of sales.\nAchieving the top end of the range will remain challenging as we are committed to increase investments in our strategic initiatives supporting long-term profitable growth. The bottom end of the target range remains unchanged. To explain, while higher gross margins support increasing the top end of the range, they actually pressure our margins in periods of decreasing volume. For that reason, we believe that the bottom end of the range remains challenging but achievable. We will now target adjusted operating profit margins of 10% to 14% at $42 billion of sales and revenues, increasing to 18% to 22% at $72 billion of sales and revenues.\nNow on slide 18. When I joined Caterpillar just over five years ago, I was impressed with the potential of our business to deliver higher, more consistent ME&T free cash flow as a result of the operating and execution model and our focus on generating absolute OPACC dollars. This is how we define winning at Caterpillar. We believe increasing absolute OPACC dollars will lead to higher shareholder returns over time. Since the beginning of 2019, we have generated $30 billion in ME&T free cash flow, including a record $10 billion in 2023. We are confident in our ability to consistently generate positive ME&T free cash flow over time. Therefore, we are introducing an updated target range for ME&T free cash flow which is between $5 billion and $10 billion. Our strong operating performance as well as confidence in our future execution supports the higher range.\nThe updated target range still maintains our flexibility to invest in our strategic initiatives, which is a priority. We also continue to expect to return substantially all of our ME&T free cash flow to shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases. Moving to slide 19, I will share our high level assumptions for the full year. As Jim mentioned, in 2024 we anticipate sales and revenues will be broadly similar to 2023. We expect slightly favorable price realization and continued healthy underlying demand across the business as a whole. We anticipate another year of services growth as we continue to target $28 billion by 2026. We do not expect a significant change in dealer inventory for machines by the end of this year, and for Energy and Transportation, it is difficult to predict with certainty what will happen to dealer inventory. As we have discussed previously, in total dealer inventory increased by $2.1 billion in 2023.\nBy segment. In Construction Industries, sales of equipment to end users should remain roughly similar to compared to the strong year we saw in 2023. However, we do not expect a dealer inventory build as we saw last year. We also anticipate our services initiatives will benefit the segment in 2024. In Resource Industries, we anticipate lower sales versus 2023 impacted by lower machine volume, primarily in off-highway and articulated trucks. We had strong sales of these products in 2023 as we converted our elevated backlog into sales, making for a challenging comparison. We also anticipate an unfavorable year-over-year change in dealer inventories. However, we expect services revenues will increase in this segment. In Energy and Transportation, we expect slightly higher sales in 2024.\nOil and Gas, and transportation sales should be positive while industrial sales are expected to be lower compared to historically strong levels in 2023. On full year adjusted operating profit margin, we currently expect to be in the top half of the updated margin target range at our expected sales levels. I'll discuss some of the puts and takes. In 2024, we expect a small pricing benefit weighted toward the first half of the year given carryover from increases taken in the second half of 2023.\nFor the full year, we expect price to modestly exceed manufacturing costs versus last year. Price and absolute dollar terms should moderate as we lap the more favorable pricing trends from 2023. Short-term incentive compensation expense was about $1.7 billion in 2023, while we anticipate $1.2 billion in 2024. We expect the benefit of that low expense will be offset by increases in SG&A and R&D expenses as we continue to invest in strategic initiatives aimed at future, long-term profitable growth. Investments are focused in services, new product introductions, and ACE.\nWe also anticipate there may be some negative margin impact due to mix this year. I'll explain. During 2023, when availability was somewhat challenged, we biased our production and shipments to products with the highest OPACC potential. Given that availability is improved, we anticipate a more normalized mix of products in 2024. We may also see an impact on margins from the mix of different segments, as we anticipate, sales in 2024 will be slightly more weighted toward Energy and Transportation than they were in 2023.\nMoving on, we expect to be within the top half of our updated ME&T free cash flow target range of $5 billion-$10 billion. As you consider our cash position, keep in mind the $1.7 billion cash outflow in the first quarter related to the payout of last year's incentive compensation expense. We also anticipate restructuring charges of $3 million-$450 million this year. Finally, we expect a global effective tax rate in the range of 22.5% -23.5%, an increase versus the 21.4% in 2023.\nNow, on slide 20, our expectations for the first quarter. Starting with the top line, we expect first quarter sales and revenues to be broadly similar to the prior year. We anticipate price to be favorable, although significantly less in absolute dollar terms than had occurred through 2023. We expect demand to remain healthy. However, we anticipate a slightly lower dealer inventory build for machines in the first quarter compared to a $1.1 billion build in the first quarter of 2023, this will act as a headwind to sales. At the segment level, in Construction Industries, we anticipate flattish to slightly higher first quarter sales versus the prior year primarily due to favorable prices. We anticipate lower sales in Resource Industries compared to the prior year driven by lower volume partially offset by favorable price.\nIn Energy and Transportation, we expect flattish to slightly higher sales versus the prior year with updated favorable volume benefiting the upside scenario. On margins, we expect the enterprise adjusted operating profit margin in the first quarter to be broadly similar to the first prior year. Price should more than offset manufacturing costs. As price actions from 2023 roll into 2024, we expect price will be lower in absolute dollar terms versus the prior year. We anticipate manufacturing costs to increase compared to last year principally impacted by cost absorption as we do not expect an inventory build like we saw in the first quater of 2023. We also anticipate an increase in SG&A and R&D expenses related to strategic investment spend.\nBy segment, in construction industries, we anticipate a similar margin as compared to the prior year. We expect price to offset strategic investment spend and slightly higher manufacturing costs, including cost absorption. In Resource Industries, we expect a lower margin compared to the prior year impacted by lower volume partially offset by favorable price. In Energy and Transportation, we anticipate a similar margin versus the prior year. A slightly stronger price should be offset by higher manufacturing costs.\nTurning to Slide 21, let me summarize. Adjusted profit per share of $21.21 exceeded our previous full year record by 53%. We exceeded the top ends of our targeted ranges for adjusted operating profit margin and ME&T free cash flow. We have increased the top end of our adjusted profit margin range and we have raised our ME&T free cash flow target range. We expect to be in the top half of our updated margin and ME&T free cash flow target ranges in 2024. We anticipate another year of services growth as we continue to execute our strategy for long-term profitable growth. With that, we'll take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, press star one a second time. Please note we are only allowing one question per analyst. Your first question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is open.\n\nRob Wertheimer\n\nFounding Partner and Director of Research, Melius Research\n\nThank you. My question on inventory, kind of at all levels. You had a healthy destock in the quarter. I think your volumes are down around 4%, retail sales up 8%, so that's nice. I wanted to see how inventory was versus what you expect out of the business at the dealer level, at your finished goods level, and also at your WIP/Raws where your own inventory is rather elevated. So just, you know, how do you feel the business is performing at those levels and then what's the path from here, especially on your own inventory? Thank you.\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar\n\nWell, good morning, Rob. Starting with our inventory, you know, as we discussed in previous calls, just because of the supply chain constraints we've had, our internal manufacturing operations are not running as efficiently as I would like. We believe we still have an opportunity to do a better job there. Certainly the supply chain constraints have started to ease, and that's made things a bit easier. But we still are dealing with some areas of constraint. So again, I think we have opportunities there, and we'll continue to work on that, try to get more lean.\nIn terms of dealer inventory. Again, we talked about it in our prepared remarks. Of course, dealers are independent businesses, make their own decisions, and their decisions on inventory are a combination of what they see in future demand, but also availability, and our ability to reduce lead times allows them and our customers to place orders later. So again, we've talked about the fact that we don't expect a significant change in dealer inventories in 2024, but again, they're independent businesses and will make their own decisions.\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar\n\nYeah, just a couple of things to add. I mean, if you look at our days inventory outstanding, Rob, it's running at about 15% -20% higher than historic levels. So that gives us an opportunity over the next several years to work that down in a way that manages also from a supply base perspective, not to create undue problems for them in their outlook. So we continue to look at that. And then just mention on dealer inventory, particularly within construction, dealer inventory is about the middle of the range. The target range we talk about are three to four months. So it's pretty much bang on there. So dealers are holding what probably we would continue to expect them to hold.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Feniger\n\nManaging Director in Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nYep, thank you for taking my question. You guys just reported a record sales and earnings. There's a view that many of your businesses are operating at peak levels. I'm curious, when you look at your overall portfolio, especially maybe on a unit basis versus prior cycles, are there areas and regions where you feel like your business is still not operating at peak levels or record levels? Do you feel if as we go in the back half of this year, if rates come down, financial conditions ease, is there torque in areas of your business where you feel like the backlog could start to maybe bottom and pick up as those conditions start to get a little bit better through the year? Thank you.\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar\n\nAll right, well, thanks for your question. Maybe just talk about, you know, some of the areas that we're most excited about as we move forward, and you know, without putting a time dimension on this. But you know, one of the things that we've talked about is that we believe that the energy transition, it will increase demand for commodities over time, thereby expanding our total addressable market. So you know, as we look forward and you think about the increased adoption of things like EVs and the amount of minerals that will need to be produced by our mining customers to satisfy that demand. We believe that again creates an opportunity for us moving forward over the next few years. And also we're very excited about the opportunities around large engines.\nThere's a secular growth trend going on in Data Centers related to, as I mentioned, related to cloud computing and Generative AI. We're very excited about that. We're making an investment to increase our large engine capacity. So again, we believe that is an area of increase in our total addressable market as well. Just kind of think about, think about around the world. One of the things we talked about in previous calls is the fact that our market in China is relatively weak. Over time that market has been 5%-10% of enterprise sales. We had strong years in China in 2020 and 2021. We saw a decline in 2022, a further decline in 2023, and we expect that market to still be relatively weak again this year.\nSo we're not in a situation where we're hitting on all cylinders in all markets around the world, both from a product and geographic perspective. Europe is again, you know, we believe there's opportunities there over time, depending on what happens in the economic cycle. So again, it's not a situation where if you look around the world, we're hitting, you know, all the cylinders going as good as they can. So we believe we have opportunities here.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Tami Zakaria, JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nTami Zakaria\n\nExecutive Director in Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. My question is more of a medium- to long-term in nature. So services growth was 5% in 2023. If you want to hit the $28 billion target, it seems like growth would need to accelerate from that to call it a high single-digit percent number over the next three years annually. So can you help us understand what could drive this acceleration in growth? And do you need industry growth to remain positive during these next three years to support that aspiration or can services grow independent of the end market or industry growth?\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar\n\nWell, thank you for your question. You know, we've been pleased by the progress we've made. You'll recall we started with that 2016 baseline of $14 billion and we have increased it to $23 billion. Our teams continue to strive to achieve that $28 billion number. One of the things we said when we laid out the target is we didn't expect it to be in a straight line. We thought it would be relatively back-end loaded. But you know, we continue to invest in our digital capabilities, e-commerce. I talked earlier about CVAs and the other things that we're doing. We're working very closely with our dealers as well. So you know, we do believe that there's an opportunity, regardless of industry growth, to increase services. And again, we continue to strive to achieve that number.\nYou know, one of the things that. We also would note that STUs were positive as well. You know, one of the things that impacts, of course, our services sales is dealer buying patterns around parts. But we're encouraged by the fact that STUs were positive.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Raso\n\nSenior Managing Director and Partner, Evercore ISI\n\nHi, thank you. First, just a clarification in your answer, if you could. The operating margin guidance. I know you have the sales framework, but just, if you can just help us, do you expect your operating margins to be flat, up, or down for the year? My real question is the backlog. I'm just trying to understand the size of the backlog. The relationship it usually has with next year's sales would imply a lot stronger growth than you're forecasting. I'm just trying to understand the orders in the quarter were okay, the dealer inventory drag, right. The growth last year, but not growth this year. That's a drag year over year.\nThat wouldn't come close really to accounting for where the sales would normally be guided for next year with this level of backlog. I'm just trying to put my head around with that size backlog, the flat sales. Is that a concern? That again, the orders were good for the quarter, that you're seeing slower orders coming. Just trying to correlate that backlog to only flat sales. Thank you.\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar\n\nYeah, David, let me start on the backlog and then talk about margin guidance afterwards. On backlog. Obviously backlog conversion varies. The one thing you should always think about is again, backlog is not a single type of activity. It's not just related to, for example, machines. Some of it's related to large engines, and some of it's related to solar. Not all of those elements of the backlog actually are in 2024.\nSome of those will convert in 2025 and beyond. So actually that's one of the factors which is a little bit different than maybe versus history. And so why you wouldn't actually necessarily convert that. But that's part of it. Again, just when we talk about guidance and what we're guiding around, around flattish sales and also around top half of the margin ranges, we are talking about ranges of outcomes. Obviously it's the beginning of the year. We've indicated where there will be some puts and takes, but obviously performance this year has been exceptional. Our aim is to continue to drive to that level of performance. That's what we're focused on, and I think that's what the organization is focused on as well.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nNicole DeBlase\n\nManaging Director in Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah, thanks. Good morning, guys.\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar\n\nGood morning, Nicole.\n\nNicole DeBlase\n\nManaging Director in Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nJust a few on parts. So if you could elaborate on the parts decline that you saw in Resource, any color on the magnitude of parts growth that you might expect for 2024, and then how would you characterize parts inventory levels in the dealer network right now? Thank you.\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar\n\nYeah. So as we talked about, I mentioned part of the decline in parts sales in Resource Industries was relating to dealer buying patterns. We don't include, obviously when we talk about dealer inventory, that's machines and engines, it's not actually parts. And what we did see as availability improved as we went through 2023, we did see dealers reduce their inventory a little bit. It's probably more at normalized levels now. Obviously they'll continue to monitor it. They make their independent decisions. And as we always remind you, it's very complex with over 150 dealers globally and a large number of parts that they order. But they obviously try and optimize their network. Next year we do expect benefit from services revenue growth.\nObviously, if we are to achieve our target, we would hope for a little bit of an acceleration versus what we saw in 2023. Obviously that does depend a little bit on what happens with the dealers and buying patterns and on resources, given the amount of truck utilization. We do expect services revenues to improve as we go through 2024 based on the need for rebuilds, particularly of large mining trucks. So that's where we are on services.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Mig Dobre with Baird. Your line is open.\n\nMig Dobre\n\nManaging Director in Equity Research, Baird\n\nYes, thank you. Thank you for the question. Go back to Construction. I'm curious to get your thoughts in terms of how you think about margin here. It sounds you're guiding Q1 flat margin year-over-year, which would be tremendous given the comp there. Are margins sustainable at this level? Is there any insight you can give us as to how you see the year progressing beyond Q1?\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar\n\nYeah, there's going to be a couple of things, Mig, which are going to happen as we go through 2024. The one that's a little bit hard to predict at the moment is any potential mix impact. As we said when we were going through 2023, we biased our production towards machines with the highest levels of OPACC. That's what customers wanted as well. So we met customer demand, particularly those products. We expect a more normal mix of product that may have some impact on margins as we go through the year. Obviously it's a little bit difficult to predict at this stage given that we're at the beginning of the year. But that potentially is the one we will continue to invest in the business. We are continuing to drive services and services growth.\nAs you know, that's a possible upside potential, particularly in Construction where we have the largest opportunity. So those are the sort of big things, big buckets I would look at as we think through 2024, and both of those, one will be slightly negative and the other one possibly will be slightly more positive. So those are the sort of puts and takes at the moment.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nJerry Revich\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYes. Hi. Good morning, everyone.\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar\n\nMorning, Jerry.\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar\n\nMorning, Jerry. Jim.\n\nJerry Revich\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nAndrew, I wonder if you just say more about the increase to the free cash flow guidance. A bigger increase there than on the margin framework. And you know, we're a couple of years away where you folks in 2020 were below the $5 billion number. So can you just talk about what's playing out better than you folks expected to drive the much stronger outlook for free cash flow conversion? And obviously we're seeing performance here as well. But I'm wondering if you just expand on those comments on the confidence through the cycle.\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar\n\nYou bet. Well, Jerry, you recall when we launched our strategy in 2017, you know, we really focused very heavily on OPACC, operating profit after capital charge. We're really challenging our teams to work to ensure that we get a return for every dollar of capital that we invest. We've also worked hard to reduce our structural cost. Again, with OPACC as our measure, that obviously helps us produce more cash. You know, again, we demonstrated the ability to produce higher free cash flows. If I remember the numbers correctly, you know, between 2019 and 2022, we produced $5 billion-$6 billion of free cash flow. Then in 2020, we had a 22% drop to our top line. Even that year, even during the COVID year when our top line dropped more than 20%, we still produced $3 billion of free cash flow.\nSo again, we have the whole organization based on OPACC, and that's, you know, working all those levers every single day. And that helps us drive increased free cash flow.\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar\n\nYou know, that is part of the reason why we've upped the bottom end of the range because we are now more confident that that OPACC will flow through to the bottom line. Obviously, with margins, the issue you have there is, you know, in a period of time where revenues decline, margins become an impact of, you know, a function of what happens from a gross margin perspective. Actually on free cash flow, we can generate more free cash flow by actually using up some of our working capital and bringing that back through. That's one of the things we expect as well, if that happens.\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar",
    "content2": "I'm really glad you asked that question. I think honestly, that's one thing that maybe is underappreciated about our performance. It's just our ability to produce cash and the way we've really transformed the business over the last few years to produce higher free cash flows more consistently.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Angel Castillo with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nAngel Castillo\n\nExecutive Director in Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to maybe continue on that note. Wanted to understand a little bit maybe the reasoning or the thought process around not lowering the kind of low end of your operating profit margin range. You talked about the gross margin and you mentioned this in the prior response, but gross margin dynamic maybe on volumes potentially also leading to a little bit more challenged lower end of the range. So maybe what gives you confidence in keeping that rather than lowering that as well? And how do you kind of think about a wider range overall through the cycle rather than kind of a step higher?\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar\n\nYeah, so I mean one of the things you will have seen over the last couple of years is the improvement in gross margins that obviously effectively with the progressive margin range, what happens obviously is the leverage is what benefits us as we go through, which gives us more confidence now that there's more opportunity from a leverage perspective to drive the top end of the range. But that obviously means on a declining volume basis there's more pressure. So that really was the reason why we kept the bottom end of the range as it was. Interestingly, if you go back to the previous ranges, this is within the top end of the range now as virtually within very, very marginal difference to the old margin target ranges that we had before.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Chad Dillard with Bernstein. Your line is open.\n\nChad Dillard\n\nManaging Director in Equity Research, Bernstein\n\nHi, good morning guys.\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar\n\nMorning Chad.\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar\n\nMorning, Chad.\n\nChad Dillard\n\nManaging Director in Equity Research, Bernstein\n\nSo, on price cost, I think in your four-year guide you talked about price modestly exceeding manufacturing costs for the full year. But then also you talk about, I guess, some carryover benefit in the first part. So just trying to understand the cadence on that and just confirm. Do you expect price costs to be positive through each quarter through the balance of the year?\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar\n\nYeah. So I think what we guided to is that we expect price to exceed manufacturing costs for the full year. We expect price to be positive in the first half of the year, more positive in the first half of the year because of carryover pricing. Obviously there will be some other factors that go through there. Geographic mix, for example, was positive this year. That may not be as positive as we go through the second part of the year. So those are the sort of mix things that can happen at this stage. We're not giving you a prediction, a firm prediction. We know what we think for overall for the full year, but most of that price benefit will come through in the first.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nStephen Volkmann\n\nManaging Director in Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Good morning everybody. Thanks for fitting me in.\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar\n\nGood morning, Steve.\n\nStephen Volkmann\n\nManaging Director in Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nJim, I wanted to go back if I could to a response to one of the earlier questions where you talked about supply chain has kind of improved a little bit but is still causing productivity issues. I guess I'm trying to think that through as we go forward. If supply chain continues to normalize, is there any reason to think we wouldn't get that productivity back?\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar\n\nYeah, well, certainly that's what we're driving our teams to do. And you know, one of the things we talked about, of course, is we have still constraints in large engines and that, you know, we're not clearly not running as lean as I would like in that area. And of course when you have some issues in engines that can also impact machines as well just because of the dynamics of shipping engines to our machine lines. So certainly our goal is to become more lean and to get back into a better operating cadence and it has improved and supply chain conditions has improved. But we still have a ways to go. But again, difficult to predict how long it will take that to happen.\nOur engine investment, as we mentioned earlier, is a multi-year investment to increase that, that capacity for both new engines and for parts. And I think that will be an important element of us achieving better lean operations and getting some of that inventory out internally.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd your next question comes from Kristen Owen with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\n\nKristen Owen\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGreat. Thank you so much for taking the question. Just a longer term question here related to the hydrogen fuel cell pilot program, just given that secular growth opportunity in Data Center, how quickly can you commercialize this, and should we expect the business model for Cat to be more systems integration and components, or is there some additional vertical integration in the balance of systems that is being supported by this capital campaign that you outlined? Thank you.\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar\n\nYeah, again, most of the capital, the investments that we're making around large engines, around parts, and new engines, that's really what the focus of it is.\n\nAndrew Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar\n\nYeah. And so, I mean, overall, you know, when we look out, one of the opportunities for us, particularly when Jim was talking about distributed generation, was the fact that obviously grid stability is going to be an issue, and one of the things that's going to be needed is there are system, whole system projects that will be part of that. So, I think there is definitely an opportunity for us there to think more broadly about services in those environments as well.\n\nRyan Fiedler\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Caterpillar\n\nWe have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Today's final question comes from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Your line is open.\n\nStanley Elliott\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Stifel\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you very much for fitting me in and congratulations. Can you talk a little bit more about the free cash flow? I mean, you got $1 billion-$2 billion more additional that you're looking at and targeting. You've done a very nice job of. Increasing the dividend on a steady basis. Should we think of this as accelerated repurchases activity into 2024? Is there something on the M&A front? Any color there would be greatly helpful. Thank you.\n\nJim Umpleby\n\nChairman and CEO, Caterpillar\n\nYeah, really what we continue to talk about is the fact that we intend to return essentially all free cash flow to shareholders over time through a combination of dividend, dividends, and share repurchases. In terms of M&A, you know, we're always open to opportunities, but frankly, we believe we have outstanding opportunities to grow our business organically. While we have made some relatively small acquisitions to do things like gain some technology or think about the SPM in oil and gas to expand our product line a bit, we're really focused on organically growing our business because we think we have great opportunities around services. We've talked about the secular growth trend in and around Data Centers. We've, you know, LNG, conditional LNG exports, the fact that the energy transition will create opportunities for commodities increase over time. Again, our primary focus is on organically growing our business.\nOkay, with that, just would like to thank everyone for joining the call. Appreciate all your questions. I'd like to just close by thanking our global team for another great quarter, and just an exceptional record year. As we discussed, we're increasing the top end of our target range for adjusted operating profit margins, and we've raised our target range for ME&T free cash flow. This reflects continuing healthy customer demand, as well as our strong operating performance. We remain focused on executing our strategy and continue to invest for long-term profitable growth. Again, appreciate you joining us. Stay safe.\n\nRyan Fiedler\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Caterpillar\n\nThanks everybody. Thank you, Jim, Andrew, and everyone who joined the call today.

James Umpleby\n\nChief Executive Officer, Caterpillar, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ryan. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'd like to start by thanking our global team for a strong first quarter, including double-digit top line growth, higher operating profit margins, record adjusted profit per share and strong ME&T free cash flow.\nOur results reflect healthy customer demand across most end markets for our products and services. We remain focused on executing our strategy and continue to invest for long-term profitable growth.\nIn today's call, I'll begin with my perspectives on our performance in the quarter. I'll then provide some insights on our end markets. Lastly, I'll provide an update on our sustainability journey.\nIt was a very strong quarter. Sales and revenues were better than we expected, with price realization, dealer inventory and sales to users each slightly better than we anticipated. Sales to users were higher than expected in Energy & Transportation and Resource Industries. Overall, sales and revenues rose by 17% versus the first quarter of 2022.\nThe year-over-year increase was due to strong price realization and volume growth, which was driven by higher sales of equipment to end users. We achieved double-digit top line increases in each of our 3 primary segments.\nAdjusted operating profit margins increased to 21.1% in the first quarter, as we saw margins improve, both on a sequential and year-over-year basis. The adjusted operating profit margins were significantly better than we had anticipated primarily due to better-than-expected manufacturing costs, including efficiencies and absorption, stronger price realization and volume growth. Andrew will discuss in detail later.\nBacklog ended the quarter at $30.4 billion, flat relative to the fourth quarter of 2022. Equipment availability increased during the quarter due to improving supply chain conditions. While dealer order rates are lower, they remain at healthy levels. As you know, as availability improves, order rates typically normalize, as dealers can wait longer to place orders for long lead time items.\nOur healthy backlog continues to underpin our constructive views about our end markets. Despite the improvement in supply chain, pockets of challenge remain as we increase production, particularly for large engines, which impacts energy and transportation and some of our larger machines.\nWe delivered a strong first quarter, which positions us well for an even better year in 2023 than we previously anticipated. While we continue to closely monitor global macroeconomic conditions, overall demand remains healthy across our products and services.\nTurning to Slide 4. In the first quarter of 2023, sales and revenues increased 17% versus last year at $15.9 billion. This was primarily due to favorable price and volume growth. Compared with the first quarter of 2022, overall sales to users increased 13%.\nFor Construction Industries and Resource Industries, sales to users rose by 5%, while Energy & Transportation was up 39%. Sales to users in Construction Industries were flat, in line with our expectations.\nNorth American sales to users increased, as demand remained healthy for both nonresidential and residential, despite some moderation of the growth rate in residential. Overall, our North American sales to users were better than we expected.\nEAME also saw higher sales to users, led by strength in the Middle East. In Latin America and Asia Pacific, sales to users declined in the quarter. The decline in Asia Pacific included further weakening in China.\nIn Resource Industries, sales to users increased 18%, which was our third consecutive quarter of accelerating sales to users.\nIn Mining, sales to users benefited from a higher level of commissioning in the quarter. Within heavy construction and quarry and aggregates, sales to users also increased, supported by growth for infrastructure-related projects.\nIn Energy & Transportation, sales to users increased by 39%. In the first quarter, oil and gas sales to users benefited from continued strength in new engine sales to customers, including repowering active fleets, upgrading technology to Tier 4 dynamic gas blending and adding incremental gas compression units.\nWe also saw strong sales of turbines and turbine-related services. Power generation and industrial sales to users continue to remain positive due to favorable market conditions. Transportation declined from a relatively low base primarily due to timing in marine deliveries, which was partially offset by deliveries of international locomotives.\nDealer inventory increased by about $1.4 billion in the first quarter, which was slightly above our expectations compared to a $1.3 billion increase in the same quarter last year.\nIn Construction Industries, the increase in dealer inventory was primarily due to stronger North American shipments, which remains our most constrained region.\nAs we mentioned last quarter, over 70% of the combined dealer inventory in Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation is supported by customer orders.\nMoving to Slide 5. We generated strong ME&T free cash flow of $1.4 billion in the first quarter. We returned $1 billion to shareholders, which included about $600 million in dividends and $400 million in repurchase stock. We remain proud of our dividend aristocrat status and continue to expect to return substantially all ME&T free cash flow to shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases.\nNow on Slide 6, I'll share some commentary on our expectations moving forward. While we continue to closely monitor global macroeconomic conditions, our first quarter results lead us to expect that 2023 will be even better than we had previously anticipated on both the top and bottom line.\nFor 2023, we currently expect to be in the top half of the targeted range for both adjusted operating profit margin and ME&T free cash flow. Andrew will provide additional color.\nBefore I discuss our outlook for key end markets, I'll provide some color on how we expect our top line to progress through this year. As I mentioned, we expect a strong top line for 2023, supported by price and higher sales to users, with healthy underlying end markets.\nWe expect higher sales in the second quarter compared to the first, as is the typical seasonal pattern. Looking to the second half of 2023, it is important to highlight the second half of last year included the dealer inventory build of $1.4 billion, as dealers began to restock their inventories.\nWe are not planning for this trend to repeat. Instead, we expect to see dealers decrease inventories compared to the first quarter levels and end 2023 about flat relative to the end of 2022. Although we expect sales to users to remain positive for our primary segments in each quarter, our planning assumption is that Caterpillar second half sales will have a dealer inventory impact.\nLet me explain. First, although dealer inventory and some products and regions have normalized, others remain constrained. For example, in North America, dealer inventory remains below the typical range for many products. However, there is greater excavator inventory in a few regions, as supply dynamics improved in 2022, which, coupled with the slowing in China, has resulted in improved excavation product availability.\nGiven the improved availability of excavators, we expect that dealers will scale back their levels of excavator inventory in the second half of the year, even though demand remains healthy.\nAs a reminder, [ Dealers our ] independent businesses and control their own inventory.\nSecond, in late 2023, we have scheduled a couple of new product changeovers in construction industry factories that will also impact the second half.\nNow I'll discuss our outlook for key end markets this year, starting with Construction Industries. In North America, overall, we continue to see positive momentum in 2023. We expect growth in nonresidential construction in North America due to the positive impact of government-related infrastructure investments and a healthy pipeline of construction projects.\nAlthough residential construction housing starts have softened, the growth rate of our residential construction equipment remains positive as the supply chain pressures alleviate.\nIn Asia Pacific, excluding China, we expect growth in Construction Industries due to public infrastructure spending and supportive commodity prices. As we mentioned during our previous earnings calls, we expect Chinese above 10-ton excavator industry to remain below 2022 levels due to low construction activity.\nIn 2023, sales in China are expected to be below the typical range of 5% to 10% of total Caterpillar sales.\nIn the EAME, business activity is now expected to increase versus last year based on healthy construction project activity, particularly strong construction demand in the Middle East. Although uncertain economic conditions remain, European construction is proving to be more resilient than we previously anticipated.\nConstruction activity in Latin America is expected to be down in 2023 versus the strong 2022 performance.\nThere is some concern about the potential impact of a commercial real estate slowdown. We estimate that North American commercial real estate accounts for about 1% of total construction industry sales. Any slowdown related to this sector should not have a significant impact on Construction Industries.\nIn Resource Industries, we expect healthy mining demand to continue, as commodity prices remain above investment thresholds. As I've mentioned during the last few years, customers remain capital disciplined, which supports a gradual increase in mining over time.\nWe anticipate production utilization levels will remain elevated. We also expect the aging of the fleet and a lower level of park trucks to support future demand for our equipment and services.\nWe continue to lead the energy transition will support increased commodity demand, expanding our total addressable market and providing further opportunities for profitable growth.\nIn heavy construction and quarry and aggregates, we anticipate continued growth due to major infrastructure and nonresidential construction projects.\nIn Energy & Transportation, we expect to follow our normal seasonal pattern, with higher sales in the second half of the year versus the first half.\nIn oil and gas, reciprocating engines, although customers remain disciplined, we are encouraged by continued strength and demand for both well servicing and gas compression.\nPower generation reciprocating engine demand is expected to remain healthy, including strong data center growth.\nNew equipment orders and services for solar turbines in both oil and gas and power generation are robust. Industrial remains healthy.\nIn transportation, we anticipate strength in high-speed Marine as customers continue to upgrade aging fleets.\nMoving to Slide 7. We are contributing to a reduced carbon future and continue to invest in new products, technologies and services to help our customers achieve their climate-related objectives. We recently completed and upgraded more than 15 models across our entire next-generation hydraulic excavator line.\nThe new models reduced fuel consumption by up to 25% compared to previous models and provide another option for customers to lower emissions, while improving operational efficiency. A customer can realize meaningful emissions reductions by simply moving to the newest next-gen model.\nThis example reinforces our ongoing sustainability leadership and how we help our customers build a better, more sustainable world. In addition, we look forward to issuing our 18th annual sustainability report in May.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew R. J. Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin by providing further color on the first quarter results, including the performance of our segments. Then I'll cover the balance sheet and ME&T free cash flow before concluding with a few comments on the full year and our assumptions for the second quarter.\nBeginning on Slide 8. Sales and revenues for the first quarter increased by 17% or $2.3 billion to $15.9 billion. The sales increase versus the prior year was due to strong price realization and higher volume, partially offset by currency impacts.\nSales were higher than we had expected in January, with price realization, dealer inventory and end user demand each slightly better than we had anticipated.\nOperating profit increased by 47% by $876 million to $2.7 billion, which includes the impact of the divestiture of the company's longwall business.\nAdjusted operating profit increased by 79% or $1.5 billion to $3.3 billion. Favorable price realization and higher sales volume was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs. The adjusted operating profit margin was 21.1%, an increase of 740 basis points versus the prior year.\nAs Jim mentioned, the adjusted operating margin was much better than we had anticipated. Lower-than-expected manufacturing costs, including efficiencies and absorption, with the largest variable, while price realization and volume were also stronger than we had envisaged. I'll provide additional color in a moment.\nAdjusted profit per share increased by 70% to $4.91 in the first quarter compared to $2.88 in the first quarter of last year. Adjusted profit per share in the first quarter of 2023 excluded pretax restructuring costs of $611 million, most of this related to the noncash charge from the divestiture of the company's longwall business.\nThis compares to pretax restructuring costs of $13 million in the first quarter of 2022.\nOther income of $32 million in the quarter was lower than the first quarter of 2022 by $221 million. The year-over-year decline included about $100 million unfavorable currency impact related to ME&T balance sheet translation and an adverse impact of $80 million for pension expense.\nThe dollar strengthened marginally since our last earnings call, so the currency impact within the first quarter of 2023 was about $30 million better than we had anticipated than when we spoke to you in January.\nFinally, the provision for income tax in the first quarter, excluding discrete items, reflected a global annual effective tax rate of 23%.\nMoving on to Slide 9, the nine. The 17% increase in the top line versus the prior year was driven by favorable price realization and higher sales volume, while currency remained a headwind to sales. Volume improved in part due to a 13% increase in sales to users.\nThe impact from changes in dealer inventory was minimal, as the $1.4 billion build in the first quarter was similar to that seen in the first quarter of 2022. Services sales volume was slightly down, mainly due to dealer ordering patterns or services to their customers remain positive.\nCompared to our expectations a quarter ago, sales were higher than we anticipated, largely due to slightly stronger volume and better-than-expected price realization.\nOn volume, sales to users outpaced our expectations due to strong demand. In addition, the improving supply chain supported higher levels of production across our primary segments. This enabled dealers to increase their inventory levels ahead of the selling season by slightly more than we had expected.\nMoving to Slide 10. First quarter operating profit increased by 47% to $2.7 billion. Adjusted operating profit increased by 79% versus the prior year quarter as favorable price realization outpaced higher manufacturing costs. Sales volume was also a benefit.\nOur first quarter adjusted operating profit margin of 21.1% was a 740 basis point increase versus the prior year.\nNow let me explain why our adjusted operating profit margin was so much better than we had expected. While manufacturing costs did increase year-over-year, the increase was less than we had than anticipated and was the most important factor in the quarter. As we have mentioned, volumes were better than expected due to favorable demand and improvements in the supply chain.\nThis help manufacturing cost was both factory efficiency and cost absorption were better than expected. Freight costs were also lower than we had anticipated due to lower premium freight utilization and rate reductions. Material costs were in line with our expectations and did not impact the margin outperformance.\nIn addition to lower manufacturing costs, price realization was also stronger than we had anticipated a quarter ago. Stronger-than-anticipated volume had a smaller beneficial impact on margins. Spend on strategic investments was also lower than expected, as project spend ramps up slower than we had planned.\nMoving to Slide 11, I'll review segment performance. Starting with Construction Industries, sales increased by 10% in the first quarter to $6.7 billion due to favorable price realization, partially offset by lower sales volume and unfavorable currency impacts.\nThe decrease in sales volume was driven by the impact from changes in dealer inventories, which increased by less in the first quarter of 2023 than compared to the prior year. Compared to our expectations, sales were higher due to stronger volumes.\nWhile sales to end users were as we'd anticipated, the dealer inventory increase was slightly above our expectations.\nBy region, sales in North America rose by 33% due to favorable price realization and higher sales volume. Supply chain improvements enabled stronger-than-expected shipments in North America, supporting delivery structuring in the region. This is a positive, as North America continues to be our most constrained region from a dealer inventory perspective.\nSales in Latin America decreased by 4% primarily due to lower sales volume, partially offset by favorable price realization.\nIn EAME, sales increased by 5% on favorable price realization, partially offset by favorable currency impacts.\nSales in Asia Pacific decreased by 21% primarily due to lower sales volume and unfavorable currency impact, partially offset by favorable price realization.\nFirst quarter profit for Construction Industries increased by 69% versus the prior year to $1.8 billion. Price realization mainly drove the increase. This was partially offset by lower sales volume, including an unfavorable product mix and higher manufacturing costs.\nThe segment's operating margin of 26.5% was an increase of 920 basis points versus last year. The segment margin for the quarter exceeded our expectations on moderating manufacturing costs and better-than-expected price and volume.\nManufacturing costs were lower than we had expected on favorable freight, manufacturing efficiencies and absorption. Production volume was more favorable than we had anticipated, which closed the usual favorable benefits margins from the fourth quarter to the first. You will recall that in January, we said we did not expect that to happen.\nTurning to Slide 12. Resource Industries sales grew by 21% in the first quarter to $3.4 billion. The increase was primarily due to favorable price realization and higher sales volume. Although aftermarket sales volumes were lower in resource industries due to dealer buying patterns, dealer services to customers remain positive.\nFirst quarter profit for Resource Industries increased by 112% versus the prior year to $764 million mainly due to favorable price realization and higher sales volume. This was partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs.\nThe segment's operating margin of 22.3% was an increase of 950 basis points versus last year. Segment margin was better than we expected due to lower manufacturing costs, including favorable absorption, efficiencies and freight. Price realization and volume benefits also exceeded our expectations.\nNow on Slide 13. Energy & Transportation sales increased by 24% in the first quarter to $6.3 billion, with sales up double digits across all applications. Oil and gas sales increased by 39%, power generation sales by 27%, industrial sales rose by 23%. And finally, transportation sales increased by 14%.\nFirst quarter profit for Energy & Transportation increased by 96% versus the prior year to $1.1 billion. The increase was mainly due to favorable price realization and higher sales volume. Unfavorable manufacturing costs and higher SG&A and R&D expenses acted as a partial offset.\nSG&A and R&D expenses increased primarily due to investments aligned with our strategic initiatives, including electrification and services growth.\nThe segment's operating margin of 16.9% was an increase of 620 basis points versus last year, but lower than the fourth quarter as is typical from a seasonality perspective. Compared to our expectations last quarter, margin was better than anticipated on lower manufacturing costs due in part to favorable absorption. Volume was also modestly stronger than we had expected.\nMoving to Slide 14. Financial Products revenue increased by 15% to $902 million primarily due to higher average financing rates across all regions. Segment profit decreased by 3% to $232 million.\nThe slight profit decrease was mainly due to unfavorable impacts from equity securities, currency exchange losses and mark-to-market adjustments on derivative contracts. However, higher net yield on average earning assets and lower provision for credit losses acted as a partial offset.\nBusiness activity remains strong, and our portfolio continues to perform well. Past dues in the quarter were 2.00%, a 5 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter of 2022. This is the lowest first quarter past dues percentage since 2006. And whilst retail new business volume declined compared to the first quarter of 2022, this was expected as high interest rates drove more cash deals and increased competition from banks.\nFinally, we continue to see strong demand for used equipment, as prices remain elevated while used equipment inventory is at historic lows.\nBefore I move on, I want to point out that CAT Financial has strong liquidity and broad access to funding. We are funded through the wholesale debt markets rather than from customer deposits, and we match assets and liabilities based on duration, currency and interest rate profile.\nAs we have mentioned previously, in a rising interest rate environment, banks are able to provide more competitive interest rates than Cat Financial, and we tend to lose some share of the machines financed.\nIn the event of a slowdown in lending from regional banks, we are well positioned to step in and fund creditworthy customers, so they can purchase their machines.\nNow on Slide 15. We continue to generate strong ME&T free cash flows. ME&T free cash flow of $1.4 billion in the quarter was about a $1.8 billion increase compared to an outflow in the prior year.\nThe increase was primarily driven by higher profit. This increase is notable in the quarter that included our annual short-term incentive payout and a rise in working capital impacted by an increase in Caterpillar inventory.\nAs Jim mentioned, following the strong half -- first -- strong first quarter, we expect to end the year in the top half of our ME&T free cash flow range of $4 billion to $8 billion.\nCapEx was around $400 million in the quarter, and we still expect to spend around $1.5 billion for the year. As Jim mentioned, capital deployment was about $1 billion in the quarter for dividends and share repurchases.\nOur balance sheet remains strong, and we have ample liquidity with an enterprise cash balance of $6.8 billion.\nNow on Slide 16, I will share some high-level assumptions for the full year, followed by the second quarter. Looking at the full year, we expect a strong top line supported by price and higher sales to users, with healthy underlying end markets.\nAs Jim mentioned, we expect full year reported sales for Construction Industries to be impacted by dealer inventory movements, particularly in the second half of the year. Underlying demand remains strong and as we do expect Construction Industries sales to users to show positive growth in the next 3 quarters.\nWe anticipate continued strength in Resource Industries end markets and stronger end user sales in 2023. In addition, as typical seasonality would suggest, we expect to see some sales ramp in the second half in Energy & Transportation given strong demand for large engines and turbines.\nMoving on to margins. Based on our current planning assumptions, we anticipate full year adjusted operating profit margins to be in the top half of our target range. Given the favorable impact of cost absorption in the first quarter, which we do not expect to recur, we anticipate margins in the remaining quarters of the year will be lower than the first quarter level, while underlying demand and end markets remain strong.\nAlso despite the slower-than-expected start, we anticipate the spend related to strategic investments within SG&A and R&D will ramp through the year. We expect price to continue to be favorable, although the absolute dollar value of the year-over-year price increases will moderate as we lap through the increases put through in 2022.\nWe also expect the relationship between price and manufacturing costs for machines to normalize as the year progresses, as we've now caught up to the manufacturing cost increases, which have outpaced price in late 2021 and early 2022. This means that the benefit to margins of price outpacing manufacturing cost inflation will moderate tempering the possibility of further margin expansion.\nKeep in mind, similar to the first quarter, we still anticipate a headwind of about $80 million per quarter at the corporate level related to pension expense. We also continue to anticipate restructuring expenses of around $700 million this year, with around $100 million remaining following the first quarter. And the global effective tax rate should be around 23%, excluding discrete items.\nNow on to our assumptions for the second quarter. We expect higher sales in the second quarter compared to the prior year on strong sales to users and price. Following the typical seasonal pattern, we expect higher sales in the second quarter as compared to the first.\nWe expect Energy & Transportation sales will accelerate given strong sales to users, which are supported by healthy demand. We expect to report flattish sales levels compared to the first quarter in Construction Industries and Resource Industries. Both segments are expected to report positive sales to users.\nIn the second quarter of 2022, we saw a decrease in deal inventory of $400 million. We expect a smaller decrease in the second quarter of 2023. Specific to second quarter margins versus the prior year, adjusted operating margins at the enterprise and segment level should be substantially stronger than the prior year on favorable price and volume. However, we do expect to see a return to the typical seasonal pattern of lower second quarter margins compared to the first quarter, despite higher sales.\nWe expect the year-over-year benefit of price realization in the second quarter to moderate compared to the benefit we saw in the first quarter, as we lapped prior year increases.\nIn addition, SG&A and R&D investment spend should increase, as we continue to accelerate our strategic investments in areas like autonomy, alternative fuels, connectivity, digital and electrification.\nFinally, we do not anticipate that the favorable absorption impact that we saw in the first quarter will be repeated. At the segment level, in Construction Industries, we expect lower second quarter margins compared to the first quarter largely due to the lack of a favorable impact from absorption and a ramp-up in strategic investment spend.\nLikewise, second quarter margins in Resource Industries were likely to be lower than the first quarter as is the typical seasonal pattern. Conversely, Energy & Transportation should see a slight margin improvement compared to the first quarter levels, supported by stronger sales volume as demand remains healthy.\nNow turning to Slide 17, let me summarize. Sales grew by 17% led by strong price realization and volume gains. The adjusted operating profit margin increased by 740 basis points to 21.1%.\nME&T free cash flow was strong at $1.4 billion, and we expect to be at the top half of our ME&T free cash flow range of $4 billion to $8 billion for the full year.\nAfter a strong first quarter, we currently expect our 2023 adjusted operating profit margins will be in the top half of our target range.\nThe environment remains positive with improving supply chain dynamics, a strong backlog and healthy underlying end markets. We will continue to execute our strategy for long-term profitable growth. And with that, we'll take your questions.",

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ryan Fiedler. Thank you. Please go ahead.\n\nRyan Fiedler\n\nThank you, Emma. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Caterpillar's Fourth Quarter of 2022 Earnings Call. I'm Ryan Fiedler, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me today are Jim Umpleby, Chairman and CEO; Andrew Bonfield, Chief Financial Officer; Kyle Epley, Senior Vice President of the Global Finance Services Division; and Rob Rengel, Senior IR Manager.\nDuring our call, which will extend to 8:40 a.m. Central, we'll be discussing the fourth quarter and full year earnings release we issued earlier today. You can find our slides, the news release and a webcast recap at investors.caterpillar.com under Events and Presentations. The content of this call is protected by U.S. and international copyright law. Any rebroadcast, retransmission, reproduction or distribution of all or part of this content without Caterpillar's prior written permission is prohibited.\nMoving to Slide 2. During our call today, we'll make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. We'll also make assumptions that could cause our actual results to be different than the information we're sharing with you on this call. Please refer to our recent SEC filings and the forward-looking statements reminder in the news release for details on factors that individually or in aggregate could cause our actual results to vary materially from our forecast. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings.\nOn today's call, we'll also refer to non-GAAP numbers. For a reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers to the appropriate U.S. GAAP numbers, please see the appendix of the earnings call slides.\nToday, we reported profit per share of $2.79 for the fourth quarter of 2022 compared with $3.91 of profit per share in the fourth quarter of 2021. We're including adjusted profit per share in addition to our U.S. GAAP results. Our adjusted profit per share was $3.86 for the fourth quarter of 2022 compared with adjusted profit per share of $2.69 for the fourth quarter of 2021.\nAdjusted profit per share for both quarters excluded mark-to-market gains for remeasurement of pension and other post-employment benefit plans as well as restructuring items. Adjusted profit per share for the fourth quarter of 2022 also excluded a goodwill impairment.\nNow let's turn to Slide 3 and turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Jim Umpleby.\n\nD. James Umpleby\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Caterpillar Inc.\n\nThanks, Ryan. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. As we close out 2022, I'd like to start by recognizing our global team for another strong quarter. Our results reflect healthy demand across most end markets for our products and services. We remain focused on executing our strategy and continue to invest for long-term profitable growth.\nIn today's call, I'll begin with my perspectives on our performance in the quarter and for the full year. I'll then provide some insights on our end markets. Lastly, I'll provide an update on our sustainability journey.\nOverall, it was another strong quarter as demand remained healthy for our products and services. Sales rose by 20% versus the fourth quarter of 2021, better than we expected. Supply chain improvements enabled stronger-than-expected shipments, particularly in Construction Industries and supported an increase in dealer inventories. We achieved double-digit top line increases in each of our 3 primary segments and saw sales growth in North America, Latin America and EAME, while Asia Pacific was about flat.\nAdjusted operating profit margins increased to 17% in the fourth quarter, an all-time record, as we saw our margins improve both on a sequential and year-over-year basis. Adjusted profit per share was $3.86, which includes an unfavorable $0.41 per share of foreign currency headwind largely due to ME&T balance sheet translation. This was caused by the rapid decline in the U.S. dollar late in the year and reversed much of the favorable impact we saw in the first 3 quarters of 2022. We generated a 17% increase in total sales to $59.4 billion in the year. Services also increased by 17% to $22 billion.\nAdjusted operating profit margin for the full year was 15.4%, a 170 basis point increase over the prior year. Although we did not achieve our Investor Day margin targets for the year, which I'll discuss more in a moment, I'm pleased that we increased adjusted operating profit by over $2 billion and grew absolute OPEB dollars, which is our internal measure of profitable growth. For the year, we achieved adjusted profit per share of $13.84, also an all-time record. In addition, we generated $5.8 billion of ME&T free cash flow, firmly in our target range. Finally, despite the strong sales in the fourth quarter, backlog grew by $400 million in the quarter to end the year at $30.4 billion, a 32% year-over-year increase.\nAs I've mentioned, we did see some improvement in certain areas of the supply chain in the fourth quarter, however, pockets of challenge continue, particularly with some suppliers related to Energy & Transportation and Resource Industries. Similar to previous quarters, our sales would have been higher, if not for these supply chain issues.\nOur global team delivered one of the best years in our nearly 100-year history, including record full year adjusted profit per share. Despite the supply chain challenges, our team achieved double-digit top line growth and generated strong ME&T free cash flow. We remain committed to serving our customers, executing our strategy and investing for long-term profitable growth.\nTurning to Slide 4. In the fourth quarter of 2022, sales increased 20% versus last year to $16.6 billion. The increase was due to favorable price realization and volume growth, which included dealer inventory increases and growth in sales of equipment to end users. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2021, sales to users increased 8%, broadly in line with our expectations.\nFor machines, including Construction Industries and Resource Industries, sales to users rose by 4%, while Energy & Transportation was up 19%. Sales to users in Construction Industries were up 1%, in line with expectations. As a reminder, nonresidential represents approximately 75% of Caterpillar sales in Construction Industries.\nNorth American sales to users increased as demand remained healthy for both nonresidential and residential despite some moderation in residential. Latin America saw higher sales to users, while EAME and Asia Pacific declined slightly in the quarter. However, excluding China, sales to users in the Asia Pacific region increased.\nIn Resource Industries, sales to users increased 13%, which was lower than anticipated mainly due to timing issues related to outbound logistics and commissioning. The segment sales to users increased primarily due to heavy construction and quarry and aggregates.\nIn Energy & Transportation, sales to users increased by 19%, slightly above our expectations. In the fourth quarter, oil and gas sales to users benefited from continued strength in large engine repowers. We also saw strong turbine and turbine-related services. Power generation and industrial sales to users continue to remain positive due to favorable market conditions. Transportation declined from a relatively low base, primarily due to lower locomotive deliveries while marine was up slightly.\nDealer inventory increased by about $700 million in the fourth quarter, which was above our expectations compared to a decrease of about $100 million in the same quarter last year. As I mentioned, supply chain improvements enabled stronger-than-expected shipments, particularly in Construction Industries, and supported an increase in dealer inventories. We saw increases in each of our primary segments. And within Construction Industries, dealer inventories are now in their typical historical range of 3 to 4 months of projected sales. In Construction Industries, the largest dealer inventory increase came in North America, which benefited our most constrained region. Over 70% of the combined year-end dealer inventory in Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation is supported by customer orders.\nAs expected, we generated improved adjusted operating profit margin in the quarter, both year-over-year and sequentially. Our adjusted operating profit margin increased by 560 basis points versus last year to 17%, which does not include the noncash goodwill impairment charges and restructuring costs associated with the rail division. I'll provide more detail in rail later in my remarks.\nTurning to Slide 5. I'll now provide full year highlights. In 2022, we generated sales of $59.4 billion up 17% versus last year. This was due to favorable price realization and higher sales volume, driven by the impact from changes in dealer inventory, increased services and higher sales of equipment to end users. As I mentioned, we generated $22 billion of services revenues in 2022, a 17% increase over 2021. Services growth in 2022 benefited from our ongoing initiatives and investments as well as price realization. We now have over 1.4 billion -- 1.4 million connected assets, up from 1.2 million in 2021. We delivered over 60% of our new equipment with a customer value agreement and the launch of our new app, called Cat Central, helped drive growth in e-commerce sales to users. We also had the highest level of parts availability in our history.\nOverall, our confidence continues to increase that we'll achieve our $28 billion services target in 2026. Our full year adjusted operating profit margin was 15.4%, a 170 basis point increase over 2021. Although we significantly increased margins in the fourth quarter versus last year, overall, they did not improve enough for us to achieve our full year Investor Day and margin targets. Our margins in 2022 were impacted by supply chain inefficiencies, ongoing inflationary pressures within manufacturing costs and our conscious decision to continue to invest for profitable growth.\nAs I mentioned during our last earnings call, our margin targets are progressive, which means we expect to achieve higher operating profit margins as sales increase. In an inflationary environment -- in a higher inflationary environment, where a relatively larger portion of the sales increase is due to price realization, there's less operating leverage, which makes the delivery of those progressive margins more challenging. Andrew will provide more information about our operating profit margin targets.\nMoving to Slide 6. We generated ME&T free cash flow of $5.8 billion for the full year, which was in line with our Investor Day range of $4 billion to $8 billion. We returned $6.7 billion to shareholders or 115% of ME&T free cash flow, which included $4.2 billion in repurchased stock and $2.4 billion in dividends to shareholders. We remain proud of our dividend aristocrat status and continue to expect to return substantially all ME&T free cash flow to shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases.\nNow on Slide 7, I'll share some high-level assumptions on our expectations moving forward. While we continue to closely monitor global macroeconomic conditions, overall demand remains healthy across our segments, and we expect 2023 to be better than 2022 on both top and bottom line. Just to remind you, our internal measure of profitable growth is absolute OPEB dollars. We believe increasing absolute OPEB dollars will lead to continued higher total shareholder returns over time. We expect to achieve our updated adjusted operating profit margin targets and ME&T free cash flow target range of $4 billion to $8 billion during 2023.\nNow I'll discuss our outlook for key end markets this year, starting with Construction Industries. In North America, overall, we see positive momentum in 2023. We expect nonresidential construction in North America to grow due to the positive impact of government-related infrastructure investments, healthy backlogs and rental replenishment. Although residential construction continues to moderate due to tightening financial conditions, it remains at a healthy level.\nIn Asia Pacific, excluding China, we expect growth in Construction Industries due to public infrastructure spending and supportive commodity prices. As we mentioned during our last earnings call, weakness continues in China in the excavator industry above 10 tons. We expect it to remain below 2022 levels due to low construction activity. In EAME, business activity is expected to be about flat versus last year based on healthy backlogs and strong construction demand in the Middle East, offset by uncertain economic conditions in Europe. Construction activity in Latin America is expected to be flat to slightly down versus the strong 2022 performance.\nIn Resource Industries, we expect healthy mining demand to continue as commodity prices remain above investment thresholds. That said, our customers remained capital disciplined. We anticipate production and utilization levels will remain elevated, and our autonomous solutions continue to gain momentum. We expect the continuation of high equipment utilization and a low level of parked trucks, which both support future demand for our equipment and services. We continue to believe the energy transition will support increased commodity demand, expanding our total addressable market and providing opportunities for profitable growth.\nIn heavy construction and quarry and aggregates, we anticipate continued growth supported by infrastructure and major nonresidential construction projects. In Energy & Transportation, we expect sales growth due to strong order rates in most applications. In oil and gas, although customers remain disciplined, we are encouraged by continued strength in demand and order intakes for the year.\nNew equipment orders for solar turbines continue to be robust. Power generation orders are expected to remain healthy, including data center strength. Industrial remains healthy with momentum continuing for 2023. In rail, North American locomotive sales are expected to remain muted. We anticipate strength in high-speed marine as customers continue to upgrade aging fleets.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we took in a $925 million noncash goodwill impairment charge related to our rail division, which is part of the Energy & Transportation segment. The impairment was primarily driven by a revision in our long-term outlook for the company's locomotive offerings. We believe opportunities exist for new locomotives, overhauls, repowers and modernizations but at lower levels than previously forecasted and occurring over a longer time horizon.\nIn addition to the goodwill impairment charge, we also incurred restructuring cost of $180 million in the quarter, primarily related to noncash inventory adjustments within this division. Importantly, our rail services, including track, signaling and freight car remain robust.\nProgress Rail plays an integral part in supporting and maintaining rail infrastructure in countries around the globe, and rail remains one of the most efficient ways of transporting goods across the land. We will continue to offer Tier 4 solutions to our customers, however, strategic investments in new locomotive products will continue shifting to competitive sustainable solutions to help customers meet their carbon reduction initiatives, including hybrid, full battery electric and alternative fuel power sources, including hydrogen. These alternative power solutions for rail will leverage modularity and scale across Resource Industries, Construction Industries and Energy & Transportation. We believe these enterprise-wide investments will provide Caterpillar with a strategic advantage over time.\nMoving to Slide 8. We continue to advance our sustainability journey in the fourth quarter of 2022 as we strive to help our customers achieve their climate-related objectives. In November, Caterpillar announced the successful demonstration of its first battery electric 793 large mining truck prototype with support from key mining customers participating in Caterpillar's early learner program. The truck performed at the same specification as a diesel truck on our 7-kilometer course, achieving a top speed of 60 kilometers per hour carrying a full load and 12 kilometers per hour with that same load at a 10% grade.\nIn addition to the truck, we also unveiled plans to create a working and more sustainable mindset of the future at our Arizona-based proving ground. This includes installing and utilizing a variety of renewable energy sources, leveraging technologies from our Electric Power division and new Electrification & Advanced Power Solutions division. We also invested in Lithos Energy, Inc., a lithium-ion battery producer that manufacturers battery packs for the types of demanding environments our Cat equipment thrives in. This collaboration supports our commitment to delivering robust [enterprise] products and solutions to our customers.\nLastly, in 2022, we continue to advance our autonomous journey, achieving an industry first of moving over 5 billion tons autonomously across 25 mine tags worldwide. During the fourth quarter, we announced our first autonomous solution in the aggregates industry. We'll collaborate with Luck Stone, the nation's largest family-owned and operated producer of crushed stone, sand and gravel, to expand these solutions beyond mining. We'll utilize Cat MineStar Command for hauling system on 777 trucks, contributing to continued improvements in safety and productivity for our customers these examples reinforce our ongoing sustainability leadership and how we help our customers build a better, more sustainable world. We look forward to issuing our 18th annual sustainability report during the second quarter. With that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew R. J. Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin by covering our fourth quarter results, including the performance of our business segments. Then I'll cover the balance sheet and ME&T free cash flow before concluding on high-level assumptions for 2023, including the first quarter.\nBeginning on Slide 9. Sales and revenues for the fourth quarter increased by 20% or $2.8 billion to $16.6 billion. The sales increase versus the prior year was due to strong price realization and volume, partially offset by currency impacts. Sales were higher than we expected as supply chain constraints eased in some areas and we were able to ship more product.\nOperating profit increased by 4% or $69 million to $1.7 billion. The strong price realization and volume growth were mostly offset by a goodwill impairment charge, higher manufacturing costs and restructuring expenses. Our adjusted operating profit was $2.8 billion, up $1.2 billion versus the prior year, and the adjusted operating profit margin was 17.0%. This was an increase of 560 basis points versus the prior year quarter due to favorable price realization and volume growth, which outpaced manufacturing cost increases. Fourth quarter margins were lower than we were targeting as well as being lower than where we needed them to be to meet our full year Investor Day margin target. I will talk more about that in a moment.\nAdjusted profit per share increased by 43% to $3.86 in the fourth quarter compared to $2.69 in the fourth quarter of last year. Adjusted profit per share in the fourth quarter excluded a goodwill impairment charge of $925 million or $1.71 per share related to our rail division, as Jim has explained. This charge is held at the corporate level and does not impact Energy & Transportation segment margins.\nAdjusted profit per share figures also exclude mark-to-market gains for the remeasurement of pension and OPEB plans and restructuring items. Restructuring cost of $209 million or $0.29 in the quarter were primarily related to noncash inventory write-downs within our rail division. Again, these charges impacted the corporate level, and the inventory write-downs are within cost of goods sold in the income statement.\nFor the full year, restructuring costs were about $600 million. Last quarter, we told you that a noncash charge of approximately $600 million could slip into 2023, which it did. We expect to close on the divestiture of our longwall business in early February, and the noncash charge will be included in our first quarter 2023 restructuring charges.\nThe provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter, excluding the amounts relating to mark-to-market goodwill impairment and other discrete items, reflected a global annual effective tax rate of approximately 23%, as we expected. Finally, our fourth quarter results include an unfavorable noncash foreign currency impact within other income expense of $0.41 related to ME&T balance sheet translation in the quarter.\nTo explain, many of our foreign entities are U.S. dollar functional. These entities are generally in a net liability position causing a favorable translation impact in periods of U.S. dollar strength. Within each of the first 3 quarters of the year, we saw some benefit as the dollar sequentially trended stronger. However, within the fourth quarter, this trend reversed. Given the significant weakening of the U.S. dollar within the fourth quarter of 2022, the negative impact to profit was sizable. As you would imagine, our forward-looking assumptions do not include expectations for currency fluctuations.\nTo give a bit more context, other income and expense, excluding the impact of pension mark-to-market adjustments, has trended at around $250 million of income per quarter for all of 2021 and for the first 3 quarters of 2022. This has reflected a number of offsetting items, including currency. In the fourth quarter, excluding pension mark-to-market, other income and expense swung to a $70 million expense. The majority of that change is due to the foreign exchange translation adjustment, which is why we have highlighted this.\nOverall, sales were better than we had expected as we had anticipated margins increase, but as I said earlier, not by enough to meet our Investor Day margin targets. Adjusted profit per share rose by 43%, but that was moderated by the $0.41 noncash foreign currency balance sheet translation charge that I mentioned a moment ago.\nMoving on to Slide 10. The 20% increase in the top line was driven by favorable price realization and higher sales volume. Volume was supported by the $800 million year-over-year impact to changes in dealer inventory and an 8% increase in sales to users. From a sales perspective, currency remained a headwind given the strength of the U.S. dollar. As I mentioned earlier, sales were higher than we expected in the quarter, mostly due to some improvements in the supply chain, which enables stronger shipments, particularly in Construction Industries. The increase in dealer inventories reflects the improved shipments in Construction Industries and customer delivery timing in Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation. Overall, market dynamics remain healthy as sales to users continue to increase, and our backlog is strong at $30.4 billion.\nMoving to Slide 11. Fourth quarter operating profit increased by 4%, impacted by the goodwill impairment charge and restructuring expenses. Adjusted operating profit increased by 78% as favorable price realization and higher sales volume continued to outpace higher manufacturing costs. Manufacturing costs increased primarily due to higher material costs and unfavorable cost absorption as we decreased our inventories in the fourth quarter compared to an increase in the prior year.\nRelated to our recent price cost performance, keep in mind that we are still catching up from the increases in manufacturing costs, which have occurred over the last few years. In particular, material freight costs have increased by about 20% since 2020 and our full year gross margins remain below our 2019 levels. Our fourth quarter adjusted operating profit margin of 17% was a 560 basis point increase versus the prior year. As Jim has mentioned, this is our highest ever quarterly adjusted operating margin.\nAs I said earlier, we did not achieve our Investor Day margin targets. As Jim said, in a high inflation environment, you do not get the benefit of operating leverage that you would normally see -- expect when sales increases are volume-driven. You will recall that our margin targets are progressive, which means at the top end of the range, for every $1 billion in sales, incremental revenues, we need to deliver close to 40 percentage points of that through adjusted operating profit. This is challenging to achieve in a high inflation environment when sales increasing due to price realization designed to mitigate increases in manufacturing costs. Also, please keep in mind that we made a conscious decision to continue to invest for future profitable growth.\nWe have not seen inflation anywhere near double-digit levels since the targets were introduced in 2017. In a low inflation environment, productivity improvements can be made to offset inflationary increases so nominal targets remain effective. In the current high inflation environment, you cannot achieve the level of productivity, so we are adjusting the target sales range to reflect the inflationary increases we've seen in 2022.\nOn Slide 12, we've updated our margin target slope to account for the impact of inflation as depicted on the chart. We still have the same aspirations for margins, however, the corresponding level of sales and costs are generally around 9% higher than they have been in a noninflationary environment. As you can see, the low end of the sales range is now $42 billion while the top end is $72 billion. This compares to the previous bookends of $39 billion and $66 billion, respectively.\nThe key point is that despite the inflationary impact on sales and costs which impact margins, our expectations for profit and cash generation have not changed, and we remain focused on delivering increases in absolute OPEB dollars. Depending on the inflationary environment that we see in 2023, we'll have to revisit the range next January.\nMoving to Slide 13. Across our 3 primary segments, sales and margins improved in the fourth quarter versus the prior year supported by price realization and sales volume. As expected, price more than offset manufacturing costs in all 3 segments.\nStarting with Construction Industries. Sales increased by 19% in the fourth quarter to $6.8 billion, driven by favorable price realization and sales volume, partially offset by currency. Volume increased primarily due to changes in dealer inventory and higher sales to users. Dealer inventory increased in the quarter compared to a reduction last year. Sales in North America rose by 34% due mostly to strong pricing. The positive change is due to inventory and higher sales to users.\nSales in Latin America increased by 39% on strong price realization and higher sales volume, the latter due mostly to a favorable change in dealer inventory. In the EAME, sales increased by 10% on price realization and sales volume, partially offset by the unfavorable currency. Sales volume was supported by a positive year-over-year change in dealer inventory as the decrease in the prior year's quarter was larger than this year's decline. Sales in Asia Pacific decreased by 10%, mostly due to unfavorable currency impacts, partially offset by stronger price realization. Lower sales volume also contributed to the decline as dealers decreased inventory during the fourth quarter compared to an increase in the prior year.\nFourth quarter profit for Construction Industries increased by 87% versus the prior year to $1.5 billion. Price realization and higher sales volume drove the increase. Unfavorable manufacturing costs largely reflected higher material costs, unfavorable cost absorption and increased freight. The segment's operating margin of 21.7% was an increase of 780 basis points versus last year. The margin for the quarter was better than we had expected on strong volume, price and moderating material costs. As a reminder, the fourth quarter is usually the weakest quarter for margins in Construction Industries, but with the benefit of price realization, the reverse was true in 2022.\nTurning to Slide 14. Resource Industries sales grew by 26% in the fourth quarter to $3.4 billion. The improvement was primarily due to favorable price realization and higher sales volume. Volume increased due to the impact of changes in dealer inventories and higher sales of equipment to end users. Dealer inventory increased more during the fourth quarter '22 than the prior year due to the timing of customer deliveries, which includes the impact of outbound logistics delays and commissioning. Fourth quarter profit for Resource Industries increased by 110% versus the prior year to $605 million, mainly due to favorable price realization and higher sales volume. This was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, primarily material, freight and volume-related manufacturing costs. The segment's operating margin of 17.6% was an increase of 700 basis points versus last year, strengthening versus the third quarter as we had expected.\nNow on Slide 15. Energy & Transportation sales increased by 19% in the fourth quarter to $6.8 billion with sales up across all applications. Oil and gas sales increased by 38% due to higher sales of turbines and turbine-related services, reciprocating engines and aftermarket parts. Power generation sales increased by 12% as sales were higher in large reciprocating engines, supporting data center applications. Sales increased in small reciprocating engines, turbines and turbine-related services as well. Industrial sales rose by 19% with strength across all regions. Finally, transportation sales increased by 6%, benefited from marine applications and reciprocating engine aftermarket parts. Rail services were offset by lower deliveries of locomotives.\nFourth quarter profit for Energy & Transportation increased by 72% versus the prior year to $1.2 billion. The improvement was primarily due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization. Higher manufacturing and SG&A and R&D costs acted as partial offset. Manufacturing cost increases largely reflected higher material costs and volume-related manufacturing costs. SG&A and R&D expenses increased due to investments aligned with our strategic initiatives, including electrification and services growth. The segment's operating margin of 17.3% was an increase of 530 basis points versus last year, strengthening versus the third quarter as we had expected.\nMoving to Slide 16. Financial Products revenue increased by 10% to $853 million, benefited by higher average financing rates across all regions. Segment profit decreased by 24% to $189 million. The profit decrease was mainly due to a higher provision for credit losses at Cat Financial and an unfavorable impact from equity securities in insurance services. The increase in provisions reflects changes in general economic factors rather than company-specific economic factors. Despite these changes, our leading indicators remain strong. Past dues were 1.89% compared with 1.95% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021. Also, this was an 11 basis point decrease in past dues compared to the third quarter of 2022.\nRetail new business volume declined versus the prior year but remained steady compared to the third quarter. As I mentioned last quarter, Cat Financial is not seeing slowing business activity but continues to see strong competition from banks due to higher interest rates and more customers willing to pay cash for their machines. Used equipment demand remains strong with inventories at historically low levels. We continue to see high conversion rates as well as customers choose to buy at the end of the lease term.\nNow on Slide 17. ME&T free cash flow in the quarter increased by about $1.2 billion versus the prior year to $3 billion. The increase was primarily due to higher profit. On working capital, our inventory decreased by about $600 million in the quarter. Improved availability of some components benefited shipments as we decreased our work in process inventory. We also saw strong shipments of solar turbines in the quarter.\nWe repurchased about $900 million of common stock in the quarter and paid around $600 million in dividends. As Jim mentioned, we generated $5.8 billion in ME&T free cash flow for the year, inclusive of CapEx of about $1.3 billion. We are pleased with the strong free cash flow we generated in a year where we paid $1.3 billion in short-term incentive compensation and increased our inventories by over $2 billion. Our liquidity remains strong with an enterprise cash balance of $7 billion and another $1.5 billion in slightly longer-dated liquid marketable securities, which generate improved yields on that cash.\nNow on Slide 18. I'll share some high-level assumptions for the full year, followed by the first quarter. As we begin 2023, demand remains constructive, given the strong order backlog and improving supply chain dynamics, although we do not expect the benefit of a dealer inventory tailwind like we saw last year. As a reminder, dealer inventory rose by $2.4 billion in 2022. Around 40% of the increase relates to Construction Industries with the balance reflecting the timing of deliveries to customers in Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation. As Jim mentioned, over 70% of the combined year-end dealer inventory in Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation is supported by customer orders.\nFor the full year 2023, we anticipate increased sales supported by price realization. Although we expect stronger sales to users in 2023, the headwind from the $2.4 billion dealer inventory build in 2022 will moderate volume growth. Our planning assumption is that we do not expect a significant change in dealer inventory by the end of the year. We do expect service sales momentum to continue after reaching $22 billion in 2022. From a sales seasonality perspective, we expect a more typical year with lighter first quarter for total sales.\nFor the full year, we expect our adjusted operating profit to increase, reflecting higher sales, and we expect to be within our updated adjusted operating margin ranges. Pricing actions from 2022 will continue to roll into 2023, and we will evaluate future actions as appropriate to offset inflationary pressures. We currently expect to see a moderation of input cost inflation as the year progresses, and therefore, a corresponding moderation and price realization as we move through the year. Price though should still more than offset manufacturing costs for the year.\nIncreases in SG&A and R&D expenses are expected to exceed the benefit of lower short-term incentive compensation expense this year as we continue to invest in strategic initiatives such as services growth and technology, including digital, electrification and autonomy.\nBelow operating profit, we anticipate a headwind of approximately just over $800 million or about $80 million per quarter in other income and expense at the corporate level related to pension expense due to higher interest costs given higher interest rates. This is a non-cash item.\nFor the full year of 2022, the strengthening U.S. dollar acted as a tailwind of $189 million relating to the ME&T balance sheet translation impact that I spoke about earlier. This would not recur if the weakening we're seeing in rates thus far continues. Based on current rates, we'd see a headwind of around about $18 million in the first quarter. Remember that 2022 was not a typical year for us as margins increased sequentially throughout -- through the year as the benefit of price realization was stronger in the second half of the year. Also, manufacturing volumes were impacted by supply chain issues, which did impact absorption rates from quarter to quarter. These factors will mean that we do not expect to return to our normal seasonal margin patterns in 2023.\nMoving on, we expect to achieve our ME&T free cash flow target of $4 billion to $8 billion for the year, with CapEx in the range of about $1.5 billion. We'll have about $1.4 billion cash outflow in the first quarter related to the payout of last year's incentive compensation, slightly higher than we saw in the first quarter of 2022. We anticipate restructuring expenses of around $700 million this year, the majority of which is related to the longwall divestiture charge that I mentioned earlier. Finally, we anticipate a global effective tax rate of 23%, excluding discrete items.\nNow on to our assumptions for the first quarter. In the first quarter compared to the prior year, we expect sales to increase on price and slightly stronger volume, reflecting higher sales to users. With regard to seasonal inventory, we expect a typical seasonal build in the first quarter of this year. As a reminder, dealers increased inventories by $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2022, and we expect a lower build in the first quarter of 2023. Sales should increase across the 3 primary segments in the first quarter versus the prior year. Compared to the fourth quarter, we anticipate lower sales in the first quarter at the enterprise level following our typical seasonal pattern. We expect lower sales sequentially in each of our 3 primary segments as well.\nTo provide some color, Construction Industries is following an abnormally strong fourth quarter, where shipments exceeded our expectations. Resource Industries had a strong fourth quarter with its highest quarterly shipments since 2012 and expect lower sequential sales in the first quarter due to the timing of shipments, which, as you know, can be lumpy. Energy & Transportation sales should be sequentially lower as well following normal seasonable patterns. Keep in mind that solar turbines had a strong fourth quarter.\nSpecific to the first quarter versus the prior year, keep in mind that the first quarter margins last year were very low. We expect substantially strong enterprise and segment margins in the first quarter on favorable price and volume. Price realization should more than offset manufacturing costs at both the [enterprise and primary segment] levels as well. Also, we could see headwinds related to pension and currency below operating profit, as I just mentioned.\nCompared to the fourth quarter of 2022, we expect adjusted operating profit margins to be flattish to down for the first quarter of the year at the enterprise level. Keep in mind that our fourth quarter of '22 adjusted operating profit margins were our highest quarterly margins ever. By segment, in Construction Industries, we normally see higher margins in the fourth quarter -- first quarter. However, coming off a very strong fourth quarter, we expect lower volume to weigh on margins sequentially. This is the business which usually drives the enterprise-wide sequential margin improvement from the fourth quarter to the first. Similarly, lower volumes should drive sequentially lower margins in Resource Industries. And in Energy & Transportation, we expect lower margins sequentially following a strong fourth quarter, which is the normal pattern for this business.\nTurning to Slide 19, let me summarize. Sales grew by 20%, led by strong price realization and volume gains across the 3 primary segments. The adjusted operating profit margin increased by 560 basis points to 17%. ME&T free cash flow was strong at $3 billion for the quarter, and we continue to return cash to shareholders on a consistent basis. Service revenues were $22 billion for the full year, a 17% increase as momentum built in 2022. The outlook remains positive with improving supply chain dynamics and the backlog up around $400 million to over $30 billion. We've updated our margin target scope to account for the impact of inflation on sales and costs, and we expect our 2023 adjusted operating margins to be within our updated range.\nDespite the inflationary impact on sales and costs, our expectations for profit and cash flow generation have not changed, and we will continue to execute our strategy for long-term profit growth. I want to confirm that our full year 2022 restructuring costs were about $300 million for the year, so apologies if (inaudible) in the call.\nNow with that -- now we'll hand over to questions.",

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ryan Fiedler. Thank you. Please go ahead.\n\nRyan Fiedler\n\nThank you, Emma. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Caterpillar's Third Quarter of 2022 Earnings Call. I'm Ryan Fiedler, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me today are Jim Umpleby, Chairman and CEO; Andrew Bonfield, Chief Financial Officer; Kyle Epley, Senior Vice President of the Global Finance Services Division; and Rob Rengel, Senior IR Manager.\nDuring our call today, we'll be discussing the third quarter earnings release we issued earlier today. You can find our slides, the news release and a webcast recap at investors.caterpillar.com under Events & Presentations.\nThe content of this call is protected by U.S. and international copyright law. Any rebroadcast, retransmission, reproduction or distribution of all or part of this content without Caterpillar's prior written permission is prohibited.\nMoving to Slide 2. During our call today, we'll make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. We'll also make assumptions that could cause our actual results to be different from the information we're sharing with you on this call.\nPlease refer to our recent SEC filings and the forward-looking statements reminder in the news release for details on factors that individually or in aggregate could cause our actual results to vary materially from our forecast. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings.\nOn today's call, we'll also refer to non-GAAP numbers. For a reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers to the appropriate U.S. GAAP numbers, please see the appendix of the earnings call slides. In addition, the appendix includes a calendar of expected earnings dates in 2023, starting with January 31 for our fourth quarter call.\nToday, we reported profit per share of $3.87 for the third quarter of 2022 compared with $2.60 of profit per share in the third quarter of 2021. We're including adjusted profit per share in addition to our U.S. GAAP results.\nOur adjusted profit per share was $3.95 for the third quarter of 2022 compared with adjusted profit per share of $2.66 for the third quarter of 2021. Adjusted profit per share for both quarters excluded restructuring costs.\nNow let's turn to Slide 3 and turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Jim Umpleby.\n\nD. James Umpleby\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Caterpillar Inc.\n\nThanks, Ryan. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. As we close out the third quarter, I want to thank our global team for delivering another good quarter, including strong top line growth, higher operating profit margins and robust ME&T free cash flow despite continuing supply chain challenges.\nOur third quarter results reflected healthy demand across most end markets for our products and services. We remain focused on executing our strategy and continue to invest for long-term profitable growth.\nIn today's call, I'll begin with my perspectives on our performance in the quarter, and then I'll provide some insights on our end markets. Lastly, I'll provide an update on our sustainability journey.\nTurning to Slide 4. Overall, it was a very strong quarter. Sales increased 21%, in line with our expectations. Operating profit improved by 46%, although the margin improvement of 280 basis points was slightly less than we had anticipated.\nThe sales growth was led by price realization and volume growth. Sales were higher in all regions, with double-digit increases in each of our 3 primary segments. Services growth momentum continued in the third quarter as a result of our services initiatives and investments.\nSimilar to previous quarters, our top line would have been even higher if not for ongoing supply chain constraints. We generated strong operating profit margin improvements in the quarter, both on a year-over-year and sequential basis.\nThe adjusted operating profit margin was 16.5%. Adjusted profit per share increased 48% to $3.95. We generated robust ME&T free cash flow of $2.1 billion. Our backlog continued to grow. It increased by $1.6 billion in the quarter and is now $30 billion.\nCompared with the third quarter of 2021, sales to users increased 7%. For machines, including Construction Industries and Resource Industries, sales to users increased by 2%, while Energy & Transportation was up 22%.\nThe timing of deliveries from dealers to customers resulted in sales to users that were slightly below our expectations. Sales to users in Construction Industries were about flat. North American sales to users were up slightly. Dealer inventories in North America remained at relatively low levels due to healthy demand and supply chain constraints.\nLatin America experienced higher sales to users, while EAME declined slightly. Asia Pacific sales to users were down in the quarter. However, excluding China, sales to users in the Asia Pacific region increased.\nIn Resource Industries, sales to users increased 10%, with increases in mining as well as heavy construction and quarry and aggregates. In Energy & Transportation, sales to users increased by 22%. Oil and gas sales to users benefited in the third quarter from continued improvement in reciprocating engines.\nTurbines and turbine-related services were about flat. Power generation and industrial sales to users remained strong due to favorable market conditions. Transportation increased from a relatively low base, primarily on strength in marine and international locomotives.\nDealer inventory increased by about $700 million in the third quarter compared to a decrease of about $300 million in the same quarter last year. Most of the increase relates to timing differences between when we ship products to dealers and when the dealers, in turn, are able to deliver completed orders to customers.\nAlthough the rise in dealer inventory was greater than our expectations, inventories remain near the low end of the typical range.\nAs I mentioned, adjusted operating margins improved by 280 basis points to 16.5%. Strong price and volume offset increases in manufacturing costs in SG&A and R&D expenses.\nManufacturing cost increases reflected continued higher material and freight costs and manufacturing inefficiencies caused by supply chain disruptions, resulting in our margins for the quarter being slightly lower than we had anticipated.\nMoving to Slide 5. We generated $2.1 billion of ME&T free cash flow in the quarter. We repurchased $1.4 billion of stock and returned about $600 million in dividends to shareholders. We remain proud of our dividend aristocrat status and continue to expect to return substantially all ME&T free cash flow to shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases.\nNow on Slide 6. I'll share some high-level assumptions on our expectations moving forward. While we continue to closely monitor global macroeconomic conditions, overall demand remains healthy across our segments. We expect top line growth in the fourth quarter, both year-over-year and sequentially.\nThis expected performance reflects healthy demand and favorable price realization. We anticipate sales increases across our 3 primary segments as order levels and backlogs remain strong.\nAs a reminder, dealers have been focused on supplying customer orders, and we'll look to [replenish] aging rental fleets over time when the supply chain situation improves.\nWe expect adjusted operating profit margins to be significantly higher in the fourth quarter versus the prior year and slightly higher than in the third quarter. However, we now anticipate that our full-year margins will be at the low end or slightly below the low end of the Investor Day target range.\nThe headwind is primarily due to ongoing manufacturing efficiencies related to supply chain constraints, ongoing inflationary pressures within manufacturing, cost and our conscious decision to continue to invest for profitable growth.\nThat said, we expect to achieve our Investor Day ME&T free cash flow target range of $4 billion to $8 billion.\nNow I'll turn to our outlook for key end markets. Residential construction generally accounts for about 25% of sales in Construction Industries, while nonresidential is the remainder.\nIn North America, residential construction is moderating due to tightening financial conditions but remains at relatively high levels. We expect nonresidential construction in North America to strengthen, supported by the impact of government-related infrastructure investments.\nIn Asia Pacific, excluding China, we expect moderate growth due to higher infrastructure spending and commodity prices. As we mentioned last quarter, weakness continues in China in the excavator industry above 10 tons. It is expected to remain below the 2019 levels due to low construction activity.\nIn EAME, business activity is expected to be flat to slightly down versus last year, based on uncertain economic conditions in Europe. However, strong backlogs and announced infrastructure plans limit the decline. Construction activity in Latin America is expected to grow due to supportive commodity prices.\nIn Resource Industries, our mining customers continue to exhibit capital discipline. However, commodity prices remain supportive of continued investment, despite trending lower recently. We expect production and utilization levels will remain elevated, and our autonomous solutions continue to gain momentum. I'll highlight an example in a moment.\nWe expect the continuation of high equipment utilization and a low level of parked trucks, which both support future demand for our equipment and services. We continue to believe the energy transition will support increased commodity demand, expanded our total addressable market and provided opportunities for profitable growth.\nIn heavy construction and quarry and aggregates, we anticipate continued growth in the fourth quarter.\nIn Energy & Transportation, we expect continued sales momentum in the fourth quarter due to strong order rates in most applications. In oil and gas, although customers remain disciplined, we are encouraged by continued strength in reciprocating engine orders, especially for large engine repowers as asset utilization increases.\nNew equipment orders for Solar Turbines have strengthened significantly, particularly in oil and gas, indicating sales growth in late 2022 and into 2023. Solar services revenue is expected to remain steady. We expect a strong fourth quarter, which is typical of our -- which is typically our highest sales quarter of the year for Solar.\nPower generation orders remain healthy due to positive industry dynamics and continued data center strength. Industrial remains healthy with continued momentum in construction, agriculture and electric power. In rail, North American locomotive sales are expected to remain muted. We also anticipate growth in high-speed marine as customers continue to upgrade aging fleets.\nMoving to Slide 7. As we continue to advance our sustainability journey through the third quarter of 2022, Caterpillar, Cat Dealers and our customers announced a number of projects that will help contribute to a lower-carbon future. I'll highlight 2 today.\nIn late August, we announced a significant step in this journey when BHP Group Limited, Caterpillar and Finning International announced an agreement to replace BHP's entire haul truck fleet at the Escondida Mine in Chile, the world's largest copper producing mine.\nWe will replace 1 of the industry's largest mixed fleet that is currently comprised of over 160 haul trucks with new Caterpillar 798 AC electric drive haul trucks. Deliveries begin in 2023 and will extend over 10 years. The new electric drive trucks will feature technology that delivers significant improvements in material moving capacity, efficiency, reliability and safety.\nThe agreements allow BHP to accelerate the implementation of its autonomy plans by transitioning the fleet to include technology that enables autonomous operation. In addition, the agreement set forth a path for BHP to meet its decarbonization goals through the progressive implementation of zero-emission trucks.\nSecond, we're currently displaying 4 battery electric machine prototypes at bauma in Munich, Germany, including mini and medium excavators, a GC medium wheel loader and a compact wheel loader. Each machine is powered by Caterpillar battery prototypes and includes onboard AC chargers. We also plan to offer an offboard DC fast charging option.\nLeveraging our deep system integration experience, the batteries are scalable to industry and customer performance needs and maximize sustainability throughout their life cycle, including recycling and reuse at the end of life.\nThe Caterpillar-designed batteries in these machines will also be available to power other industrial applications, highlighting our ability to leverage technology across the enterprise.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew R. J. Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by walking you through our third quarter results, including the performance of our segments. Then I'll discuss the balance sheet and ME&T free cash flow before concluding as usual with our expectations for the fourth quarter and full year.\nBeginning on Slide 8. Sales and revenues for the third quarter increased by 21% or $3.6 billion to $15 billion. The increase was due to strong price realization and volume, partially offset by currency impacts. Operating profit increased by 46% or $761 million to $2.4 billion as price realization and volume growth were partially offset by higher manufacturing and SG&A and R&D costs.\nOur adjusted operating profit margin of 16.5% increased by 280 basis points versus the prior year's quarter as the impact of price realization and volume growth outpaced continued manufacturing cost increases.\nAdjusted profit per share increased by 48% to $3.95 in the third quarter compared to $2.66 last year. Adjusted profit per share for both quarters excluded restructuring costs, which were $0.08 per share this quarter compared to $0.06 in the prior year. In total, taxes benefited profit per share by about $0.06 per share for the quarter.\nDuring the third quarter of 2022, we reached a settlement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service that resolves all issues for tax years 2007 through 2016. We are pleased to have settled the audit without any penalties and within our reserves. The settlement includes, amongst other issues, the resolution of disputed tax treatment of profits earned by Caterpillar SARL in certain parts transactions.\nThe final tax assessed by the IRS for all issues under the settlement was $490 million for the 10-year period. [$407 million] of this was paid in the third quarter of 2022, and the associated estimated interest of $250 million is expected to be paid by the end of the year.\nThe settlement was within reserves, and the company recorded a discrete tax benefit of $41 million to reflect changes in estimates of prior-year taxes and related interest, net of tax.\nNow on Slide 9. The top line increased by 21% on strong price realization and volume, and our currency was a headwind within the strong U.S. dollar. Overall, sales were about as we expected. Regarding volume, the largest benefit versus the prior year was a $1 billion favorable quarter-over-quarter change in dealer inventory.\nSales to users increased by 7%. While there is continued uncertainty regarding the macroeconomic backdrop, demand indicators remain supported as sales to users increased by 7%. Backlog grew by $1.6 billion to $30 billion, and dealer inventory remains at the low end of the typical range.\nAs we've seen in recent quarters, the dealer inventory increase was primarily due to issues resulting from the timing of deliveries from dealers to customers and delays in the commissioning machines as a result of labor shortages and dealers.\nThe main impact was that sales to users was slightly lower than expected, with the corresponding offset increase in dealer inventories. As both Jim and I have indicated, we believe that the majority of this is timing and is not an indicator of changing market dynamics. Dealer inventories remained at the low end of the typical range.\nMoving to Slide 10. As I mentioned, third quarter operating profit increased by 46% on favorable price realization and volume. Price realization was in line with our expectations and was supported by healthy demand.\nManufacturing costs continue to increase versus the prior year, primarily due to material and freight cost increases as well as manufacturing inefficiencies due to supply chain constraints. Overall, the impact of favorable price realization exceeded manufacturing costs for the quarter.\nFinally, SG&A and R&D costs increased primarily due to investments aligned with our strategy for profitable growth, which included services growth and technology such as digital, electrification and autonomy.\nOur third quarter adjusted profit margin of 16.5% was a 280 basis point increase versus the prior year. The impact of price actions accelerated, so price realization was strong. Although we began to let the significant increases in material and freight costs seen in the second half of last year, we are still seeing cost increases from suppliers for materials in particular.\nFinally, related to our recent price cost performance, keep in mind that we are still catching up from the increases in manufacturing costs, which have occurred over the last few years.\nIn particular, material and freight costs have increased by about 20% since 2020. Our gross margin of 28.5% for the third quarter is now only just getting back in line with the levels seen in the third quarter of 2019, despite sales and revenues being higher.\nMoving to Slide 11. As we expected, segment sales and margins improved in the third quarter. Starting with Construction Industries, sales increased by 19% to $6.3 billion, driven by favorable price realization and sales volume, partially offset by currency. Volume increased primarily due to changes in dealer inventories, which increased in the quarter compared to a reduction last year.\nSales in North America rose by 29% due mostly to strong pricing and a favorable change in dealer inventory. Dealers in North America decreased their inventories in the third quarter of last year, whilst we saw some build this year. North American dealer inventories still are very low, which impacts their ability to supply the region.\nSales in Latin America increased by 51% on strong price realization, higher sales of equipment to end users and a favorable impact due to changes in dealer inventories. In both EAME and Asia Pacific, sales were relatively flat as strong price realization was offset by currency.\nThird quarter profit for Construction Industries increased by 40% to $1.2 billion versus the prior year. Price realization and higher sales volume drove the increase as price more than offset manufacturing costs.\nUnfavorable manufacturing costs largely reflected higher material and freight costs, in addition to manufacturing inefficiencies. The segment's operating margin of 19.3% was an increase of 280 basis points versus last year.\nTurning to Slide 12. Resource Industries sales grew by 30% in the third quarter to $3.1 billion. The improvement was primarily due to favorable price realization and higher sales volume. Volume increased due to the impact of changes in dealer inventories, higher sales of aftermarket parts and higher sales of equipment to end users.\nThird quarter profit for Resource Industries increased by 81% to $506 million as price realization more than offset manufacturing costs, which largely reflected higher material, freight and manufacturing inefficiencies.\nThe segment's operating margin of 16.4% was an increase of 460 basis points versus last year.\nNow on Slide 13. Energy & Transportation sales increased by 22% to $6.2 billion, with sales up across all applications. Oil and gas sales increased by 22% due to higher sales of reciprocating engine aftermarket parts and engines used in well-servicing applications and gas compression.\nPower generation sales increased by 31%, a sales increase for both turbines and reciprocating engines as data center activity remains strong. Industrial sales rose by 22%, with strength across all regions.\nFinally, transportation sales increased by 9% on reciprocating engine aftermarket parts and relative strength in marine applications. International locomotive deliveries also benefited sales.\nThird quarter profit for Energy & Transportation increased by 32% to $935 million. The improvement was primarily due to federal price realization and higher sales volume, partially offset by higher manufacturing and SG&A and R&D costs.\nAs anticipated, price realization narrowly offset manufacturing costs. Manufacturing cost increases largely reflected higher material and freight costs, coupled with manufacturing inefficiencies.\nAlso, SG&A and R&D expenses increased due to investments aligned with our strategic initiatives, including electrification and services growth, in addition to higher short-term incentive compensation expense. The segment's operating margin of 15.1% was an increase of 120 basis points versus last year.\nMoving on to Slide 14. Financial Products revenue increased by 7% to $819 million, benefiting from higher average financing rates in North America and Latin America. Segment profit increased by 27% to $220 million. The profit increase was mainly due to a favorable impact from a lower provision for credit losses at Cat Financial.\nMoving to our credit portfolio. Our leading indicators remain strong. Past dues, a good proxy for the financial health of our customers, were 2.00% compared with 2.41% at the end of the third quarter of 2021. We also saw a 19 basis points decrease in past dues compared to the second quarter of this year.\nRetail new business volumes did decline compared to the record levels in the prior year. However, at this point, Cat Financial is not seeing slowing business activity but is instead impacted by strengthening competition from banks. This is typical in a realizing interest rate environment as banks benefit from a lower cost of funds, especially due to [customer] deposits.\nFinally, used equipment demand remains strong as elevated prices have stabilized and inventories remain low.\nNow on Slide 15. ME&T free cash flow in the quarter increased by about $1.2 billion versus the prior year to $2.1 billion. The increase was primarily due to higher profit and favorable net working capital. We did continue to build production inventory to support shipments and mitigate component delivery delays, an increase of about $1 billion versus the second quarter.\nCumulatively, ME&T free cash flow year-to-date is $2.8 billion, despite the increase in inventories and the payment of incentive compensation in the first quarter of 2022.\nLooking ahead, we continue to expect to achieve our Investor Day in ME&T free cash flow target of between $4 billion and $8 billion for the full year. As Jim mentioned, we paid around $600 million in dividends in addition to repurchasing about $1.4 billion worth of common stock, supporting our objective to be in the market on a more consistent basis.\nEnterprise cash was $6.3 billion, about a $300 million increase compared to the second quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily driven by higher free cash flow.\nOur liquidity remains strong as we continue to hold some of our cash balances and slightly longer-dated liquid marketable securities in order to improve the liquidity -- to improve the yield on that cash.\nNow on Slide 16, I will share some thoughts on the fourth quarter and the full year. As a reminder, the third quarter was generally in line with our expectations on the top line. And while margins were better than the prior year, they were marginally lower than we had anticipated.\nPricing gained momentum against a backdrop of stronger demand, while manufacturing costs increased on continuous inflationary cost headwinds for our suppliers and manufacturing inefficiencies due to the ongoing disruption to the supply chain. We also continue to invest for future profitable growth.\nLooking ahead, we anticipate the fourth quarter will reflect our highest quarterly sales for the year, which is in line with typical seasonality. Compared to the prior year, higher sales to users and price realization should support the top line growth.\nAt year-end, we expect dealer inventories to remain at similar levels as they ended in the third quarter. We also expect sales increases across the 3 primary segments, both year-over-year and sequentially.\nInfrastructure spending should continue to benefit our segments over time as nonresidential building accelerates and large projects commence. On margins, we should see slightly higher adjusted operating margins in the fourth quarter compared to the third on higher volume and continued pricing momentum.\nWe do anticipate the manufacturing cost increases, including manufacturing inefficiencies, will act as a partial offset. At the segment level, we expect to see similar margins to the strong third quarter performance in Construction Industries.\nIn Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation, margin should strengthen compared to the third quarter and prior year. Compared to last year, all 3 primary mid segments should benefit from price realization and higher volumes. We expect price realization to more than offset manufacturing costs across our 3 primary segments in the fourth quarter.\nFinally, to assist you with your modeling, we continue to expect our accrual for short-term incentive compensation expense of about $1.6 billion this year. CapEx is expected to be about $1.4 billion. We anticipate a global effective tax rate of around 23%, slightly lower than previously expected due to changes in the geographic mix of profits from a tax perspective.\nFinally, restructuring charges are expected to be up to $800 million for the full year. There's a possibility that the largest item, which is a noncash charge of approximately $600 million relating to a divestiture, may slip into 2023.\nSo turning to Slide 17, let me summarize. Sales grew by 21%, led by strong price realization and volume gains across all the segments. The adjusted operating profit margin increased by about 280 basis points to 16.5%.\nME&T free cash flow was strong at $2.1 billion, and we continue to return cash to shareholders on a consistent basis. The outlook remains positive, with sales to users up 7% and the backlog up $1.6 billion to $30 billion. We continue to execute our strategy for long-term profitable growth.\nAnd with that, we'll take your questions.",

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ryan Fiedler. Thank you. Please go ahead.\n\nRyan Fiedler\n\nThank you, Emma. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Caterpillar's Second Quarter of 2022 Earnings Call. I'm Ryan Fiedler, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me today are Jim Umpleby, Chairman and CEO; Andrew Bonfield, Chief Financial Officer; Kyle Epley, Senior Vice President of the Global Finance Services Division; and Rob Rengel, Senior IR Manager.\nDuring our call today, we'll be discussing the second quarter earnings release we issued earlier today. You can find our slides, the news release and a webcast recap at investors.caterpillar.com under Events and Presentations.\nThe content of this call is protected by U.S. and international copyright law. Any rebroadcast, retransmission, reproduction or distribution of all or part of this content without Caterpillar's prior written permission is prohibited.\nMoving to Slide 2. During our call today, we'll make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. We'll also make assumptions that could cause our actual results to be different than the information we're sharing with on this call. Please refer to our recent SEC filings and the forward-looking statements reminder in the news release for details on factors that individually or in aggregate could cause our actual results to vary materially from our forecast.\nOn today's call, we'll also refer to non-GAAP numbers. For a reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers to the appropriate U.S. GAAP numbers, please see the appendix of the earnings call slides.\nToday, we reported profit per share of $3.13 for the second quarter of 2022 compared with $2.56 of profit per share in the second quarter of 2021. We're including adjusted profit per share in addition to our U.S. GAAP results. Our adjusted profit per share was $3.18 for the second quarter of 2022 compared with adjusted profit per share of $2.60 for the second quarter of 2021. Adjusted profit per share for both quarters exclude restructuring costs.\nNow let's turn to Slide 3 and turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Jim Umpleby.\n\nD. James Umpleby\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Caterpillar Inc.\n\nThanks, Ryan. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. As we close out the first half of 2022, I want to thank our global team for delivering another good quarter with double-digit top line and adjusted profit per share growth despite ongoing supply chain challenges. Our second quarter results reflect healthy demand across most of our end markets. We remain focused on executing our strategy for long-term profitable growth.\nIn today's call, I'll begin with my perspectives on our performance in the quarter and then I'll provide some insights on our end markets. Lastly, I'll provide an update on our sustainability journey.\nFor the quarter, sales were broadly in line with our expectations as we generated better-than-expected price and strong services revenue, which were offset by lower-than-expected sales to users. Similar to previous quarters, our top line would have been even stronger, if not for supply chain constraints. We remain focused on executing creative solutions to help mitigate our supply chain challenges.\nOverall, we remain encouraged by the strong demand in our end markets for our products and services. We're seeing strong momentum in services due to our service initiatives and investments. As I mentioned at our Investor Day in May, our confidence is increasing that we'll achieve our goal to double services to $28 billion by 2026.\nOperating profit margins came in slightly lower than our expectations, mostly due to lower-than-expected volume and unfavorable mix. Price realization more than offset manufacturing cost increases, which occurred earlier in the year than we had anticipated. However, this is the only -- this only partially offsets the impact of volume and mix. Dealer inventory remains at the low end of the typical range and rental fleets continue to age as dealers prioritize trying to meet the demand from retail customers.\nOrders remained solid and our backlog grew by approximately $2 billion in the quarter. We expect a volume and price realization to improve in the second half of the year, which should lead to sales growth in the remaining quarters of the year, both sequentially and year-over-year. We also expect adjusted operating profit margins will improve both sequentially and year-over-year in the second half of 2022 as our price realization will more than offset manufacturing cost increases.\nDespite ongoing inflation and supply chain challenges, we continue to expect to achieve our Investor Day adjusted operating profit margin and ME&T free cash flow targets for the full year.\nMoving to Slide 4. Sales and revenues increased by 11%, broadly in line with our expectations. The increase was primarily driven by strengthening price realization and higher sales volume. Second quarter sales and revenues increased across our three primary segments versus the prior year, with sales higher in all regions, except EAME. Sales in North America rose by 18%, with double-digit growth in the three primary segments. Strength in Latin America continued as 27% sales growth was supported by strong construction activity.\nIn EAME, sales decreased by 3%, primarily due to currency impacts. Asia Pacific sales increased by 3% as lower sales in China were more than offset by stronger sales elsewhere within the region.\nCompared to the second quarter of 2021, sales to users declined 3%. For machines, including Construction Industries and Resource Industries, sales to users decreased by 4%, while Energy & Transportation was flat overall. Sales to users were below our expectations largely due to the impact of supply chain constraints. These constraints were mostly due to component shortages, which resulted in production delays and shortfalls against our schedules. For example, engine control modules have continued to be one of the most significant bottlenecks mostly due to the shortage of semiconductors. We were unable to completely satisfy strong customer demand for our machines and engines and continue to incur additional costs due to factory inefficiencies and freight expenses.\nSales to users in Construction Industries decreased 4%, primarily due to weakness in China and continued supply chain constraints. North America sales to users declined slightly, mainly due to supply chain challenges. Latin America saw higher sales to end users, while EAME declined slightly. Asia Pacific sales to users were down in the quarter. However, excluding China, the Asia Pacific region, sales to users increased. The same holds true for Construction Industries overall.\nIn Resource Industries, sales to users decreased 2% due to supply chain challenges and one-off disruptions, including commissioning delays. Orders remained strong, although slightly lower than recent high levels. We continue to see high equipment utilization and parked trucks remain at low levels, both supporting continued demand for our equipment and services.\nIn Energy & Transportation, sales to users were flat versus the prior year. Oil and gas sales to users were down in the second quarter due to lower turbine and turbine-related services, which were partially offset by continued improvement in reciprocating engines. As we mentioned during our last earnings call, we expected solar turbines new equipment shipments to be lower in the first half. Power generation and industrial sales to users remained strong due to favorable market conditions. Transportation decreased slightly.\nNow I'll spend a moment on dealer inventory. Dealer inventory declined by about $400 million in the second quarter, reflecting typical seasonality similar to the second quarter of last year. Dealer inventories remain near the low end of the typical range and we continue to work closely with our global dealer network to satisfy customer demand. As a reminder, dealers are independently owned businesses.\nOperating profit increased 9% in the quarter to $1.9 billion. The increase was driven by higher sales across our three primary segments, which largely reflected favorable price realization and volume and was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs and SG&A and R&D expenses. High manufacturing costs in the quarter reflected increased material and freight costs. As I mentioned, favorable price realization more than offset manufacturing cost increases.\nOperating profit margins were 13.6% in the second quarter of 2022 compared to 13.9% in the second quarter of last year. Although our adjusted operating profit margins improved sequentially in the quarter, they were slightly lower than our expectations, mostly due to lower-than-expected volumes and unfavorable mix. Andrew will discuss the consolidated and segment-level margins in a few minutes.\nOur profit per share was $3.13 versus $2.56 in the second quarter of 2021. The adjusted profit per share was $3.18 versus $2.60 in the second quarter of last year.\nNow to Slide 5. We generated $1.1 billion of ME&T free cash flow in the quarter. We continue to expect to be within our $4 billion to $8 billion ME&T free cash flow range for the full year 2022. Andrew will discuss this in more detail.\nRegarding capital deployment. In the quarter, we repurchased $1.1 billion of stock and returned $600 million in dividends to shareholders. In May, our Board approved a new authorization to repurchase an additional $15 billion of common stock, which was effective on August 1. We also announced we're increasing our quarterly cash dividend by 8% to $1.20 per share. We remain proud of our dividend aristocrat status. We continue to expect to return substantially all of our ME&T free cash flow to shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases.\nNow on Slide 6, I'll share some high-level assumptions on our expectations for the full year. Overall demand remained healthy across our segments. However, the environment remains challenging, primarily due to continuing supply chain disruptions. Our teams are working hard to mitigate the supply chain challenges, and we expect to achieve our Investor Day targets for adjusted operating profit margins and ME&T free cash flow.\nWe expect continued top line growth for the second half of the year, reflecting healthy demand, favorable price realization and our team's persistent efforts to mitigate supply chain disruptions.\nAs I mentioned, our total backlog increased by about $2 billion in the quarter, led by Energy & Transportation. The backlog for Resource Industries and Construction Industries remain elevated. Although we continue to anticipate inflationary pressures in manufacturing costs, we expect price will more than offset these cost increases for the full year.\nNow I'll turn to our expectations for key end markets this year. In Construction Industries in North America, we expect nonresidential construction to continue to be strong due to construction backlogs. We also expect the ramping of projects from the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to occur in late 2022 and into 2023. Residential construction is moderating from the very strong levels experienced since early 2021.\nIn China, the above 10 tonne excavator market was very strong during the first half of 2021. During our last earnings call, we indicated that the industry would be slightly lower than 2019 levels. We now anticipate the industry will be lower than we previously expected. The rest of the Asia Pacific region is expected to grow due to higher infrastructure spending and commodity prices.\nIn EAME, the EU has proposed an infrastructure investment package. However, business activity has moderated. Strong growth continues for construction activity in Latin America due to supportive commodity prices. Overall, we expect healthy demand for the remainder of the year in Construction Industries.\nIn Resource Industries, while our mining customers continue to display capital discipline, commodity prices remain supportive of investment despite recent moderation. We expect production and utilization levels will remain elevated and our autonomous solutions continued to gain momentum. We expect the continuation of high equipment utilization and a low level of park trucks, which both support future demand for our equipment and services.\nWe continue to believe the energy transition will support increased commodity demand over the medium and long term, expanding our addressable market and providing opportunities for profitable growth.\nIn heavy construction and quarry and aggregates, we expect continued growth in 2022.\nIn Energy & Transportation, we expect improving momentum in 2022 with strong order rates in most applications. In oil and gas, although customers remain disciplined, we remain encouraged by continued strength in reciprocating engine orders, especially for large engine replacements as asset utilization increases.\nIn 2022, while solar services are expected to remain steady, new equipment orders strengthened significantly in the first half particularly in oil and gas, indicating sales growth in late 2022 and into 2023. Power generation orders remain healthy due to positive economic growth and continued data center strength. Industrial remains healthy with continued momentum in construction, agriculture and electric power. In rail, North American locomotive sales are expected to remain muted. We also anticipate growth in high-speed Marine as customers upgrade aging fleets.\nMoving to Slide 7. Since our last quarterly earnings call, we published our 2021 sustainability report in May to highlight progress on our sustainability journey. In the report, we reiterated our commitment to further enhance our sustainability reporting and disclosures by utilizing the task force on climate-related financial disclosures, or TCFD, framework and also committed to begin reporting estimated Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions in 2023.\nAs we continue to advance our sustainability journey through the second quarter of 2022, Caterpillar and our customers announced a number of projects that will help contribute to a lower carbon future. In May, we announced a low carbon intensity fuel project with District Energy St. Paul to demonstrate a combined heat and power, or CHP system, fueled by various combinations of hydrogen and natural gas. CHP systems from Caterpillar provide both electricity and heat simultaneously, increasing overall efficiency and reducing exhaust emissions. With support and partial funding from the U.S. Department of Energy, the demonstration project will compare how hydrogen and hydrogen blends can be integrated into a waste heat and power solution.\nThis quarter, we also announced the acquisition of Tangent Energy Solutions, a U.S.-based energy as a service company. Tangent's suite of intelligent energy solutions will allow us to provide value to customers by helping them reduce energy costs, increase energy efficiency, reduce emissions, monetize electric good support and provide resiliency for their operations.\nIn summary, we continue to support our customers' climate-related objectives with new equipment and services that facilitate fuel transition increase operational efficiency and reduce emissions. We remain committed to contributing to a reduced carbon future as we help our customers build a better, more sustainable world.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew R. J. Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by walking you through our second quarter results, including the performance of our segments. Then I'll comment on the balance sheet and free cash flow before concluding with our expectations for the third quarter and remainder of the year.\nBeginning on Slide 8. Sales and revenues for the second quarter increased by 11% or $1.4 billion to $14.2 billion. The increase was due to price and volume, partially offset by currency. Operating profit increased by 9% or $155 million to $1.9 billion as price realization and volume growth were partially offset by higher manufacturing and SG&A and R&D costs. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 13.8% was slightly below the year-ago level despite the underlying inflationary and supply chain pressures.\nAdjusted profit per share was $3.18 in the second quarter compared to $2.60 last year. Adjusted profit per share for both quarters excluded restructuring costs, which had a similar impact in both quarters. Taxes included discrete tax impacts, which benefited the quarter by about $0.10.\nNow on Slide 9. As Jim mentioned, the top line was generally in line with our expectations on strong price and service revenues with a bit of currency as a headwind as the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen. Machine sales to users were impacted by supply chain challenges was slightly worse than we had anticipated. Overall, we are not seeing signs of slowing demand as order levels and backlog remain healthy.\nOur retail statistics or sales to users, are normally strongly correlated to demand in a typical environment. However, the ongoing supply chain constraints continue to impact our ability to ship equipment. Dealer inventory changes had a minimal impact on the top line as a $400 million decrease versus the first quarter was similar to the reduction seen in the prior year. Services remain strong as we benefit from the impact of our services growth initiatives.\nMoving to Slide 10. As I mentioned, second quarter operating profit increased by 9% on favorable price and volume. Price realization was better than we had anticipated due to the strong demand for machines. Manufacturing costs were also slightly higher than expected, primarily due to continued material and freight cost pressures as well as the impact of supply chain on our factory performance. Overall, price exceeded manufacturing costs for the quarter, which reverses the trend we had seen for most of the past year.\nSG&A and R&D costs increased partly due to investments aligned with our strategy for profitable growth, in addition to higher short-term incentive compensation. Our second quarter adjusted operating profit margin of 13.8%, a 30 basis point decrease versus the prior year. This was slightly lower than we had anticipated in April, principally as equipment volume lagged our expectations. We also saw some negative mix within our segments. The net impact of higher price and increased manufacturing costs was about neutral.\nBefore I discuss segment results, I want to address the impact of high inflation and inventory build had on our segment margins in the quarter. For background, in periods with rapidly rising input costs and inventory growth, a portion of these rising costs will be appropriately included in Caterpillar's ending inventory.\nIn order to promote effective management decision-making within our segment results, we recognize material and freight cost changes as soon as they impact our input costs. For enterprise reporting, this negative impact on segment results is offset by a favorable impact at the corporate level.\nIn a nutshell, inflationary cost pressures were elevated negatively impacting margins at the segment level, while enterprise margins performed much closer to our expectations. This dynamic is timing related, meaning we'll see things balance out as the inventory starts to decline and inflationary costs subside.\nMoving to Slide 11. Let's review segment performance, starting with Construction Industries. Sales increased by 7% in the second quarter to $6 billion, driven by favorable price realization. Volume decreased slightly as lower sales of equipment to end users was mostly offset by higher sales off-to-market parts.\nNorth America had the highest growth in sales dollars, a 20% increase due to strong pricing, a favorable change in dealer inventory and continued strength in services. Sales of equipment to end users lagged the prior year slightly, driven by supply chain challenges. Residential and nonresidential demand remained healthy, although we saw some moderation in residential.\nSales in Latin America increased by 48% as robust construction activity supported higher sales of equipment to end users. In EAME, sales decreased by 7%, primarily driven by the changes in inventories and currency while price was a partial offset. Asia Pacific sales decreased by 17% due in part to lower sales of equipment to end users, primarily in China, which had a strong quarter a year ago.\nSecond quarter profit for Construction Industries decreased by 4% versus the prior year to $989 million. Price realization more than offset manufacturing costs. The profit decreased due to the impact of lower sales volume and mix. Unfavorable manufacturing costs largely reflected higher material and freight. The segment's operating margin decreased by 180 basis points versus last year to 16.4% as inflationary cost pressures impacted the segment margins, as I mentioned a moment ago.\nTurning to Slide 12. Resource Industries sales increased by 16% in the second quarter to $3 billion. The improvement was primarily due to favorable price realization and higher sales volume. Volume increase on sales of aftermarket parts. Second quarter profit for Resource Industries increased by 2% to $355 million as price and volume more than offset unfavorable manufacturing costs, which largely reflected higher material and freight costs. The segment's operating profit margin decreased by 170 basis points versus last year to 12% as inflationary cost pressures impacted the segment margins similar to Construction Industries.\nNow on Slide 13. Energy & Transportation sales increased by 15% to approximately $5.7 billion with sales up across all applications. This included an 8% sales increase in oil and gas as sales of aftermarket parts, reciprocating engines and engines used for well servicing and gas compression increased. Solar turbine sales and oil and gas applications lagged the prior year. Power generation sales increased by 13% on stronger sales volume in small reciprocating engines and aftermarket parts. Sales of solar turbines increased in power generation. Industrial sales rose by 24% with strength across all regions. Finally, transportation sales increased by 7% on reciprocating engine aftermarket part sales and strength in rail services.\nSecond quarter profit for Energy & Transportation decreased by 11% to $659 million. Higher manufacturing costs reflected continued headwinds from inflationary cost pressures in freight and material, which were partially offset by favorable price realization and higher sales volume. As a reminder, Energy & Transportation took price increases later in the year in 2021, given the different market dynamics as compared to the other primary segments.\nIn addition, SG&A and R&D expenses increased due to investments aligned with our strategic initiatives, including electrification and services growth, coupled with higher short-term incentive compensation. The segment's operating margin decreased by 320 basis points versus last year to 11.6%, impacted by the same inflationary cost pressures as our other primary segments.\nMoving to Slide 14. Financial Products revenue increased by 3% to $798 million. Segment profit decreased by 11% to $217 million. The profit decrease was mainly due to an unfavorable impact from movements in equity securities and insurance services. Our higher provision for credit losses at Care Financial primarily relating to reserves associated with Russia and Ukraine also weighed on profit. A favorable impact from return to repossessed equipment served as a partial offset.\nMoving to our credit portfolio. Customers and dealers continue to perform well as our leading indicators remain strong. Past dues, which are a good proxy for the financial health of our customers were 2.19% compared to 2.58% at the end of the second quarter of 2021. That's down 39 basis points year-over-year. As is typical, retail new business volume improved sequentially versus the first quarter. And while we did see a 12% decrease versus the prior year, nearly half of that decline was attributable to China, where we saw COVID restrictions reinstated.\nIn addition, although our match funding strategy serves to mitigate our risks from interest rate changes, rising rates typically do benefit banks from a competitive financing perspective. We saw this play out in the second quarter as our share of machines financed declined slightly. We continue to benefit from robust demand for used machines from both a volume and price perspective. This reflects the underlying demand trends we are seeing for equipment.\nNow on Slide 15. We generated about $1.1 billion in ME&T free cash flow during the quarter, a decrease of about $600 million versus the second quarter 2021. We continue to build production inventory to help manage through supply chain challenges. Looking ahead, we expect stronger free cash flow in the second half due to the absence of the payment of incentive compensation. We also do not anticipate our working capital rise as it did in the first half of the year. Therefore, we continue to expect to achieve our Investor Day ME&T free cash flow target of between $4 billion and $8 billion for the full year.\nAs Jim mentioned, we paid around $600 million in dividends, in addition to repurchasing about $1.1 billion worth of common stock, supporting our objective to be in the market on a more consistent basis. Enterprise cash was $6 billion, a $500 million decrease compared to the first quarter of 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by the $1.7 billion in shareholder return, net of ME&T free cash flow generation.\nWe also continue to hold some of our cash balances and slightly longer-dated liquid marketable securities, in order to improve the yield on net cash. Our liquidity remains strong.\nNow on Slide 16. In light of the current environment, including supply chain constraints, we continue to refrain from providing annual profit per share guidance. However, I will share some thoughts on our third quarter and full year.\nAs a reminder, the second quarter played out about as we had anticipated on the top line, although the inputs varied somewhat. Pricing was better than expected, while sales of equipment to end users lagged our expectations due to supply chain challenges and additional weakness in China.\nLooking to the third quarter, we currently anticipate the top line will increase compared to the prior year on higher sales to users and favorable price realization. Strong demand should support higher sales across the three primary segments, subject to our ability to navigate through the ongoing supply chain changes.\nFor the second half of the year, we expect revenues to be higher compared to the first half. To reiterate Jim's comment, we remain encouraged by the strong demand in our end markets for our equipment and services.\nOrder levels and backlogs remain strong. Dealer inventory levels remain at the low end of the typical range and rental fleets are aging. Finally, infrastructure investment later in the year should be supportive.\nOn margins in the third quarter, we anticipate gains across our three primary segments as compared to the prior year and first half. Construction Industries and Resource Industries margins should improve as price realization continues to flow through and more than offset manufacturing cost inflation. In Energy & Transportation, we expect pricing to continue to gain momentum and offset manufacturing costs.\nFor the second half of the year, both the enterprise and segment levels, we anticipate adjusted operating profit margin improvement compared to both the first half and the comparable periods of 2021. The impact of price actions should accelerate and though we anticipate continued increases in manufacturing costs, we are starting to let the significant increases, particularly in freight and material costs, that we saw in the second half of the last year. Finally, to assist you with your modeling, we currently expect our accrual for short-term incentive compensation to be around $1.6 billion this year. We continue to anticipate a global effective tax rate of around 24% and restructuring spend of approximately $600 million for the full year.\nTurning to Slide 17. In summary, we performed well in the quarter where demand generally remains strong, but our ability to satisfy that demand was constrained by supply chain challenges. Despite this backdrop, we realized $1.4 billion more in sales and revenue, supported by strong price realization and services. Looking ahead, comparisons should ease in the second half of the year, and despite the challenging environment, we continue to expect to achieve our Investor Day targets for adjusted operating profit margin and ME&T free cash flow for the full year.\nAnd with that, we'll now take your questions.",

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ryan Fiedler. Thank you. Please go ahead.\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nThank you, Emma. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Caterpillar's First Quarter of 2022 Earnings Call. I'm Ryan Fiedler, Director of Investor Relations. Joining me today are Jim Umpleby, Chairman and CEO; Andrew Bonfield, Chief Financial Officer; Kyle Epley, Vice President of the Global Finance Services Division; and Rob Rengel, Senior IR Manager. .\nDuring our call today, we'll be discussing the first quarter earnings release we issued earlier today. You can find our slides, the news release and a video recap at investors.caterpillar.com under Events and Presentations.\nI would also like to remind everyone that we are hosting Caterpillar's Investor Day on May 17 from 10:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central Time at the Hilton DFW Lakes Executive Conference Center in Grapevine, Texas. Our theme is services, technology and sustainability, helping our customers build a better world. Please check out the details on our investor website. Caterpillar has copyrighted this call, and we prohibit use of any portion of it without our prior written approval.\nMoving to Slide 2. During our call today, we'll make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. We'll also make assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially on the information we're sharing with you on this call. Please refer to our recent SEC filings, and the forward-looking statements reminder in the news release for details on factors that individually or in aggregate could cause our actual results to vary materially from our forecast.\nOn today's call, we'll also refer to non-GAAP numbers. For a reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers to the appropriate U.S. GAAP numbers, please see the appendix of the earnings call slides.\nToday, we reported profit per share of $2.86 for the first quarter of 2022 compared with $2.77 of profit per share in the first quarter of 2021. We're including adjusted profit per share in addition to our U.S. GAAP results. Our adjusted profit per share was $2.88 for the first quarter of 2022 compared with adjusted profit per share of $2.87 for the first quarter of 2021. Adjusted profit per share for both quarters excluded restructuring costs. Now let's flip to Slide 3 and turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Jim Umpleby.\n\nD. James Umpleby\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Caterpillar Inc.\n\nThanks, Ryan. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'd like to start by thanking our global team for their contributions to another good quarter. We continue to execute our strategy for long-term profitable growth as demonstrated by our first quarter results. I'll begin with my perspectives on our performance in the quarter, and then I'll provide some insight on our end markets.\nBefore discussing our results, I'd like to take a moment to say we remain deeply saddened by the tragic events continuing to occur in Ukraine and hope for a peaceful resolution. Through the Caterpillar Foundation, we have donated more than $1 million to support both urgent and long-term needs of the Ukraine humanitarian crisis. I'm proud of our employees for their generous contributions through the Foundation Matching Gifts program, which added nearly an additional $1 million of support for Ukrainian refugees. On the operations front, we suspended production in our Russian manufacturing facilities and will continue to comply with all applicable laws and evolving sanctions.\nMoving on to our quarterly results. Sales rose in all 3 of our primary segments due to volume gains and favorable price. Sales and margins were both slightly better than we expected. And similar to the second half of 2021, our top line would have been even stronger without the continuing supply chain constraints.\nOverall, we remain encouraged by the strong demand for our products and services. The first quarter of 2022 marked the fifth consecutive quarter of higher end-user demand compared to the prior year. Services remained strong in the quarter. We continue to make progress on our service initiatives, including customer value agreements, e-commerce, connected assets and prioritized service events.\nMoving to Slide 4. Sales and revenues increased by 14%, slightly better than we expected. The increase was primarily driven by higher end-user demand and the impact of changes in dealer inventories as well as strengthening price realization. The impact of our price actions started to accelerate in the second half of 2021.\nWe generated double-digit sales growth in all primary segments, and sales rose in North America, Latin America and EAME. Asia Pacific was down by 4%. Compared with the first quarter of 2021, sales to users rose 2%, which was about as we expected. For machines, including Construction Industries and Resource Industries, sales to users increased by 3%, while Energy & Transportation decreased 1%. Sales to users in Construction Industries were about flat overall with good growth globally in the first quarter, except for China. North America grew by double digits as residential construction remained strong and nonresidential contributed -- showed signs of improvement. Latin America saw higher end user demand supported by construction and strong commodity prices. End-user demand increased in the EAME due to residential growth and support of commodity prices.\nI'll briefly discuss China. In the first quarter of 2021, China's greater than 10-ton excavator industry was at an all-time high, which resulted in a difficult comparable in the quarter. In the first quarter of 2022, China was lower than we expected due to weaker residential construction and COVID-19-related shutdowns. Overall, sales in China were about half of what we saw in the prior year's quarter. Keep in mind, China sales are typically 5% to 10% of our enterprise sales. Outside of China, Asia Pacific sales to users grew as we continue to see strong demand in the region.\nIn Resource Industries, the overall environment remained positive with sales to users up 13%, an improvement from the fourth quarter. Mining increased at a measured pace, which is in line with the expectations that we've been communicating to you for the last couple of years. Strong commodity prices supported a high utilization and a low number of parked trucks. In heavy construction and quarry and aggregates, sales to users increased versus the prior year for the fourth straight quarter as end-user demand continues to improve.\nIn Energy & Transportation, sales to users declined 1% versus the prior year. Solar turbines declined as expected due to the timing of projects. Excluding solar, sales to users were strong. Oil and gas sales to users were down in the first quarter with improvement in reciprocating engines more than offset by solar. Despite continued data center and rental demand strength, power generation sales to users were down overall due to timing of some larger projects. Industrial end-user demand strengthened across all regions. Lastly, transportation benefited from growth off a low base, primarily in marine applications.\nNow I'll spend a moment on dealer inventory. Dealers who are independent businesses increased their inventories by about $1.3 billion in the first quarter. This compares to a $700 million increase in the first quarter of last year. While dealer inventories remain near the low end of the typical range, we continue to work closely with dealers to satisfy higher end-user demand. Andrew will provide additional color about dealer inventory later in the call.\nRegarding ongoing supply constraints, we experienced similar challenges to what we highlighted in the fourth quarter, which was in line with our expectations. We continue to experience constraints with semiconductors and certain other components.\nOur team continues to implement solutions to help mitigate the overall situation. For example, we executed engineering redesigns to provide customers with alternative options. We also increased dual sourcing of components and placed specialized Caterpillar resources at suppliers to help ease constraints.\nI remain proud of our global team's ability to deliver double-digit sales growth despite supply chain challenges. Similar to previous quarters, absent the supply chain constraints, our top line would have been even stronger. When the supply chain conditions ease, we expect to be well positioned to fully meet demand and gain operating leverage from higher volumes.\nOperating profit increased 2% in the quarter to $1.9 billion driven by strong volume and favorable price realization across all segments, which was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs and SG&A and R&D expenses. The higher manufacturing costs primarily reflected increased material and freight costs in the quarter. While we did see some labor inefficiencies, these were not as significant as they were in the fourth quarter.\nOperating profit margins were 13.7% in the first quarter, which was lower than the first quarter of 2021. We expect that comparisons would be difficult as inflationary impacts to manufacturing costs accelerated in the back half of 2021 and remain at a similar level in the first quarter of 2022. On a sequential basis, our margins improved versus the fourth quarter as we expected. Our profit per share was $2.86 versus $2.77 in the first quarter of 2021. The adjusted profit per share was $2.88 versus $2.87 in the first quarter of last year.\nOn Slide 5, we had an ME&T free cash outflow of about $400 million in the quarter, which Andrew will discuss in a few moments. To remind you, our Investor Day target is to deliver ME&T free cash flow of between $4 billion and $8 billion per year. We expect to be within that range for the full year 2022. Regarding capital deployment, we completed $800 million of share repurchases and returned $600 million in dividends to shareholders. We remain proud of our dividend aristocrat status. We continue to expect to return substantially all of our ME&T free cash flow to shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases.\nNow I'll share some high-level assumptions on our expectations for the full year. We expect to achieve our Investor Day targets for adjusted operating profit margins and, as I've just mentioned, deliver ME&T free cash flow within our targeted range in 2022. As I previously indicated, we continue to be encouraged by strong order demand across our segments. In the first quarter of 2022, our total backlog increased by $3.4 billion as we experienced continued strong demand and supply chain challenges. Backlog increased in all segments with the largest increase in Energy & Transportation. The environment continues to be challenging due to supply chain constraints and the more recent COVID-19-related shutdowns in China. Although manufacturing costs are expected to remain elevated, we expect price to more than offset these cost increases for the full year.\nTurning to Slide 6. I'll discuss our expectations for key end markets this year. In Construction Industries in North America, residential construction remained strong with nonresidential continuing to improve. Despite rising interest rates, infrastructure investment is expected to improve in late 2022 and beyond supported by the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.\nThe 10-ton and above excavator market in China was very strong in 2020 and 2021. We now anticipate this market will be slightly lower than 2019 levels. The rest of Asia Pacific region is expected to grow due to higher infrastructure spending.\nIn the EAME, despite the broader geopolitical concerns, we remain cautiously optimistic due to housing growth in the EU investment package that is expected to drive construction demand. Construction and mining activity in Latin America are supportive of growth. It could be impacted by inflation and interest rate policy decisions.\nIn Resource Industries, we believe commodity prices will continue to drive higher production and utilization levels, which support more investments in equipment and services in 2022 and beyond. Within heavy construction and quarry and aggregates, we also anticipate continued growth in 2022. Lastly, we are seeing increased quoting for our autonomous solutions, which includes large mining trucks, drills, track-type tractors, water trucks and underground machines.\nIn Energy & Transportation, we expect improving momentum in 2022 with strong order rates in most applications. In oil and gas, although customers remain disciplined, we are encouraged by continued strength in reciprocated engine orders, especially for large engine replacements as asset utilization increases. Power generation orders remain healthy due to positive economic growth and continued data center strength. In 2022, while solar services are expected to remain steady, we continue to expect new equipment shipments to be lower than last year due to the lead time of solar products. Solar's new equipment orders strengthened significantly in the first quarter, and shipments are expected to improve in late 2022 or early 2023.\nIndustrial remains healthy with continued momentum in construction, agriculture and electric power. In rail, North American locomotive sales are expected to remain muted, but international locomotives are more promising. We also anticipate growth in high-speed marine as customers upgrade aging fleets.\nNow on to Slide 7. In 2021 and into the first quarter of 2022 Caterpillar and our customers announced a number of projects that will contribute to a reduced carbon future. We recently entered into an agreement with ioneer, a U.S.-based lithium Boron miner. This will be the first greenfield site in the U.S. to use autonomous haul trucks. Lithium is a key component for electric -- for battery electric vehicles and the minerals from this Nevada mine will help contribute to a more sustainable future.\nOur autonomous technology is a competitive advantage as it delivers significant benefits to our customers, including improved safety, productivity and efficiency while lowering greenhouse gas emissions per tonne of material moved. Our commitment to [sustainable innovation] remains strong as we continue to execute our strategy for long-term profitable growth. I look forward to hosting you at our Investor Day on May 17, where we will be talking more services, technology and sustainability. With that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew R. J. Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a recap of our first quarter results, including the performance of our segments. Then I'll comment on the balance sheet and free cash flow before concluding with a few comments on our expectations as we move into the second quarter of 2022.\nBeginning on Slide 8, sales and revenues for the first quarter increased by 14% or $1.7 billion to $13.6 billion. Volume, including higher dealer inventory build and price, drove the increase in sales and revenues, which, as Jim mentioned, was slightly better than we had expected. Operating profit increased by 2% to $1.9 billion as price realization and volume growth were partially offset by higher manufacturing and period costs.\nOur adjusted operating profit margin of 13.7% was slightly better than we had anticipated primarily due to the stronger-than-expected volumes and favorable price realization. First quarter profit per share was $2.86 compared to $2.77 in the prior year. Adjusted profit per share was $2.88 in the first quarter compared to $2.87 last year. Adjusted profit per share for both quarters excludes restructuring costs.\nOur global tax rate in the quarter was about 24%, slightly lower than we had guided you in January. However, on a comparable basis, the lower tax rate was offset by lower favorable discrete tax benefits compared to the prior year.\nNow on Slide 9. As we anticipated, the top line improved on stronger volume and price realization. End-user demand increased versus the prior year but the growth rate accelerated on a sequential basis due to tougher comparisons, especially in China. Dealer inventory rose by about $1.3 billion. Services revenues remained strong in the quarter. Price realization strengthened, while currency was a bit of a headwind.\nLet me provide some color on dealer inventory. The $1.3 billion increase versus year-end 2021 was nearly double what we had anticipated and about $600 million more than the increase we saw in the same quarter last year. About half of that $600 million increase year-on-year came from Resource Industries due to the timing of shipments from our dealers to their customers, which can be lumpy. These units are backed by firm customer orders but were not recognized in our reported retail sales for the quarter. This is in part due to variations in on-site assembly times. The other half of the deal inventory increase was mainly due to the timing of shipments in Construction Industries late in the quarter.\nWe anticipate that dealers will start to sell down the inventories in the second quarter following their normal seasonable pattern on strong sales to users. Our expectations for the full year haven't changed, and we do not expect to see a significant benefit from dealer restocking in 2022 as end-user demand remains strong.\nFirst quarter sales and revenues increased by double-digit percentages in all regions except Asia Pacific. Sales in North America rose by 23% with continued growth in the 3 primary segments. In EAME, sales increased by 15%, while Latin America sales grew by 26%. A 4% decrease in Asia Pacific sales was primarily due to softening in China. Sales in the remainder of that region were positive.\nMoving to Slide 10. As I mentioned, first quarter operating profit increased by 2% on favorable price and volume. Price realization was slightly better than we had anticipated. Manufacturing costs remain elevated but in line with our expectations primarily due to continued material and freight cost headwinds. SG&A and R&D costs increased partly due to investments in services and technologies such as digital, autonomy and electrification.\nOur first quarter adjusted operating profit margin was 13.7%, a 210 basis point decrease versus the prior year. As we said in our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call, we expected the largest margin headwinds to occur in the first quarter. First quarter margins were lower than the prior year. Favorable price realization did not offset higher manufacturing costs but did improve compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Margins were slightly better than we had anticipated on stronger price and volume partially offset by higher-than-expected short-term incentive compensation. I will discuss our expectations for the second quarter and full year margins in a bit more detail later.\nMoving to Slide 11. Let's review segment performance starting with Construction Industries. Sales increased by 12% in the first quarter to $6.1 billion primarily driven by favorable price realization and strong sales volume. End-user demand improved in 3 of the 4 regions. North America had the highest sales growth in sales dollars, a 28% increase, as nonresidential demand improved and residential construction remains strong. Sales in Latin America increased by 60% as construction activity supported higher demand. EAME sales increased by 18% primarily due to growth in residential construction demand. However, Asia Pacific sales decreased by 21% due to a reduction in sales in China, which had a very strong quarter a year ago.\nThe segment's first quarter profit increased by 1% versus the prior year to $1.1 billion. Price realization and higher sales volume drove the increase more than offsetting increases in manufacturing costs. Price realization was stronger than we had anticipated but lagged manufacturing costs in the quarter. The segment's operating margin decreased by 180 basis points to 17.3%.\nTurning to Slide 12. Resource Industries sales increased by 30% in the first quarter to $2.8 billion. The improvement was mostly due to higher end-user demand, the impact from changes in dealer inventories and favorable price. End-user demand increased in heavy construction and quarrying aggregates as well as mining.\nFirst quarter profit for Resource Industries increased by 16% to $361 million. Higher sales volume and favorable price realization were partially offset by higher manufacturing costs and increases in SG&A and R&D expenses. Manufacturing cost increases were primarily due to freight and material. The segment's operating margin decreased by 150 basis points versus last year to 12.8%.\nNow on Slide 13. Energy & Transportation sales increased by 12% to approximately $5 billion with sales up across all applications. This included a 4% sales increase in oil and gas, including aftermarket parts for reciprocating engines. Power generation sales increased by 5%. Small reciprocating engine sales improved. Solar turbine sales were lower in the quarter for oil and gas and power generation applications, impacted by a higher-than-usual first quarter in 2021. Industrial sales rose by 25%, with strength across all regions. Finally, transportation increased by 9% on reciprocating engine cells for both aftermarket parts and marine applications.\nProfit for Energy & Transportation decreased by 20% to $538 million. Higher sales volume and price realization were more than offset by higher manufacturing costs, reflecting continued headwinds from freighter material. In addition, SG&A and R&D expenses increased. The segment's operating margin decreased by 430 basis points versus last year to 10.7%.\nLet me take a moment to provide a bit more color on Energy & Transportation margins. Seasonally, first quarter margins are typically lower compared to the rest of the year in this segment. However, the first quarter of 2022 proved a bit more challenging due to continued supply chain constraints, including elevated freight and material costs.\nI'll discuss very generally, but note that increased freight costs have impacted this segment more than others. Also, Energy & Transportation took price increases later in the year 2021 given the different marketing dynamics as compared to the other primary segments. However, similar to the other segments, we expect margins to improve through 2022 as the benefit of higher price realization starts to pull through.\nMoving to Slide 14. Financial Products had another good quarter. Revenue increased by 3% to $783 million. Segment profit decreased by 2% to [$238 million]. Whilst profit was down, this represents our second highest first quarter profit in 8 years. The decrease was mainly due to a higher provision for credit losses at Cat Financial related to reserves associated with Russia and Ukraine.\nNote, the Russian-Ukraine generally accounts for about 2% of Caterpillar's enterprise sales and less than 1% of the Cat Financial portfolio. Demand for used equipment remained very strong in the quarter, and that helped mitigate the impact of higher provisions.\nMoving to our credit portfolio. It remains high quality as customers and dealers continue to perform well in the quarter. Past dues were 2.05%, the best first quarter performance we've seen in 15 years. That's down 85 basis points year-over-year and up just 10 basis points compared to the fourth quarter, which had marked a 15-year low. While new business volume typically decreased versus the fourth quarter, this is typical seasonality. New business volume was our second highest first quarter performance in 8 years, second only to the prior year, which benefited from pent-up demand following COVID-related shutdowns.\nRegarding interest rate changes, we are in a good position as our matched funding strategy serves to mitigate that risk. We also maintained healthy spreads on new business.\nNow on Slide 15. We had an ME&T free cash outflow of about $400 million, a decrease of $2.1 billion versus the first quarter of 2021. Let me take a moment to discuss the changes. In a typical year, the first quarter is our weakest from a cash generation perspective, primarily due to the payment of our incentives. We paid approximately $1.3 billion in short-term incentive compensation during the first quarter compared to 0 in the prior year. This accounts for the majority of the difference year-over-year. In addition, we continue to build production inventory in the quarter by about $1 billion, which contributed to a negative net working capital impact of approximately $600 million. Despite these first quarter impacts, we continue to expect to achieve our Investor Day free cash flow target of between $4 billion and $8 billion for the full year.\nMoving to shareholder return. We paid around $600 million in dividends during the first quarter. We also repurchased about $800 million worth of common stock supporting our objective to be in the market on a more consistent basis. Enterprise cash was $6.5 billion, a $2.7 billion decrease compared to the year-end. The $400 million free cash outflow and the $1.4 billion in shareholder returns accounted for the majority of the decrease in our cash position. In addition, we have moved some of our cash balances into slightly longer-dated liquid marketable securities in order to improve the yield on that cash. This amounted to about $800 million in the quarter.\nNow on Slide 16. In light of the current environment, including supply chain constraints, we continue to refrain from providing annual profit per share guidance. However, I do want to share some thoughts on the second quarter and the full year. The first quarter played out slightly better than we had anticipated on the top line, resulting from higher volume and better-than-expected price tailwinds. Supply chain challenges remained steady, which we expect to continue into the second quarter. Despite these challenges, we anticipate the top line will increase compared to the first quarter and continued strong end user demand and favorable price realization.\nLooking to the remainder of the year, our order books and backlog remain robust. We expect continued strong end-user demand and pricing, although supply chain challenges will impact the extent to which we'll be able to fully meet demand. As I mentioned, we do not expect to see a significant benefit from dealer restocking in 2022.\nOn margins, as we discussed in January, we do not expect a typical year. In a normal year, we'd see strong margins in the first quarter with margins decreasing sequentially through the fourth quarter. However, this year, we expect margins to improve in the second half of the year compared to both the first half and the comparable period of 2021 as the impact of price actions accelerate. Comparisons ease in the back half of the year as well as we let the manufacturing cost increases from the prior year. As Jim mentioned, we continue to expect price to more than offset manufacturing costs for the full year. Specific to the second quarter, we expect similar margins to the prior year as additional price actions should offset manufacturing cost increases.\nLooking at the second quarter by segment. We do expect margins in both Construction Industries and Resource Industries to be close to or higher than the prior year as price improves and manufacturing cost headwinds are in line with the first quarter. Margin in Energy & Transportation still lag the prior year as the timing of price actions is late as compared to the other segments. However, we expect the lag in the second quarter was not -- will not be as significant as it was in the first quarter.\nAs we move into the second half of the year in Energy & Transportation, we expect a reduction in expediting costs and an improvement in efficiencies. Increases in large engine and turbine volumes versus 2021 should also positively contribute to margins in the second half of the year. However, it's important to note that the majority of our core investments related to the energy transition will impact this segment.\nFinally, to assist with more modeling, we currently expect to add accrual for short-term incentive compensation expense to be around $1.3 billion this year. We anticipate a global effective tax rate of around 24% and restructuring costs of approximately $600 million for the full year.\nTurning to Slide 17. In summary, we performed well in a challenging environment. End-user demand remains strong, and we realized $1.7 billion more in revenues. Sales and margins were slightly better than we expected. Looking ahead, comparisons ease in the second half of the year, and we expect to achieve our Investor Day targets of adjusted operating profit margins and ME&T free cash flow. And with that, we'll take your questions.",

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jennifer Driscoll. Thank you. Please go ahead.\n\nJennifer K. Driscoll\n\nDirector of IR, Caterpillar Inc.\n\nThanks, Emma. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the fourth quarter earnings call for Caterpillar. With me are Jim Umpleby, Chairman and CEO; Andrew Bonfield, Chief Financial Officer; Kyle Epley, Vice President of the Global Finance Services Division; and Rob Rengel, Senior Manager and Investor Relations.\nEarlier this morning, we issued our earnings news release. You can find the release and accompanying slides on caterpillar.com in the Investors section under Events and Presentations. In the back of the slide, you'll find supplemental information on dealer inventory and order backlog.\nWe've copyrighted this call. Please don't use any portion without a prior written approval.\nNow on Slide 2. During our call, we'll make forward-looking statements. These are subject to a host of risks and uncertainties. For more information about the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to vary materially from any forward-looking statements, please refer to our SEC filings, including our 10-Q filings for the most recent quarters.\nOn today's call, we'll also refer to non-GAAP numbers. For a reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers to the appropriate U.S. GAAP numbers, please see the appendix of the earnings call slides.\nThis morning, we announced profit per share of $3.91 for the fourth quarter of 2021. That compares with a profit per share of $1.42 in the fourth quarter of 2020. Our adjusted profit per share was $2.69 in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared with $2.12 in the fourth quarter of 2020. Adjusted profit per share for both quarters excluded restructuring and mark-to-market gains or losses for remeasurement of pension and other post-employment benefit plans. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we had $1.19 per share of remeasurement gain and $0.03 per share of net restructuring income due to a gain on the sale of a facility. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we had $0.63 per share of remeasurement losses and $0.07 per share of restructuring expenses. Please keep in mind, to a date, we'll announce our first quarter earnings, April 28, and we'll host our next Investor Day, May 17.\nAnd with that, turn to Slide 3. We'll give the call over to Jim Umpleby.\n\nD. James Umpleby\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Caterpillar Inc.\n\nThank you, Jennifer. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'd like to start by recognizing our global team for their continued resilience and hard work in what proved to be a challenging and dynamic environment. We're proud that we achieved our best year on record for employee safety for the third year in a row. In 2021, we continue to execute our strategy for long-term profitable growth while striving to meet strong customer demand. I'll briefly cover a number of topics. I'll start with my perspective on the quarter, then I'll give a brief update on our supply chain, followed by comments on services and our end markets before closing with an update on Caterpillar's sustainability journey.\nWe were encouraged by the continued strong customer demand in the quarter. Sales and revenues rose in all regions and in the 3 primary segments due to volume gains and favorable price. And similar to the third quarter, absent the continuation of supply chain constraints, our top line would have been even stronger.\nOn the other hand, our margins were lower than we expected, primarily because of 2 factors. First, freight costs were higher than expected due to inflationary pressures as well as our decision to increase the use of premium freight to meet as much customer demand as possible.\nThe second factor was production inefficiencies. As I mentioned, underlying demand is stronger than we can currently supply due to ongoing supply chain constraints. We made the decision to keep our plants open and fully staffed to best serve our customers and meet as much demand as possible. We believe it's the right decision to incur some short-term margin impact rather than take actions that might limit our ability to more fully satisfy demand when supply chain conditions start to improve. We also continue to redirect components, alter our assembly processes and optimize where we can. Some of these actions aimed at maintaining our production flexibility come with additional short-term costs. When the supply chain bottlenecks begin to ease, we expect to be well positioned to increase our production to more fully meet demand and gain operating leverage from higher volume.\nMaterial costs also impacted us this quarter, but unlike freight and inefficiencies, it was within the range we had anticipated. As you know, we implemented price increases during 2021. We're taking further action in 2022 with the intent to offset the impact of underlying inflation. That's the general picture. Andrew will provide more details on our margins and how the combination of supply chain pressures and pricing will likely affect the cadence of our quarterly margins in 2022.\nNow on Slide 4. Our top line rose by 23%. The primary drivers of the volume gains were increases in sales to users, including the original equipment and services and changes in dealer inventory. For the full year 2021, services sales grew 17% to $19 billion. Services growth in 2021 benefited from investments in our digital capabilities and the increased focus we and our dealers placed on meeting customer needs for services, particularly aftermarket parts. We saw significant increases in 2021 in e-commerce sales and sales of customer value agreements for CVAs and in prioritized service events or PSEs. In 2021, our e-commerce orders increased significantly, and now we have critical mass in connectivity with more than 1.2 million connected assets.\nIt's encouraging to see services sales in 2021 higher than in 2019 when our total company -- while our total company sales in 2021 remained lower than in 2019. We continue to strive to meet our aspirational target of doubling services to $28 billion by 2026. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2020, sales to users rose 7%. Gains were across the 3 segments. For machines, including Construction Industries and Resource Industries, sales to users rose 5%. For Energy & Transportation, sales to users increased 12%. Sales to users and Construction Industries rose by 4%, with double-digit growth in EAME and Latin America.\nIn North America, residential construction remained strong in the elevated housing construction, while nonresidential demand continued to improve at a slower pace. In Asia Pacific, end-user demand slowed, reflecting the expected moderation in China construction. However, excluding China, sales to users were positive in Asia Pacific driven by favorable commodity prices and government stimulus.\nIn Resource Industries, sales to users rose by 10%. Mining saw healthy gains in the quarter, supported by strong commodity prices and the replacement of aging equipment. Sales to users increased versus the prior year in heavy construction and quarry and aggregates for the third straight quarter.\nIn Energy & Transportation, sales to users were up across all applications versus the prior year. We saw double-digit growth in industrial and transportation, although from a low base. We experienced strength across many applications for industrial, and international rail deliveries benefited transportation sales as expected. Oil and gas grew from demand for both reciprocating engines and turbines. Finally, power generation sales to users increased as data center demand remains strong.\nOverall, total sales to users growth in the quarter moderated versus the second and third quarters. As a reminder, the impact of the pandemic lessened in the fourth quarter of 2020. In addition, the supply chain challenges have constrained our ability to fully meet end-user demand. As independent businesses, dealers make their own decisions about their inventories. Changes in dealer inventories drove about a $1 billion tailwind to sales compared with last year. Dealer inventory was nearly flat in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter of this year. In the fourth quarter of 2020, dealers decreased their inventory by about $1.1 billion.\nTo put it in context, our year-end dealer inventory in 2021 also finished about flat with year-end 2020, as we expected. Dealer inventories are generally near the low end of the typical range due to strong customer demand and our supply chain challenges. Currently, availability is extended for some products due to the shortage of semiconductors and other components. With the exception of China, end-user demand for our equipment remains strong.\nTurning to Slide 5. In 2021, we met our 2019 Investor Day target for adjusted operating profit margins for the third year in a row. We also met our target for free cash flow for Machinery, Energy & Transportation or ME&T. Our strong cash flow enabled us to return $5 billion to shareholders this year through dividends and share repurchases. We paid a higher dividend annually for 28 consecutive years and are proud of our status as a dividend aristocrat. We expect to continue to return substantially all of ME&T free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases over time.\nNext, on Slide 6, I'll share some high-level assumptions for the full year. First, in 2022, based on what we know today, we expect to achieve our Investor Day targets for adjusted operating profit margins and ME&T free cash flow. That said, the environment remains uncertain due to COVID and other issues, including continuing supply chain disruptions, freight and material cost inflation and labor availability. Our focus is long-term profitable growth. Despite the challenging environment, we continue to invest in services, electrification, autonomy, alternative fuels and digital technology, all of which support our strategy.\nNow I'll describe our outlook for key end markets this year. Demand remains strong as demonstrated by robust orders. In addition, we're receiving positive input from our customers and dealers. A key variable remains the supply chain, namely to what degree can we fully meet strong customer demand.\nIn Construction Industries in North America, residential construction continues to be the main growth engine with nonresidential also improving. We believe the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will begin to fuel increased investments in capital equipment late this year, into 2023 and beyond.\nIn China, we expect the industry for excavators above 10 tons to return to 2019 levels, reflecting weakness in housing construction. We expect the balance of Asia Pacific to have good growth, fueled by higher investments in infrastructure.\nTurning to EAME. Positive fundamentals include government stimulus actions, construction confidence, new orders and commodity prices. Latin America is expected to benefit from construction activity in mining, supported by commodity prices, although strong inflation could make it more challenging.\nIn Resource Industries, we anticipate elevated commodity prices will support continuing improvement in demand for mining products and services. We also expect growth in heavy construction and quarry and aggregates to continue in 2022. We now currently operate autonomously on 18 sites on 3 continents with more than 500 large mining trucks and have now moved more than 4 billion tons. Technology and autonomy offerings deliver significant benefits across the board, from boosting safety and productivity to more consistent and efficient operations. Autonomous operations enable higher machine utilization, leading to reductions in idle time and nonproductive fuel burn.\nIn Energy & Transportation, we see improved sales across most applications, and we had strong order rates, including for large engines in the fourth quarter. While we expect our oil and gas customers to continue to display capital discipline, we do expect growth in our reciprocating engines and aftermarket services for oil and gas. We see growth in reciprocating engines for power generation with strength across many applications.\nIndustrial, which includes engines for our own equipment and loose engines sold to customers, is projected to grow across many applications, including construction, agriculture and electric power. We expect a modest increase in transportation, primarily in rail services. We also anticipate growth in Marine from a low base as customers update aging fleets. In 2022, Solar is expected to be impacted by the dampening industry cycle. We expect Solar's new equipment sales to be lower this year, which will be partially offset by continued services growth. Solar is experiencing healthy inquiry activity, which indicates the likely recovery in customer deliveries in the late 2022 and into 2023.\nNow on Slide 7. We significantly advanced our sustainability journey in 2021, and we continue to focus on this important element of our strategy. In 2021, Caterpillar and our customers announced a number of projects that will help contribute to a lower carbon future. I'll highlight several more that occurred since our last earnings call.\nIn November, Newmont announced a strategic alliance with Caterpillar to deliver a fully automated zero-emissions mining equipment and technology. The investment encompasses a U.S. surface mine and an Australian underground mine while also deploying Caterpillar [mine store] across all Newmont sites.\nWe also announced a 3-year collaboration with Microsoft and Ballard to demonstrate a power system with large format hydrogen fuel cells to produce backup power for Microsoft data centers. Caterpillar is providing the system integration, electronics and controls that form the central structure of the power solution, which will be fueled by low carbon intensity hydrogen. The project is backed by the U.S. Department of Energy.\nIn December, Progress Rail entered into a memorandum of understanding with BNSF and Chevron to advance the demonstration on BNSF's line of a locomotive powered by hydrogen fuel cells. Progress Rail plans to design and build a prototype hydrogen fuel-cell locomotive with Chevron developing the infrastructure to support it.\nEarlier this month, Tech Resources, one of Canada's leading mining companies, announced a partnership with Caterpillar to deploy 30 zero-emissions large haul trucks, including CAT 794 ultra-class trucks at their mining operations beginning in 2027. This collaboration will support their goals to reduce the carbon intensity of their operations by 33% by 2030 and be carbon-neutral by 2050.\nAnd finally, Union Pacific is purchasing 10 Progress Rail battery electric locomotives, making them our fourth customer for this new technology. In railroads, in California, in Nebraska, they will be tested in diverse weather conditions and evaluated for broader deployment in support of Union Pacific's emissions reduction goals.\nWe're excited about the opportunities associated with the energy transition, which includes rising demand for commodities used in electric vehicles and other applications, benefiting Resource Industries. The significant infrastructure investments associated with the energy transition also support growth in Construction Industries. In addition, the increased demand for a number of products in our Energy & Transportation segment, including distributed power generation and our integrated systems and solutions to help our customers meet their climate-related objectives. Caterpillar continues to invest in research and development to support a wide variety of fuel types, energy storage and hybrid solutions.\nIn summary, we're continuing to execute our strategy for long-term profitable growth. The 3 core elements of the strategy remain: services, expanded offerings and operational excellence. Services growth and our record safety performance are among the many highlights of 2021. We remain committed to a reduced carbon future, both in our operations and helping customers reach their climate-related goals.\nWe continue to introduce products and services that facilitate fuel transition, increase operational efficiency and reduce emissions. While we continue to face supply chain challenges that negatively impacted our top line and our fourth quarter margin performance, we're focusing on meeting as much customer demand as possible and remain encouraged by the continuation of strong end-market demand. Our team delivered 2021 adjusted operating profit margins and ME&T free cash flow consistent with the long-term targets we set at our 2019 Investor Day, while continuing to invest in our long-term strategy for profitable growth.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew R. J. Bonfield\n\nCFO, Caterpillar Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a recap of Caterpillar's fourth quarter results, including the performance of each segment, then I'll comment on the balance sheet and cash flow, before concluding with a few assumptions about the first quarter and full year of 2022.\nStarting with the fourth quarter on Slide 8. Our sales revenues rose by 23% or $2.6 billion to $13.8 billion. Volume growth led the way and was broad-based as demand remained strong. Operating profit increased by 17% to $1.6 billion as volume growth and favorable price were partially offset by freight, material and short-term incentive compensation headwinds. As Jim has mentioned, operating margins were lower than we had anticipated, primarily due to elevated freight costs and plant inefficiencies, which I'll discuss further in a few moments.\nFourth quarter profit per share was $3.91 compared to $1.42 last year. We had our usual impacts from mark-to-market accounting for remeasurement of pension and OPEB plans. That included $1.19 per share favorable in the fourth quarter of this year compared to $0.63 per share unfavorable last year. Restructuring was actually a net income of $19 million in the quarter, due to the gain on the sale of the facility. In addition, some of our planned restructuring activities that we'd originally expected to complete in the quarter will push back into 2022.\nThe reported adjusted profit per share of $2.69 in the fourth quarter compared to $2.12 last year. This performance included a lower-than-expected global tax rate and some discrete tax items, which, together, added approximately $0.36 to fourth quarter profit per share.\nNow on Slide 9. As we had anticipated, the top line for the fourth quarter was the strongest of the year, coming in slightly better than normal seasonality would imply. Dealer inventory provided about a $1 billion tailwind versus the comparable quarter in 2020 when dealers reduced their inventories by $1.1 billion. Sales to users growth decelerated a bit sequentially, but remained strong despite a tougher comparison period, particularly in China. Price realization strengthened as we saw the benefit of additional price actions begin to flow through. Services continue to be a bright spot.\nI want to take a moment to provide some color on dealer inventory. Cash [pivot] dealers typically hold between 3 and 4 months worth of inventory based on projected sales for the next 12 months. For the past year, they've been near the low end of that range. Because of strong sales to end users and supply chain constraints, dealers have prioritized customer orders over building inventory. As a result, dealers have been unable to restock as would have been their normal practice. Given the current constrained environment, we don't expect to see a significant benefit from dealer restocking in 2022.\nFourth quarter sales and revenues increased in every region. In North America, our largest region, sales increased by 27%, with strong growth in all 3 primary segments, but led by Construction Industries and Resource Industries.\nIn EAME, sales rose by 24% as fundamentals remain strong. Latin America sales grew by 38% from a low base. Asia Pacific sales increased by 9% as gains in Energy & Transportation and Resource Industries more than offset lower revenues in Construction Industries. Excluding China, Construction Industry sales in the regions grew versus the prior year's quarter. Just to remind you, the quarterly sales profile for China in 2020 was very different from the normal seasonable pattern, with a strong second half due to the timing of stimulus activity.\nIn 2021, we have returned the more typical profile of a stronger first half of the year ahead of the selling season. This is made for a particular tough comparison as China sales were abnormally strong in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nNow let's review the bottom line on Slide 10. Fourth quarter operating profit increased by [$231] million or 17%. Compared to the prior year, strong volume and favorable price realization were the principal drivers of the increase. Higher manufacturing costs and SG&A and R&D expenses partially offset these gains. Acceleration in freight, manufacturing inefficiencies and material costs drove the manufacturing cost increases. The freight costs included both inflation and standard rates and the increased use of premium freight. The reinstatement of short-term incentive compensation had an impact on manufacturing costs and SG&A and R&D expenses, albeit at a slower rate than previous quarters.\nBeginning in the second quarter, we told you that we had expected price realization to offset higher manufacturing costs for machines in 2021. We have come up just short of that goal as the unfavorable impacts of rising freight costs and the manufacturing inefficiencies during the fourth quarter were more significant than we had expected. As we had noted previously, due to taking price action later in the year, we had expected a lag in Energy & Transportation price realization, so material cost increases and sharply rising freight costs negatively impacted Energy & Transportation's margins more significantly than they did for the machine groups.\nMoving to margins. The adjusted operating profit margin was 11.4%, a decrease of 140 basis points, with short-term incentive compensation expense, a headwind of roughly 150 basis points of margin in the quarter. As both Jim and I have acknowledged, margins for the fourth quarter deteriorated by more than we had expected. To provide a bit more perspective, we typically see margins decrease sequentially by between 100 to 200 basis points from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. However, in the fourth quarter of 2021, the spike in freight costs, along with the plant inefficiencies that Jim described, caused an additional unfavorable impact of around 100 basis points or so. Most of this was due to the need to ship components using premium freight and factory inefficiencies that resulted from challenges caused by component shortages as we prioritize meeting customer demand. We believe that these margin temperature headwinds are temporary and will only last as long as the supply chain challenges remain.\nOur price actions are designed to cover increases in underlying input costs, but do not anticipate factory inefficiencies or premium shipping, which had to be used to serve our customers. There's no doubt that this will impact some part of 2022, but it's impossible to be certain when these costs will abate.\nNow looking at the full year. Our adjusted operating profit margin was 13.7%. As Jim mentioned, we've achieved our 2019 Investor Day margin target of adjusted operating profit margins being 300 to 600 basis points better at a comparable level of sales to the reference period of 2010 to 2016. We've done so while investing in new product launches, services and sustainability.\nOf note, R&D expense, including [higher] short-term incentive compensation, increased by 19% for the full year. Our global effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 23% versus the 25% we had assumed previously. The improvement primarily related to changes in the geographic mix of profits from a tax perspective. Adjusted profit per share was $2.69, reflecting the stronger volume, favorable price as well as the lower-than-expected global tax rate.\nMoving to Slide 11. Let's take a look at the segment performance, starting with Construction Industries. Sales increased by 27% in the fourth quarter to $5.7 billion, primarily driven by strong sales volume and favorable price realization. The improvement in volume was due to a smaller reduction year-over-year in dealer inventories and higher end-user demand. End-user demand improved in 3 of the 4 regions.\nIn North America, we saw our largest sales growth as nonresidential demand continued to improve, and housing construction remained supportive. End-user demand eased in Asia Pacific due to the challenging comparatives in China that I spoke about earlier. The segment's fourth quarter profit increased by 25% to $788 million on higher sales volume and favorable price realization. Cost increases related to material and freight were more than offset by price increases. However, the segment's operating margin decreased by 30 basis points versus last year to 13.7% due to the headwinds of factory inefficiencies and higher short-term incentive compensation expense.\nTurning to Slide 12, Resource Industries sales increased by 27% in the fourth quarter to $2.8 billion. The improvement was mostly due to higher end-user demand and favorable price. End-user demand increased in mining as well as heavy construction from quarrying aggregates. Fourth quarter profit for Resource Industries increased by 12% to [305]\ncosts and higher SG&A and R&D expenses were more than offset by higher selling sales volume and favorable price realization. The increase in SG&A and R&D expenses was driven by investments and higher short-term incentive compensation.\nIn Resource Industries, price realization takes longer to come through results because of the equipment's longer lead times between the time of an order and date of delivery. However, as we progress through 2022, we expect more benefits to flow through from the price increases we have taken. The segment's operating margin decreased by 150 basis points versus last year to 11.0%.\nNow on Slide 13. Energy & Transportation sales increased by 19% to approximately $5.7 billion with sales up across all applications. That included a 22% sales increase in oil and gas, including aftermarket parts for reciprocating engines. Gas compression also supported reciprocating engine sales. Power generation sales increased by 7%, driven by reciprocating engine aftermarket part sales. Industrial sales rose by 29% with strength across many applications. Last, transportation rose by 17% on strong international rail deliveries and services in the quarter.\nProfit for Energy & Transportation decreased by 2% to $675 million. Volume and price gains were more than offset by higher manufacturing costs, short-term incentive compensation expense and investments in growth initiatives such as the energy transition. Keep in mind that the majority of our core investments in the energy transition, for example, in electrification, impact this segment.\nFreight cost increases were particularly significant in the quarter, driving the higher manufacturing costs. The segment's operating margin decreased by 250 basis points versus last year to 11.8%.\nOn Slide 14, Financial Products had a very strong quarter. Revenue increased by 4% to $776 million. Segment profit increased by 27% year-over-year to $248 million. The year-over-year profit increase was partly due to continued strong demand for used equipment, where worldwide sales -- new sales were our highest on record in 2021. The segment also benefited from a lower provision for credit losses at CAT Financial.\nMoving to our credit portfolio, it's in good shape as customer health indicators remain positive. Past dues continue to improve across all portfolio segments to 1.95%. That's down 154 basis points year-over-year and down 46 basis points compared to the third quarter. It's the lowest past due levels we've seen in 15 years. New retail lending hit an [8-year] high in the fourth quarter.\nOn Slide 15, ME&T free cash flow was $1.8 billion in the quarter, an increase of about $116 million versus the fourth quarter of last year. The increase was due to higher profit adjusted for noncash items, which includes higher accruals for short-term incentive compensation. ME&T generated $6 billion in free cash flow this year, almost double compared to the prior year and in line with our Investor Day target of between $4 billion and $8 billion. We recently declared a quarterly dividend of $1.11 per share or around $600 million per quarter. In 2021, we paid around $2.3 billion in dividends. We are proud of our dividend aristocrat status, which we maintained following the 8% [quarterly] increase announced in June of last year.\nWe completed $1 billion in share repurchases in the fourth quarter for a total of $2.7 billion in 2021. In aggregate, we returned $5 billion to shareholders, which represents 83% of our ME&T free cash flow for 2021. Over the past 4 years, on average, we've returned 99% of our ME&T free cash flow to shareholders. That aligns to our target to return substantially all of our ME&T free cash flow to shareholders over time.\nThe company ended the year with $9.3 billion in enterprise cash, a strong position. As always, given our captive finance organization, which helps our customers acquire our equipment, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet as we prioritize our mid-A credit ratings.\nNow on Slide 16. In light of the fluid environment, we will continue to not provide guidance for our annual profit per share. However, to assist with modeling the company, we'll continue to share some high-level assumptions for the upcoming quarter and full year.\nLooking to the first quarter, we expect the top line to increase versus the prior year on stronger end-user demand and higher prices. We also expect to see a dealer inventory increase, which would follow our normal seasonable pattern as is prepared for the spring selling season. However, we anticipate that increase will be slightly less than normal given the supply chain constraints and the high levels of committed orders.\nFor the full year, we expect the environment to support strong end-user demand and higher pricing. The extent that we'll be able to fulfill that demand will be impacted by the supply chain challenges we've discussed today. As these alleviate, we would expect to see an acceleration in sales to end users. As we have noted, our order books and backlog are robust, but we do expect the supply chain to constrain our volumes.\nBefore I discuss margins, I want to highlight how unusual the last 2 years have been. In 2020, the full impact of the pandemic started to be felt from the first quarter -- end of the first quarter. Whilst demand started to improve through 2021, we then started to see the impacts of commodity and freight inflation as well as significant supply chain pressures build through the year. This makes our normal quarterly phasing more difficult to model as there are fundamental changes in the underlying comparatives that make historic norms less relevant. Let me explain.\nIn 2021, pricing was slow to ramp up and picked up at the third and fourth quarters of the year following midyear and October price increases. From a cost perspective, material and freight costs were about flat in the first quarter and then ramped up through to be at their highest in absolute terms in the fourth quarter. So that sets up our comparisons. Then this year, we will begin this year with a carryover pricing from midyear [and] October 2021. And then we expect to have additional pricing in 2022. That's why we expect pricing to be more or less evenly spread across the quarters as we move through 2022. Then we will lap those rising material freight costs and manufacturing inefficiencies as we move towards the back half of the year, so we will have easier comparisons.\nIn a nutshell, we anticipate the greatest headwinds to margin in 2022 to occur in the first quarter. This is completely counter to the normal historic pattern of strong margins in the first quarter, with margins decreasing sequentially to the fourth. We expect those headwinds to margins to abate as the year goes on, as we realize more price and as we lap the higher costs.\nMore importantly, we intend price increases to more than offset manufacturing cost increases in 2022, assuming the current level supply chain disruption does not deteriorate. I'll provide a few more key assumptions for you to keep in mind as well.\nOur short-term incentive compensation expenses anticipates to be around $1 billion for the year or $250 million per quarter. That's a $50 million tailwind in the first quarter. Also, we'll have about $1.3 billion cash outflow in the first quarter related to the payout of last year's incentive compensation. We anticipate an increase in R&D, reflecting continued acceleration of investments related to initiatives such as sustainability, electrification and digital. Restructuring expense should be a headwind for the year. we [anticipate] around $600 million in restructuring expense in 2022 compared to $90 million in 2021. The increase is larger than usual due to the actions to address certain challenged products we've already announced, some of which were delayed a bit.\nKeep in mind that our adjusted profit per share calculation excludes restructuring costs. We also estimate prior restructuring actions will benefit 2022 by around $75 million.\nIn addition, we assume an annual global effective tax rate of around 25%. Finally, we anticipate CapEx to be in the [$1.4] billion range.\nTurning to Slide 17. Let me recap today's key points. We met our adjusted operating margin and ME&T free cash flow targets in a challenging year. End-user demand remained strong. And in a challenging supply chain environment, we kept our factories opened, maintained our production flexibility and recognized $2.6 billion more in revenues. We continue to execute our strategy for long-term profitable growth as we expand our offerings in preparation for the energy transition. We anticipate stronger sales volume in the first quarter versus the prior year, while margins will be pressured in the first quarter as costs remain elevated and the full benefits of pricing flow through evenly throughout the year.\nWith that, I'll take your questions.",

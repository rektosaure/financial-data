[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Steve Sanghi. Thank you, sir. You may begin.\n\nStephen Sanghi\n\nExecutive Chair\n\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone.\nDuring the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.\nIn attendance with me today are Rich Simoncic, Microchip's COO; Eric Bjornholt, Microchip CFO; and Brian McCarson, Microchip's VP of Data Center Business Unit; and Sajid Daudi, Microchip's Head of Investor Relations.\nI will provide a reflection on our fiscal second quarter 2026 financial results, then Brian will provide an update on our data center business and Eric will go over our financial performance. I will then provide an overview of the current business environment and our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal year 2026. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.\nI will now highlight a few salient points of our financial results. 6% sequential sales growth. Net sales were up sequentially in Americas and Asia and flat in Europe, which is not bad for a summer quarter in Europe. Sales from our microcontroller and analog businesses were up sequentially; specifically, our MCU business grew 9.7% sequentially with strong contribution from 32-bit MCU, while our analog business increased 1.7% sequentially.\nOur Gen 4 and Gen 5 data center products are seeing strong sales growth albeit from depressed levels as customers seem to have finished their inventory correction. In the new products area, our blockbuster product announcement came on October 13 when we announced the industry's first 3-nanometer based PCIe Gen 6 switch to power modern AI infrastructure. [indiscernible] will comment on this later in today's call.\nOur non-GAAP gross margin was up 236 basis points sequentially, incremental non-GAAP gross margin was 95% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating margin was up 364 basis points sequentially, incremental non-GAAP operating margin was 84.6% sequentially. Our incremental gross and operating margins are very positive. Inventory went down by $73.8 million sequentially and calendar year-to-date reduction in inventory is $261 million. Inventory days were 199 days. Our inventory over 3 quarters has gone down from 266 days to 251 days to 214 days to 199 days.\nUnderutilization in our factories in September quarter was $51 million. The product gross margin in the September quarter was 67.4% due to a rich product/mix driven by data center products. We added $71.8 million of new inventory write-off and $51 million of underutilization charge makes a total of $122.8 million of charges. Divide that by the net sales of $1,140.4 million and you get a non-GAAP gross margin impact of 10.8 percentage points. Subtracting it from the product gross margin of 67.4%, we got a non-GAAP gross margin of 56.7%, which is what we reported.\nSo the product gross margin remains very healthy. we still need to bring down inventory write-offs and underutilization charges. We are pleased to announce that we have entered into a purchase and sales agreement to sell our Fab 2 wafer fabrication facility located in Tempe, Arizona, to a third party. The sale of this facility is part of our previously announced plan to restructure our wafer fabrication operations.\nUnder this restructuring plan, Microchip completed the closure of Fab 2 in May of 2025 and begin to transfer the process technologies from Fab 2 to Fab 4 in Gresham, Oregon; and Fab 5 in Colorado Springs, Colorado, both of which facilities have ample clean room space for expansion. The transaction is subject to closing conditions and is expected to be completed in December 2025. Now we have a special guest for you today.\nLet me introduce Brian McCarson, Corporate Vice President of our Data Center Solutions business unit. Brian will speak about our recent announcement of industry's first 3-nanometer base PCIe Gen 6 switch. Brian?\n\nBrian McCarson\n\nSenior Principal Engineer, CTO of IoT Strategy, Intel Corp.\n\nThank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm the Corporate Vice President and leader of the Data Center Solutions business unit at Microchip. And today, I'm excited to introduce you to the latest addition to our Switchtec family of products. Our new Gen 6 PCIe switch announced on October 13 marks a significant milestone in Microchip's technological leadership within the AI and enterprise data center infrastructure markets.\nThe build-out of AI data centers continues to accelerate with hyperscalers committing to gigawatt scale deployments. Some recent announcements have outlined single infrastructure projects in the 5 to 10 gigawatt range, targeting completion between 2026 and 2027. These developments are driving our current design engagement cycles.\nIt is critical to understand that regardless of whether our customers deploy NVIDIA, AMD, Intel or custom ASICs all require high-performance PCIe switching infrastructure. This is where Microchip's Gen 6 Switchtec products are designed to excel. Last month, at the Open Compute Project Global Summit in San Jose, California, we introduced the industry's first PCIe Gen 6 switches manufactured using 3-nanometer process technology.\nThese new devices deliver 4 distinct competitive advantages. First, PCIe doubles the bandwidth to 64 giga transfers per second per lane compared to PCIe 5.0 eliminating GPU to storage, memory and CPU bottlenecks that constrained previous generations. Our new Gen 6 switch features an industry-leading maximum of 160 lanes per device, significantly increasing total data transfer capacity.\nSecond, our 3-nanometer implementation provides 15% to 20% power per lane advantage over competitors' products developed on 5-nanometer and older technology nodes. This is critical when deploying hundreds of thousands of GPUs and switches in multi-gigawatt data centers. Choosing Microchip's devices enables customers to lower total power consumption without compromising performance.\nThird, all our Gen 6 Switchtec devices offer advanced device telemetry and multicast capabilities, allowing a single GPU data packet to be transmitted to multiple devices simultaneously, thereby improving GPU efficiency.\nAnd fourth, we have implemented a secure-based hardware route of trust that supports post-quantum cryptography and CNSA 2.0, the commercial national security algorithm suite compliant, meeting or exceeding both governments and commercial security requirements. This represents industry-leading device security. We are now sampling these products to qualified customers and recent engagements have been validating both our technical approach and our market timing.\nFrom a financial perspective, we believe this represents a significant growth opportunity for the company. AI servers require substantially more PCIe switching infrastructure than traditional servers to enable resource pooling and the composable architectures that hyperscalers demand. Our total addressable market encompasses the entire data center PCIe fabric, not just a subset.\nWe are vendor-agnostic selling into all data center and AI architectures. Design win cycles typically span 12 to 18 months from initial engagement to production, aligning our current sampling activity with initial production starting in June 2026 and volume ramping towards the end of calendar year 2026.\nLooking ahead, our Gen 6 Switchtec devices position us to capture a meaningful share of the committed AI infrastructure build-out across 3 growth vectors: hyperscale training infrastructure, enterprise AI training and inference deployments and high-performance computing applications.\nI will pause here and turn the call over to Eric for comments about our financials. Eric?\n\nJames Eric Bjornholt\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Microchip Technology, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. We are including information in our press release and in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, and included reconciliation information in our earnings press release which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website.\nI will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our earnings press release and in the reconciliations on our website.\nNet sales in the September quarter were $1.14 billion, which was up 6% sequentially and $10.4 million above the midpoint of our September quarter guidance provided on August 7. We have posted a summary of our net sales by product line and geography on our website for your reference.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 56.7% including capacity underutilization charges of $51 million, and new inventory reserve charges of $71.8 million. Operating expenses were at 32.4% of sales and operating income was 24.3% of sales. Non-GAAP net income was $199.1 million and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.35, which was $0.02 above the midpoint of our guidance.\nOn a GAAP basis in the September quarter, gross margins were 55.9%. Total operating expenses were $549 million and included acquisition intangible amortization of $108.1 million; special charges of $6.3 million, which was primarily driven by our activities associated with our closure of Fab 2; share-based compensation of $53.3 million; and $12.3 million of other expenses.\nThe GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders was $13.9 million or $0.03 per share and was positively impacted by our settlement of an audit with the IRS dating back to fiscal year 2007. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 9.5% in the September quarter. We expect to record a non-GAAP tax rate of about 10.25% for all of fiscal year 2026, which is exclusive of the transition tax and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years.\nOur inventory balance at September 30, 2025, was $1.095 billion, which was down $73.8 million from the balance at June 30, 2025. We had 199 days of inventory at the end of the September quarter, which was down 15 days from the prior quarter's level driven by our inventory reduction actions included in our September ending inventory was 16 days of long life cycle, high-margin products whose manufacturing capacity has been end-of-life by our supply chain partners.\nInventory at our distributors in the September quarter was at 27 days, which was down 2 days from the prior quarter's level. Distribution sell-through was about $52.9 million higher than distribution sell in. Our cash flow from operating activities was $88.1 million in the September quarter. Our adjusted free cash flow was $38.3 million in the September quarter. And as of September 30, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $236.8 million.\nOur total debt decreased by $82 million in the September quarter and our net debt increased by $247.7 million. Our adjusted EBITDA in the September quarter was $341.8 million and 30% of net sales. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was $1.103 billion, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 4.69 at the end of the quarter.\nCapital expenditures were $36.5 million in the September quarter and included approximately $20 million for a building purchase in India, supporting our ongoing R&D activities in Bangalore. We expect capital expenditures for fiscal year 2026 to be at or below $100 million, and depreciation expense in the September quarter was $39 million.\nI will now turn it back to Steve, who will provide some additional commentary on our September quarter results and our guidance for the December quarter. Steve?\n\nStephen Sanghi\n\nExecutive Chair\n\nThanks, Eric. As you saw in the last quarter, our net sales continued to grow sequentially. We are continuing to see the inventory go down at distributors at our distributors' customers our direct customers and contract manufacturers. The distributors sell-in versus sell-through gap did not shrink last quarter. It was $49.3 million in the June quarter and it was $52.9 million in the September quarter.\nThe good thing about that is that distributor inventory went down even further. We expect that the distribution selling will eventually rise to meet the sell-through over the next couple of quarters.\nNext is gross margin. As I described in my summary earlier, product gross margins were very healthy at 67.4%, but our inventory write-off and underutilization charges knocked down the non-GAAP gross margin to 56.7%. We still need stronger sales to drive down inventory write-off and underutilization charges. However, our customers and distributors are taking advantage of short lead times and are continuing to drive down their inventory.\nNow to the market environment. We are seeing some recovery in our key end markets in automotive, industrial, communications, data center, aerospace and defense and consumer. They're all looking somewhat better. The strongest sales performance last quarter was in the data center market, albeit from depressed levels. As the inventory at end customers and distributors corrected, we saw a large increase in bookings and shipments of our Gen 4 and Gen 5 products, which included PCIe switches, memory, flash controllers, storage and rad cards, we believe we are extremely well positioned with our Gen 6 PCIe switch with it being the only 3-nanometer based device currently sampling in hyperscaler and enterprise data center customers, beating our competition in virtually every specification metric.\nNow let's get into our guidance for the December quarter. Our backlog for the December quarter started lower than the starting backlog for September quarter. The bookings for July were higher than bookings for any month in the last 3 years. August bookings were seasonally low, but better than our expectations; and September bookings were quite strong, as expected and the best booking month in 3-plus years.\nOverall, September quarter's bookings were 10% higher than those of June quarter. The book-to-bill ratio for the last quarter was 1.06. October bookings were higher than July, so we have a good start to this quarter's bookings; and November bookings so far are very strong. Embedded in these strong bookings is the observation that customers and distributors are scheduling these for March delivery and are continuing to lower their inventories into this calendar year-end.\nA comment about lead times. While lead times for our products have been 4 to 8 weeks for some time, we are continuing to experience lead times bounce off the bottom and are experiencing increases on some of our products. We're running into challenges on certain kind of substrates and subcontracting capacity and also some foundry constraints on very advanced nodes.\nThese challenges remain isolated to specific areas. Our customer requests for expedited shipments have increased significantly from a couple of quarters ago, pointing to some customers' inventories running low.\nI also want to remind investors that December is seasonally our weakest sales quarter of the year, and it's typically down low- to mid-single digits sequentially. This is mainly due to a lot of holidays in the quarter and our customers shutting down their factories during the holidays.\nTaking all of these factors into account, we expect our net sales for the December quarter to be $1.129 billion, plus or minus $20 million, which would be down 1% sequentially at the midpoint. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 57.2% and 59.2% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 32.3% and 32.7% of sales; and we expect our non-GAAP operating profit to be between 24.5% and 26.9% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $0.34 and $0.40.\nI want to highlight the operational discipline in our business model. Despite a seasonally challenging December quarter, with expected slightly lower revenues, our operational improvements are expected to deliver strong profit performance. Non-GAAP operating profit is projected to increase by over $13 million sequentially at the midpoint of our guidance.\nThis operational discipline is evident in our business model's ability to deliver significant flow-through of incremental revenue to operating profit in normal business environments. While we are only providing 1 quarter of guidance and that is for this current December quarter, which is seasonally the weakest sales quarter of the year with a lot of holidays and customer shutdowns, we currently expect 3 strong quarters of March, June and September 2026.\nMarch quarter backlog is currently strong, and we currently expect March quarter sales to be stronger than a seasonal low single-digit up sequentially. Finally, a comment on our capital return program for shareholders. Starting this quarter, we expect our adjusted free cash flow to be roughly even with our dividend payment driven by increasing profitability, low CapEx and liberating cash inventory. In future quarters, as we have excess free cash flow above dividends, we intend to use this to bring down our borrowings.\nWith that, operator, will you please poll for questions?"

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded on Thursday, August 7, 2025. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Steve Sanghi. Thank you. Please go ahead.\n\nStephen Sanghi\n\nExecutive Chair\n\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially.\nWe refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Rich Simoncic, Microchip's CEO, Eric Bjornholt, Microchip's CFO; and Sajid Daudi, Microchip's Head of Investor Relations.\nI will provide a reflection on our fiscal first quarter 2026 financial results, Eric will go over our financial performance and Rich will then review some product line updates. I will then provide an overview of the current business environment and our guidance for second quarter of fiscal year 2026. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.\nMicrochip employees are often referred to as chippers. I will begin with a question for all of you and then I will provide the answer. How many chippers does it take to deliver a good quarter? The answer is that it takes quite a few, but they all showed up to deliver an outstanding quarter like we produced in the June 2025. And that is the point I want to make. 18,000 employees of Microchip worked all last year on a pay cut have not received a bonus or a salary increase in a year and suffered through a gut-wrenching global layoff earlier this year in March.\nThese employees working with high morale came together to deliver an outstanding quarter. I tip my head to all 18,000 employees of Microchip worldwide. I will highlight a few salient points of our financial results. 10.8% sequential sales growth. Net sales were up sequentially in all geographies. Sales from our microcontroller and analog businesses were both up in double-digit percentages sequentially.\nNon-GAAP gross margin was 230 basis points sequentially and incremental non-GAAP gross margin was 76% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating margin was up 670 basis points sequentially and an incremental non-GAAP operating margin was 82% sequentially. Inventory went down by $124 million sequentially. Our target for the whole fiscal year is a $350 million reduction. So we are off to a very good start.\nInventory days were 214 days. Our inventory over 2 quarters has gone down from 266 days to 251 days to 214 days. We expect inventory at the end of September quarter to be between 195 and 200 days. The inventory write-off in the June quarter was $77.1 million down from $90.6 million in the March quarter. The inventory write-offs are expected to decrease again in the September quarter.\nUnderutilization in our factories in the June quarter was $51.5 million, down from $54.2 million in the March quarter. We expect the underutilization will modestly decrease again this quarter with a more significant decrease in the December quarter. Adding $77.1 million of inventory write-off and $51.5 million of underutilization charge makes a total of $128.6 million of charges, divide that by the net sales of $1.075 billion and you get a non-GAAP gross margin impact of 12 percentage points, adding it to the reported non-GAAP gross margin of 54.3% indicates that the product gross margin was 66.3%.\nThe point is as inventory write-off and underutilization charges decreased, we believe our long-term non-GAAP gross margin target of 65% is achievable. We have accrued about $5.5 million from the upside profit to provide a small bonus to our 18,000 employees who deserve it very much. The net impact from this accrual is less than $0.01 per share. And with that, I will pass it on to Eric Bjornholt, who will take you through a more detailed financial performance last quarter. I will come back later to discuss the business environment and provide guidance for the second quarter. Eric?\n\nJames Eric Bjornholt\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Microchip Technology, Inc.\n\nThanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We are including information in our press release and on this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, and included reconciliation information in our earnings press release, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website.\nI will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our earnings press release and in the reconciliations on our website.\nNet sales in the June quarter were $1.075 billion, which was up 10.8% sequentially and $5.5 million above the high end of our updated June quarter guidance provided on May 29. We have posted a summary of our net sales by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 54.3%, including capacity underutilization charges of $51.5 million. new inventory reserve charges of $77.1 million, operating expenses were at 33.7% of sales and operating income was 20.7% of sales.\nNon-GAAP net income was $154.7 million, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.27, which was $0.01 above the high end of our updated guidance. On a GAAP basis in the June quarter, gross margins were 53.6%. Total operating expenses were $544.6 million and included acquisition intangible amortization of $107.6 million, special charges of $22.2 million, which was primarily driven by foundry contract exit costs and our activities associated with the closure of Fab 2, share-based compensation of $45.2 million and $7.5 million of other expenses.\nThe GAAP net loss attributable to common shareholders was $46.4 million or $0.09 per share. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 11.25% in the June quarter, and we expect to record a non-GAAP tax rate of about 9.5% in the September quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal year 2026 is expected to be about 10.25%, which is exclusive of the transition tax and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years, and was positively impacted by the impacts of the recently passed one big beautiful bill. Our inventory balance at June 30, 2025, was $1.169 billion and down $124.4 million from the balance at March 31, 2025.\nWe had 214 days of inventory at the end of the June quarter, which was down 37 days from the prior quarter's levels by our inventory reduction actions is what drove this. Included in our June ending inventory with 16 days of long life cycle, high-margin products whose manufacturing capacity has been end-of-life by our supply chain partners. Inventory at our distributors in the June quarter was at 29 days, which was down 4 days from the prior quarter's level.\nDistribution sell-through was about $49.3 million higher than distribution sell-in. Our cash flow from operating activities was $275.6 million in the June quarter. Our adjusted free cash flow was $244.4 million in the June quarter. And as of June 30, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $566.5 million. Our total debt decreased by $175 million in the June quarter and our net debt increased by $30.2 million.\nOur adjusted EBITDA in the June quarter was $285.8 million and 26.6% of net sales. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was $1.167 billion, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 4.22% at June 30, 2025. Capital expenditures were $17.9 million in the June quarter, and we expect capital expenditures for fiscal year 2026 to be at or below $100 million. Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $39.5 million. And I will now turn it over to Rich, who will provide some commentary on our product line innovations in the June quarter. Rich?\n\nRichard J. Simoncic\n\nSVP of Analog Power and Interface Business Units, Microchip Technology Incorporated\n\nThank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to share our operational progress this quarter, highlighting strong momentum across aerospace, defense, AI applications and network connectivity. As a leading semiconductor supplier to the Department of Defense and our native Iles, our aerospace and defense business continues to strengthen amid increased global defense spending driven by geopolitical tensions and NATO monetization with over 60 years of aerospace and defense heritage, including from our acquisitions, we have recently achieved significant defense industry device qualifications and continue to expand our product portfolio to support commercial aviation, defense systems and space application.\nMicrochip plays a key role supporting products to many modern defense platforms. Also our radiation-tolerant FPGA solutions can deliver up to 50% power savings while maintaining the highest levels of security and reliability. We have recently expanded our FPGA portfolio by introducing cost optimized solutions that deliver up to 30% cost reduction while maintaining industry-leading performance and security. This positions us firmly across both high-reliability defense applications and broader industrial markets.\nMicrochip continues to be a leader in the microcontroller industry and enabling customers with our AI coding assistant, aiding customers to achieve up to a 40% productivity improvement and programming our microcontroller devices. At Masters, our major technical conference this week, we previewed further advancements for the attendees with the inclusion of AI agents into the AI coating assistant that will be released into the market in September this year, further improving productivity and reducing time to market for our customers.\nThe AI build-out continues to create substantial opportunities across our portfolio. We have secured design wins in data center infrastructure, spanning AI acceleration, storage, and network infrastructure with tier 1 cloud providers and enterprise leaders. We have strategically expanded our connectivity, storage and compute offerings for AI and data center applications as well as intelligent power modules for AI at the edge.\nSecurity remains paramount as defense and AI deployments proliferate. We have made significant advances with embedded controllers that feature a mutable post-quantum photography support, which was recently mandated by the NSA. This support enhances the security of platforms using our digital signing for secure boot and secure firmware over-the-air updates. These capabilities are essential enablers to protect our defense, industrial and AI applications well into the future in compliance with critical standards such as CNSA 2.0 and the European Cyber Resiliency Act.\nWith that, I will pass the call to Steve for comments about our business and guidance going forward. Steve?\n\nStephen Sanghi\n\nExecutive Chair\n\nThank you, Rich. During the last quarter's earnings conference call, I talked about a trifecta effect on our revenue growth. We saw that effect in action last quarter. First, our distributors' customers inventory is getting corrected, and we saw the first sequential increase after 2 years in distribution sales out last quarter. Certainly, the distributor sell-in versus sell-through gap shrunk from $103 million in the March quarter to only $49.3 million in the June quarter.\nSo distribution selling is rising to meet the sell-through, and we believe there is more to go. And third, our direct customers inventory is getting corrected, and we saw the first sequential increase in direct sales in 2 years. This trifecta effect led to a 10.8% sequential growth in our net sales in the June quarter. We believe that this dynamic is still in effect. Importantly, we believe that we are seeing what -- we believe what we are seeing represents structural demand recovery as we remain below normalized end market demand levels.\nAfter 2 years of correction, we believe we are filling a supply chain deficit rather than experiencing any significant pull-forward activity. The second effect I have spoken about is the impact on gross margins. As the inventory comes down, our inventory write-off will decrease, thus growing our gross margin percentage. And as the inventory comes down and we start to grow the factories again, our underutilization charge will decrease and will further grow the gross margin. We saw these 2 effects in action last quarter.\nOur inventory write-off decreased from $90.6 million in the March quarter, to $77.1 million in the June quarter, our factory underutilization charge dropped from $54.2 million in the March quarter to $51.5 million in the June quarter. This combined effect is adding to our gross margin. We expect the increase in gross margin percentage will continue as the inventory write-off continues to decrease, and we ramp the factories, which will lower the underutilization charge.\nWe currently plan to start increasing wafer starts in the December quarter. Now the market environment. We are seeing some recovery in our key end markets, automotive, industrial, communication, data center, aerospace and defense markets and consumers are all looking somewhat better. While we have not seen any material tariff-related pull-ins in April and May, we saw some selective acceleration of orders from Asia, which appear to be tariff related.\nWe believe that such pull-ins amounted to only mid- to high single-digit millions. However, it is important to provide context on pull-ins more broadly. We are still shipping below normalized end market demand across most of our markets after 2 years of inventory correction, this depreciated to normal demand levels means that any pull-in we are seeing represents underlying demand where the inventory has run out at the customers rather than borrowing from future quarters.\nNow let's go into our guidance for the September quarter. We believe substantial inventory destocking has occurred at our customers, channel partners and downstream customers and the trifecta effect is in play. Our backlog for the September quarter started higher than the starting backlog for June quarter. And as of this time, the backlog for September quarter is comfortably higher than the backlog for June quarter at the same point in time.\nThe bookings for July were higher than booking for any month in the last 3 years. I will make a comment about lead times. While lead times for products have been 4 to 8 weeks for some time, we are experiencing a lead time bounce off the bottom and increases on some of our products. While we have sufficient inventory, it is mostly held in the DI form. We still have to package and test the products. We're running into challenges on certain kind of lead frames, substrates and subcontracting capacity. While these challenges are isolated to specific areas, we expect them to broaden and lead times go from the 4 to 8 weeks range to more like 6 to 10 weeks range out in time and on certain products, they are likely to go to 8 to 12 weeks range.\nThe customer and distributor inventories have begun to run low on many products. We are increasingly getting short-term shipment requests and pull-ins of the prior orders. Our customers will be well advised to manage their backlog and have 12 to 16 weeks of their needs on backlog, so they are not cut short. The emerging lead time pressures and increasing customer requests for expedited shipments reflect the reality that inventories have run too low on certain products. This dynamic supports our view that we are seeing demand normalization from a severely corrected starting point rather than speculative buying on any -- or any significant pull-forward activity.\nTaking all of these factors into account, we expect our net sales for the September quarter to be $1.13 billion, plus or minus $20 million. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 55% and 57% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 32.4% and 32.8% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP operating profit to be between 22.2% and 24.6% of sales.\nWe expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $0.30 and $0.36 per share. I want to again highlight the leverage in our business model with a $54.5 million sequential increase in net sales at the midpoint, we would expect to see approximately 77% of such amount to go to the bottom line as non-GAAP operating profit.\nAs the inventory drains further in inventory write-offs decrease, we expect our gross margin recovery will accelerate. And with the incremental profits going to the bottom line, we will have tremendous leverage. Finally, a comment on our capital return program for shareholders. After this September quarter, we expect our adjusted free cash flow to exceed our dividend payment driven by increasing revenue and profitability, low CapEx and liberating cash from the inventory.\nTherefore, we do not expect to have to borrow money to pay our dividend after this quarter. In future quarters, we intend to use this excess and adjusted cash flow to bring down our borrowings. With that, operator, will you please poll for questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce you to your host, Steve Sanghi, CEO. Thank you, Steve. You may begin.\n\nStephen Sanghi\n\nExecutive Chair\n\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements or predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.\nIn attendance with me today are Rich Simoncic, Microchip's COO; Eric Bjornholt, CFO; and Sajid Daudi, Head of Investor Relations. I will comment on our restructuring and my observations since returning to Microchip as CEO. Eric will go over our third quarter fiscal year 2025 financial performance, and Rich will then review some product line updates. I will then provide an overview of the current business environment in our fourth quarter fiscal year 2025 guidance. We will then be available to respond the specific investor and analyst questions.\nSince I returned as Microchip's CEO on November 18, 2024, I have spent a significant amount of time evaluating key aspects of Microchip's business. At the UBS conference on December 3, I described a 9-point plan to evaluate Microchip and make changes where needed to set the company on a course to achieve its previous premium status of performance. We are setting up an investor and analyst call on the morning of March 3, to provide you with a comprehensive update on that 9-point plan. Today, I'll give you an interim report on several aspects of that plan.\nThe first action was to resize our manufacturing footprint. After analysis, we have decided to close our Tempe Fab known as Fab 2. Currently, we are in the process of building the material to provide buffer required before we transfer the processes and products to our other 2 fabs. 70% of this product is already qualified at these other fabs. Our other 2 fabs, namely Fab 4 in Gresham, Oregon and Fab 5 in Colorado Springs are working on rotating time off schedules. This reduces the capacity but leave the fabs in a position to ramp capacity when needed on a very short notice. In our back-end facilities in Thailand and Philippines, we're managing capacity by taking shutdown days and reducing the number of employee hours in days of work. In the rest of our smaller plants worldwide, there is a plan for each plant based on the specific demand in each plant. Some of them are running at capacity while others are working shortened weeks. The second action was to reduce our inventory. Our inventory at the end of December 2024 was 266 days, up from 247 days at the end of September 2024. Our target inventory is 130 to 150 days. On March 3, I will project to you the inventory reduction plan. As an example, from December 2024 to the end of fiscal year '26, which is March 31, 2026. We are currently expected to be able to reduce our inventory balance by approximately $250 million, which will limit cash from this inventory reduction. The third action was a review of our megatrends and TSS and recommend any changes. I will provide an update on this topic on March 3. The fourth action was business unit by business unit deep dive. This is still underway, but I already know that we will reorganize some of our business units for greater efficiency and synergy. In the process, we will combine a few groups together. The fifth action was a review of Microchip's channel strategy I have reviewed our channel strategy, and we have made 2 changes. First, when we give a demand creation registration to a distributor and a design socket, we historically have kept that demand creation flag forever. Going forward, we will change that flag to demand fulfillment to a given number of years. This will incentivize the distributor present our new products to customers instead of sitting on a higher margin and exposing socket to competitors. The second range is we have been providing industry high fulfillment margins for distributors. We have lowered the fulfillment margins, which will bring it to a level that is still on the higher end of what our competitors provide. The sixth point of evaluation was to strengthen our customer relationships. We have targeted the top 1,000 customers with an urgent focus on the 256 customers. Many of them have already been approached and visited or the customers visited us. We are giving customers the chance to communicate candidly with us showing empty and care and then engaging with them to support them on their new designs.\nOur goal is to put our customers first and win their hearts and design opportunities with our products, technologies, support and care. Point 7 and 8 were our long-term business model and operating expenses, I will provide an update on these topics on March 3. The intent final area was the chipset activity. we are currently paused, waiting for the new administration to restaff the chip's office, we will then reengage when the time is right.\nWith that, I will pass it to Eric Bjornholt. Eric?\n\nJames Eric Bjornholt\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Microchip Technology, Inc.\n\nThanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We are including information in our press release and in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, and included reconciliation information in our earnings press release, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website. .\nI will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our earnings press release and in the reconciliations on our website. Net sales in the December quarter were $1.026 billion, which was down 11.8% sequentially. We have posted a summary of our net sales by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 55.4%, including capacity and utilization charges of $42.7 million as we are aggressively managing production activities to adjust to challenging business conditions.\nOperating expenses were 34.9% of net sales and operating margin was 20.5%. Non-GAAP net income was $107.3 million, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.20. Please note that our operating expenses increased in the December quarter and will further increase in the [ first ] quarter due to a predominant portion of our employees coming off a cut that we had seen on for about 9 months in the late November, early December 2024 time frame. The full quarterly impact of this is reflected in our operating expense guidance for the March quarter.\nOn a GAAP basis in the December quarter, gross margins were 54.7%, total operating expenses were $530.5 million and included acquisition and intangible amortization of $122.6 million, special charges of $3.5 million and share-based compensation of [ $14 million ] and $4.3 million of other expenses. The GAAP net loss was $53.6 million, resulting in a loss of share of $0.10. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 19.9% in the December quarter. We currently expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate to be approximately 14.5% for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, which is modestly higher than our previously forecasted 13% tax rate. This is a result of expected overpayments in 2 of our larger tax jurisdictions, which will have the impact of reducing our fiscal year 2026 tax rate as we are calculating this on a cash basis. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate is exclusive of the transition tax and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. Our inventory balance at December 31, 2024, was $1.356 billion, which was up $16.7 million from the end of the September 2024 quarter. We had 266 days of inventory at the end of the December quarter, which was up 19 days from the prior quarter's level.\nAt the midpoint of our March 2025 quarterly guidance, we would expect both inventory dollars and inventory days to decrease from the December 31, 2024 levels. We also continue to invest in building inventory for long-lived, high-margin products whose manufacturing capacity is being end of life by our supply chain partners, and these last time buys represented 18 days of inventory at the end of December. Inventory at our distributors in the December quarter was 37 days and was down 3 days from the prior quarter's level. Distribution took down their inventory holdings in the [indiscernible] quarter as distribution sell-through was $118 million higher than distribution sell in.\nOur cash flow from operating activities was $271.5 million in the December quarter. Our adjusted free cash flow was $244.6 million for December quarter. As of December 31, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $586 million, which is higher than normal due to the timing of the maturity dates of some of our commercial papers that did not occur until early January, which was used to pay down debt after the end of the December quarter. We retired $665.5 million in convertible bonds that matured in November 2024. In the December quarter, we also issued $1 billion in investment-grade bonds with a 4.9% coupon maturing in March of 2028 and $1 billion in investment-grade bonds with a 5.5% coupon maturing in February 2030. We used the proceeds of these bond offerings to retire a $750 million term loan and pay down a portion of our commercial paper balance. Our next debt maturity is a $1.2 billion bond maturing in September 2025. The debt issuance this past quarter will give us ample room to retire our September 2025 bond with our line of credit or commercial paper programs. As a result, we have taken the refinancing risk off the table for the $1.2 billion maturity.\nOur net debt increased by $33.6 million in the December quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA in the December quarter was $274.9 million and 26.8% of net sales. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was $1.64 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was [ 3.78 ] at December 31, 2024, up from [ 1.27 ] at December 31, 2023. Capital expenditures were $81 million in the December quarter. Our expectation for capital expenditures for fiscal year '25 is about $135 million, and we expect fiscal year 2026 capital expenditures to be lower than that as we have a lot of capacity to grow back into as well as capital that we purchased during the up cycle that has not been placed in service yet. Depreciation in the December quarter was $40.4 million.\nI will now turn it over to Rich, who will provide some commentary on our product line innovations in the December quarter. Rich?\n\nRichard J. Simoncic\n\nSVP of Analog Power and Interface Business Units, Microchip Technology Incorporated\n\nThank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Our strategic investments continue to strengthen our position across key growth markets. In our core microcontroller business, and we introduced a new generation of 64-bit RISC-V process featuring advanced AI capabilities, integrated time-sensitive networking and next-generation security. These processors deliver exceptional reliability for factory automation and secure data processing applications, particularly where real-time communication is critical. Initial customer response has been strong with promising design win momentum across industrial and aerospace and defense sectors. We expanded our Wi-Fi portfolio with 20 new products, spanning microcontrollers and plug-and-play modules, helping customers simplify robust secure wireless connectivity and accelerate time to market. We also introduced a new Smart Touch controller with an industry standard interface, make it simpler for manufacturers to implement water tolerant touch solutions in their products. For high-speed wired connectivity, we continue strengthening our automotive networking portfolio with ASA Motion Link technology, enabling next-generation software-defined vehicles with high-speed data exchange between systems. Our innovative technology is currently being evaluated by several leading global automotive manufacturers.\nOur FPGA portfolio achieved 2 notable milestones. We earned the highest level of space certification for our radiation hard and chips and strengthening our position in critical space missions and released a new sensor connectivity solution for NVIDIA's Holoscan platform, enabling AI applications in medical imaging and industrial automation. These developments reinforce our commitment to providing comprehensive solutions across our target markets while making it easier for customers to implement advanced capabilities in their next-generation products. demonstrating our ability to simplify advanced technological implementation for our customers.\nWith that, I will pass the call to Steve for comments about our business and guidance going forward. Steve?\n\nStephen Sanghi\n\nExecutive Chair\n\nThank you, Rich. As Eric described in his prepared remarks, our December quarter net sales were $1.026 billion, down 11.8% sequentially and down 41.9% from a year ago quarter as we continue to navigate through a very large inventory correction following a post COVID super cycle. We saw conned broad-based weakness in the December quarter. Our revenue from our microcontroller, analog, FPGA and other businesses were all down sequentially. Geographically, our business was down sequentially in all major geographies of Americas, Europe and Asia.\nNow let's get into our guidance for the March quarter. We believe substantial inventory destocking has occurred at our customers, channel partners and their downstream customers. Everyone would like me to call the last quarter as a bottom. However, in our view, the inventory at our customers, channel partners and their downstream customers has not corrected yet. Our bookings remain low although the current quarter bookings are running at a higher rate than in the December quarter. Our backlog started out lower for the March quarter than it was at the start of the December quarter. So we have a lot of turns to take for the March quarter and the visibility remains low. Taking all these factors into account, we expect our net sales for the March quarter to be between $920 million and $1 billion. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 52% and 54% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 37.7% and 40.5% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 11.5% and 16.3% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $0.05 and $0.15. We are later focused on our 9-point plan. The megatrends and customer portion of that plan entails aggressively winning designs at the customers and then pulling them through the funnel to generate growth. We believe that as the remaining excess inventory is consumed at our customers and distributors, we are well positioned to provide above-market growth in our net sales.\nNow let me provide an update on our capital return program for shareholders. We are essentially returning 100% of our adjusted free cash flow to investors in dividends right now. Due to depressed net sales, our adjusted free cash flow is currently less than our dividend. And in certain quarters, we have had to make higher bond interest payments and tax payments. Bond interest payments are made every 6 months. So every other quarter, this impacts our adjusted free cash flow and results in a dividend exceeding our adjusted free cash flow. As we begin to liberate cash from our inventory, coupled with very low capital expenditures, we expect to bring the free cash flow above the dividend in future quarters, we intend to use the excess cash to bring our borrowings back down to at least the levels they were at before our dividend exceeded our adjusted free cash flow.\nWith that, operator, will you please poll for questions."

Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our earnings press release and in the reconciliations on our website.\nNet sales in the June quarter were $1.241 billion, which was down 6.4% sequentially. We have posted a summary of our net sales by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were just below the midpoint of our guidance at 59.9%, including capacity underutilization charges of $36 million as we continue to manage production activities to adjust to the challenging business conditions.\nOperating expenses were at 28.4% of net sales and operating income was 31.5%. Non-GAAP net income was $289.9 million and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.53, which was $0.01 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance. On a GAAP basis in the June quarter, gross margins were 59.4%. Total operating expenses were $517.8 million, and included acquisition intangible amortization of $123 million, special charges of $2.6 million, share-based compensation of $37.4 million and $1.8 million of other expenses.\nGAAP net income was $129.3 million, resulting in $0.24 in earnings per diluted share. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 13% in the June quarter, which was in line with our guidance. Our non-GAAP tax rate in fiscal year '25 is expected to be about 13%, which is exclusive of the transition tax and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. We are still hopeful that the tax rules requiring companies to capitalize R&D expenses will be pushed out or repealed.\nIf this were to happen, we would anticipate about a 200 basis point favorable adjustment to Microchip's non-GAAP tax rate in future periods. Our inventory balance at June 30, 2024, was $1.308 billion, which was down $8 million from the end of the March 2024 quarter. We had 237 days of inventory at the end of the June quarter, which was up 13 days from the prior quarter's levels as a result of a lower dollar value of quarterly cost of goods sold from lower sequential revenue.\nAt the midpoint of our September 2024 quarter guidance, we would expect inventory dollars to be up modestly and days of inventory to increase. We also continue to invest in building inventory for long-lived, high-margin products whose manufacturing capacity is being end-of-life by our supply chain partners, and these last-time buys represented 19 days of inventory at the end of June. Inventory at our distributors in the June quarter was at 43 days, which was up 2 days from the prior quarter's level. Distribution took down their inventory holdings in the June quarter as distribution sell-through was about $85 million higher than distribution sell in.\nOur cash flow from operating activities was $377.1 million in the June quarter, adjusted free cash flow was $301.3 million in the June quarter. As of June 30, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $315.1 million. Our total debt increased by $179 million in the June quarter, and our net debt increased by $183.6 million. The increase in debt was impacted by our refinancing activities in the quarter which included issuing a 0.75% 6-year convertible bond, for which we paid $105 million for a 75% cap call to provide some protection from future equity dilution from stock price appreciation. Our adjusted EBITDA in the June quarter was $456.2 million and 36.8% of net sales,\nOur trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was $2.908 billion. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 2.02x as of June 30, 2024, up from 1.29x at June 30, 2023. Capital expenditures were $72.9 million in the June quarter. Our expectations for capital expenditures for fiscal year 2025 is about $175 million and is more heavily weighted in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 as we had worked with our suppliers to push out capital that was originally planned for delivery last fiscal year. Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $43 million. I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter as well as our guidance for the September quarter. Ganesh.\n\nGanesh Moorthy\n\nCEO, President & Director\n\nThank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Our June quarter results were consistent with our guidance, with net sales down 6.4% sequentially as we continue to navigate through a major inventory correction. Non-GAAP gross margin came in just under the midpoint of our guidance of 59.9%, while non-GAAP operating margin was at the midpoint of our guidance at 31.5% as we continued our strong expense control programs. .\nOur consolidated non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came in $0.01 ahead of guidance at $0.53 per share. Our sequential revenue decline resulted in June quarter adjusted EBITDA dropping. And as a result, our net leverage rose to 2.02x. We expect our net leverage to rise modestly for a few more quarters as trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA drops when replacing stronger prior year quarters with weaker current year quarters.\nHowever, our cash generation continues to be solid, and we remain committed to our capital return plan. Our capital return to shareholders in the September quarter will increase to 92.5% of our June quarter adjusted free cash flow as we continue on our path to return 100% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders by the March quarter of calendar year 2025.\nMy thanks to our worldwide team for their support, hard work and diligence as we continue to navigate a difficult environment. and focus on actions that we believe position us well to thrive in the long term. In early July, we announced our entry into the 64-bit embedded microprocessor market with a suite of products, developments to address high-performance embedded processing applications, including AI-enabled edge solutions. This extends our strong 32-bit embedded microprocessor portfolio to higher performance and increased capabilities while preserving Microchip's historically strong ecosystem of leading development tools to make adoption easy for embedded system design engineers.\nMicrochip is the only company to offer the widest embedded control and processing platform from 8 to 64 bit as well as FPGAs with a common development to ecosystem, that's empowering customers to innovate and reuse their work across a wide spectrum of markets and applications. Now for some color on the June quarter and the general business environment. All regions of the world and most of our end markets exhibited varying degrees of weakness. The exceptions were Aerospace and Defense, which was stable and the artificial intelligence subset of data centers, which continue to be strong.\nOur business in Europe and America, which are dominated by industrial and automotive markets were particularly weak on the heels of a very weak March quarter. Our broad base of customers continue to manage their inventory tightly and adjust their business plans in the midst of a weak macro environment for manufacturing, high interest rates, very short lead times and an uncertain business outlook. This combination of factors we believe is driving inventory destocking as well as reductions in target inventory levels in multiple areas.\nAt our direct customers, at contract manufacturers and distributors who buy from us at our indirect customers who buy through our distributors and in many cases, at our customers' customers. The early signs of green shoots in our business we saw in February, March and April have continued to progress, although at an uneven pace, with bookings up sequentially in some months and relatively flat sequentially in other months. Although quarterly bookings grew close to 50% in the June quarter as compared to the March quarter, overall bookings were still below where we would like to see them. Bookings, however, continue to age over a shorter period of time.\nAnd we continue to see many requests for expedites of new orders and shipment date pull-ins for previously placed orders. request for cancellations and pushouts continue to subside. Our average lead time continue to be about 8 weeks or less, while the short lead times are resulting in reduced near-term visibility as customers delay placing orders since they have high confidence that supply is readily available. We also believe short lead times during a period of business uncertainty are the best way to help customers navigate the environment successfully and improve the quality of backlog placed with us. We have adjusted our operational systems to adapt to this uncertain environment and preposition semi-finished and finished goods inventory as best as we can to accept and ship the turns orders we need this quarter. Given the severity of the down cycle, our factories around the world are continuing to run at lower utilization rates in order to help control inventory levels. Our internal capacity expansion actions remain paused.\nWe expect our capital investments in fiscal '25 and likely in fiscal '26 as well, will be low as we will use the inventory we have invested in as well as our underutilized capacity to support the next up cycle. We're also prepared for the long-term growth of our business. On the 1 hand, in partnership with our foundry and outsourced assembly and test partners. And on the other hand, for our internal factories, with the optionality of deploying capital, which we have purchased but not yet placed into service.\nWhile neither we, nor our customers know the shape of the recovery in the coming months, we do expect it to arrive advertise in all prior semiconductor cycle. And we believe we are well prepared for the things we can control to exploit whatever the market recovery looks like. On the chip stack front, we continue to work through a number of challenges with the chips office and other government departments in regards to the grants. While the investment tax credit process has been relatively straightforward, and we are greatly appreciative of this benefit. The journey to receive grants has taken much longer and been more complicated than we expected. Recall, we announced a preliminary memorandum of terms in early January 2024 and supported the completion of diligence by March.\nGiven that we align extremely well with the U.S. government's goals of shoring up semiconductor supply for national security and industrial security, it would be unfortunate if a pragmatic agreement on the conditions attached to the grants cannot be reached. We continue to persevere through the challenges by collaborating with the chip's office while remaining resolute that whatever agreement we reach must also be consistent with our business values. Before we get into our guidance, I note about the strength of our design in activity.\nAfter 2-plus years of dealing with shortages and redeploying their innovation resources towards mitigating the impact of shortages, our customers over the last year plus have returned to prioritizing their innovation projects. The result is a strong design-in pipeline for us across all end markets, mega trends and key customers. amplified by our total system solutions approach to take advantage of our broad portfolio of solutions.\nThe impact of this growing design pipeline is muted in the current environment where excess inventory gets most of the attention. and design-in activity takes time to gestate into production. But design win momentum is the engine of long-term growth that we have always focused on and which we expect will drive above-market long-term growth. Now let's get into our guidance for the September quarter. While we continue to see a number of green shoots in our business indicators, we do need turns orders within the quarter to meet our guidance, operating in a high turns environment has historically been normal for Microchip, but it's challenging to predict during abnormal times as we're in today.\nWe are, however, forecasting strong signs of growth in our data center business beyond the artificial intelligence subset after several quarters of weakness. This is effectively another green shoot. Taking all the factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, especially the very low backlog visibility we are faced with. We expect our net sales for the September quarter to be between $1.12 billion and $1.18 billion. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 58.5% and 59.5% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 30% and 31% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 27.5% and 29.5% of sales, and we expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $0.40 and $0.46.\nThis multiyear semiconductor cycle for Microchip and for the overall semiconductor industry has been like none other we had seen. It started with coveted supply and demand disruptions in the March quarter of 2020, which then continued for many months. This was followed by extreme product shortages and result in supply chain challenges later that year and for several quarters thereafter. And finally, a substantial inventory correction over the last several quarters. We recognize that on a peak to trough basis, our revenue decline has been sharper than many of our competitors. Some of this variance reflects the differences in end market exposure as this cycle has impacted different end markets at different times. Some of the variance is due to differences in noncancer gold, nonreschedulable programs. implemented by us and our competitors.\nAnd finally, some of the variance is driven by differences in the relative size of business transacted either directly or through the channel. While peak across revenue performance is relevant, we believe a better longer-term indicator is a comparison of the cumulative revenue generated through the entire cycle. Assuming the December quarter of 2019 was the last unaffected or normal quarter, Microchip's cumulative revenue over the next 19 quarters, inclusive of our guidance from -- for the September 2024 quarter when indexed to the December quarter shows very comparable performance between us and our competitors.\nThis is, of course, excluding the impact of acquisitions for everyone. The revenue peaks and trucks were different for each company. We believe for the factors that we mentioned earlier. However, when we're looking -- when looking at the cumulative 19-quarter revenue, essentially the area under the revenue curve is what that would represent. While the journey for each company was different that destination was very similar after 19 quarters. This would suggest that Microchip may be positioned for a sharper growth in the coming quarters, although we're not ready to predict the shape of that recovery at this time.\nMy point is that rather than be focused on peak the trust performance alone, it seems prudent to consider the area under the curve of cumulative revenue performance as well. We believe the fundamental characteristics of growth, profitability and cash generation of our business remain intact. We are confident that our solutions remain the engine of innovation for the application of end markets we serve. We remain committed to executing our strategic imperatives, which we believe will deliver sustained results and substantial shareholder value.\nAnd finally, at a time of macro uncertainty, we remain focused on the things we can control to create long-term shareholder value. With that, let me baton to Steve to talk more about our cash generation to shareholders. Steve?\n\nStephen Sanghi\n\nExecutive Chair\n\nThank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. I would like to provide you with a further update on our cash return strategy. The Board of Directors approved an increase in the dividend of 10.7% from the year ago quarter to a record $0.454 per share.\nDuring the last quarter, we purchased $72.7 million of our stock in the open market. We also paid out $242.6 million in dividends. Thus, the total cash return was $315.3 million. This quarter, our total cash return was reduced by the cash outlays for the recent acquisition of BSI and Euronics. When you combine the dividend buyback and acquisition-related cash outlays, this amount was 87.5% of our actual adjusted free cash flow of $389.9 million during the March 2024 quarter. Our net leverage at the end of June 2024 quarter was 2.02x.\nEver since we achieved an investment-grade rating for our debt in November 2021 and pivoted to increasing our capital return to shareholders, we have returned a total of $4.6 billion to shareholders through June 30, 2024, by a combination of dividends and share buybacks. During this period, our share buyback in the open market was approximately 31.2 million shares representing approximately 5.8% of our shares outstanding. In the current September quarter, we will use the adjusted free cash flow level from the June quarter to target the amount of cash returned to shareholders. Our adjusted free cash flow for the June quarter was $301.3 million. So our target return to shareholders would be 92.5% of that amount, minus a small payment made for acquisitions.\nOur resulting cash return to shareholders will be approximately $261 million. Out of that amount, dividends are expected to be approximately $243.8 million and our expected stock buyback will be approximately $17.2 million. Going forward, we plan to continue to increase our adjusted free cash flow return to shareholders by 500 basis points every quarter until we reach 100% of our adjusted free cash flow returned to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. That will take 2 more quarters and we expect that dividend over the long run will represent approximately 50% of our cash returned. We also announced today that effective at the close of business on August 20, which is the date of our Annual Shareholders' Meeting, I will transition from Executive Chair to being the Non-Executive Chair of the Board. In this role, I will continue to be a resource to Ganesh and to all of Microchip. I want to thank our investors and our employees. It was my highest honor to have served you for 30 [indiscernible]. Let me now turn it back to Ganesh.\n\nGanesh Moorthy\n\nCEO, President & Director\n\nThank you, Steve. On behalf of the Microchip leadership team and all of our employees worldwide. Thank you so much on the bottom of our hearts. We have 34 years of service to Microchip. In your Nonexecutive Chair role, you will continue to be an important resource for me personally and for other Microchip team members as well.\nWith that, Stacy, will you please pull for questions?"

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, CFO, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nJames Eric Bjornholt\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Microchip Technology, Inc.\n\nOkay. Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.\nIn attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and CEO; Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Executive Chair; and Sajid Daudi, Microchip's Head of Investor Relations. I will comment on our third quarter fiscal year 2024 financial performance. Ganesh will then provide commentary on our results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. and Steve will provide an update on our cash return strategy. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.\nWe are including information in our press release and on this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, and included reconciliation information in our earnings press release which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our earnings press release and in the reconciliations on our website.\nNet sales in the December quarter were $1.766 billion, which was down 21.7% sequentially. We have posted a summary of our net sales by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 63.8%, operating expenses were 22.5% and operating income was 41.2%. Non-GAAP net income was $592.7 million and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $1.08. On a GAAP basis, in the December quarter, gross margins were 63.4%.\nTotal operating expenses were $590.6 million and included acquisition and tangible amortization of $151.3 million, special charges of $1.1 million, share-based compensation of $38.8 million and $1.5 million of other expenses. GAAP net income was $419.2 million, resulting in $0.77 in earnings per diluted share. The GAAP tax rate was favorably impacted from an IRS notice that clarified the treatment of costs incurred by a research provider under contract that we had been accruing for and that accrual was released in the quarter.\nOur non-GAAP cash tax rate was 13.2% in the December quarter. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal year 2024 is expected to be just under 14% and which is exclusive of the transition tax and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. Our fiscal '24 cash tax rate is higher than our fiscal '23 tax rate was for a variety of factors, including lower availability of tax attributes, such as net operating losses and tax credits lower tax depreciation with our expectation for lower capital expenditures in the U.S. in fiscal '24 as well as the impact of current tax rules requiring the capitalization of R&D expenses for tax purposes.\nWe are still hopeful that the tax rules requiring companies to capitalize R&D expenses will be pushed out or repealed. The House actually passed the tax bill last night that would achieve this, and we will see how this progresses through the Senate. If this were to happen, we would anticipate about a 200 basis points favorable adjustment to Microchip's non-GAAP tax rate in future periods.\nOur inventory balance at December 31, 2023, was $1.31 billion. We had 185 days of inventory at the end of the December quarter, which was up 18 days from the prior quarter's level. Although we reduced inventory dollars in the quarter, we were not able to make as much progress as we would have liked, as we continue to accommodate requests by customers to push out delivery schedules for products that were very far through the manufacturing process. At the midpoint of our March 2024 quarter guidance, we would expect inventory dollars to be up modestly and days of inventory to be in the range of 225 to 230 days due to the significant reduction in revenue and cost of goods sold.\nWe also continue to invest in building inventory for long-lived, high-margin products whose manufacturing capacity is being end of life by our supply chain partners and these last time buys represented 10 days of inventory at the end of December. Inventory at our distributors in the December quarter were 37 days, which was up 2 days from the prior quarter's level.\nOur cash flow from operating activities was $853.3 million in the December quarter. Included in our cash flow from operating activities was $30.4 million of long-term supply assurance receipts from customers. We have adjusted these items out of our free cash flow to determine the adjusted free cash flow that we will return to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, as these supply assurance payments will be refundable over time as purchase commitments are fulfilled. Our adjusted free cash flow was $763.4 million in the December quarter. As of December 31, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $281 million.\nOur total debt decreased by $392 million in the December quarter, our net debt decreased by $416.4 million in the quarter. Over the last 22 full quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down $7.1 billion of the debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash beyond dividends and stock buyback to bring down this debt.\nOur adjusted EBITDA in the December quarter was $796.2 million and 45.1% of net sales. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was $4.26 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.27x at December 31, 2023, down from 1.56x at December 31, 2022. Capital expenditures were $59.5 million in the December quarter. Our expectation for capital expenditures for fiscal year 2024 is between $300 million and $310 million which is down from the $300 million to $325 million we shared with investors last quarter as we are delaying certain capital given the more challenging economic backdrop.\nWe expect that our capital investments will continue to provide us increased control over our production during periods of industry-wide constraints. Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $47.1 million. I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter as well as our guidance for the March quarter. Ganesh?\n\nGanesh Moorthy\n\nCEO, President & Director\n\nThank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Our December quarter results were disappointing and below our expectations with net sales down 21.7% sequentially and down 18.6% from the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP gross and operating margins came in at 63.8% and 41.2%, respectively, down from our recent strong performance, but somewhat resilient despite the significant sequential decline in revenue. Our consolidated non-GAAP diluted EPS came in at $1.08 per share, down 30.8% from the year ago quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA was 45.1% of net sales in the December quarter, continuing to demonstrate some resiliency. As a result, we had good debt reduction in the December quarter and despite the lower adjusted EBITDA we generated, our net leverage ticked down to 1.27x. However, we expect our net leverage ratio to rise for a few quarters, as trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA drops when replacing stronger prior year quarters with weaker ones. Our capital return to shareholders in the March quarter will increase to 82.5% of our December quarter adjusted free cash flow as we continue on our path to return 100% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders by the March quarter of calendar year 2025.\nMy thanks to our worldwide team for their support, hard work and diligence as we navigated a difficult environment and focus on what we could control so that we are well positioned to thrive in the long term.\nTaking a look at our December quarter net sales from a product line perspective, our Mixed Signal Microcontroller net sales were down 22.3% sequentially and down 18.5% on a year-over-year basis. And our Analog net sales were down 30.9% sequentially and down 29% on a year-over-year basis.\nNow for some color on the December quarter. and the general business environment. All regions of the world and most of our end markets were weak. Our business was weaker than we expected as our customers continue to respond to the effects of increasing business uncertainty, slowing economic activity and a resultant increase in their inventory. In addition, many customers implemented extended shutdowns of closures at the end of the December quarter as they manage their operational activities.\nWe continue to receive requests to push out or cancel backlog as customers sought to rebalance their inventory in light of the weaker business conditions and the increased uncertainty that we're experiencing. And we were able to push out or cancel backlog to help many customers with these inventory positions.\nWith no major supply constraints, coupled with very short lead times and a weak macro environment, we believe that is inventory destocking underway at multiple levels at our direct customers and distributors who buy from us, our indirect customers who buy through our distributors and in some cases, our customers' customers. The very strong up cycle of the last 2 to 3 years drove many of our customers to build inventory in order to be able to capitalize on strong business conditions in an uncertain supply environment. The term, \"just in case\", instead of \"just in time,\" was used by customers to express their approach to these conditions. But as the macro environment slowed, many of our customers found their business expectations to be too optimistic and ended up with high levels of inventory. And as a result, they sought to cancel or reschedule backlog.\nAn update on our PSP program. During the early stages of the up cycle, we launched our PSD program requiring noncancelable backlog in exchange for supply priority in a hyper constrained supply environment. The program was aimed to discourage speculative demand and achieve mutual commitments between our customers and us usual demand. for future demand. The program worked extremely well for many customers who participated during all of 2021 and 2022 as well as the early part of 2023, supporting strong growth in their businesses. However, the business challenges, which led to the creation of the PSP program are no longer relevant, and we have, therefore, decided to discontinue the program effective today. If business conditions warranted we may at some point in the future, initiate a similar program, which will, of course, have to be adapted to whatever that situation requires.\nReflecting the slowing macro environment, our distribution inventory grew to 37 days at the end of the December quarter, as compared to 35 days at the end of the September quarter. We are working with our distribution partners to find the right balance of inventory required to serve their customers, manage their cash flow requirements and be positioned for the eventual strengthening of business conditions.\nOur internal capacity expansion actions remain paused. Given the severity of the down cycle, our factories around the world will be running at lower utilization rates and also taking up to 2 shutdown weeks in each of the March and June quarters in order to help control the growth of inventory. We expect our capital investments in fiscal year '24 and fiscal year '25 will be low even as we prepare for the long-term growth of our business.\nTo that end, we reached a preliminary memorandum of terms with the Department of Commerce for $162 million in grants targeted at existing projects for 2 of our U.S. fabs. These grants are subject to diligence by the chip's office as well as capacity investments by Microchip over multiple years. We have been driving our lead times down and have reduced average lead times from roughly 52 weeks at the start of 2023 to roughly 8 weeks by the end of 2023 on average.\nDuring a period of macro weakness and business uncertainty, we believe short lead times are the best way to help customers navigate the environment successfully and improve the quality of backlog placed with us as it enables our customers and Microchip to engage an uncertain environment with more agility and effectiveness. However, a significant reduction in lead times is also resulting in lower bookings and reduced near-term visibility for our business.\nWe're also taking steps to reduce our expenses. In addition to the variable compensation programs, which provide automatic reductions during a down cycle and normal containment of discretionary expenses, we will be implementing broad-based paid reductions. Our team members who are not a part of the factory shutdowns will take a 10% take-up. And consistent with our normal practice, the executive team will take the largest reduction with a 20% pay cut.\nThe shutdowns for manufacturing team members and pay cuts for nonmanufacturing team members are consistent with our long-standing culture of shared sacrifices and down cycles and shared rewards and up cycles. That's avoiding layoffs, and in the process protecting manufacturing capability as well as high priority projects, which are important for our customers and us to thrive in the long term. We took similar actions in prior periods of business uncertainty such as the COVID pandemic in 2020 and the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, and we believe such actions were quite effective to navigate our business.\nNow let's get into our guidance for the March quarter. As our customers take further actions to adjust to a weakening macro environment and uncertain business conditions, we are continuing to support customers and channel partners with inventory position to push out or cancel their backlog. We recognize that our short lead times and increased flexibility with backlog will result in customers reducing inventory aggressively, and that this could result in some degree of overcorrection. However, in response to these conditions, we are continuing to work with our customers to absorb as much of the inventory correction as we can at this time.\nTaking all the factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, we expect our net sales for the March quarter to be between $1.225 billion and $1.425 billion. The guidance range is larger than normal to reflect the macro uncertainty and the resultant low business visibility. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 59% and 61.6% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 26.9% and 30.7% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 28.3% and 34.7% of sales and we expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $0.46 and $0.68.\nTo keep things in perspective, while our business results have degraded significantly over the last 2 quarters, as a larger-than-normal inventory correction has played out. Our full fiscal year '24 revenue decline at the midpoint of the March quarter guidance is expected to be roughly 9.5% and comparing favorably with weakness that other industry players have experienced. Our non-GAAP operating margin for full fiscal year '24 at the midpoint of our March quarter guidance is expected to be 43.6% and continuing to be among the best results across other companies in our industry. While we don't know how and when the inevitable up cycle will play out, we believe the fundamental characteristics of our business remain intact.\nFinally, notwithstanding any near-term macro weakness, we are confident that our solutions remain the engine of innovation for the applications and end markets we serve. Our focus on total system solutions and key market megatrends continue to fuel strong design win momentum, which we expect will drive above-market long-term growth.\nWith that, let me pass the baton to Steve to talk more about our cash return to shareholders. Steve?\n\nStephen Sanghi\n\nExecutive Chair\n\nThank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. I would like to provide you with a further update on our cash return strategy. The Board of Directors announced an increase in the dividend of 25.7% from the year ago quarter to $0.45 per share. During the last quarter, we purchased $114.6 million of our stock in the open market. We also paid out $237.4 million in dividends. Thus, the total cash return was $352 million. This amount was 77.5% of our actual adjusted free cash flow of $454.3 million during the September 2023 quarter. Our net leverage at the end of December 2023 quarter was 1.27x.\nEver since we achieved an investment-grade rating for our debt in November 2021 and pivoted to increasing our capital return to shareholders, we have returned $3.6 billion to shareholders through December 31, 2023 by a combination of dividends and share buybacks. During this time, we have bought back approximately 26 million shares of our common stock from the open market, representing approximately 4.5% of our shares outstanding.\nIn the current March quarter, we will use the adjusted free cash flow from the December quarter to target the amount of cash returned to shareholders. The adjusted free cash flow excludes a net $30.4 million that we collected from our customers for long-term supply assurance payments. These payments are refundable when purchase commitments are fulfilled. The adjusted free cash flow for the December quarter was $763.4 million. We plan to return 82.5% or $629.8 million of that amount to our shareholders with the dividend expected to be approximately $243 million and the stock buyback expected to be approximately $386.8 million, which will be a new quarterly record for stock buyback since we initiated our enhanced capital return strategy.\nGoing forward, we plan to continue to increase our adjusted free cash flow returned to shareholders by 500 basis points every quarter until we reach 100% of adjusted free cash flow returned to shareholders. That will take 4 more quarters and we expect that dividends over time will represent approximately 50% of our cash returned.\nWith that, operator, will you please poll for questions?"

Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our earnings press release and the reconciliations on our website.\nNet sales in the September quarter were $2.254 billion, which were down 1.5% sequentially. We have posted a summary of our net sales by product line and geography on our website for your reference.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 68.1%, operating expenses were at 20% and operating income was a record 48.1%. Non-GAAP net income was $889.3 million and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $1.62.\nOn a GAAP basis in the September quarter, gross margins were 67.8%, total operating expenses were $642.4 million, and included acquisition intangible amortization of $151.4 million, special charges of $1.8 million, share-based compensation of $38 million and $1.1 million of other expenses.\nGAAP net income was a record $666.6 million, resulting in a record $1.21 in earnings per diluted share. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 14.2% in the September quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal year 2024 is expected to be about 14.2%, which is exclusive of the transition tax and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years.\nOur fiscal '24 cash tax rate is expected to be higher than our fiscal '23 tax rate for a variety of factors, including lower availability of tax attributes, such as net operating losses and tax credits, lower depreciation with our expectation for lower capital expenditures in the U.S. in fiscal '24, as well as the impact of current tax rules requiring the capitalization of R&D expenses for tax purposes.\nWe are still hopeful that the tax rules requiring companies to capitalize R&D expenses will be pushed out or repeal. If this were to happen, we would anticipate about a 200 basis point favorable adjustment to Microchip's non-GAAP tax rate in future periods.\nOur inventory balance at September 30, 2023, was $1.331 billion. We had 167 days of inventory at the end of the September quarter, which was flat to the prior quarter's level. Although we reduced inventory dollars in the quarter, we were not able to make as much progress as we would have liked, as we continue to accommodate requests by customers to push out delivery schedules for products that were very far through the manufacturing process.\nWe also continue to invest in building inventory for long-lived, high-margin products whose manufacturing capacity is being end of life by our supply chain partners, and these last-time buys represented 10 days of inventory at the end of September.\nWe expect dollars of inventory on our balance sheet to reduce in the December quarter. Inventory at our distributors in the September quarter was at 35 days, which was up 6 days from the prior quarter's level.\nOur cash flow from operating activities was $616.2 million in the September quarter. Included in our cash flow from operating activities was $87.5 million of long-term supply assurance receipts from customers. We have adjusted these items out of our free cash flow to determine the adjusted free cash flow that we will return to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, as these supply assurance payments will be refundable over time as purchase commitments are fulfilled.\nOur adjusted free cash flow was $454.3 million in the September quarter. As of September 30, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $256.6 million. Our total debt increased by $45.6 million in the September quarter, and our net debt was up by $60.2 million.\nOver the last 21 full quarters since we closed the [ Microsemi ] acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down $6.72 billion of the debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash beyond dividends and stock buyback to bring down this debt.\nIn the September quarter, we issued a $750 million Term Loan A and retired $1 billion in bonds that matured on September 1, 2023, with the Term Loan A and proceeds from our line of credit. We also issued $1 billion of commercial paper during the September quarter, taking advantage of about a 90 basis point lower interest rate on the commercial paper compared to our line of credit rate.\nOur line of credit had $39 million of borrowings against it at September 30, 2023. During the September quarter, we also retired $18.2 million of total principal amount of our 2027 convertible bonds for a total cash payment of $42.7 million. The amount paid above the principal amount essentially works like a synthetic stock buyback, reducing any current and future share count dilution that could result if these convertible bonds were ever converted into shares.\nThe $24.5 million we paid above the par value for the convertible bonds was in addition to our normal share buyback activity that we executed during the quarter, resulting in an additional reduction in the diluted share count outstanding.\nOur adjusted EBITDA in the September quarter was $1.152 billion and 51.1% of net sales. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was a record at $4.57 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.28 at September 30, 2023, down from 1.84 at September 30, 2022.\nCapital expenditures were $74.4 million in the September quarter. Our expectation for capital expenditures for fiscal year 2024 is between $300 million and $325 million, which is down from the $300 million to $350 million we shared with investors last quarter, as we are delaying certain capital given the more challenging economic backdrop.\nWe expect that our capital investments will continue to provide us with increased control over our production during periods of industry-wide constraints. Depreciation expense in the September quarter was $47 million.\nI will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the September quarter as well as our guidance for the December quarter. Ganesh?\n\nGanesh Moorthy\n\nCEO, President & Director\n\nThank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Our September quarter results were about as we expected, with net sales coming in just under the midpoint of our guidance and well within our guidance range.\nNet sales were down 1.5% sequentially and up 8.7% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP gross and operating margins remained strong at 68.1% and 48.1%, respectively. Our consolidated non-GAAP diluted EPS was at the midpoint of our guidance at $1.62 per share, up 11% from the year ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was 51.1% of net sales, and adjusted free cash flow was 20.2% of net sales in the September quarter, continuing to demonstrate the strong cash generation characteristics of our business.\nOur net leverage exiting September dropped to 1.28x. We had higher cash flow outflows in the September quarter compared to the June quarter, due to the timing of tax payments and because of record capital return to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases totaling $562.6 million. This is 61% higher than the capital returned to shareholders in the June quarter.\nOur capital return to shareholders in the December quarter will increase to 77.5% of our September quarter adjusted free cash flow. As we continue on our path, [indiscernible] down 100% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders by the March quarter calendar year 2025.\nMy thanks to all our stakeholders, who enabled us to achieve these results despite the increasingly challenging macro environment and especially to the worldwide Microchip team, whose effort and engagement enables us to navigate effectively through the business cycles.\nTaking a look at our [ first ] September quarter net sales from a product line and geographic perspective. Our mixed signal [ Microcontroller ] net sales were down 1.7% sequentially and up 8.5% on a year-over-year basis.\nOur Analog product line, net sales were down 1.7% sequentially and up 8.8% on a year-over-year basis. On a sequential revenue basis, Asia was down, Europe was about flat and the Americas was slightly up.\nNow for some color on the September quarter. Our business slowed down as expected, as our customers continue to respond to the effects of increasing business uncertainty, slowing economic activity and a result in increase in inventory. The combined effects of persistent inflation and high interest rates, we believe, are contributing to the weak macro environment.\nAll regions of the world and most end markets experienced varying degrees of weakness. We continue to receive requests to push out or cancel backlog, as customers start to rebalance their inventory in light of the weaker business conditions and increased uncertainty they were experiencing. And we were able to push out meaningful amounts of backlog to later quarters to help many customers with inventory positions. We are seeing customers continue to adjust the demand expectations as they derisk the inventory position whenever possible.\nOur experience from prior cycles is that at this stage of the cycle, customers tend to overcorrect their inventory and backlog due to their business uncertainty, combined with the availability of product with very short lead times. This is, in effect, the flip side of what we saw during 2021 and 2022, when demand was historically strong and seemingly insatiable.\nReflecting the slow macro environment, our channel inventory grew [ to ] 35 days. We are working with our channel partners to find the right balance of inventory required to serve customers, as well as to be positioned for the eventual strengthening of business conditions.\nMost of our internal capacity expansion actions remain paused, and we expect this will result in lower capital investments in fiscal year '24 and fiscal year '25, even as we prepare for the expected robust long-term growth of our business.\nIn the meanwhile, we have been driving our lead times down and have reduced average lead times from approximately 52 weeks at the start of 2023 to approximately 26 weeks at the end of June, and exited the September quarter at approximately 13 weeks. We expect to continue to drive average lead times down further, to less than 8 weeks by the end of 2023.\nDuring a period of macro weakness and business uncertainty, we believe short lead times are the best way to help customers navigate the environment successfully and improve the quality of backlog placed on us, as it enables our customers and Microchip to engage an uncertain environment with more agility and effectiveness. However, the significant reduction in lead times is also resulting in lower bookings and reduced near-term visibility.\nNow let's get into the guidance for the December quarter. As our customers take further actions to adjust to a weakening macro environment and uncertain business conditions, we are continuing to support customers and channel partners with inventory positions to push out their backlog.\nTaking all the factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, we expect our net sales for the December quarter to be between down 15% and down 20% sequentially. At the midpoint of our net sales guidance for the December quarter, our year-over-year decline for the quarter would be 14.3%.\nWe expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 64% and 65% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 22.7% and 23.3% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 40.7% and 42.3% of sales, and we expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $1.09 and $1.17 per share.\nGiven the current macro weakness and resultant business uncertainty, combined with our lower bookings and reduce near-term visibility, we anticipate that our March quarter revenue is likely to decline again sequentially, although to a lesser extent than the December quarter decline.\nNotwithstanding any near-term macro weakness, we are confident that semiconductors remain the engine of innovation for the applications and markets we serve. Our focus on total system solutions and key market megatrends is fueling strong design win momentum that we expect will drive above-market long-term growth.\nIf you review Microchip's speak to crop performance on a trailing 12-month basis, through the business cycles over the last 15-plus years, which is included in the investor presentation posted on our website, you will observe our consistent and resilient cash generation gross margin and operating margin results. We remain confident that our non-GAAP operating margins on a trailing 12-month basis should remain above 40% through the business cycles.\nWith that, let me pass the baton to Steve to talk more about our cash return to shareholders.\n\nStephen Sanghi\n\nExecutive Chair\n\nThank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. I would like to provide you with a further update on our cash return strategy.\nThe Board of Directors announced an increase in the dividend of 33.8% from the year ago quarter to $0.439 per share. During the last quarter, we purchased $339.8 million of our stock in the open market. We also paid out $222.8 million in dividends. Thus, the total cash return was a record $562.6 million. This amount was 72.5% of our actual adjusted free cash flow of $776 million during the June 2023 quarter. Our net leverage at the end of September 2023 quarter was 1.28x.\nEver since we achieved an investment-grade rating for our debt in November 2021 and pivoted to increasing our capital return to shareholders, we have returned $3.248 billion to shareholders in September 30, 2023, by a combination of dividends and buybacks.\nIn the current December quarter, we will use the adjusted free cash flow from the September quarter [ to ] target the amount of cash returned to shareholders. The adjusted free cash flow excludes a net $87.5 million that we collected from our customers for long-term supply assurance payments. These payments are refundable when first [ 2 ] commitments are fulfilled. The adjusted free cash flow for the September quarter was [ $454.3 ] million. We plan to return 77.5% or $352.1 million of that amount to our shareholders with the dividend expected to be approximately $237.5 million and the stock buyback expected to be approximately $114.6 million.\nGoing forward, we plan to continue to increase free cash flow return to shareholders by 500 basis points every quarter until we reach 100% of adjusted free cash flow returned to shareholders. That will take 5 more quarters and dividends over time, we expect will represent approximately 50% of our cash returned.\nWith that, operator, will you please poll for questions?"

I will now turn the call over to today's host, Eric Bjornholt, Chief Financial Officer of Microchip. You may begin.\n\nJames Eric Bjornholt\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Microchip Technology, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, everybody. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.\nIn attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and CEO; Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Executive Chair; and Sajid Daudi, Microchip's Head of Investor Relations. I will comment on our first quarter fiscal year 2024 financial performance. Ganesh will then provide commentary on our results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance, and Steve will provide an update on our cash return strategy. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.\nWe are including information in our press release and on this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, and included reconciliation information in our earnings press release, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website. I will now go through some of our operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our earnings press release and in the reconciliation on our website.\nNet sales in the June quarter were $2.89 billion, which was up 2.5% sequentially. We have posted a summary of our net sales by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record at 68.4%. Operating expenses were at 20.3% and operating income was a record 48.1%. Non-GAAP net income was $905.3 million and non-GAAP earnings per share on a diluted basis was a record $1.64. On a GAAP basis in the June quarter, gross margins were a record at 68.1%. Total operating expenses were $655.3 million and included acquisition intangible amortization of $151.5 million, special charges of $1.7 million, share-based compensation of $37.7 million and a benefit of $0.4 million for other matters. GAAP net income was a record $666.4 million resulting in a record $1.21 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 14.2% in the June quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal year 2024 is expected to be about 14% and which is exclusive of the transition tax and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years.\nOur fiscal '20 forecast tax rate is expected to be higher than our fiscal '23 tax rate for a variety of factors including lower availability of tax attributes such as nonoperating losses, tax credits, lower tax depreciation and our expectation for lower capital expenditures in the U.S. in fiscal '24 and as well as the impact of current tax rules requiring the capitalization of R&D expenses for tax purposes. We are still hopeful that the tax rules requiring companies to capitalize R&D expenses will be pushed out or repealed. If that were to happen, we would anticipate about a 200 basis point favorable adjustment to Microchip's non-GAAP tax rate in future periods. Our inventory balance at June 30, 2023, was $1.336 billion. We had 167 days of inventory at the end of the June quarter, which was down 2 days from the prior quarter's level. Although we reduced inventory day order, we were not able to make as much progress as we would have liked to as we accommodated requests by customers to push out delivery schedules for products that were very far through the manufacturing process.\nWe also continue to invest in building inventory for products with long life and high margins, whose manufacturing capacity is being end of life by our supply chain partners and these last-time buys represented 8 days of inventory at the end of June. We expect dollars and days of inventory on our balance sheet to reduce in the September quarter. Inventory at our distributors in the March quarter -- excuse me, in the June quarter was at 29 days, which was up 5 days from the prior quarter's level. Compared to our other regions, inventory at our Asia distributors grew the most in the quarter as sell-through activity was down significantly on a sequential basis in this region, heavily driven by unfavorable business conditions in China. Our cash flow from operating activities was $993.2 million in the June quarter Included in our cash flow from operating activities was $106.1 million of long-term supply assurance receipts from customers. We have adjusted these items out of our free cash flow to determine the adjusted free cash flow that we will return to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases as these supply assurance payments will be refundable over time as purchase commitments are fulfilled.\nOur adjusted free cash flow was $776 million in the June quarter. As of June 30, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $271.2 million. We paid down $413 million of total debt in the June quarter, and our net debt was reduced by $450.2 million. Over the last 24 quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down $6.76 billion of debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash beyond dividends and stock buybacks to bring down this debt. In the June quarter, we retired $1 billion in bonds that matured using our line of credit to do so. Our line of credit had $725 million of borrowings against it at June 30, 2023. And after paying off the $1 billion in bonds. During the June quarter, we also retired $38 million of total principal amount of our 2025, 2027 and 2037 convertible bonds for a total cash payment of $90.1 million. The amount paid above the principal amount essentially works like a synthetic stock buyback reducing any current and future share count dilution that will result if these convertible bonds were ever converted into shares. The over $50 million we paid above the par value for the convertible bonds was in addition to our normal share buyback activity that we executed during the quarter, resulting in an additional reduction in the diluted shares outstanding.\nOur adjusted EBITDA in the June quarter was a record at $1.172 billion and 51.2% of net sales. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was also a record at $4.473 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was $1.29 at June 30, 2023, down from $1.45 at March 31, 2023, and down from $2.05 at June 30, 2022. The Capital expenditures were $111.1 million in the June quarter. Our expectation for capital expenditures for fiscal year 2024 is between $300 million and $400 million as we still have a lot of equipment that was ordered with long lead times that we will be receiving over the next year. We expect that our capital investments will continue to provide us with increased control over our production during periods of industry-wide constraints. Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $50.5 million, I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter as well as our guidance for the September quarter. Ganesh?\n\nGanesh Moorthy\n\nCEO, President & Director\n\nThank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Our June quarter results were strong in the context of a slowing macro environment, marked by our continued disciplined execution as well as our resilient end markets and diversified customer base. Net sales grew 2.5% sequentially at 16.6% on a year-over-year basis to achieve another all-time record of $2.29 billion. The June quarter represented our 11th consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth. Non-GAAP gross and operating margins were both records at 68.4% and 48.1%, respectively. Our consolidated non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.64 per share another record by a whisker and up 19.7% from the year ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was a record 51.2% of net sales and adjusted free cash flow was 33.9% of net sales in the June quarter, continuing to demonstrate the robust cash generation characteristics of our business. Our net leverage exiting June dropped to 1.29x. We returned $349.2 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases in the June quarter, representing 67.5% of our March quarter adjusted free cash flow.\nOur capital return to shareholders in the September quarter will increase to 72.5% of our June quarter adjusted free cash flow as we continue on our path to return 100% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders by the March quarter of calendar year 2025. My profuse thanks to all our stakeholders who enabled us to achieve these outstanding results despite the increasingly challenging macro environment. and especially to the worldwide Microchip team, whose tireless efforts and agility to adapt are what enable us to navigate effectively through the business cycles. Taking a look at our June quarter net sales from a product line perspective. our mixed-signal microcontroller net sales set another all-time record, coming in sequentially up 0.8% in the June quarter and up 22.5% on a year-over-year basis. Our analog net sales also set another all-time record, coming in sequentially up 2.5% in the June quarter and up 9.2% on a year-over-year basis. Our FPGA net sales which we comment on from time to time, had another record quarter with annualized revenue growth continuing to be in the double digits. Now for some color on the June quarter. While our overall business remains steady, our customers continue to feel the effects of slowing economic activity and increasing business uncertainty.\nStarting in early June, we saw business conditions deteriorate in 3 areas. First, our China business was much weaker than our expectations and has not recovered from the shutdowns of last year and the Lunar New Year holidays in the March quarter. This manifested in weak sell-through activity and the building of inventory in the distribution channel in China. Second, we started to see initial signs of weakness and uncertainty in the automotive and industrial segments, reflecting the impact of high inflation and high interest rates driving more cautious spending. And third, we are seeing early signs of an impending slowdown in Europe exacerbated by some of our European customers being dependent on exports to countries like China whereas we noted the business environment is much weaker than expected. As a result, we continue to receive requests to push out our canceled backlog as customers sought to rebalance their inventory in light of the weaker business conditions and increased uncertainty they were experiencing.\nWe were able to push out meaningful amounts of nonreschedulable backlog to later quarters to help many customers with inventory positions. While the rate of cancellation and pushout requests appears to be stabilizing, we expect request to push out or cancel backlog will likely be with us through the rest of calendar 2023 as customers adjust to the new demand environment, and attempt to derisk their inventory position commensurately. We are also seeing an increase in direct and indirect impact from the cumulative effect of U.S. export control actions, especially in China. These actions were less of an issue over the last few quarters when demand was significantly higher than supply, but are more of an issue now as demand and supply come more into balance. Despite all the factors mentioned so far, in the June quarter, we were able to reverse the growth in days of inventory on our balance sheet with inventory dropping by 2 days to 167 days of which 8 days of inventory were from an investment and last-time buys of high-margin, long-life products whose manufacturing capacity was being end-of-life by our supply chain.\nReflecting the slowing macro environment, especially in China, our channel inventory grew by 5 days to 29 days. We continue to take actions to further reduce the days of inventory on our balance sheet while maintaining absorption in our internal wafer fabrication factories. We're also working with our channel partners to find the right balance of inventory required to serve customers and to be positioned for an eventual strengthening of business conditions. Finally, while our overall inventory is still a bit higher than our target, we made excellent progress to position our inventory at the best locations in manufacturing to be able to rapidly respond to demand growth when the macro environment strengthens. Consistent with the slowing macro environment and the higher than target level of inventory on our balance sheet as well as with some of our customers and channel partners, most of our internal factory expansion actions remain paused. This we expect will result in lower capital investments in fiscal year '24 and fiscal year '25. During a period of macro weakness and business uncertainty, we believe shorter lead times are the best way to help customers navigate the environment successfully and improve the quality of backlog placed on us.\nWe have been able to reduce average lead time from roughly 52 weeks at the start of 2023 and to roughly 26 weeks by the end of the June quarter, and we expect to continue to drive lead times down further in the coming months. We have heard concerns from some of the investment community about falling lead times because it results in lower backlog. While this is often true, we believe the level of backlog does not equate to true end market consumption. And in the final analysis, shorter lead times enable our customers and Microchip to navigate an uncertain environment with agility and more effectively.\nNow let's get into the guidance for the September quarter. Although our backlog for the September quarter is strong, -- we are continuing to take active steps to help customers with inventory positions to push out their backlog. Taking all the factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, we expect our net sales for the September quarter to be between up 1% and and down 3% sequentially. At the midpoint of our net sales guidance for the September quarter, our year-over-year growth for the quarter would be 9.3%. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 68.3% and 68.5% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 20.1% and 20.5% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 47.8% and 48.4% of sales. And we expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $1.60 and $1.64. At the midpoint of our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance, our year-over-year growth for the September quarter would be 11% despite a much higher tax rate than the year ago quarter. As supply and demand come into balance, we expect normal seasonality to return to our business. Historically, the December quarter has been our seasonally weakest quarter.\nThis year, we expect that our normal seasonality in the December quarter will likely be amplified by the macro weakness and business uncertainty that our customers are experiencing. As a result, we anticipate further business headwinds in the December quarter. However, notwithstanding any near-term macro weakness, we are confident that semiconductors remain the engine of innovation for the markets and applications we serve. Our focus on total system solutions and key market megatrends continues to fuel strong design win momentum, which we expect will drive above-market long-term growth. Finally, as you can see from our June quarter results and our September quarter guidance, our Microchip 3.0 strategy, which we launched 21 months ago, continues to be the foundation of our results as we continue to build and improve what we believe is 1 of the most diversified, defensible, high growth, high margin, high cash generating businesses in the semiconductor industry. However, we recognize that we operate in a cyclical industry and that we're not immune to the business cycle.\nIf you review Microchip's peak to trough performance through the business cycles over the last 15-plus years, which is included in the investor presentation posted on our website, you will observe our robust and consistent cash generation gross margin and operating margin results. Although we don't know what exactly the future holds. If we were to experience a semiconductor inventory correction, like what the industry has seen in the past, we are highly confident that our non-GAAP operating margins will remain well above 40%, and we expect our cash generation non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating margin to once again demonstrate consistency and resiliency through the cycle. And with that, let me pass the baton to Steve to talk more about our cash return to shareholders. Steve?\n\nStephen Sanghi\n\nExecutive Chair\n\nThank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. I would like to reflect on our financial results announced today and provide you further updates on our cash strategy. Reflecting on our financial results, I continue to be very proud of all employees of Microchip, that have delivered another exceptional quarter while making new records in many respects, namely record net sales, record non-GAAP gross margin percentage record non-GAAP operating margin percentage, record non-GAAP EPS and record adjusted EBITDA, and all of that in a continuing challenging environment. The Board of Directors announced an increase in the dividend of 36.2% from the year ago quarter to $0.41 per share. During the last quarter, we purchased $140.3 million of our stock in the open market. We also paid out $208.9 million in dividends Thus, the total cash return was $349.2 million. This amount was 67.5% of our actual adjusted free cash flow of $517.3 million during the March 2023 quarter. Our paydown of debt as well as record adjusted EBITDA drove down our net leverage at the end of June 2023 quarter to 1.29x from 2.05x at the end of June 2022.\nEver since we achieved an investment-grade rating for our debt in November 2021 and pivoted to increasing our capital return to shareholders, we have returned $2.686 billion to shareholders through June 30, 2023, by a combination of dividends and stock buybacks. In the current September quarter, we will use the adjusted free cash flow from the June quarter to target the cash returned to shareholders. The adjusted free cash flow excludes a net $10.1 million that we collected from our customers for long-term supply assurance payments. These payments are refundable when purchase commitments are fulfilled. The adjusted free cash flow for the June quarter was $776 million. We plan to return 72.5% of or $562.6 million of that amount to our shareholders with the dividend expected to be approximately $223 million and the stock buyback to be approximately $339.6 million. Going forward, we plan to continue to increase free cash flow return to shareholders by 500 basis points every quarter until we reach 100% of adjusted free cash flow returned to shareholders. This will take 6 more quarters and dividends over time we expect will represent -- approximately 50% of our cash returned. With that, operator, will you please poll for questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Eric Bjornholt, Senior Vice President and CFO. Thank you. Eric, you may begin.\n\nJames Eric Bjornholt\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Microchip Technology, Inc.\n\nThank you, and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.\nIn attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and CEO; Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Executive Chair; Rich Simoncic, Microchip's COO; and Sajid Daudi, Microchip's Head of Investor Relations. I will comment on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2024 financial performance, Ganesh will then provide commentary on our results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance, and Steve will provide an update on our cash return strategy. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.\nWe are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, and included reconciliation information in our earnings press release, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results.\nWe have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our earnings press release and in the reconciliation of the\nNet sales in the March quarter were $1.326 billion, which was down 24.9% sequentially. We have posted a summary of our net sales by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 60.3%, including capacity underutilization charges of $32 million, operating expenses were at 27.4% and operating income was 32.9%. Although our operating income was better than the midpoint of our guidance, our cash taxes came in higher than forecasted. Non-GAAP net income was $310.3 million, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.57 and at the midpoint of our guidance.\nOn a GAAP basis, in the March quarter, gross margins were 59.6%. Total operating expenses were $536.4 million and included acquisition intangible amortization of $151.2 million, special income of $16.9 million, which was primarily driven by the settlement of an unclaimed property audit at a value that was less than what we had accrued for. Share-based compensation of $37.4 million and $1.1 million of other expenses. GAAP net income was 154 points in, resulting in $0.28 in diluted earnings per share.\nFor fiscal 2024, net sales were $7.634 billion and were down 9.5% from net sales in fiscal year 2023. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 65.8%, operating expenses were 22% of sales and operating income was 43.9% of sales. Non-GAAP net income was $2.698 billion, and EPS was $4.92 per diluted share.\nOn a GAAP basis, gross margins were 65.4%, operating expenses were 31.8% of sales and operating income was 33.7% of sales. Net income was $1.907 billion, EPS was $3.48 per diluted share.\nOur non-GAAP cash tax rate was 18.8% in the March quarter and 14.5% for fiscal year 2024. Non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal year 2025 is expected to be about 13%, which is exclusive of the transition tax and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. We are still hopeful that the tax rules requiring companies to capitalize R&D expenses will be pushed out or repealed. If this were to happen, we would anticipate about a 200 basis point favorable adjustment to Microchip's non-GAAP tax rate in future periods.\nOur inventory balance at March 31, 2024, was $1.316 billion. We had 224 days of inventory at the end of the March quarter, which was up 39 days from the prior quarter's level and in line with our expectations given the difficult revenue quarter we experienced. At the midpoint of our June 2024 quarter guidance, we would expect inventory dollars to be up modestly and days of inventory to increase based on the lower cost of goods sold driven by the depressed revenue levels at which we believe is the low point of the current cycle for Microchip.\nWe also continue to invest in building inventory for long-lived, high-margin products whose manufacturing capacity is being end of life by our supply chain partners and these last time buys represented 14 days of inventory at the end of March. Inventory at our distributors in the March quarter were at 41 days, which was up 4 days from the prior quarter's level. Distribution took down their inventory in the March quarter as distribution sell-through was about $125 million higher than distribution sell in. The inventory days increased as this is reflective of the much lower cost of sales for Microchip in the March quarter that is used in this calculation.\nOur cash flow from operating activities was $430 million in the March quarter. Our adjusted free cash flow was $389.9 million in the March quarter. As of March 31, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $319.7 million. Our total debt increased by $312 million in the March quarter, our net debt increased by $273.3 million.\nOur adjusted EBITDA in the March quarter was $503 million and 37.9% of sales. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was $3.623 billion, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.57 at March 31, 2024, up from 1.45 at March 31, 2023. Capital expenditures were $40.1 million in the March quarter and $285.1 million for fiscal year 2024. Our expectation for capital expenditures for fiscal year 2025 is about $175 million. Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $45.8 million.\nI will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the March quarter as well as our guidance for the June quarter. Ganesh?\n\nGanesh Moorthy\n\nCEO, President & Director\n\nThank you, Eric, and good evening, everyone. Our March quarter results were consistent with our guidance, with net sales down 24.9% sequentially and down 40.6% from the year ago quarter as we endured through a major inventory correction. Non-GAAP gross margin came in as expected at 60.3% and non-GAAP operating margin was better than expected, 32.9% due to the strong expense control programs we had in place. However, as Eric mentioned, our tax rate was higher than expected, and as a result, our consolidated non-GAAP diluted EPS only met expectations at $0.57 per share.\nOur revenue decline resulted in March quarter EBITDA dropping. And as a result, our net leverage ratio rose to 1.57x. We expect our net leverage to rise modestly a few quarters as trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA drops when replacing stronger prior year quarters with weaker current year quarters. [indiscernible] capability remains strong, and we are committed to our capital return plan.\nOur capital return to shareholders in the June quarter will increase to [ 87.2% ] of our March quarter adjusted free cash flow as we continue on our path to return 100% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders by the March quarter of calendar year 2025.\nReflecting on our fiscal year '24 results, it was a roller coaster year with a positive start that was followed by a major inventory correction. As compared to fiscal year '23, revenue declined 9.5% to $7.6 billion. Non-GAAP operating margin was resilient at 43.9% as we took the actions required to respond to the major inventory correction. Capital return to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks in fiscal '24 was $1.89 billion, representing a 15.4% growth as compared to fiscal '23.\nMy thanks to our worldwide team for their support, hard work and diligence as we navigated a difficult environment and focus on actions that we believe\nposition us well to thrive in the long term.\nTaking a look at our fiscal year '24 net sales from a product line perspective, our mixed signal microcontroller net sales were down 10.2% and represented 56% of Microchip's overall revenue. Our analog net sales were down 15.2% and represented 26.4% of Microchip's overall revenue. While we don't normally break out our FPGA product line results, it is noteworthy that our fiscal year '24 FPGA revenue exceeded $670 million and set another record. FPGA revenue grew over 22% as compared to fiscal '23 and delivered operating margins of north of corporate average. We deliver market-leading mid-range FPGA solutions with best-in-class low power, reliability and security and are especially well suited for the fast emerging opportunities around artificial intelligence at the edge. Our overall FPGA design win momentum is strong across multiple end markets.\nA few other product line notes are significant. Early in April, we closed our acquisition of Soul Korea-based VSI and ADAS and digital cockpit connectivity pioneer to extend our automotive networking market leadership. This acquisition adds automotive SerDes Alliance Motionlink technology, otherwise known as ASA DASH ML to Microchip's broad Ethernet and PCIe automotive networking portfolio to enable next-generation software-defined vehicles. with the anticipated increase in the adoption of advanced camera-based driver assistance systems, in-cabin monitoring, safety and convenience features and multiscreen digital cockpits for next-generation software-defined vehicles, there is a growing requirement for a more highly asymmetric raw data and video links and higher bandwidth with the ASA Motion Lake Open Standard supports.\nAlso last month, we closed our acquisition of Neuronix AI Labs whose innovative software technology enhances AI-enabled intelligent edge solutions and increases neural networking capabilities. This technology expands our capabilities for power-efficient AI-enabled edge solutions deployed in FPGAs. Neuronix AI Labs provides neural network sparcity optimization technology that enables the reduction in power, size and calculation for tasks such as image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation while maintaining high accuracy.\nFinally, in July, we expect to announce our entry into the 64-bit embedded microprocessor market with a suite of products, development tools and other support requirements to address high-performance embedded processing applications including AI-enabled edge solutions. This will extend our strong 32-bit embedded microprocessor portfolio to higher performance and increased capabilities while preserving Microchip's historically strong ecosystem of leading development tools to make adoption ease for embedded system design engineers.\nMicrochip is the only company to offer the widest embedded control and processing platform from 8-bit to 64-bit as well as FPGAs with a common development tool ecosystem that's empowering customers to innovate and reuse their work across a wide spectrum of markets and applications.\nNow for some color on the March quarter and the general business environment. All regions of the world and most of our end markets with the exception of Aerospace and Defense and the artificial intelligence subset of data centers were weak. We believe that our product shipments were significantly lower than the end market consumption of our distribution channels drained inventory during the quarter. Our broad base of customers continued to lower their inventory and adjust their business plans in the midst of a weak macro environment and an uncertain outlook. With no major supply constraints, coupled with very short lead times and a weak macro environment, we believe there is inventory destocking as well as reduction in target inventory levels that is underway at multiple levels. At our direct customers and distributors who buy from us, our indirect customers who buy through our distributors and in some cases, our customers' customers.\nWe are, however, also seeing early signs of green shoots in our business. First, the level of request the cancellations and pushouts has started to subside. Second, our bookings have started to pick up, albeit from low levels. February bookings were the highest in 8 months. March bookings were the highest in all of fiscal '24 and April bookings were higher than March. Third, the new bookings are aging over a shorter period of time; and fourth, the number of expedites and shipment pulling requests are growing. Collectively, these green shoots, we believe, are pointing to the formation of a bottom.\nOur average lead times continue to be 8 weeks or less. During a period of business uncertainty, we believe short lead times are the best way to help customers navigate the environment successfully and improve the quality of backlog placed with us. However, the significant reduction in lead time is also resulting in reduced near-term visibility for our business.\nGiven the severity of the inventory correction, our factories around the world are running at lower utilization rates and our 3 major fabs will take another 2-week shutdown in the June quarter in order to help control the growth of inventory.\nOur internal capacity expansion actions remain paused. We expect our capital investments in fiscal year '25 will be low, even as we prepare for the long-term growth of our business.\nOn the CHIPS Act front, we have nothing new to report. The CHIPS office has completed their diligence for the grants we are seeking and we are working towards an agreement.\nAt this stage of a major inventory correction, we believe that the days of inventory metric where the for Microchip for our distributors can be Decepta as this is a backward-looking indicator measuring off of a baseline that is well below where we believe end market consumption is at. For inventory planning, we are, therefore, focused on where we believe consumption is running and will likely run in the coming quarters. We continue to work with our distribution partners to attempt to find the right balance of inventory required to serve their customers, manage through their cash flow requirements and be positioned for the eventual spinning of business conditions.\nThe operating expense reduction efforts we implemented last quarter, including broad-based salary sacrifices are continuous this quarter. The shutdown for manufacturing team members and pay cuts for nonmanufacturing team members are consistent with our long-standing culture of shared sacrifices and down cycles and shared rewards and up cycles. Our culture of shared sacrifice protects our valuable employees from layoffs, helps enable us to support -- customers maintain our design win momentum, helps ensure that manufacturing capacity can be done quickly as business conditions strengthen and helps enable our product development teams to maintain their pace of new solution introductions.\nNow let's get into the genes for the June quarter. While we see a number of green shoots and other indicators, we still need turns orders within the quarter to meet our guidance. Operating in a high turns and have historically been normal for Microchip. It is just not a position we have found ourselves in over the last few years to a supply-constrained high backlog environment we and the industry experience.\nTaking all the factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, we expect our net of the June quarter to be between $1.22 billion and $1.26 billion. We believe that the June 2024 quarter marks the bottom of the cycle for Microchip and that our business will return to sequential revenue growth in the September 2024 quarter. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 59% and 61% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 28.25% and 28.75% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 30.25% and 32.75% of sales, and we expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $0.48 and $0.56.\nWe believe that the fundamental characteristics of growth, profitability and cash generation of our business remain intact. We are confident that our solution and the engine of innovation for the applications and end markets we serve. Our focus on total system solutions and key market megatrends continue to fuel strong design win momentum, which we expect will drive above-market long-term growth. We remain committed to executing our Microchip 3.0 strategic imperatives, which we believe will deliver sustained results and substantial shareholder value.\nLast but not least, a month ago, we appointed Rich Simoncic as Chief Operating Officer. Rich is a Microchip Lifer who has been with us for 35 years in many different capacities, which has been expanding his role over the last few years, and he and I will jointly lead the Microchip global enterprise so that we can apply our combined leadership capacity to engage the opportunities and challenges that are ahead of us.\nWith that, let me pass it back on to Steve to talk more about our cash return to shareholders. Steve?\n\nStephen Sanghi\n\nExecutive Chair\n\nThank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. I would like to provide you with a further update on our cash return strategy. The Board of Directors approved an increase in the dividend of 18% from the year ago quarter to a record $0.452 per share. During the last quarter, we purchased a record $387.4 million of our stock in the open market. We also paid out recurred $242.5 million in dividends. Thus, the total cash return was a record $629.9 million. This amount was 82.5% of our actual adjusted free cash flow of $763.4 million during the December 2023 quarter. Our net leverage at the end of March 2024 was 1.57x.\nEver since we achieved an investment-grade rating for our debt in November 2021 and pivoted to increasing our capital return to shareholders, we have returned a total of $4.23 billion to shareholders through March 31, 2024, through a combination of dividends and share buybacks. During this period, our share buyback in the open market was approximately 30.4 million shares, representing approximately 5.7% of our shares outstanding. In the current June quarter, we will use the adjusted free cash flow level from the March quarter to target the amount of cash returned to shareholders. The adjusted free cash flow excludes amounts we collected from our customers for long-term supply assurance payments. These payments are refundable when purchase commitments are fulfilled.\nOur adjusted free cash flow for the March quarter was $389.9 million, so our target return to shareholders would be 87.5% or $341.2 million of that amount. However, as Ganesh mentioned, we did complete 2 small acquisitions in this June quarter. So we are reducing our share buyback amount to reflect the cash outlay for those deals. Thus, in the June quarter, our cash return to shareholders is expected to be $315.3 million, out of which dividends are expected to be approximately $243 million and our expected stock buyback will be approximately $72.3 million.\nGoing forward, we plan to continue to increase our adjusted free cash flow to return to shareholders by 500 basis points every quarter until we reach 100% of adjusted free cash flow returned to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. They will take 3 more quarters, and we expect that dividends over time will represent approximately 50% of our cash returns.\nWith that, operator, will you please poll for questions."

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Eric Bjornholt, our CFO. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJames Eric Bjornholt\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Microchip Technology Incorporated\n\nThank you, and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.\nIn attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and CEO; Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Executive Chair; and Sajid Daudi, Microchip's Head of Investor Relations. I will comment on our third quarter financial performance. Ganesh will then provide commentary on our results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance, and Steve will provide an update on our cash return strategy. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.\nWe are including information in our press release and on this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, and included reconciliation information in our press release, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website.\nI will now go through some of our operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our press release and in the reconciliations on our website.\nNet sales in the December quarter were $2.169 billion, which was up 4.6% sequentially. We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record at 68.1%, operating expenses were 20.6% and operating income was a record 47.5%. Non-GAAP net income was a record $863.7 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was a record $1.56 and at the high end of our guidance range.\nOn a GAAP basis in the December quarter, gross margins were a record at 67.8%. Total operating expenses were $659.2 million and included acquisition intangible amortization of $167.4 million, special charges of $6.5 million and $0.3 million of acquisition-related and other costs, and share-based compensation of $37.1 million.\nGAAP net income was a record $580.3 million, resulting in a record $1.04 in earnings per diluted share. As compared to a year ago quarter, our December quarter GAAP tax expense was impacted by a variety of factors, notably the tax expense recorded as a result of the capitalization of R&D expenses for tax purposes.\nOur non-GAAP cash tax rate was 11.9% in the December quarter. We now expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal '23 to be about 11%, exclusive of the transition tax and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. A reminder of what we communicated over the past couple of quarters. Our fiscal '23 cash tax rate is higher than our fiscal '22 tax rate for a variety of factors, including lower availability of tax attributes, such as net operating losses and tax credits as well as the impact of current tax rules requiring the capitalization of R&D expenses for tax purposes.\nWe are still hopeful that the tax rules requiring companies to capitalize R&D expenses will be pushed out or repealed. If this were to happen, we would anticipate about a 300 basis point favorable adjustment to Microchip's non-GAAP tax rate in future periods.\nOur inventory balance at December 31, 2022, was $1.165 billion. We had 152 days of inventory at the end of the December quarter, which was up 13 days from the prior quarter's level. We have increased our raw materials inventory to help protect our internal manufacturing supply lines. We are carrying higher work in progress to help maximize the utilization of constrained equipment as well as to position ourselves to take advantage of new equipment installations, which should relieve bottlenecks.\nWe are investing in building inventory for long-lived, high-margin products whose manufacturing capacity is being end of life by our supply chain partners. We need to take actions to help ensure that our supply lines can feed growth beyond what we expect in the March 2023 and June 2023 quarters, and our reported days of inventory is a backward-looking indicator.\nAs gross margins rise, the effective days of inventory for the same physical inventory rises and with every 100 basis points of gross margin growth, it creates approximately 3 incremental days of inventory. Inventory at our distributors in the December quarter was at 22 days, which was up 3 days from the prior quarter's level.\nOur cash flow from operating activities was a record $1.278 billion in the December quarter. Included in our cash flow from operating activities was $385 million of long-term supply assurance receipts. We are going to adjust these items out of our free cash flow to determine the adjusted free cash flow that we will return to shareholders as these payments will be refundable over time as purchase commitments are fulfilled.\nOur adjusted free cash flow was $751.6 million and 34.6% of net sales in the December quarter. As of December 31, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $288.9 million. We paid down $719.1 million of total debt in the December quarter, and our net debt was reduced by $701.2 million. Over the last 18 full quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down almost $6.2 billion of the debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash beyond dividends and stock buyback to bring down this debt.\nOur adjusted EBITDA in the December quarter was a record at $1.106 billion and 51% of net sales. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was also a record at $4.051 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.56 at December 31, 2022, down from 1.84 at September 30, 2022, and down from 2.58% at December 31, 2021. Capital expenditures were $141.3 million in the December quarter. Our expectation for capital expenditures for fiscal year 2023 is between $525 million and $545 million as we continue to take actions to support the growth of our business and ramp our manufacturing operations accordingly.\nWe continue to prudently add capital equipment to maintain, grow and operate our internal manufacturing operations to support the expected long-term growth of our business. We expect these capital investments will bring gross margin improvements to our business and give us increased control over our production during periods of industry-wide constraints. Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $55.3 million.\nI will now turn it over to Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter as well as our guidance for the March quarter. Ganesh?\n\nGanesh Moorthy\n\nCEO, President & Director, Microchip Technology Incorporated\n\nThank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Our December quarter results were well above the midpoint of our revenue guidance, marked by our disciplined execution as well as our resilient end markets. Net sales grew 4.6% sequentially and 23.4% on a year-over-year basis to achieve another all-time record of $2.17 billion.\nThe December quarter also marked our ninth consecutive quarter of growth. Non-GAAP gross margins came in above the high end of our guidance at a record 68.1%, up 38 basis points from the September quarter and up 202 basis points from the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin also came in above the high end of our guidance at a record 47.5%, up 62 basis points from the September quarter and up 283 basis points from the year ago quarter.\nDue to a rapid increase in net sales over the last 2 years, operating expenses at 20.65% were 185 basis points below the low end of our long-term model range of 22.5% to 23.5%. Our long-term operating expense model will continue to guide our investment actions to drive the long-term growth, profitability and durability of our business.\nOur consolidated non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was at the high end of our guidance at a record $1.56 per share, up 30% from the year ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA at 51% of net sales and adjusted free cash flow at 34.6% of net sales were both very strong in the December quarter, continuing to demonstrate the robust cash generation capabilities of our business.\nAs Eric mentioned, we have excluded $385 million of long-term supply assurance payments made by customers from our adjusted free cash flow calculation since these payments are refundable when customers fulfill their purchase commitments. Net debt declined by $701.2 million, driving our net leverage ratio down to 1.56x exiting the December quarter.\nDuring the December quarter, we returned $409.8 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases, representing 60% of the prior quarter's free cash flow. We expect to get below 1.5x net leverage by the end of the March quarter. And as Steve will share with you later, the Microchip Board has decided to increase the rate at which capital will be returned to shareholders starting in the June quarter.\nMy heartfelt gratitude to all our stakeholders who enabled us to achieve these outstanding results and especially to the worldwide Microchip team whose tireless efforts and strong sense of ownership are what enable us to navigate effectively in the midst of turbulent times.\nTaking a look at our net sales from a product line perspective, our Microcontroller net sales was sequentially up 3.5% in the December quarter and set another all-time record. On a year-over-year basis, our December quarter microcontroller net sales were up 25.6%. Microcontrollers represented 56.3% of our net sales in the December quarter. Our analog net sales were sequentially up 5.9% in the December quarter and also set an all-time record. On a year-over-year basis, our December quarter analog net sales were up 21.2%. Analog represented 28% of our net sales in the December quarter.\nIn the December quarter, our FPGA net sales also achieved a new record. While our overall business remained strong in the December quarter, the consumer appliance end market was weak as was our overall business in China. Our China business was initially impacted by COVID lockdowns and then subsequently impacted by the rapid transmission of COVID when lockdowns were lifted. Both actions adversely impacted our customers' operations during the December quarter, resulting in inventory at many customers and distributors being higher than normal.\nIn response to the weaker business environment in China, and a small but increasing number of other customers who have inventory and requested pushouts, we took action in the December quarter to delay or redirect some shipments and plan to do more of the same in the March quarter. This is designed to reduce customer and channel inventory overbuild, but will also increase the inventory on our balance sheet in the near term. In the medium term, we expect this will give us a better chance to achieve a soft landing and position us well to respond to a stronger demand growth as the macro environment improves.\nAs a result of the uncertain macro environment and the multiple quarters worth of backlog in our books, most of which is noncancelable, our bookings have slowed down, as we expected. Given the circumstances, we view the booking slowdown as a positive, which will serve to preserve the quality of new backlog that gets placed. Our unsupported backlog, which represents backlog customers wanted to ship to them in the December quarter, but which we could not deliver in the December quarter, remained well in excess of the actual net sales we achieved. Unsupported backlog did decline slightly for the first time in 9 quarters, and we are continuing to work hard to further reduce our unsupported backlog as well as our lead times to more manageable levels.\nWhile we have seen an increase in request to push out or cancel backlog, these requests remain a small fraction of the very large backlog we have over multiple quarters, and hence, they have not had a material effect on our business. Despite supply gradually improving, we expect to have supply constraints through much of 2023.\nHowever, in order to achieve a more healthy and sustainable business environment, we are driving to bring average lead times down to 26 weeks or less by the time we get to the second half of 2023, and we will be publishing a customer letter to this effect shortly.\nWe believe there are 3 reasons why Microchip's business is demonstrating more resilience in the midst of the weakness seen by some other semiconductor companies. First, on the demand side, the industrial, automotive, aerospace and defense, data center and communications infrastructure end markets, which make up approximately 86% of our net sales remains solid. The consumer end market, which is about 14% of our net sales, is experiencing some weakness, but is dominated by home appliances, which are comparatively more resilient.\nThere are some signs that the data center end market could see some headwinds in 2023 although our business remains strong based on the market share gains we have had. Hence, our overall demand remains quite durable because of the end market mix we have consciously gravitated towards over the years.\nSecond, on the supply side, a vast majority of our products are built on specialized technologies requiring trailing edge capacity. This is the capacity that has been most constrained over the last 2 years which still remains constrained and where there was less opportunity to overship to consumption. And last but not least, our laser focus on organic growth through total system solutions and higher-growth megatrends from multiple years is giving us increased design win momentum, further share gains and a result in revenue tailwind.\nIf you review Microchip's peak to trough performance through the business cycles over the last 15-plus years, you will observe our robust and consistent cash generation, gross margin and operating margin results. The investor presentation posted on our IR website has details of our performance through the business cycles. We remain cautiously optimistic about navigating to a soft landing for our business, and expect our cash generation, gross margin and operating margin to once again demonstrate consistency and resiliency through the cycle.\nLast quarter, we mentioned that Microchip was in the early stages of considering building a 300-millimeter U.S.-based fab for specialized trailing edge technologies. After a detailed analysis, we have concluded not to move forward with this project and that our business objectives would likely be better achieved through our relationships with our foundry suppliers with lower execution risk and a better return on invested capital.\nThe CHIPS Act is already making a positive impact on our business. through the investment tax credit, which started on January 1, and with impending capacity expansion grants that we will be seeking with several of our U.S. semiconductor factories. We believe the CHIPS Act is good for the semiconductor industry and for America as it enables critical investments, which will help even the global playing field while being strategically important for American economic and national security.\nNow let's get into the guidance for the March quarter. Our backlog for the March quarter is strong, and we have more capacity improvements coming into effect. However, we are also taking active steps to help customers with inventory positions to selectively push out some of their backlog. Taking all the factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, we expect our net sales for the March quarter to be up between 1% and 4% sequentially. Further, we expect sequential net sales growth again in the June quarter. At the midpoint of our net sales guidance, our year-over-year growth for the March quarter would be a strong 20.6%.\nWe expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 68.1% and 68.3% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 20.6% and 20.8% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 47.3% and 47.7% of sales. And we expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $1.61 per share and $1.63 per share. At the midpoint of our earnings per share guidance, our year-over-year growth for the March quarter would be a strong 20% despite a much higher tax rate than the year ago quarter.\nFinally, as you can see from our December quarter results and our March quarter guidance, our Microchip 3.0 strategy, which we launched 15 months ago is firing on all cylinders as we continue to build and improve what we believe is one of the most diversified, defensible, high growth, high margin, high cash generating businesses in the semiconductor industry.\nOur Board of Directors and leadership team operate just as long-term owners of the business would, thoughtfully making the key investments in people, technology, capacity, culture and sustainability required to thrive in the long term while being prudent, pragmatic and nimble about whatever short-term adjustments may be required. We are confident we will effectively navigate through whatever macro business challenges may unfold in 2023.\nLet me now pass the baton to Steve to talk more about our cash return to shareholders. Steve?\n\nStephen Sanghi\n\nExecutive Chair, Microchip Technology Incorporated\n\nThank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. I would like to reflect on our financial results announced today and provide you further updates on our cash return strategy.\nReflecting on our financial results, I continue to be very proud of all employees of Microchip that have delivered another exceptional quarter while making new records in many respects, namely record net sales, record non-GAAP gross margin percentage, record non-GAAP operating margin percentage record non-GAAP EPS and record adjusted EBITDA and all that in a continuing challenging supply environment.\nThe Board of Directors announced an increase in the dividend of 9.1% from last quarter to $0.358 per share. This is an increase of 41.5% from the year ago quarter. During the last quarter, we purchased $229.5 million of our stock in the open market. We also paid out $180.3 million in dividends. Thus, the total cash return was $409.8 million. This amount was 60% of our actual free cash flow of $682.9 million during the September 2022 quarter.\nOur paydown of debt as well as record adjusted EBITDA drove down our net leverage at the end of December 2022 quarter to 1.56 from 1.84 at the end of September. Ever since we achieved an investment-grade rating for our debt in November 2021 and pivoted to increasing our capital return to shareholders, we have returned $1.867 billion to shareholders through December 31, 2022, by a combination of dividends and share buybacks.\nIn the current March quarter, we will use the adjusted free cash flow from the December quarter to target the amount of cash returned to shareholders. The adjusted free cash flow excludes $385 million that we collected from our customers for long-term supply assurance payments. These payments are refundable when customers fulfill their purchase commitments. The adjusted free cash flow for December quarter was $751.6 million. We plan to return 62.5% or $469.8 million of that amount to our shareholders with the dividend expected to be approximately $196 million and the stock buyback expected to be approximately $273.8 million.\nWe also want to provide guidance for our planned cash return to shareholders beyond this quarter. We expect our net debt leverage at the end of March quarter to be less than 1.5. Therefore, our Board of Directors decided that beginning with the June quarter, we will accelerate the cash return to shareholders. We laid out a strategy for our cash return to shareholders at an Analyst and Investor Day in November 2021. We began with returning 50% of the free cash flow of the prior quarter and increasing it by 2.5 percentage points every quarter.\nWith these increases, we'll be returning 62.5% of last quarter's adjusted free cash flow to investors this quarter. Beginning in June quarter, we expect to double the rate at which we are increasing the percentage of free cash flow returned to shareholders. In other words, in June quarter, we expect to return 75% of our adjusted free cash flow from March quarter. Then in September quarter, we expect to return 72.5% of adjusted free cash flow from the June quarter, and so on, 5 percentage point increase every quarter. At this rate, we would approach 100% return of our adjusted free cash flow in about 8 quarters.\nWe realize that we are still carrying a debt burden of $6.62 billion in a rising interest rate environment. As some of our debt matures, we will likely be renewing it at a higher interest rate than we are currently paying on such debt. Our strategy of accelerating our cash return to shareholders over several quarters will help us pay down some additional debt and lower our debt service costs.\nWith that, operator, will you please poll for questions?"

Today's call is being recorded. And now at this time I'd like to turn the call over to Eric.\n\nJames Eric Bjornholt\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Microchip Technology Incorporated\n\nThank you and good afternoon, everybody. Thank you for bearing with us. We had some conference call dial-in challenges that we've worked through now, so appreciate your patience with that.\nDuring the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially.\nWe refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.\nIn attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and CEO; Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Executive Chair; and Sajid Daudi, Microchip's Head of Investor Relations. I will comment on our second quarter financial performance, Ganesh will then provide commentary on our results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance, and Steve will provide an update on our cash return strategy.\nWe will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. We are including information in our press release and on this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com and included reconciliation information in our press release, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website.\nI will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our press release.\nNet sales in the September quarter were $2.073 billion, which was up 5.6% sequentially. We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record at 67.7%. Operating expenses were at 20.9%. And operating income was a record 46.9%.\nNon-GAAP net income was a record $814.4 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was a record $1.46 and at the high end of our guidance range.\nOn a GAAP basis in the September quarter, gross margins were a record at 67.4%. Total operating expenses were $642.8 million and included acquisition intangible amortization of $167.5 million, special charges of $4.3 million, $3.2 million of acquisition-related and other costs and share-based compensation of $34.8 million.\nGAAP net income was a record $546.2 million resulting in a record $0.98 in earnings per diluted share and was adversely impacted by a $2.1 million loss on debt settlement associated with our convertible debt refinancing activities.\nOur September quarter GAAP tax expense was impacted by a variety of factors, notably the tax expense recorded as a result of the capitalization of R&D expenses for tax purposes.\nOur non-GAAP cash tax rate was 11.2% in the September quarter. We now expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal '23 to be between 9.8% and 10.8%, exclusive of the transition tax, any potential tax associated with restructuring the Microsemi operations into the Microchip global structure and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. This is modestly higher than our previous forecast as we have refined our tax calculations for the year.\nA reminder of what we communicated last quarter. Our fiscal '23 cash tax rate is higher than our fiscal '22 tax rate for a variety of factors, including lower availability of tax attributes such as net operating losses and tax credits, as well as the impact of current tax rules requiring the capitalization of R&D expenses for tax purposes. There appears to be some momentum for the tax rules requiring companies to capitalize R&D expenses to be pushed out or repealed. If this were to happen, we would anticipate about a 300 basis point favorable adjustment to Microchip's tax rate in fiscal year 2023.\nOur inventory balance at September 30, 2022, was $1.03 billion. We had 139 days of inventory at the end of the September quarter, which was up 12 days from the prior quarter's level. We have increased our raw materials inventory to protect our internal manufacturing supply lines. We are carrying higher work in progress to maximize the utilization of constrained equipment as well as to position ourselves to take advantage of new equipment installations, which will relieve bottlenecks.\nWe are investing and building inventory for long-life, high-margin products whose manufacturing capacity is being end-of-lifed by our supply chain partners. We need to ensure that our supply lines can feed growth beyond what we expect in the December 2022 and March 2023 quarters, and our reported days of inventory is a backward-looking indicator. As gross margins rise, the effective days of inventory for the same physical inventory rises, and with every 100 basis points of gross margin growth, it creates approximately 3 incremental days of inventory.\nInventory days at our distributors in the September quarter was at 19 days, which was flat to the prior quarter's level. With distribution inventory still being low, we will be carrying higher inventory at Microchip to ensure our customers can be served.\nIn the September quarter, we repurchased $36.9 million of principal value of our 2025 and 2027 convertible subordinated notes for cash, and we also paid cash for the value of these bonds above the principal amount, which was an additional $60 million. We used cash generation during the quarter to fund the amount of the convertible debt repurchases, and we believe that these transactions will benefit stockholders by reducing share count dilution to the extent our stock price appreciates over time.\nThe principal amount of convertible debt on our balance sheet at September 30 was $766.6 million. This includes $665.5 million of convertible bonds maturing in November of 2024 with the cap call option in place that offsets any potential dilution from these convertibles up to stock prices of $116.15. At the beginning of calendar year 2020, Microchip had $4.481 billion of convertible bonds outstanding. So today, our overall capital structure is in a much better long-term position.\nOur cash flow from operating activities was $793.2 million in the September quarter. Our free cash flow was $682.9 million and 32.9% of net sales. As of September 30, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $306.8 million. We paid down $264.9 million of total debt in the September quarter, and our net debt was reduced by $192.6 million. Over the last 17 full quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down almost $5.5 billion of debt and continue to allocate substantially all our excess cash beyond dividends and stock buyback to bring down this debt.\nOur adjusted EBITDA in the September quarter was a record at $1.056 billion and 50.9% of net sales. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was also a record at $3.814 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.84 at September 30, 2022, down from 2.05 at June 30, 2022, and down from 3.0 at September 30, 2021.\nCapital expenditures were $110.3 million in the September quarter. Our expectation for capital expenditures for fiscal year 2023 is between $500 million and $550 million as we continue to take actions to support the growth of our business and the ramp of our manufacturing operations.\nWe continue to prudently add capital equipment to maintain, grow and operate our internal manufacturing operations to support the expected long-term growth of our business. We expect these capital investments will bring gross margin improvement to our business and give us increased control over our production during periods of industry-wide constraints. Depreciation expense in the September quarter was $63.6 million.\nI will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the September quarter as well as our guidance for the December quarter. Ganesh?\n\nGanesh Moorthy\n\nCEO, President & Director, Microchip Technology Incorporated\n\nThank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Our September quarter results continued to be strong, driven by our disciplined execution and our resilient end markets. Net sales grew 5.6% sequentially and 25.7% on a year-over-year basis to achieve another all-time record at $2.07 billion. While we don't normally provide information on a distribution sell-through basis, which we refer to as end market demand, we are providing information this quarter to give investors some insight into consumption. September quarter end market demand grew sequentially at about the same rate as our GAAP net sales, which is based on sell-in recognition. The September quarter was our eighth consecutive quarter where we achieved a net sales record and the first time we have ever crossed the $8 billion annualized net sales mark.\nNon-GAAP gross margin came in at the high end of our guidance at a record 67.7%, up 64 basis points from the June quarter and up 244 basis points from the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin came in well above the high end of our guidance at a record 46.9%, up 127 basis points from the June quarter and up 438 basis points from the year ago quarter.\nDue to a rapid increase in net sales over the last 2 years, operating expenses at 20.9% were about 160 basis points below the low end of our long-term model range of 22.5% to 23.5%. Our long-term operating expense model will continue to guide our investment actions to drive the long-term growth, profitability and durability of our business.\nOur consolidated non-GAAP diluted EPS was a record $1.46 per share, up 36.4% from the year ago quarter and at the high end of our guidance. Adjusted EBITDA at 50.9% of net sales and free cash flow at 32.9% of net sales were both very strong in the September quarter, continuing to demonstrate the robust cash generation capabilities of our business.\nNet debt declined by $192.6 million, driving our net leverage ratio down to 1.84x exiting the September quarter. During the September quarter, we returned $413.3 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases, representing 57.5% of the prior quarter's free cash flow.\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank all our stakeholders who enabled us to achieve these outstanding results and especially thank the worldwide Microchip team for their continued efforts during challenging times to deliver results for our customers despite a large and persistent imbalance between supply and demand.\nTaking a look at our net sales from a product line perspective, our microcontroller net sales were sequentially up 11% as compared to the June quarter and set another all-time record. On a year-over-year basis, our September quarter microcontroller net sales were up 31.9%, and microcontrollers represented 56.9% of our net sales in the September quarter.\nOur analog net sales sequentially decreased 1.3% in the September quarter. On a year-over-year basis, our September quarter analog net sales were up 16.6%, and analog represented 27.6% of our net sales in the September quarter.\nAs we mentioned last quarter, there are quarter-to-quarter differences in supply constraints, which can cause differences in net sales growth by product line. If you compare the trailing 4-quarter net sales growth performance versus the prior 4 quarters for our analog and microcontroller product lines, the growth rates are almost exactly the same. In the September quarter, our technology licensing net sales achieved a new record.\nBusiness conditions continue to be strong as viewed through our internal indicators. Demand continued to be strong despite the capacity increases we have been implementing for some time now. As a result, our unsupported backlog, which represents backlog customers wanted shipped to them in the September quarter but which we could not deliver in the September quarter, climbed again. And we exited the September quarter with our highest unsupported backlog ever with unsupported backlog well above the actual net sales we achieved.\nWe are working hard to reduce our unsupported backlog to more manageable levels and expect to do so in the coming quarters but also expect to remain supply constrained through the rest of 2022 and well into 2023. We are, of course, cognizant of the weakening macro conditions resulting from rising inflation and interest rates and are monitoring such conditions closely.\nWe're also aware that there is some inventory build at our customers as can be seen in their balance sheets. Some of this, we believe, is due to strategic buffer inventory builds arising from the learnings of the last 2 years, and some of this is due to the incomplete kits of the infamous golden screw effect. While we've seen an increase in requests to push out or cancel backlog, these requests remain a very small fraction of the very large backlog we have over multiple quarters, and hence, they have not had a material impact on our business.\nWe believe there are 3 reasons why Microchip's business is demonstrating more resilience in the midst of the weakness seen by some of the other semiconductor companies. First, on the demand side, the industrial, automotive, aerospace and defense, data center and communications infrastructure end markets, which make up 86% of our net sales, remain strong. The consumer end market, which is about 14% of our net sales, is experienced some weakness but is dominated by home appliances. And home appliances are more resilient than other consumer markets as a high percentage of demand comes from replacements for appliances which have broken down and must be replaced. Hence, our demand is quite durable because of the end market mix we have consciously gravitated towards over the years.\nSecond, on the supply side, a vast majority of our products are built on specialized technologies requiring trailing edge capacity. This is the capacity that has been most constrained over the last 2 years, which still remains constrained and where there was the least opportunity to overship the consumption. And last but not least, our laser focus on organic growth through total system solutions and higher-growth megatrends for multiple years is giving us increased design win momentum and a resultant revenue tailwind.\nGiven the crosscurrents of strong internal business indicators and some uncertainty in the macro environment, we have modeled a range of potential scenarios and are closely monitoring various indicators, which should enable us to take deliberate action when we feel it's appropriate. Our goal is to deliver a soft landing for our business, if or when there is a softer -- a softer macro environment catches up with it. The playbook we shared with you last quarter for how we will deal with the macro slowdown remains unchanged.\nIf you study Microchip's peak-to-trough performance through the business cycles over the last 15 years, you will observe our robust and consistent cash generation, gross margin and operating margin results. The investor presentation posted on our IR website provides details about our performance through the business cycles. If or when there is a macro slowdown and that impacts our business, we expect our cash generation, gross margin and operating margin to once again demonstrate consistency and resiliency. This will help us continue to execute our long-term Microchip 3.0 strategy and help insulate it from whatever short-term market challenges there may be.\nWhile we are seeing some loosening of constraints in our supply chain, we continue to have several internal and external capacity corridors that remain very constrained. We are continuing with our carefully calibrated capacity increases seeking to serve what we believe is a long-term consumption growth. We believe our calibrated increase in capital spending will enable us to capitalize on growth opportunities, serve our customers better, increase our market share, improve our gross margins and give us more control over our destiny, especially for specialized trailing edge technologies.\nAs you may have seen, Microchip has expressed its view that the recently approved CHIPS Act is good for the semiconductor industry and for America as it enables critical investments, which will even the global playing field for U.S. companies while being strategically important for our economic and national security.\nFor a very long time, an important component of our business strategy has been to own and operate a substantial portion of our manufacturing resources, including wafer fabrication facilities in the U.S. This strategy enables us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control, resulting in us being one of the lowest-cost producers in the embedded control industry. In light of this strategy and potential grant funding from the CHIPS Act, the investment tax credit provision as well as state and local grants and subsidies, Microchip is in the early stages of considering a 300-millimeter U.S.-based fab for specialized trailing-edge technologies.\nThis fab project, if we decide to pursue it, would be intended to provide competitive growth capacity as well as geographic and geopolitical diversification. The availability of grants, subsidies and other incentives will all be important considerations in our analysis and will also help determine the location and timing for the fab.\nNow let's get into the guidance for the December quarter. Our backlog for the December quarter is strong, and we have more capacity improvements coming into effect. Taking all the factors we've discussed on the call today into consideration, we expect our net sales for the December quarter to be up between 3% and 5% sequentially. We also expect our net sales based on end market demand to grow at about the same growth as our GAAP net sales. And further, we expect sequential net sales growth again in the March quarter.\nAt the midpoint of our net sales guidance, our year-over-year growth for the December quarter would be a strong 22.7%. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 67.8% and 68% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 20.7% and 20.9% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 46.9% and 47.3% of sales. And we expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $1.54 per share and $1.56 per share. At the midpoint of our EPS guidance, our year-over-year growth for the December quarter would be a strong 29.2%.\nFinally, as you can see from our September quarter results and our December quarter guidance, our Microchip 3.0 strategy, which we launched a year ago, is firing on all cylinders as we continue to build and improve what we believe is one of the most diversified, defensible, high-growth, high-margin, high cash-generating businesses in the semiconductor industry.\nLet me now pass the baton to Steve to talk more about our cash return to shareholders. Steve?\n\nStephen Sanghi\n\nExecutive Chair, Microchip Technology Incorporated\n\nThank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. I would like to reflect on our financial results announced today and provide you further updates on our cash return strategy.\nReflecting on our financial results, I continue to be very proud of all employees of Microchip that have delivered another exceptional quarter while making new records in many respects, namely record net sales, record non-GAAP gross margin percentage, record non-GAAP operating margin percentage, record non-GAAP EPS and record adjusted EBITDA and all of that in a very challenging supply environment.\nThe Board of Directors announced an increase in the dividend of 9% from last quarter to $0.328 per share. This is an increase of 41.4% from the year ago quarter. During the last quarter, we purchased $247.2 million of our stock in the open market. We also paid out $166.1 million in dividends. Thus, the total cash return was $413.3 million. This amount was 57.5% of our actual free cash flow of $718.5 million during the June 2022 quarter. Our paydown of debt as well as record adjusted EBITDA drove down our net leverage at the end of September 2022 quarter to 1.84 from 2.05 at the end of June.\nEver since we achieved investment-grade rating for our debt in November of 2021 and pivoted to increasing our capital return to shareholders, we have returned $1.457 billion to shareholders through September 30, 2022, by a combination of dividends and share buybacks. In the December quarter, we will use the September quarter's actual free cash flow of $682.9 million and plan to return 60% or $409.7 million of that amount to our shareholders. Of this $409.7 million, the dividend is expected to be approximately $181 million. And the stock buyback is expected to be approximately $228.7 million.\nWith that, operator, will you please poll for questions?"

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Eric Bjornholt, our CFO. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJames Eric Bjornholt\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Microchip Technology Incorporated\n\nThank you, and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially.\nWe refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and CEO; Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Executive Chair; and Sajid Daudi, Microchip's Head of Investor Relations. I will comment on our first quarter financial performance, Ganesh will then provide commentary on our results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance, and Steve will provide an update on our cash return strategy.\nWe will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. We are including information in our press release in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, and included reconciliation information in our press release, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debts and our leverage metrics on our website.\nI will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our press release. Net sales in the June quarter were $1.964 billion, which was up 6.5% sequentially. We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales by product line and geography on our website for your reference.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record at 67.1%, operating expenses were at 21.5%, and operating income was a record 45.6%. Non-GAAP net income was a record $767.2 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was a record $1.37 and $0.01 above the high end of our guidance range.\nOn a GAAP basis in the June quarter, gross margins were a record at 66.7%. Total operating expenses were $608.6 million and included acquisition and tangible amortization of $167.6 million. Special income of $16.9 million, $1.7 million of acquisition-related and other costs and share-based compensation of $33.5 million.\nGAAP net income was a record $507.2 million, resulting in $0.90 per diluted share and was adversely impacted by a $6.2 million loss on debt settlement associated with our convertible debt refinancing activities and positively impacted by a $22 million litigation accrual adjustments. Our June quarter GAAP tax expense was impacted by a variety of factors, notably the tax benefits recorded as a result of the loss on the debt settlement.\nOur non-GAAP cash tax rate was 9.4% in the June quarter and was in line with our guidance. The June quarter tax rate was up approximately 450 basis points from the rates in fiscal year 2022. We expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal '23 to be between 8.5% and 10.5%, exclusive of the transition tax, any potential tax associated with restructuring the Microsemi operations into the Microchip global structure and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years.\nA reminder of what we communicated last quarter, our fiscal '23 cash tax rate is higher than our fiscal '22 tax rate for a variety of factors, including lower availability of tax attributes, such as net operating losses and tax credits as well as the impact of current tax rules requiring the capitalization of R&D expenses for tax purposes. Our inventory balance at June 30, 2022, was $911.8 million. We had 127 days of inventory at the end of the June quarter, which was up 2 days from the prior quarter's level.\nA major part of the increase in days of inventory was driven by the 50 basis point sequential increase in gross margin. Our levels of raw materials and work in progress increased in the quarter, which helps position us for the increased production we are expecting from our internal factories and helps buffer to a degree some against unexpected shortages or changes in material lead times.\nThe carrying cost of our inventory has been and will be increasing due to rising input costs from our supply chain as well as several last-time buys we are forced to make because of capacity restructuring actions being taken by our suppliers. We are continuing to ramp capacity in our internal and external factories so we can ship more product to support customer requirements. Inventory at our distributors in the June quarter was at 19 days, which was up 2 days from the prior quarter's level.\nIn the June quarter, we repurchased $34.6 million of principal value of our 2027 and 2037 convertible subordinated notes for cash, and we also paid cash for the value of these bonds above the principal amount. We used cash generation during the quarter to fund the amounts of the convertible debt repurchases, and we believe that these transactions will benefit stockholders by reducing share count dilution to the extent our stock price appreciates over time.\nThe principal amount of convertible debt on our balance sheet at June 30 was $803.5 million. This includes $665.5 million of convertible bonds maturing in November of 2024, with the cap call option in place that offsets any potential dilution from these convertibles up to a stock price of $116.34. At the beginning of calendar year 2020, Microchip had $4.481 billion of convertible bonds outstanding. So today, our overall capital structure is in a much better long-term position.\nOur cash flow from operating activities was $840.4 million in the June quarter. Our free cash flow was $718.5 million and 36.6% of net sales. As of June 30, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $379.1 million. We paid down $233.6 million of total debt in the June quarter, and our net debt was reduced by $293.3 million. Over the last 16 full quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down almost $5.2 billion of debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash beyond dividends and stock buyback to bring down this debt.\nWe have accomplished this despite the adverse macro and market conditions during the earlier years of this period, which we feel is a testimony to the cash generation capabilities of our business as well as our ongoing operating discipline. We continue to expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years.\nOur adjusted EBITDA in the June quarter was a record at $986.7 million and 50.2% of net sales. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was also a record at $3.521 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.05 at June 30, 2022, down from 2.32 at March 31, 2022, and down from 3.34 at June 30, 2021.\nCapital expenditures were $121.9 million in the June quarter. Our expectation for capital expenditures for fiscal year '23 is between $500 million and $550 million as we continue to take actions to support the growth of our business and ramp up our manufacturing operations. We continue to prudently add capital equipment to maintain, grow and operate our internal manufacturing operations to support the expected long-term growth of our business. We expect these capital investments will bring gross margin improvement to our business and give us increased control over our production during periods of industry-wide constraints. Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $71.7 million.\nI will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter as well as our guidance for the September quarter. Ganesh?\n\nGanesh Moorthy\n\nCEO, President & Director, Microchip Technology Incorporated\n\nThank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Our June quarter results continue to be strong across the board, setting several records in the process. Revenue grew 6.5% sequentially and 25.1% on a year-over-year basis to achieve another all-time record at $1.96 billion.\nThis was our seventh consecutive quarter where we achieved a record revenue mark. During the quarter, we worked through several COVID-related operational challenges, including, but not limited to, the shutdowns in Shanghai, which affected our customers and our supply chain partners. Non-GAAP gross margin was another record of 67.1%, up 50 basis points from the March quarter and up 230 basis points from the year ago quarter, benefiting from improved operational efficiencies as well as product mix changes. Non-GAAP operating margin was also a record of 45.6%, up 90 basis points from the March quarter and up 390 basis points from the year ago quarter, achieving the high end of our guidance.\nDue to our rapid increase in revenue, operating expenses at 21.5% or 100 basis points below the low end of our long-term model range of 22.5% to 23.5%. Our long-term operating expense model will continue to guide our investment actions to drive the long-term growth and profitability of our business. Our consolidated non-GAAP diluted EPS was a record $1.37 per share, up 38.4% from the year ago quarter and just above the high end of our guidance.\nAdjusted EBITDA at 50.2% of revenue and free cash flow at 36.6% of revenue, were both very strong in the June quarter, continuing to demonstrate the robust cash generation capabilities of our business. Net debt declined by $293.3 million, driving our net leverage ratio down to 2.05 exiting the June quarter as we continue to aggressively drive down our net leverage.\nRecalling that our net leverage was almost 5x at the end of the 2018 June quarter right after the Microsemi acquisition, it is satisfying to see how far we have come in the full year since to bring down our net leverage so significantly. During the June quarter, we returned $348.2 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases, representing 55% of the prior quarter's free cash flow.\nI would like to take this opportunity to profusely thank all of our stakeholders who enabled us to achieve these outstanding results and especially thank the worldwide Microchip team for their concerted effort and never give up attitude to deliver results for our customers despite a historic and persistent imbalance between supply and demand. Taking a look at our revenue from a product line perspective, our microcontroller revenue was sequentially up 1.6% as compared to the March quarter and set another all-time record.\nOn a year-over-year basis, our June quarter microcontroller revenue was up 17.8%. Microcontrollers represented 54.1% of our revenue in the June quarter. Our analog revenue sequentially increased 12.5% in the June quarter, setting another record in the process. On a year-over-year basis, our June quarter analog revenue was up a strong 34.2%, and analog represented 29.5% of our revenue in the June quarter.\nThe difference in growth rate in the June quarter between Microcontrollers and analog is in part based on quarter-to-quarter differences as we have seen in the past and in part because we are competitively less constrained on analog products which are predominantly produced through internal factories. Although we no longer break them out, it was notable that in the June quarter, our FPGA revenue as well as our technology licensing royalty revenue were both up strongly and achieved new records.\nTaking a look at our revenue from a geographic and end market perspective. Americas was up 33% over the prior year quarter. Europe was up 28.4% over the prior year quarter. Asia was up 20.7% over the prior year quarter. Our major end markets remain strong and were supply constrained. Business conditions continue to be strong as viewed through our internal indicators, we expect to remain supply constrained through the rest of 2022 and into 2023. Demand continued to be insatiable despite the capacity increases we have implemented so far. As a result, our unsupported backlog, which represents backlog customers want to ship to them in the June quarter, but which we could not deliver in the June quarter climbed again.\nWe exited the June quarter with our highest unsupported backlog ever, with unsupported backlog coming in well above the actual revenue we achieved. We are cognizant of the weakening macro conditions resulting from rising inflation and the actions being taken by central banks in response. We're also aware that there is some inventory build at our customers as can be seen in their balance sheet, some of which we believe is due to strategic buffer inventory builds and some of which is due to incomplete kits or the infamous golden screw effect.\nWhile we have seen sporadic requests to push our backlog, these requests are a small fraction of the very large unsupported backlog we have over multiple quarters and hence, have not had a material impact on our business. At the same time, the level of expedites and customer escalations we're experiencing has not abated, indicating that demand and supply remain imbalanced from many customer situations. In order to best utilize the available supply and reduce customer inventory builds, we continue to thoughtfully reallocate future supply from customers who self-identify inventory positions through customers in distress with imminent (inaudible) situations.\nGiven the crosscurrents of strong internal business indicators and some uncertainty in the macro environment, we have modeled a range of potential scenarios and are monitoring our leading indicators which should enable us to take deliberate actions swiftly and early when appropriate. Our goal is to deliver a soft landing for our business if or when the softer macro environment catches up with it. And so here's how we're thinking about it. We continue to have strong PSP backlog, which is non-cancelable for at least 12 months, which comprises well over 50% of our total backlog.\nIn addition, over the last 6 months, we have entered into multiyear long-term supply agreements with a number of large customers, in effect, giving them reserved capacity in exchange for guaranteed purchases typically over 5 years. We have a significant demand cushion with unsupported backlog that is much greater than 100% of supported backlog and which can readily absorb any pushouts and cancellations.\nDistribution inventory at 19 days is low when compared to what the channel has historically required to serve customers effectively. Any business weakness will give us the opportunity to replenish depleted channel inventory and position our channel partners to respond to business growth as well as better serve customers. Our internal die bank and finished goods inventory has been substantially depleted as demand outstripped supply for the last 7 quarters. Any business weakness will enable us to replenish this inventory to better position us to support our customers.\nWe continue -- we expect continued above-average secular growth trends resulting from our focus on total system solutions and megatrends. In addition, our end market exposure is concentrated in the industrial, aerospace and defense automotive, data center and communications infrastructure markets, all of which have demonstrated much higher durability in prior cycles. With any business weakness, we expect our capital intensity will shift to the lower end or even below the lower end of our CapEx guidance of 3% to 6% of revenue, thus liberating free cash flow.\nAnd finally, as you've seen in prior cycles, we expect our variable compensation programs to buffer our operating expenses and protect our operating model. If you study Microchip's peak to trough performance through the business cycles over the last 15 years, you will observe our robust and consistent cash generation, gross margin and operating margin results. The investor presentation posted on our IR website today provides details about our performance through the business cycles. If or when there is a macro slowdown that impacts our business, we expect our cash generation, gross margin and operating margin to once again demonstrate consistency and resiliency. This will help us to continue to execute our long-term Microchip 3.0 growth strategy and insulate it from whatever short-term market challenges there may be.\nWe continue to expect constraints in our internal and external factories and the related manufacturing supply chains, we are ramping our internal factories and working closely with our supply chain partners to secure additional capacity wherever possible. We expect our capital spending in fiscal year '23 to be modestly above the 3% to 6% of revenue range we have shared with you as we respond to growth opportunities in our business. We believe our calibrated increase in capital spending will enable us to capitalize on growth opportunities, serve our customers better, increase our market share, improve our gross margin and give us more control over our destiny, especially for specialized trailing edge technologies.\nWe're also pleased to see the CHIPS and Science Act approved by Congress with bipartisan support and expect the President will sign it into law imminently. This bill is good for the semiconductor industry and for America as it enables critical investments, which will even the global playing field for U.S. companies while being strategically important for our economic and national security. We expect to be eligible to benefit from the grants under this legislation, as well as the investment tax credit provisions of the bill as we do our part to invest in ensuring U.S. economic and national security.\nNow let's get into the guidance for the September quarter. Our backlog for the September quarter is strong, and we have more capacity improvements coming into effect. Taking all the factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, we expect our net sales of the September quarter to be up between 3% and 7% sequentially, and we expect sequential revenue growth again in the December quarter. At the midpoint of our revenue guidance, our year-over-year growth for the September quarter would be a strong 25%.\nFor the September quarter, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 67.3% and 67.7% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 21.3% and 21.7% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 45.6% and 46.4% of sales, and we expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $1.42 per share and $1.46 per share. At the midpoint of our EPS guidance, our year-over-year growth for the September quarter would be a strong 34.6%.\nFinally, as you can see from our June quarter results and September quarter guidance, every element of our Microchip 3.0 strategy is firing on all cylinders as we continue to build and improve what we believe is one of the most diversified, defensible, high growth, high margin, high cash generating businesses in the semiconductor industry.\nTo summarize the essential elements of Microchip 3.0, they are organic growth -- organic revenue growth rate of 10% to 15% in the fiscal year '22 to '26 time frame by focusing on total system solutions in our 6 key market megatrends. Long-term non-GAAP operating margin target of 44% to 46% and free cash flow target of 38%, consistently increasing capital return to shareholders as net leverage drops such that 100% of free cash flow is returned to shareholders after net leverage drops to 1.5x.\nCapEx investment of 3% to 6% of revenue and inventory investment of 130 to 150 days over business cycles, and a strong company foundation that is built on culture and sustainability.\nNow let me pass baton to Steve to talk more about our cash return to shareholders. Steve?\n\nStephen Sanghi\n\nExecutive Chair, Microchip Technology Incorporated\n\nThank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. I would like to reflect on our financial results announced today and provide you further updates on our cash return strategy. Reflecting on our financial results, I continue to be very proud of all employees of Microchip, that have delivered another exceptional quarter while making new records in many respects, namely record net sales, record non-GAAP gross margin percentage, record non-GAAP operating margin percentage, record non-GAAP EPS and record adjusted EBITDA. And all of that in a very challenging supply environment.\nThe Board of Directors announced an increase in the dividend of 9.1% from last quarter to $0.31 per share. This is an increase of 37.8% from the year ago quarter. During the last quarter, we purchased $195.2 million of our stock in the open market. We also paid out $153 million in dividends. Thus, the total cash return was $348.2 million.\nThis amount was 55% of our actual free cash flow of $633.1 million during the March 2022 quarter. Our paydown of debt as well as record adjusted EBITDA drove down our net leverage at the end of June 2022 quarter to 2.05 from 2.32 at the end of March quarter.\nEver since we achieved investment-grade rating for our debt in November of 2021 and pivoted to increasing our capital return to shareholders, we have returned $1.04 billion to shareholders through June 30, 2022, by a combination of dividends and share buybacks. In the September quarter, we will use the June quarter's actual free cash flow of $718.5 million and plan to return 57.5% or $413.1 million of that amount to our shareholders.\nOut of this $413.1 million, the dividend is expected to be approximately $166.5 million and the stock buyback is expected to be approximately $246.6 million.\nWith that, operator, will you please poll for questions?"

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJames Eric Bjornholt\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Microchip Technology Incorporated\n\nThanks, Sarah, and good afternoon, everyone.\nDuring the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions, and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.\nIn attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and CEO, Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Executive Chair; and Sajid Daudi, Microchip's Head of Investor Relations. I will comment on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2022 financial performance. Ganesh will then provide commentary on our results and discuss the current business environment, as well as our guidance, and Steve will provide an update on our cash return strategy. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.\nWe are including information in our press release and this conference call, on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on our Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, and included reconciliation information in our press release, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and leverage metrics on our website.\nI will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation, and certain other adjustments as described in our press release.\nNet sales in the March quarter were $1.844 billion, which was up 4.9% sequentially, and near the high end of our quarterly guidance. We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales by product line and geography as well as our total end market demand on our website for your reference.\nGoing forward, we will only be providing GAAP net sales by product line and geography, consistent with the standard practice by our peer companies. We will continue to provide information each quarter on changes in distribution inventory levels.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record 66.6%. Operating expenses were at 21.9%, and operating income was a record 44.7%. Non-GAAP net income was a record $764.6 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was a record $1.35, $0.10 above the midpoint of our guidance, $0.07 of which was driven by favorable events in the March quarter, benefiting our cash tax expense.\nOn a GAAP basis, in the March quarter, gross margins were a record at 66.2%. Total operating expenses were $670.9 million, and included acquisition intangible amortization of $215.5 million, special charges of $9.1 million, $3.8 million of acquisition-related and other costs, and share-based compensation of $39 million. GAAP net income was $437.9 million or $0.77 per diluted share, and was adversely impacted by an $11.8 million loss on debt settlement associated with our convertible debt refinancing activities.\nOur March quarter GAAP tax expense was impacted by a variety of factors, notably the tax benefits recorded as a result of releasing the unrecognized tax benefit due to the closing of an audit in Europe.\nFor fiscal year 2022, net sales were a record $6.82 billion and were up 25.4% from net sales in fiscal year 2021. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record 65.7%. Operating expenses were 22.2% of sales and operating income was a record 43.5% of sales. Non-GAAP net income was a record $2.611 billion, and EPS was a record at $4.61 per diluted share.\nOn a GAAP basis, gross margins were a record 65.2%. Operating expenses were 38.1% of sales, and operating income was 27.1% of sales. Net income was $1.286 billion, and EPS was $2.27 per diluted share.\nOur non-GAAP cash tax rate was 1.3% in the March quarter and 4.9% for fiscal year 2022. The non-GAAP cash tax rate in the March quarter was lower than originally forecasted, due to a variety of factors, including the receipt of a tax refund that had been forecasted to receive, that had not been forecasted to be received until a later date, lower taxes in certain jurisdictions, and tax benefits from our convertible debt exchanges.\nWe expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal '23 to be between 7.5% and 11.5%, exclusive of the transition tax, any potential tax associated with restructuring the Microsemi operations into the Microchip global structure, and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. The midpoint of our June quarter tax rate guidance is 9.5%.\nOur fiscal '23 cash tax rate is higher than our fiscal '22 tax cash rate for a variety of factors, including lower availability of tax attributes, such as net operating losses and tax credits, as well as the impact of current tax rules requiring the capitalization of R&D expenses for tax purposes.\nOur inventory balance at March 31, 2022, was $854.4 million. We had 125 days of inventory at the end of the March quarter, which was up 9 days from the prior quarter's level.\nOur levels of raw materials and work in progress increased in the quarter, which helps position us for the increased production we are expecting from our internal factories and helps buffer us against unexpected shortages or changes in material lead times.\nThe carrying cost of our inventory has been and will be increasing due to the rising input costs from our supply chain. We are continuing to ramp capacity in our internal and external factories, so we can ship as much product as possible to support customer requirements.\nInventory at our distributors in the March quarter were at 17 days, which is a record low level and down from 19 days at the end of the prior quarter.\nFollowing on the heels of our upgrade to investment grade or BBB minus in the December 2021 quarter, during the March 2022 quarter, we were upgraded to the equivalent of BBB by both Moody's and Fitch, reflecting the strength of our balance sheet, financial results and our franchise.\nIn the March quarter, we exchanged a total of $64.9 million of principal value of our 2027 convertible subordinated notes for cash and shares of our common stock. We used cash generation during the quarter to fund the principal amount of the convertible debt exchanges, and we believe that these transactions will benefit stockholders by significantly reducing share count dilution to the extent our stock price appreciates over time.\nThe principal amount of convertible debt on our balance sheet at March 31 was $838.1 million. This includes $665.5 million of convertible bonds maturing in November of 2024 with the cap call option in place that offsets any potential dilution from these convertibles up to stock prices of $116.79. At the beginning of calendar year 2020, Microchip had $4.481 billion in convertible bonds outstanding. So today, our overall capital structure is in a much better long-term position.\nOur cash flow from operating activities was $747.7 million in the March quarter. Our free cash flow was $633.1 million and 34.3% of net sales. As of March 31, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $319.4 million. We paid down $205.9 million of total debt in the March quarter.\nOver the last 15 full quarters, since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down almost $5 billion of debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash, beyond dividends and stock buyback, to bring down this debt.\nWe have accomplished this despite the adverse macro and market conditions during the earlier years of this period, which we feel is a testimony to the cash generation capabilities of our business, as well as our ongoing operating discipline.\nWe continue to expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years. Our adjusted EBITDA in the March quarter was a record at $902.6 million and 48.9% of net sales. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was also a record at $3.246 billion and 47.6% of net sales. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 2.32 at March 31, 2022, down from 2.58 at December 31, 2021, and down from 3.76 at March 31, 2021.\nOur dividend payment in the March quarter was $140.8 million, and we repurchased $259.6 million of our stock during the quarter. Capital expenditures were $114.6 million in the March quarter and $370.1 million for fiscal year 2022. We had originally forecasted capital expenditures of about $140 million in the March quarter, and we experienced delays in receiving some of our capital equipment from our suppliers.\nOur expectation for capital expenditures for fiscal year 2023 is between $450 million and $550 million, as we continue to take actions to support the growth of our business and ramp our manufacturing operations.\nWe continue to prudently add capital equipment to maintain, grow and operate our internal manufacturing operations to support the expected long-term growth of our business. We expect these capital investments will bring gross margin improvement to our business, and give us increased control over our production during periods of industry-wide constraints. Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $59.3 million.\nI will now turn it over to Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the March quarter as well as our guidance for the June quarter. Ganesh?\n\nGanesh Moorthy\n\nCEO, President & Director, Microchip Technology Incorporated\n\nThank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Our March quarter results were very strong across the board, and set several records in the process. Revenue grew 4.9% sequentially and 25.7% on a year-over-year basis to achieve an all-time record of $1.84 billion.\nDespite a number of operational challenges, including the rapid spread of the COVID Omicron virus, which affected several of our factories, the shutdowns in several cities in China, and the suspension of shipments to Russia, we finished just shy of the high end of our revenue guidance. This was our fifth consecutive quarter of new revenue records.\nNon-GAAP gross margin was another record of 66.6%, up 50 basis points from the December quarter, and at the high end of our guidance, as we continue to ramp our internal factories and benefit from improved operational efficiencies as well as product mix changes. Non-GAAP operating margin was also a record at 44.7%, very close to the high end of our guidance.\nAt 21.9% operating expenses, we are 60 basis points below the low end of our long-term model of 22.5% to 23.5%. Our long-term operating expense model will continue to guide our actions to invest for the long-term growth and profitability of our business.\nOur consolidated non-GAAP diluted EPS was a record $1.35 per share, well over the high end of our guidance and up 45.2% from the year ago quarter. Even after excluding the tax benefit we received, our March quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS at $1.28, was at the high end of our guidance.\nAdjusted EBITDA at 48.9% of revenue and free cash flow at 34.3% of revenue, were both very strong in the March quarter, continuing to demonstrate the robust cash generation capabilities of our business.\nNet debt declined by $209.8 million, driving our net leverage ratio down to 2.32 in the March quarter, as we continue to relentlessly drive down our net leverage. During the March quarter, we returned $400.4 million to shareholders, representing 52.5% of the prior quarter's free cash flow.\nReflecting on our fiscal year '22 results, it was one for the record books, and one of our best years ever. We made dramatic progress on all fronts, revenue growth, gross and operating margins, earnings per share, free cash flow generation, debt and leverage reduction, and last but not least, we significantly increased the capital return to shareholders through dividend increases and the initiation of a programmatic share buyback program.\nAt our Investor Day in November 2021, we outlined our plan to increase the capital return to shareholders every quarter, as our net leverage continues to drop. We are making consistent and meaningful progress towards our net leverage growth every quarter.\nI would like to take this opportunity to profusely thank all our stakeholders, who enabled us to achieve these outstanding results, and especially thank the worldwide Microchip team for their never-give-up attitude and concerted effort to consistently deliver results to support our customers, in the face of a historic and persistent imbalance between supply and demand.\nTaking a look at our revenue from a product line perspective. Our microcontroller revenue was sequentially up a strong 7.6% as compared to the December quarter, and was another all-time record. On an annualized basis, our March quarter microcontroller revenue broke through the $4 billion mark for the first time.\nOn a year-over-year basis, our March quarter microcontroller revenue was up 28.3%. All microcontroller product lines, 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit, experienced strong growth and achieved record revenue milestones. 32-bit microcontrollers had the highest growth and is now the largest microcontroller product line for us at 46.5% of our microcontroller revenue. Microcontrollers represented 56.7% of our revenue in the March quarter.\nOur analog revenue sequentially increased 3% in the March quarter, setting another record in the process. On a year-over-year basis, our March quarter analog revenue was up a strong 24.2%. Analog represented 27.9% of our revenue in the March quarter.\nTaking a look at our revenue from a geographic and end market perspective. Americas was up 21.4% over the prior year quarter. Europe was up 25% over the prior year quarter. Asia was up 27.9% over the prior year quarter. All end markets remained strong and were supply constrained.\nBusiness conditions continue to be exceptionally strong through the quarter. Our preferred supply program, or PSP backlog, continued to grow and remained well over 50% of our aggregate backlog and 100% of our backlog in the most constrained capacity product areas.\nDemand continued to be insatiable, despite the significant capacity increases, we have implemented so far. As a result, our unsupported backlog, which represents customer backlog -- backlog that customers want to ship to them in the March quarter, but which we could not deliver in the March quarter, climbed substantially again as we exited the March quarter with our highest unsupported backlog ever.\nWe continue to experience constraints in all our internal and external factories and their related manufacturing supply chains. We are ramping our internal factories as fast as reasonably possible. And we are working closely with our supply chain partners to secure additional capacity wherever possible.\nOur supply chain partners as well as some of our customers were adversely impacted by the lockdowns in China during March, which continued into April and May. Our operations team worked to redirect our manufacturing activities and sourcing wherever possible to other locations that are not locked down.\nLooking at the magnitude of the demand supply inbound, the size of our noncancelable backlog, the rate at which new backlog continues to come in, and the rate at which we're able to bring on new capacity, we expect that we will remain supply constrained throughout 2022 and into 2023. Our growth is predominantly limited by how quickly we can bring on additional capacity to support demand.\nTo reiterate what we first shared with you in March this year, we expect our 5-year compounded annual growth rate, using fiscal year 2021 as a baseline, to be 10% to 15%. We expect our capital spending in fiscal year '23 to be at the high end of the range we have shared with you, as we respond to growth opportunities in our business as well as fill gaps in the level of capacity investments being made by our outsourced manufacturing partners in specialized technologies, they consider to be trailing edge, but which we believe will be workhorse technologies for us for many years to come.\nWe believe our calibrated increase in capital spending will enable us to capitalize on growth opportunities, serve our customers better, increase our market share, improve our gross margins, and give us more control over our destiny, especially for specialized trailing-edge technologies. We will, of course, continue to utilize the capacity available from our outsourced partners, but our goal is to be less constrained by their investment priorities in areas where they don't align with our business needs.\nNow let's get into the guidance for the June quarter. Our backlog for the June quarter is very strong, and we have more capacity improvements coming into effect. Taking all the factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, we expect our net sales for the June quarter to be up between 4% and 8% sequentially.\nOur guidance range assumes capacity additions, as well as continued materials and capacity challenges, some of which will work -- expect to work through during the quarter, others that will carry over to be worked in future quarters. We have also included the anticipated effects of the lockdowns in China on our supply chain partners as well as our customers.\nAt the midpoint of our revenue guidance, our year-over-year growth for the June quarter would be a strong 24.6%. For the June quarter, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 66.8% and 67.2% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 21.6% and 22% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP operating profit to be between 44.8% and 45.6% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $1.32 per share and $1.36 per share, after comprehending the higher tax rate that Eric shared with you.\nFinally, as you can see from our March quarter results and the June quarter guidance, every element of our Microchip 3.0 strategy is firing on all cylinders, as we continue to build and improve what we believe is one of the most diversified, defensible, high growth, high margin, high cash generating businesses in the semiconductor industry.\nTo summarize the essential elements of Microchip 3.0, they are; organic growth rate of 10% to 15% in the fiscal year '22 to '26 timeframe, by focusing on total system solutions and our 6 key market megatrends; long-term non-GAAP operating margin target of 44% to 46%, and free cash flow target of 38%; consistently increasing capital return to shareholders as net leverage drops such that 100% of free cash flow is returned to shareholders by the time net leverage drops to 1.5x; a CapEx investment of 3% to 6% of revenue, and an inventory investment of 130 to 150 days over the business cycles; and last but not least, a strong company foundation built on culture and sustainability.\nLet me now pass the baton to Steve to talk more about our cash return to shareholders. Steve?\n\nStephen Sanghi\n\nExecutive Chair, Microchip Technology Incorporated\n\nThank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. I would like to reflect on our financial results announced today and provide you further updates on our cash return strategy.\nReflecting on our financial results, I continue to be very proud of all employees of Microchip that have delivered another exceptional quarter and fiscal year, while making new records in many respects, namely record net sales, record non-GAAP gross margin percentage, record non-GAAP operating margin percentage, record non-GAAP EPS and record adjusted EBITDA, and all of that in a very challenging supply environment.\nThe Board of Directors announced an increase in the dividend of 9.1% from last quarter to $0.276 per share. This is an increase of 33.7% from a year ago quarter. During the last quarter, we purchased $259.6 million of our stock in the open market. We also paid out $140.8 million in dividends. Thus, the total cash return was $400.4 million. This amount was 52% of our actual free cash flow of $762.7 million during the December 2021 quarter.\nOur paydown of debt as well as record adjusted EBITDA, drove down our net leverage at the end of March 2022 quarter to 2.32 from 2.58 at the end of December. In the current June quarter, we will use last quarter's actual free cash flow of $633.1 million and expect to return $348.2 million, which is 55% of that amount to our shareholders. Out of this $348.2 million, the dividend is expected to be approximately $153.2 million, and the stock buyback is expected to be approximately $195 million.\nWith that, operator, will you please poll for questions?"

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJames Eric Bjornholt\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Microchip Technology Incorporated\n\nThank you, and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.\nIn attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and CEO; Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Executive Chair; and Sajid Daudi, Microchip's Head of Investor Relations. I will comment on our third quarter fiscal year 2022 financial performance. Ganesh will then provide commentary on our results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance, and Steve will provide an update on our cash return strategy. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.\nWe are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page for our website at www.microchip.com, and included reconciliation information in our press release, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and leverage metrics on our website.\nI will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our press release.\nNet sales in the December quarter were $1.76 billion, which was up 6.5% sequentially and up 30% compared to the December quarter of fiscal 2021. We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales by product line and geography, as well as our total end market demand on our website for your reference.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record at 66.1% and operating income was a record 44.6%. Non-GAAP net income was a record $681.7 million. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 6.7% in the December quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was at the high end of our guidance and was a record $1.20.\nOn a GAAP basis in the December quarter, gross margins were a record at 65.6% and include the impact of $8.4 million of share-based compensation expense. Total operating expenses were $638.3 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $215.7 million, special income of $0.3 million, $3.2 million of acquisition-related and other costs and share-based compensation of $42.5 million. GAAP net income was $352.8 million or $0.62 per diluted share and was negatively impacted by the GAAP loss on the convertible debt exchanges we executed in the quarter, which were not included in our guidance.\nOur December quarter GAAP tax expense was impacted by a variety of factors, most notably, the tax expense recorded from truing up estimated taxes to actual amounts based on tax returns filed during the quarter.\nOur inventory balance at December 31, 2021 was $768.2 million. We had 116 days of inventory at the end of the quarter, which was up 4 days from the prior quarter's level. Our levels of raw materials and work in progress increased in the quarter, which helps position us for increased production we are expecting from our internal factories and helps buffer us against unexpected shortages or changes in material lead times.\nThe days of inventory on our balance sheet go up with our gross margin improvement, with each 100 basis points of gross margin improvement translating into approximately 2 to 3 days of increased inventory on our balance sheet. The carrying cost of our inventory has been and will be increasing due to rising input costs from our supply chain. We are continuing to ramp capacity in our internal and external factories so we can ship as much product as possible to support customer requirements. Inventory at our distributors in the December quarter was at 19 days, which is a record low level and in line with where it was at the end of the prior quarter.\nDuring the December 2021 quarter, we achieved a milestone of becoming an investment-grade rated company. This is a goal we have been pursuing since we acquired Microsemi in May of 2018, and it positions us well for our capital return strategy that we detailed for investors at our Investor and Analyst Day back in November.\nIn the December quarter, we exchanged a total of $96.2 million of principal value of 2025, 2027 and 2037 convertible subordinated notes for cash and shares of our common stock. We used cash generation during the quarter to fund the principal amount of the convertible debt exchanges, and we believe that these transactions will benefit stockholders by significantly reducing share count dilution to the extent our stock price appreciates over time.\nThe principal amount of convertible debt on our balance sheet at December 31 was $903 million compared to $4.481 billion at the beginning of calendar 2020, putting our overall capital structure in a much better long-term position.\nDuring the December quarter, we also refinanced our revolving line of credit to be in line with our investment-grade rating and decrease the size of that facility from $3.6 billion to $2.75 billion. Our cash flow from operating activities was a record $853.4 million in the December quarter. Our free cash flow was a record $762.7 million and 43.4% of net sales.\nAs of December 31, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $315.5 million. We paid down $362.7 million of total debt in the December quarter. And over the last 14 full quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down almost $4.8 billion of the debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash beyond dividends and stock buyback to bring down this debt. We have accomplished this despite the adverse macro and market conditions during the earlier years of this period, which we feel is a testimony to the cash generation capabilities of our business as well as our ongoing operating discipline.\nWe continue to expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years. Our adjusted EBITDA in the December quarter was a record $869.4 million and 49.5% of net sales. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was also a record at $3 billion and 46.5% of net sales. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.58 at December 31, 2021, down from 2.99 at September 30, 2021. Our dividend payment in the September quarter was $128.7 million, and we repurchased $166 million of stock during the quarter.\nCapital expenditures were $90.7 million in the December quarter. Our expectation for the March 2022 quarter's capital expenditures is between $135 million and $145 million. Our capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 are expected to be between $390 million and $400 million.\nAs a reminder, our fiscal year 2021 capital expenditures came in lower than originally planned due to longer equipment lead times and deliveries pushing out as a result of overall industry conditions. We continue to prudently add capital equipment to maintain, grow and operate our internal manufacturing operations to support the expected long-term growth of the business. We expect these capital investments will bring gross margin improvement to our business and give us increased control over our production during periods of industry-wide constraints. Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $64.9 million.\nI will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the quarter on the performance of the business as well as our guidance for the March quarter. Ganesh?\n\nGanesh Moorthy\n\nCEO, President & Director, Microchip Technology Incorporated\n\nGreat. Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Our December quarter results continued the strength of strong growth quarters, with revenue growing 6.5% sequentially to achieve another all-time record at $1.76 billion, breaking through the $7 billion annualized revenue milestone.\nOn a year-over-year basis, our December quarter revenue was up 30%, registering the fifth consecutive quarter of rising year-over-year revenue growth rate. Non-GAAP gross margin was another record of 66.1%, up 80 basis points from 65.3% in the September quarter and above the midpoint of our guidance as we continue to ramp our internal factories and benefit from improved fixed cost absorption as well as product mix changes.\nNon-GAAP operating margin was also a record at 44.6%, up 210 basis points from 42.5% in the September quarter and well above the high end of our guidance. The large increase in operating margin percentage was helped by the rapid growth in revenue, and the additional time it is taking to hire new employees, thus delaying expected operating expenses. At 21.5% operating expenses, we're 100 basis points below the low end of our long-term model of 22.5% to 23.5% in operating expenses. Our long-term business model will continue to guide our actions to enable the long-term growth and profitability of our business.\nOur consolidated non-GAAP diluted EPS was a record $1.20 per share at the high end of our guidance and up 49% from the year ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA at 49.5% of revenue and free cash flow at 43.4% of revenue were both very strong, continuing to demonstrate the robust cash generation capabilities of our business. This, in turn, enabled us to pay down another $362.7 million in debt. It's brought down our net debt by $422.1 million, driving our net leverage ratio down to 2.58% in the December quarter. This reduction in net debt and net leverage ratio was achieved despite our also buying back $166 million of our shares under our $4 billion stock buyback program, which we initiated soon after we achieved investment-grade rating for our debt in November.\nThe December quarter marked our 125th consecutive quarter of non-GAAP profitability. And I would like to thank all our stakeholders who enabled us to achieve these outstanding and record results, and especially thank the worldwide Microchip team whose tireless efforts are what made these results possible.\nTaking a look at our revenue from a product line perspective. Our microcontroller revenue was sequentially up a strong 8.7% as compared to the September quarter and was an all-time record. On an annualized basis, our December quarter microcontroller revenue at $3.9 billion is closing in on $4 billion.\nOn a year-over-year basis, our December quarter microcontroller revenue was up 33.9%. All microcontroller product lines, 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit, had over 30% year-over-year revenue growth in the December quarter, with 32-bit microcontrollers having the highest year-over-year growth. 8-bit microcontrollers and 32-bit microcontrollers, both of which are about the same size in revenue, each also achieved record revenue milestones. Microcontrollers represented 55.3% of our revenue in the December quarter.\nComing off strong sequential growth in the September quarter, our analog revenue increased 1.9% in the December quarter, setting another record in the process. On an annualized basis, our December quarter analog revenue broke through the $2 billion mark for the first time.\nOn a year-over-year basis, our December quarter analog revenue was up 34.3%, almost the same year-over-year growth rate as our microcontroller revenue. Analog represented 28.5% of our revenue in the December quarter.\nWhile we no longer break out our FPGA or licensing revenue, they both remain a key focus for Microchip's long-term growth. In the December quarter, our FPGA revenue hit an all-time record by a wide margin, and our licensing royalty revenue also hit an all-time record.\nTaking a look at our revenue from a geographic and end market perspective. Americas was up 4.6% sequentially, Europe was up 11% sequentially, which is significantly better than typical seasonal performance for the December quarter, Asia was up 5.8% sequentially and all end markets were strong and supply-constrained.\nBusiness conditions continue to be exceptionally strong through the quarter. Our preferred supply program, or PSP backlog, continues to grow and is well over 50% of our aggregate backlog and 100% of our backlog in the most constrained capacity product areas. Demand far outpaced the capacity improvements and increased shipments we achieved in the quarter. As a result, our unsupported backlog, which represents backlog customers wanted shipped to them in the December quarter but which we could not deliver in the December quarter, continued to climb significantly as compared to the unsupported backlog exiting the September quarter.\nTo illustrate the magnitude of the demand/supply imbalance. Despite our December quarter revenue having grown 30% as compared to the year ago quarter, we exited the December quarter with the highest unsupported backlog ever. We continue to experience constraints in all our internal and external factories and their related manufacturing supply chains. We are also experiencing some adverse impact from the rapid rise in the Omicron variant cases of the COVID-19 virus. We continue to ramp our internal factories as fast as possible, and we are working closely with our supply chain partners who provide wafer foundry, assembly, test and materials to secure additional capacity wherever possible.\nLooking at the magnitude of the demand/supply imbalance, the size of our noncancelable backlog and the rate at which we're able to bring on new capacity, we continue to expect that we will remain supply-constrained throughout 2022 and possibly beyond that. We believe our backlog position, especially the proportion of PSP backlog, is giving us a solid foundation to prudently acquire constrained raw materials, invest in expanding factory capacity and hire employees to support our factory ramps.\nOur planned capital spending continues to rise in response to growth opportunities in our business as well as to fill gaps in the level of capacity investments being made by our outsourced manufacturing partners in technologies they consider to be trailing edge, but which we believe will be workhorse technologies for us for many years to come.\nIn the December quarter, we signed a definitive agreement to purchase an assembly test factory shell in the Philippines near where we already operate our manufacturing facilities. As we facilitize and build out this shell with equipment, we will be able to grow our internal back-end capacity for many years to come.\nWe believe our increase in capital spending will enable us to capitalize on growth opportunities, improve our gross margins, increase our market share and give us more control over our destiny, especially for trailing-edge technologies. We will, of course, continue to utilize the capacity available from our outsourced partners. But our goal is to be less constrained by their investment priorities in areas where they don't align with our business needs.\nNow let's get into the guidance for the March quarter. Our backlog for the March quarter is very strong, and we have more capacity improvements coming into effect. However, our supply in the March quarter is expected to be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 Omicron variant, which has increased the level of factory workforce absentees. We also have challenges in staffing in several of our factories at the rate we would like to. Taking all these factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, we expect our net sales for the March quarter to be up between 2% and 5% sequentially. Our guidance range assumes some capacity additions, as well as continued capacity constraints, some of which we expect to work during the quarter and others that we will carry over to future quarters.\nAt the midpoint of our revenue guidance, our year-over-year growth for the March quarter would be a strong 24%. For the March quarter, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 66.2% and 66.6% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 21.8% and 22.2%, and we expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 44% and 48% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $1.22 per share and $1.28 per share.\nGiven all the complications of accounting for our acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis except for net sales, which will be on a GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call.\nFinally, at our Investor Day on November 8 last year, we unveiled our Microchip 3.0 strategy, which builds on our Microchip 2.0 strategy that we successfully executed over the last decade, employing serial acquisitions to give us a solid foundation to build scale and breadth of solutions while significantly improving our gross and operating margin model.\nTo summarize, the essential elements of Microchip 3.0 we announced were: an organic growth target of 2x the industry growth by focusing on total system solutions and the 6 key market megatrends; long-term non-GAAP operating margin target of 44% to 46% and free cash flow target of 38%; increased capital return to shareholders to 50% of free cash flow and further increase this every quarter to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders as net leverage drops to 1.5x; increase our CapEx investment to 3% to 6% of revenue and invest in 130 to 150 days of inventory over the business cycles; and finally, to maintain a strong company foundation built on culture and sustainability.\nAs you can see from our December quarter results and the March quarter guidance, we are laser-focused on executing our Microchip 3.0 strategy.\nLet me now pass the baton to Steve to talk more about our capital return to shareholders. Steve?\n\nStephen Sanghi\n\nExecutive Chair, Microchip Technology Incorporated\n\nThank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to reflect on our financial results announced today and provide you further updates on our capital return strategy.\nReflecting on our financial results, I continue to be very proud of all employees of Microchip that have delivered another exceptional quarter in making new records in many respects, namely record net sales, record non-GAAP gross margin percentage, record non-GAAP operating margin percentage, record non-GAAP EPS, record cash flow from operations and record adjusted EBITDA.\nThe Board of Directors announced an increase in the dividend of 9.1% from last quarter to $0.253 per share. This is an increase of 29.7% from a year ago quarter.\nLast quarter, we received an investment-grade rating from both Moody's and Fitch. After receiving such rating, we initiated our enhanced capital return strategy that we described at our Investor and Analyst Day on November 8, 2021.\nDuring the last quarter, we purchased $166 million of our stock in the open market. We also paid out $129 million in dividends. Thus, the total cash return totaled $295 million. This was 50.1% of our free cash flow projection at the start of the quarter of $589 million, consistent with us targeting 50% of free cash flow as a return to our investors. However, our cash collections in the final month of the quarter were exceptional due to a very strong and linear shipping quarter and record non-GAAP gross and operating margins and record adjusted EBITDA being well above our forecast.\nOur actual free cash flow last quarter was $763 million, which was $174 million higher than our projection. Towards the end of the quarter, the stock buyback window had already closed. So we use the extra free cash flow towards further paying down the debt. This extra paydown of debt as well as record adjusted EBITDA drove down our December net leverage to 2.58 from 2.99 at the end of September.\nOur strategy for cash return to the shareholders was to execute it based on forecast and then true up in the following quarter. Because of the unpredictability of the free cash flow, we are simplifying the process. Going forward, we will use the actual free cash flow for the prior quarter and return our target percentage of that free cash flow to shareholders in the current quarter. So based on this revised process, we will use our last quarter's actual free cash flow of $763 million. This quarter, we plan to return 52.5% of this $763 million, which is $400 million to the shareholders. Out of this $400 million, the dividend is expected to be approximately $141 million and the stock buyback is expected to be approximately $259 million.\nI will also like to note that on January 13, 2022, Moody's further raised Microchip's unsecured debt credit rating from prior BAA3+ to the current BAA2+. As you know, Moody's BAA2 rating is equivalent to BBB on the rating scale of S&P and Fitch.\nWith that, operator, will you please poll for questions?"

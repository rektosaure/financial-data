Iger\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Walt Disney Co.\n\nThank you, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. This was another year of great progress as we strengthened the company by leveraging the value of our creative and brand assets and continue to make meaningful progress in our direct-to-consumer businesses, resulting in strong earnings growth for the company. Adjusted EPS for fiscal 2025 was up 19% from fiscal 2024. And over the past 3 fiscal years, we have delivered a 19% compound annual growth rate in adjusted EPS. Our strategy and portfolio of complementary businesses, coupled with a strong balance sheet, enable us to continue to grow adjusted EPS and free cash flow over time. For fiscal 2026, we expect to deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth compared to the prior year. The expected growth in earnings and cash flow enable us to continue investing in our businesses and to increase our return of capital to shareholders. We are targeting $7 billion in share repurchases in 2026, double the $3.5 billion we repurchased in fiscal 2025. Also pleased to announce that the Board has declared a cash dividend of $1.50 per share, a 50% increase over $1 paid to shareholders in fiscal 2025.\nBefore we take your questions, I'd like to touch on a few highlights from the quarter. First, our film studios. The summer's box office once again demonstrated the global and cross-generational appeal of our storytelling and IP. To date, Disney's live action Lilo & Stitch remains the highest grossing Hollywood film at the global box office this calendar year, and its success has extended across our interconnected businesses and consumer touch points. The film achieved 14.3 million views during its first 5 days on Disney+, becoming the second biggest Disney live action premier on the platform ever. Retail sales for Stitch from our Consumer Products business also continues to grow, eclipsing $4 billion in fiscal 2025. The popularity of this global phenomenon underscores the franchise's enduring strength and the effectiveness of our strategy to invest in popular stories and characters. Over the past 2 years, our studios have delivered 4 global franchise hits that have earned more than $1 billion each. While no other Hollywood studio has achieved a single one during the same period.\nAdditionally, with the strong opening of Predator: Badlands, the biggest opening in the franchise's nearly 40-year history, the Walt Disney Studios has now crossed the $4 billion mark at the global box office for the fourth consecutive year. Heading into the holiday season, we're excited to bring audiences Zootopia 2 and Avatar: Fire and Ash. Looking ahead, next year's slate includes numerous highly anticipated titles, such as the Devil Wears Prada 2, the Mandalorian and Grogu, Toy Story 5, the live action Moana and Avengers Dooms Day. We saw a strong viewership of our television content in Q4, fueled by series such as Alien Earth, FX's biggest premier ever on Disney+ and Hulu, Season 2 of High Potential, the #1 original broadcast series across all platforms among adults 18 to 49. The Korean global hit Tempest and Season 34 of ABC's Dancing with the Stars, which made history as the only fall show to increase its overall audience for 6 straight weeks following a season premiere. Something that's never been achieved by any show since Nielsen began electronic measurement in 1991.\nAnd we have more highly anticipated titles to come over the next few months including new seasons of Paradise, the Secret Lives of Modern Wives, Percy Jackson the Olympians, American Idol and the revival of the comedy Scrubs. We're also excited to bring viewers Taylor Swift's End of the Era Docuseries, as well as the concert film Taylor Swift, the Eros tour, the final show. In our Entertainment segment, our streaming business had another quarter of profit growth with operating income up 39% in Q4. For the full year, we hit $1.3 billion in operating income, up $1.2 billion from last year and $300 million ahead of our original guidance. That is a significant achievement when you consider that just 3 years ago, our DTC business was running a $4 billion operating loss. As we continue to build DTC into a core growth engine, we're rolling out a more unified app experience to better serve our consumers and unlock new value. In October, Hulu became our global general entertainment brand, and we continue to work to consolidate all of our entertainment content domestically within a single app, which will simplify the user experience highlight the full value of our bundles and unlock global marketing efforts. We're also expanding our international reach by investing strategically in our own originals and working with local studios to license content that brings more high-quality local storytelling to the platform. We're taking a disciplined approach to the markets we are prioritizing, and we have confidence in our long-term strategy.\nTurning to Sports. We ushered in a new era with the launch of ESPN's full direct-to-consumer service and enhanced the ESPN app, making ESPN's full suite of networks and services available directly for the first time. We're thrilled by the response from fans so far, especially to the upgraded ESPN app, which now includes features such as MultiView, Sports Center for you catch up to live and tools like live game stats, bedding, fantasy sports and commerce integration. Viewership of our industry-leading portfolio of live sports also remains robust with ratings across ESPN networks, including ESPN on ABC, finishing the quarter up 25% over the prior year quarter. In our Experiences segment, we delivered record operating income for both Q4 and the full year with operating income up 13% for the fourth quarter compared to the prior year and up 8% for the full year. We're looking forward to 2 new cruise ships joining our fleet in the coming months. The Disney Destiny, which sets sail next week and the Disney Adventure, which will become our first ship homeported in Asia when it launches in March. This will bring our fleet to a total of 8 cruise ships.\nAnd in the spring, we're excited to open a World of Frozen at Disneyland Paris. With expansion projects underway at every 1 of our theme parks five additional cruise ships scheduled for launch beyond fiscal '26 and a new theme park planned for Abu Dhabi, the strategic investments we are making now will help ensure our offerings remain best-in-class and appeal to audiences worldwide well into the future. Overall, this quarter caps another strong fiscal year for the company. We continue to execute across our strategic priorities as we build for the future deliver the very best in entertainment and create value to shareholders.\nAnd with that, Hugh and I will be happy to take your questions.\n\nCarlos A. Gomez\n\nExecutive Vice President of Corporate Finance & Treasurer\n\nThanks, Bob. As we transition to Q&A, we ask that you please try to limit yourselves to 1 question in order to help get to as many analysts as possible today. And with that, Rocco, we are ready to take the first question.",

Following introductory remarks from Bob, we will be happy to take your questions. So with that, I will now turn the call over to Bob.\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThank you, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. Before we take your questions, I'd like to share some updates related to our strategic priorities, including a few exciting announcements. At a time of great change for our industry, when a number of companies are contracting, we are operating from a position of strength and building across our company with a continued focus on quality and innovation. We are building on the creative success at our film studios, resulting in the continued emergence of popular new franchises at a level that is unparalleled in the industry. We are building on Disney's value proposition in streaming by combining Hulu into Disney+ to create a unified app\nexperience featuring branded and general entertainment, news, and sports, resulting in a one-of-a-kind entertainment destination for subscribers.\nWe are building ESPN into the preeminent digital sports platform with our highly anticipated direct-to-consumer sports offering launching on 21 August, and our just-announced plans with the NFL that will expand ESPN's programming and content offerings for fans. We are building on our best-in-class parks and experiences businesses with more expansions underway around the world than at any other time in our history. I'd like to dive deeper into the steps we're taking to drive growth for our company, beginning with our film studios. Our renewed momentum continued in Q3, adding to our popular brands and franchises and further demonstrating their ability to\ngenerate ongoing long-term value across our businesses. The live-action Lilo & Stitch recently crossed the $1 billion mark at the worldwide box office, making it Hollywood's first film to reach that milestone this year and Disney's fourth billion-dollar film in just over a year.\nLilo & Stitch is on track to become the company's second-largest consumer products merchandise franchise this year, behind only Mickey Mouse, with more than 70% revenue growth compared to last year. Meanwhile, Marvel's The Fantastic Four: First Steps opened to rave reviews two weeks ago, successfully launching this important franchise into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And later in the calendar year, we will release more highly anticipated titles, including Zootopia 2 and Avatar: Fire and Ash. Turning to our streaming business, today we are announcing a major step forward in strengthening our streaming offering by fully integrating Hulu into Disney+. This will create an\nimpressive package of entertainment pairing the highest-caliber brands and franchises, great general entertainment, kids' programming, news, and industry-leading live sports content, all in a single app.\nBy creating a differentiated streaming offering, we will be providing subscribers tremendous choice, convenience, quality, and enhanced personalization, while at the same time continuing to grow profitability and margins in our entertainment streaming business through expected higher engagement, lower churn, operational efficiencies, and greater advertising revenue potential. As we detail in our shareholder letter, Hulu will now become our global general entertainment brand, and in the fall, it will replace the Star tile on Disney+ internationally. Over the coming months, we will be implementing improvements within the Disney+ app, including exciting new features and a more\npersonalized homepage, all of which will culminate with a unified Disney+ and Hulu streaming app experience that will be available to consumers next year.\nThe other key component of our streaming strategy is sports, and on 21 August, we will launch ESPN's direct-to-consumer offering, making ESPN's full suite of networks and services directly available to fans for the first time. The enhanced ESPN App will be a sports fan's dream, with key new features planned for launch, such as multi-view, enhanced personalization, integration of stats, betting, fantasy sports, and commerce, and a personalized SportsCenter. Fans with subscriptions to the Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN bundle will be able to watch ESPN content directly inside Disney+. In addition, yesterday, ESPN and the NFL announced plans for ESPN to acquire NFL Network and\ncertain other media assets owned and controlled by the NFL. In exchange, the NFL will receive a 10% equity stake in ESPN.\nThis announcement paves the way for the world's leading sports media brand and America's most popular sport to deliver an even more compelling experience for NFL fans in a way that only ESPN and Disney can. Separately, ESPN and the NFL reached an agreement which includes expanded NFL highlight rights within multiple fan engagement platforms and more interactive features for ESPN's DTC offering and the ESPN App, including betting and fantasy. ESPN will also gain the ability to sell and bundle NFL+ Premium, which includes NFL RedZone, to ESPN DTC subscribers, along with rights to additional non-exclusive preseason NFL games for its DTC offering, both starting in\nthe 2025 season. An additional agreement extends ESPN's NFL draft rights with the ability to stream ESPN and ABC's draft coverage on ESPN DTC, Hulu, and Disney+.\nWe're also excited to announce that ESPN will be the exclusive home for WWE Premium Live Events, further expanding ESPN's rights portfolio, and we look forward to sharing more soon. Looking to our experiences segment, expansion projects are underway across every one of our theme parks globally, from a new World of Frozen land opening at Disneyland Paris in 2026, to the Villains and Cars-themed areas at Magic Kingdom, to a Monsters, Inc. area at Disney's Hollywood Studios, to an Avatar-themed destination at Disney California Adventure, in addition to a new theme park coming to Abu Dhabi. Disney Cruise Line continues to grow as we prepare for the launch of two\nnew ships later this year.\nThe Disney Destiny and the Disney Adventure are our largest ship ever and the first to be docked in Asia, bringing our fleet to a total of eight cruise ships operating around the globe. Taken in their totality, our efforts across the entire company reinforce that Disney operates in a league of its own, with a robust portfolio of growth businesses that work seamlessly together to generate value, supported by a deep library of beloved IP, and enabled with cutting-edge technology. With ambitious plans ahead for all of our businesses, we're not done building, and we remain optimistic about the company's trajectory. With that, Hugh and I would be happy to take your questions.\n\nCarlos Gómez\n\nEVP, Treasurer, and Head of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, Bob. As we transition to Q&A, we ask that you please try to limit yourselves to one question in order to help us get to as many questions today as possible. And with that, operator, we are ready for the first question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And as a reminder, it's star, then one to ask a question. Our first question today comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nBen Swinburne\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks. Good morning. A lot of news to digest this morning. Bob, I guess I'd love to hear a little more on the NFL relationship. Clearly, strategically aligning with that league is good for ESPN. I think that's pretty obvious. But you gave up 10% of the network from a value point of view. How does this agreement and the content you're getting help Jimmy grow that business faster? Can you talk a little bit about how you see this playing out in terms of revenue growth, subscriber growth, and the benefits you think it means to the business? I just wanted to check with Hugh, is the 2026 guidance that you've given in the past still intact? So double-digit EPS growth and low single-digit growth OI\nat sports, given all the stuff we learned today. Thank you very much.\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nBen, there are a number of aspects of these deals, and I say plural because there are two separate deals, one to license content and another to basically cover the asset exchange. Let me start with the fact that the result of these agreements will give ESPN more games, more NFL games than they've ever had before. Basically, there will be 28 windows for NFL games, which is an increase over what we've had before. Previously, there were 22. That obviously is of major significance in terms of both ESPN, but also in terms of the audience. We're basically giving ESPN, we're giving NFL fans more opportunities to watch NFL games than they've ever had before.\nBecause of the acquisition of the NFL Network, not only will we continue to distribute it from a linear perspective, but it will be fully essentially included in or ingested within the ESPN direct-to-consumer app. So those games, the seven games that are on the, will be on the NFL Network, will all be part of ESPN's direct-to-consumer offering. That's obviously where the major value will come. But in addition to that, there's a number of other elements we're calling features and functionality that will improve the quality of the experience and actually grow the quality experience of the fan on the ESPN App. And that includes smooth integration with fantasy, with betting, and a\ncombination of our fantasy businesses, by the way, with stats, with the ability to basically personalize SportsCenter with NFL highlights. I co`uld go on and on.\nA commerce opportunity off of the ESPN App to buy NFL merchandise. All of it added up, obviously, gives ESPN the opportunity to go forward with a more compelling app. But I should also note that from an economic perspective, even with this exchange of assets and the fact that the NFL obviously will be paid a dividend from ESPN's earnings, it will be accretive in the first year after it closes. I think that's significant. So that the revenue that we will derive from distributing the NFL Network and from distributing other NFL properties will obviously increase our revenue and increase our operating income for the ESPN business. That does not even factor in a potentially lowered churn rate\nfor the ESPN App once we go to market and once the NFL games are all included. Obviously, there's advertising value as well.\nI probably could go on and on, but there are many different elements to this, but it's extremely exciting. I've talked about it being one of the most important steps ESPN has taken, really, since they went from half a season to a full season of the NFL back in 1987.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nSenior EVP and CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nYeah. Hey, Ben, it's Hugh. Just as a reminder, we try to stay pretty disciplined about doing guidance for the following year on the fourth quarter call. The one thing I would say is, given we have the NFL deal and the WWE deal, if we had something of substance in terms of a change to that, we'd be sharing that with you right now. The fact that we're not sharing with that should tell you that we don't see it as materially different. And as Bob noted, we feel great about the NFL deal. It likely won't close until the end of next calendar year, but it'll be about $0.05 accretive before purchase accounting. So we certainly feel good about the financials of the deal.\n\nBen Swinburne\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you so much.\n\nCarlos Gómez\n\nEVP, Treasurer, and Head of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, Ben. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. Our next question comes from Robert Fishman at MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\n\nRobert Fishman\n\nSenior Research Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nThank you. Bob, can you talk more about how you can accelerate DTC growth by fully integrating Hulu into Disney+ and the related subscriber and advertising revenue opportunities? Just curious also, what does that mean for the future of Hulu as a standalone app? And then for Hugh, if I can, just again, back to the guidance, the strong DTC profitability and raised full-year guidance that we saw there, any updated thinking to your double-digit margin target there on DTC, especially with the opportunity to take out costs at Hulu now? Thank you.\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nI think the way to look at the combination is to start with the consumer. You're going to end up with a far better consumer experience when those apps are combined. By combining all of the program assets of both apps, both card apps, and obviously, with an improved consumer experience comes the ability to lower churn, which is obviously something that we're very, very focused on and committed to doing. We obviously will deliver efficiencies when these are together. They'll be on one tech stack, as, for instance, one tech platform. We already sell the advertising together, but this will give our sales organization a chance to package them far more effectively than\nthey have before. I imagine down the road it may give us some price elasticity as well that we haven't had before.\nIt also provides us with a tremendous bundling experience because, when you have the one app that has a significant amount of all of the Disney and the other Disney-branded programming with the general entertainment programming bundled, for instance, with the ESPN direct-to-consumer app, I think you end up with a proposition from not only a consumer perspective, but also from our perspective that's far better than what we've had before.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nSenior EVP and CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nYeah. And Robert, no update on the guidance versus what we've talked about in the past. As I said, we'll talk about 2026 guidance on the Q4 call, but no update on DTC at this point.\n\nCarlos Gómez\n\nEVP, Treasurer, and Head of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, Robert. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. Our next question comes from Michael Morris at Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Morris\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim\n\nThank you. Good morning, guys. So Hugh, I know you don't want to talk about 2026 yet, but I have to ask. On the experiences side, your guide for the fourth quarter implies that you'll be exiting the year at a high in terms of operating income growth. So as we look to fiscal 2026, can you give us any preview on how to think about any puts or takes with respect to the rate of growth next year that might be informed by the fourth quarter guide? And then secondly, on the standalone ESPN App, I think there's a perception and a fear that when you launch an app like this, it's sort of all or nothing with respect to how people sign up. But clearly, you're going to make it available to your\npay-TV partners as well.\nSo I'm curious if you can talk about your expectations for engagement with the app from people who come from outside the ecosystem, like cord cutters versus those inside, and how it benefits you to have people who pay for pay-TV to also engage with the app. Thank you.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nSenior EVP and CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nOkay. Let me talk about 2026. It'll, I'm sure, shock you, Michael, that I'm going to defer on talking about 2026 until the Q4 call. The only thing I would remind you is we are launching a couple of ships at the tail end of this year and into next year. So we'll have the cost associated with launch on those in the earlier part of the year, which obviously impacts the line of business. Regarding engagement generally with the deals and the ESPN App, we think it's all going to be additive. And as a reminder, our goal with the ESPN is to basically reach sports fans as they choose to be reached. So if they choose to be reached through the ESPN app, great. If they choose to be reached through the\nDisney+ Hulu app, great. If they choose to be reached through cable, great.\nOur goal is to engage them where they are.\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nAnd let me just add to that, if you don't mind, because we're asked a lot about linear versus streaming. We're at a point, given the way we're operating our businesses, where we don't really look at being in the linear business and the streaming business. We're in the television business. And what we're doing is we're giving our customers or our viewers a chance to watch our programming, really, as Hugh just said, wherever they want. If you're watching ABC primetime shows on the linear channel, great, through a multi-television provider, fantastic. Or if you want to go to streaming and watch it on the Disney+ and Hulu app, that's fine as well. The same is true for National Geographic, for\nFX, for the Disney Channel. And that will also be true for ESPN.\nNow, I will say that the features and functionality of the ESPN App will have more on them or in the app than obviously any linear channel can provide. It will really be a sports fan's dream in terms of everything they'll be able to do and watch on that channel. There'll also be a far greater volume of sports covered on the ESPN App than is covered on their linear channels. But we are, generally speaking, as a company now, operating these businesses completely as one. And that gives us an opportunity to not only run them more efficiently, but to aggregate sub-fees and advertising revenue across a very, very broad range of television distribution platforms.\n\nMichael Morris\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim\n\nThank you. Appreciate it.\n\nCarlos Gómez\n\nEVP, Treasurer, and Head of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, Mike. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. And our next question comes from Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nSteven Cahall\n\nSenior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks. So first on experiences, I think fiscal year to date, OI is up about 7%, and you raised the guidance to 8%. Hugh, I think on CNBC this morning, you were talking about the strong domestic per caps, which accelerated nicely in the quarter. So could you give us a little color as to what you're seeing in both domestic parks and cruises that's driving some of that acceleration into the fiscal Q4? It sounds like things there are pretty good, but there's always a little bit of economic uncertainty. And then a different fiscal 2026 question that maybe you can address. So you have some new sports rights coming on. How do we think about overall cash content spend next year? My guess is\nsports are going to be going up with things like WWE. And then, of course, content is the lifeblood of the company.\nAny good way to think about content spend as we look out for the next 12 months or so? Thank you.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nSenior EVP and CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nYeah. Good morning. A couple of things. In terms of experiences, obviously, we really have a terrific portfolio of experiences businesses. As I mentioned this morning, Walt Disney World just had a record Q3 revenue number as we emerged from last quarter. So we certainly feel great about that. In addition to that, the Disneyland Paris business, we expect to do very well. As a reminder, we have some easier overlaps due to the Olympics last year. But in addition to those laps, the business is performing strongly. China, as we've noted on past calls, is a little bit challenged, not so much from an attendance perspective, but from per caps perspective, as there's some stress\nwith the China consumer. And then in addition to that, the cruise ships are doing extremely well right now.\nForward bookings look great, and we're running at very high occupancies in terms of the cruise ships. In terms of thinking about bookings for experiences for the fourth quarter, right now they're up about 6%. So we certainly feel positively about that as well. As regards cash content spend for 2026, I know you're going to be shocked at this, but I'm going to defer on talking about that until the Q4 call.\n\nCarlos Gómez\n\nEVP, Treasurer, and Head of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, Steve. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, sir. And next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThank you. One follow-up on experiences and then maybe move on to content. So on experiences, I know everyone's trying to get some guidance for next year, but you do have a ship launching in Singapore, a large ship. Can you talk about how you see the impact of that, moving to another region, another side of the world, and how you think about the impact of that ship on pretty much all of Disney's businesses? And then on content, you've given positive commentary, but the guide indicates very tough Q4. Can you talk a little bit about the ins and outs of what you see in content in the year ahead?\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nRegarding the ship in Singapore launching out of Singapore, Jessica, that's the biggest ship that we've ever built. To give it some perspective, our big ships today sail with about 4,000 passengers each. This will sail with about 7,000 passengers. We've said in previous calls that sales, when we went to the market and started selling trips on this ship, were extremely robust, sold out very, very quickly over, I think, the first two quarters of operation. This will give us an opportunity to basically sail or float the Disney brand in all of its glory into a region that we think has huge Disney brand affinity, and it creates a huge opportunity for us. It's a floating, essentially, ambassador for the Disney brand\nbecause if you've been on any one of our ships, particularly the new ones, we effectively use our IP built into the entire experience.\nAnd so I think this will create a great opportunity for us in Asia, but particularly in Southeast Asia.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nSenior EVP and CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nHi, Jessica. Yeah. Regarding your question on content, I assume you're asking generally about CSL&O and entertainment in Q4. The thing I would remind you of is we will be overlapping Inside Out 2 from last year, which is obviously a tough comp. But all of that is considered in the guide that we gave you of 585 for the overall company for the year.\n\nCarlos Gómez\n\nEVP, Treasurer, and Head of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, Jessica. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Karnovsky\n\nSenior Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Thank you. I wanted to follow up on your comments regarding theatrical franchises. Disney's had great success recently with sequels and reboots. I'm interested, though, in how you think about launching new IP into today's exhibition market. Is it a fair comment that that's a tougher proposition than in the past? And then separately for Hugh, it might be early, but can you discuss or even quantify potential tax benefits at Disney from the Big Beautiful Bill in return of 100% Bonus Depreciation? Thanks.\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThank you, David. We continue to be focused on creating new IP. Obviously, that's of great value to us long term. But we also know that the popularity of our older IP remains significant, and the opportunities to either produce sequels, or to basically bring them forward in a more modern way, as we've done, or convert what was previously animation to live action, like we're doing with Moana in 2026, is just a great opportunity for the company and supports our franchise. So I wouldn't say that we've got a priority one way or the other. Our priority is to put out great movies that ultimately resonate with consumers. The more we can find and develop original property, the better, of\ncourse. We are developing original property for under the 20th Century Fox banner and under the Searchlight banner.\nAnd look, you could even argue that Marvel continues to mine its library of characters for original property. Even though, for instance, there have been Fantastic Four movies before, we kind of consider the one that we did an original property in many respects because we're introducing those characters to people who are not familiar with them at all.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nSenior EVP and CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nYeah. And regarding.\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\n[inaudible]\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nSenior EVP and CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nRegarding tax, I assume you're asking about the impact of OB3. Basically, from a book tax perspective, it won't have any material impact on the company. From a cash perspective, it will be a positive to us. Again, we'll talk about that more on the Q4 call, but we do expect a positive cash tax impact, which obviously benefits us from a cash flow perspective.\n\nCarlos Gómez\n\nEVP, Treasurer, and Head of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, David. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. Our next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nTelecom and Cable Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thank you. Maybe just following up on the ESPN launch. Given the attractive pricing for the service from an ESPN D2C bundle standpoint, can the launch of the ESPN platform accelerate growth on the D2C side, either from a subscriber standpoint or from an engagement standpoint? Thanks.\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThe answer is absolutely. We won't predict exactly how much, but for $29.99, you can get Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN, which is an incredible, incredible bargain for the consumer. We would hope that that will enable us to grow our subbase. Additionally, with ESPN and all of its programming bundled with Hulu and Disney+, we fully expect that engagement will increase as well, which we know is one of the key ways that you can reduce churns. We're very excited about those prospects. The other thing we haven't even touched upon is that with the NFL deal, we have the ability to bundle NFL+ Premium service, which includes RedZone digitally. We'll bundle that with the trio bundle of\nDisney+, Hulu, and ESPN, and with ESPN. That's also an opportunity to lower churn, increase engagement across basically the apps that we'll be selling.\n\nCarlos Gómez\n\nEVP, Treasurer, and Head of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nGreat. Thank you. Thanks, John. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. And our next question today comes from Kutgun Maral with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nKutgun Maral\n\nDirector, Evercore ISI\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I have a follow-up on the cruise line, maybe not just the Disney Adventure, but more broadly about the business where you've laid out a transformational roadmap with the fleet set to double over the coming years. It feels like we're nearing a major inflection point, particularly with the Disney Treasure launched last December and both the Destiny and Adventure coming online later this calendar year. As we work through trying to better understand the financial implications, can you help frame the opportunity ahead? I'm not trying to tease out 2026 guidance, and I understand that it might be too early to give\nspecifics and that there are still unknowns around pricing, maybe cannibalization, and margins. I'm not sure if we should look at the current fleet's economics per ship or maybe stateroom and apply them to what you have coming ahead.\nBut the point is more that even with conservative assumptions, the potential operating income contributions look quite meaningful. So I would appreciate any views you could share. Thank you.\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nHugh, I'll let you handle the economic side of that question. Let me just point out a few, I think, salient points regarding the expansion of the cruise ship line. First of all, we've discovered that many of the people who sail on our current ships have such a great experience that they are the first to want to sail on our new ships. So interestingly enough, what we're getting is, in effect, repeat visitation onto new ships. So when we're building a bigger base of consumers, it's also one of the best experiences that we offer across our experiences business. So that's one way to look at it. The other way to look at it, which I referenced with regard to Singapore, is that there are many destinations\nin the world that we haven't visited.\nAnd this gives us an opportunity to not only bring our brand to those destinations, but to attract customers from those regions who may want to sail in their region. And so by expanding, we feel we expand the business in terms of our access to people around the world. And we also give people who have sailed on our current ships an opportunity to sail again, but with a different experience because they're on a new ship.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nSenior EVP and CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nRight. From a financial perspective, the best way to think about it, I think, really is in the multi-year guidance that we gave you back last fall for the experiences business. Obviously, we don't break out cruise ships, but we did contemplate all of the builds that we had coming on as a part of providing that guidance. The thing I can tell you in addition to that is, and as Bob noted, our cruise ships continue to be incredibly well received. As we sit here today, we're already basically half booked out for all of next year, and the newer ships are even higher in that regard. So we feel terrific from the perspective of consumer receptivity to our new offerings.\n\nCarlos Gómez\n\nEVP, Treasurer, and Head of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, Kutgun. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. Our next question today comes from Peter Supino with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nPeter Supino\n\nSenior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHello, good morning. I wondered if you could comment on engagement trends regarding or of your existing subscribers on Disney+ and Hulu and how your current DTC strategies could contribute to those trends. And then a related longer-term question, not a 2026 guidance question. Your DTC segment reported 6% operating margins. As DTC surpasses your 10% margin objective, is there an opportunity to accelerate DTC content spending for the sake of market share over the long run? Thank you.\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nWell, I'll take the first part. Maybe I'll take the second too. When we gave people an opportunity to have a more seamless experience between Disney+ and Hulu, we saw engagement increasing. We would hope that when we take this next step, which is basically full integration, that that engagement will go up even more. In addition to that, we've implemented a number of technological improvements that are designed to increase engagement. We're really pleased with what we're seeing already, but we also know that it's still a work in progress, and we have a lot more work to do. For instance, just the strength of our recommendation engine. We're also experimenting like crazy\nwhere we're basically trying different elements out on consumers and getting data back from them in order to figure out what works the best.\nThat includes basically the homepage experience and basically what they see when they open up an app. In addition, we've added streams, which was a technological advancement. There are some great streams. You can watch, I think, 35 seasons or whatever it is of The Simpsons on one stream, for instance. That's also something that increases engagement. There's an ABC News stream that you can watch. So there's some news on all the time on the service. So what we're basically doing is, by one, combining them, we hope to increase engagement more. Two, with all the technological advances, we will increase engagement more. In addition to that, as it relates to content\nspend, I'd say that from a domestic perspective, you shouldn't expect that we need to increase the spend on content significantly. Where we believe we should be investing is to grow our international businesses.\nSo one, we're going to brand the general entertainment from Star to Hulu across the world, for instance. Two, these technological advancements will obviously help in markets where our engagement has not been as high as they need to be. Three, we probably will invest in very selected markets internationally where we really feel there's a potential to grow our bottom line, to grow subs, to grow advertising revenue, and to grow our bottom line.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nSenior EVP and CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nYeah. The only thing I'll add to Bob's comments are our objective with this business is to maximize OI over time through a growth-oriented strategy, not through cost management, although we'll manage cost effectively. Through growing this business, we have a significant opportunity in the US to grow through higher engagement. Internationally, we have a significant penetration opportunity. As we grow engagement and reduce churn in the US, that presents opportunities from a marketing spend perspective, some of which can be basically reinvested into international content. Our intent is to do that through a rifle shot approach with specific markets. We intend to be\ndeep rather than broad in terms of the way that we do that in a number of markets around the world. As a result of that, I would tell you, we certainly don't intend to stop at 10 margin.\nWe think there's still lots of margin opportunity once we hit double digits, but we're going to do it through a growth-oriented strategy, not through a cost-oriented strategy.\n\nCarlos Gómez\n\nEVP, Treasurer, and Head of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, Peter. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today comes from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Ng\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. I just have one on domestic theme park trends. The per caps in the quarter were up 8% year-over-year. I think that was the best growth in over two years. I was just wondering if you could talk about whether the per cap growth was impacted by the mix of attendance between local, out-of-state, and international. Were there any divergent attendance trends between those cohorts of domestic park patrons, just given the noise around competitive park openings and international visitation to the United States? Thank you.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nSenior EVP and CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nYeah. Hey, Mike. In terms of the mix of visitors, that's obviously one of the factors that plays into per caps. That said, the ones that you mentioned specifically, international, nothing material going on there. It's always going to be a mix of sort of local versus visitors from elsewhere. And there isn't a particularly material trend that's worth trying to model or worth trying to note. Overall, we feel good certainly about the per caps, but frankly, we feel good about the attendance as well. In light of the fact that there's a competitive offering in the marketplace, the fact that attendance came in as well as it did is something that we feel terrific about. So overall, as we've talked about in the past, the\nintent is to grow through both increased attendance and increased per caps in a balanced way.\nI expect that's what we're going to continue to do.\n\nCarlos Gómez\n\nEVP, Treasurer, and Head of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nGreat.\n\nMike Ng\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you, Hugh.\n\nCarlos Gómez\n\nEVP, Treasurer, and Head of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nOperator, one question. Last question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question today comes from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nKannan Venkateshwar\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nThank you. Bob, with respect to the sports offering, in terms of your go-to-market strategy, what we see right now, how close is that to the potential end state? And is there an opportunity maybe to tier the product now that you have products like RedZone, for instance, as a pay-per-view offering or a separate tier? Or even bundling with others like Fox launching their own sports offering, for instance, is that an opportunity for you to bundle other sports offerings in the market and consolidate streaming more broadly?\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nYes. We believe there may be opportunities for us to bundle other companies' sports offerings. We've actually had some discussions with some other companies on doing just that. Nothing to report on that. But obviously, we're not only interested in growing engagement and growing our own subs, but we're interested in serving consumers better as well. And the more sports can be offered in one destination for the consumer, or if we can improve the ease of use for consumers, ease of finding things, because as a devoted sports fan, I often have to work to try to find what platform sports are on. If we can help that, if we can help consumers in that regard, we're certainly going to try.\n\nCarlos Gómez\n\nEVP, Treasurer, and Head of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nOkay. Thanks, everyone, for the questions. We want to thank you again for joining us this morning and wish everyone a good rest of the day.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes the conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.\nGoodbye.",

Joining me this morning are Bob Iger, Disney's Chief Executive Officer, and Hugh Johnston, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following introductory remarks from Bob, we will be happy to take your questions. With that, I will now turn the call over to Bob.\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nIn the 102-year history of The Walt Disney Company, there have been many defining moments and countless achievements. One such moment was the opening of Disneyland in 1955. Now, 70 years later, having entertained 4 billion guests across six Disney theme park destinations around the world, we are celebrating another great moment in our storied history. I am joining you from the United Arab Emirates, where we just announced an agreement to bring a Disney theme park to Abu Dhabi. Disneyland Abu Dhabi will be authentically Disney and distinctly Emirati. It will serve as an oasis of extraordinary Disney entertainment for millions and millions of people in this crossroads of the world, connecting travelers from the Middle East and Africa, India, Asia, Europe, and beyond.\nThis seventh Disney theme park resort will rise from the shores of this land in spectacular fashion, blending wonderful Disney stories and characters with the cultures and tastes of this country and this region. It will combine contemporary architecture and cutting-edge technology with the timeless magic of Disney to offer guests deeply immersive experiences in unique and modern ways. As part of our new strategic partnership with the Miral Group of Abu Dhabi, Disney will oversee design, license our IP, and provide operational expertise, while Miral will provide the capital, construction resources, and operational oversight. Our Imagineering team is already hard at work designing this large and very special destination that will become a source of joy and inspiration for generations to come.\nThis is my third visit to Abu Dhabi in the last nine months, and each time I gain more appreciation and respect for the UAE government, the government of Abu Dhabi, for our partners at Miral, and for the people and the culture of Abu Dhabi. As we prepare to embark on this exciting new addition to our experiences portfolio, we already have more expansion projects underway domestically and around the world than at any time in our history. That includes investing more than $30 billion in our theme parks in Florida and California to enhance our offerings, create jobs, and support the US economy. Our focus must always be on building for tomorrow, as much as it is on managing for today. That eye to the future and driving growth is central to the important work we've done advancing our four strategic priorities.\nLooking at our Q2 results, we're making excellent progress. We had a very strong Q2 with adjusted EPS up 20% from the prior year, rounding out a solid first half of fiscal 2025. Our experiences segment delivered strong results this quarter, driven by the outstanding performance from our domestic businesses. Investments in this segment have delivered impressive returns on invested capital, with returns from our experiences businesses at all-time highs. Experiences is obviously a critical business for Disney and also an important growth platform. Despite questions around any macroeconomic uncertainty or the impact of competition, I'm encouraged by the strength and resilience of our business, as evidenced in these earnings and in the second-half bookings at Walt Disney World. Our entertainment business, including movies, television series, news, and sports, continues to generate strong growth. Our feature films continue to enjoy success at the global box office.\nThunderbolts from Marvel Studios opened this past week, and it is currently the number one movie in the world and the best-reviewed Marvel film in the last few years. We are also excited about our upcoming theatrical slate for the remainder of the calendar year, including the live-action Lilo & Stitch, Pixar's Elio, Marvel's The Fantastic Four: First Steps, Freakier Friday, Zootopia 2 from Walt Disney Animation Studios, and the spectacular Avatar: Fire and Ash. We're also quite pleased with the performance of our general entertainment and news programming. Finally, sports viewership trends continue to be healthy.\nESPN's Q2 primetime audience, among the key 18 to 49 demographic, was up 32%, making it ESPN's most watched Q2 in primetime ever, driven by ESPN's fantastic programming, including NFL and college football, the NCAA women's basketball tournament, and other exciting events, all of which is giving us optimism as we head into the upfront next week. Meanwhile, we are only a few months away from the launch of ESPN's exciting new direct-to-consumer product offering, and we look forward to sharing pricing and timing details very soon. Overall, our expansive portfolio of high-quality content and programming is enabling us to continue to grow revenue and profitability in our streaming business. Streaming remains a key priority and a core growth platform for Disney.\nAs we move forward, our improvements in the product will continue to enhance the user experience, increase engagement, and reduce churn, thereby enabling us to grow the strategic business at an accelerated rate over time. This has been an excellent first half of the fiscal year with strong results powered by our disciplined and focused growth strategy. We remain confident about the direction of the company and optimistic about our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year. With that, Hugh and I would be happy to take your questions.\n\nCarlos Gomez\n\nEVP, Treasurer, and Head of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, Bob. As we transition to Q&A, we ask that you please try to limit yourselves to one question in order to help us get through as many analysts as possible today. And with that, Operator, we are ready for the first question.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, sir. As a reminder, if you'd like to ask a question, please press star then one on your telephone keypad. Today's first question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nBen Swinburne\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Media Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, or good evening, I guess, if you're overseas. Bob, I want to pick up on the streaming commentary you just were talking about. You know, for the last year plus, you guys have been bringing more Hulu content and sports content into Disney+. You're bringing a flagship in from a bundling perspective. I'm just wondering if you're seeing benefits to this broader content strategy within the Disney+ app. Whether you look, this is obviously a domestic comment, but when you look at engagement, sign-ups, et cetera, you know, is the broadening out of Disney+ into other areas of content helping the business from a sign-ups, churn, engagement point of view? And is there more ahead that you think can really drive the business?\nI just wanted to ask Hugh, because I don't think it was in any of the prepared commentary, the three-year guidance, the double-digit earnings growth in 2026 and 2027. I assume all that is still in place off of the new 2025 higher EPS base. Just wanted to make sure we had that correct. Thanks so much.\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, Ben. To answer your question specifically, the presence of a Hulu embedded in Disney, basically from a user experience perspective, and the addition of sports content is definitely having an impact, definitely having a positive impact. Not only is engagement up, but churn is down, and significantly. As we look ahead, it's obviously our desire, and in fact, we're optimistic about being able to execute against it to turn the streaming business into a true growth business. As we see it, there are three ways to do it. One is what we've just talked about, which is to continue to put Disney+ and Hulu together as a user experience. You'll see more of that in the months ahead. In addition, we plan, when we launch ESPN direct-to-consumer, to be really smart about bundling that. For those that bundle, the experience will be fully integrated.\nThat will be another big step. So when you consider the Disney brands that are part of Disney+, the general entertainment that's part of Hulu, and the volume, and then the live sports that will be part of the experience, in a way, there's nothing like it in the streaming world. It's unrivaled in terms of quality, in terms of volume, and just in terms of variety. We're very excited about it. Two other pillars of growth for that business will be technology. We're also hard at work at improving our, basically, the tech side of that business. We've taken a lot of steps already, including paid sharing, which we're just kicking in with Hulu. That's also starting to work. A lot more in terms of personalization and customization, a lot on the ad tech side, and much more coming.\nI was just taken through a roadmap for the rest of the year. We're not talking about many years. We're talking about near-term where the technology improvements to the platforms will be significant. Of course, the third pillar of growth will be investment in content, particularly outside the United States, where we know that we need to invest more in local content, and we've already started that process. It takes time, and you know we don't really end up booking those costs until the shows air, but we're already starting to develop more aggressively in markets, in very, very targeted markets outside the United States.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nEVP and CFO, Walt Disney Company\n\nRight. Hey, Ben, this is Hugh. Obviously, the guide that we announced for this year, which was $5.30, we've now taken to $5.75. The long-term guide remains intact. What we announced before, no change to that.\n\nCarlos Gomez\n\nEVP, Treasurer, and Head of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, Ben. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, sir. Our next question comes from Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nSteven Cahall\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst of Equity Research, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, first, just congratulations on Abu Dhabi. I was wondering if you could speak a little more on how you settled specifically on this location, this partner. I mean, Yas Island is really exciting already with the track and Ferrari World and the Emirate has a lot in infrastructure, but there are a lot of choices in the region. So maybe you could just think about what audience you're going after and how this particular location is best suited for those purposes.\nAnd then just a second question on Parks. I think domestic park margins were up 110 basis points in the quarter. I think you said that cruise is margin accretive. I was just wondering if you could help us think through the margin improvement you saw at domestic. Was that mostly due to cruise mix? Were underlying domestic park margins up as well?Just thinking about that as we forecast this longer term. Thank you.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nEVP and CFO, Walt Disney Company\n\nYeah, hi, this is Hugh. So in terms of the margins on the parks business, that's a combination of all of the businesses. So we have certainly seen margin accretion in the parks and experiences side as well, not just the impact of cruise.\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nAnd then on the Abu Dhabi question, which is a good question, Steven, because we did study the region very carefully, and we know that we had many opportunities. Obviously, building a theme park in a location is a huge endorsement of that location. It speaks volumes in terms of the ability of that location to sustain a Disney theme park. I should start really with an overview of the Middle East. It was very obvious to us that there were many people, basically hundreds of millions in the world that are income qualified, where a trip to one of our six locations was pretty lengthy in nature and expensive.\nAnd so we felt the best way, obviously, to reach those people is to basically bring our product to them. Interestingly enough, as an aside, when we decided to build a cruise ship and put it in Singapore, which will not launch until the end of the year, we put it on sale just a few months ago, and the Q1 sold out in a matter of days, as, for instance. So there's clearly a desire of consumers to engage with Disney in a wide region that is actually distanced enough from our other locations so that we don't really view this as in any way cannibalistic to the places we already operate. Then when you look at Abu Dhabi and the UAE, I mentioned these statistics earlier today.\nWe talk about it being a crossroads of the world. 500 million income qualified people live within four hours. 120 million people will come through Dubai and Abu Dhabi this year alone. Abu Dhabi estimates that 39 million tourists will visit Abu Dhabi by 2030. That says a lot. Then as we started to really dig deeper into Abu Dhabi specifically and engage with our partners, obviously, capital was not an issue. But in addition to that, they've demonstrated a number of things that were really important to us.\nOne, a real appreciation of quality and innovation, an appreciation of the arts and creativity, and a huge commitment to new technology. We were impressed with all of that. We also looked at what they've already built between the Louvre that's already built, the Guggenheim, which is going up, and incredible other experiences, the architecture here as well. Everywhere we looked, we basically were convinced that this was a perfect place for us. Then, in Miral, our partners, we immediately bonded with them in many respects, spoke the same language, and basically we both have a real appreciation of our history and our legacy, but moving forward and being forward-thinking and innovating is also part of our, basically our DNA.\nSo it was very, very clear to us that of all of the places that we could choose from, there didn't seem to be any place that was better than this. One of the reasons why it came together so quickly is because of how convinced we became, particularly after engaging with our partners, that this was the right choice.\n\nCarlos Gomez\n\nEVP, Treasurer, and Head of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, Steve. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question today comes from Robert Fishman with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\n\nRobert Fishman\n\nSenior Research Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nThank you. Bob, the studio has clearly delivered many hits over the past year. I'm wondering if you could just share a little bit more about your excitement for the upcoming theatrical slate and how that will generate the additional long-term value for Disney and the multiplier effect that you talked about in your prepared comments. On a related note, with the Thunderbolts opening, what is your confidence that Marvel can still be a significant driver to that Disney flywheel with its renewed focus on theatrical and putting out less scripted series on Disney+?\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, Robert. I have a lot of confidence in our upcoming slate. Let me just list some of the films that are coming out. We have Lilo & Stitch coming out on Memorial Day weekend. That's the live-action version. Tracking is enormous. I've seen the movie a few times. I can endorse it wholeheartedly. I have a lot of confidence there. Pixar's Elio in June.\nThen we have Fantastic Four in July. And then Tron, Zootopia, and Avatar to finish out the calendar year. That's quite a lineup. And then next year, Avengers, Mandalorian, Toy Story, and Moana live-action. So we have a slate in the next year and a half that not only I have a lot of confidence in, but it's as strong as any slate that I've seen in a long time since, well, in 2019, I think was our best year.\nIt's as strong as anything I've seen since then. So, great confidence. And look, I've talked about Marvel a lot. We all know that in our zeal to flood our streaming platform with more content, that we turn to all of our creative engines, including Marvel, and have them produce a lot more. We've also learned over time that quantity does not necessarily beget quality.\nAnd frankly, we've all admitted to ourselves that we lost a little focus by making too much and by bringing Marvel, by consolidating a bit and having Marvel focus much more on their films. We believe it will result in better quality. And I think the first and best example is Thunderbolts. So, feel very good about that. Thank you.\n\nCarlos Gomez\n\nEVP, Treasurer, and Head of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, Robert. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. And our next question today comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with BofA Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nManaging Director, BofA Securities\n\nThank you. Maybe switching gears to advertising. Bob, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you're optimistic regarding the upfront. So can you give us some comments on what you're seeing in the market? The move to programmatic, is it having an impact on your share of markets, sports?\nAnd then I think the advertising was lower in Disney+, so maybe you could give us a color on what's going on. And then just to follow up on Abu Dhabi, since you're not putting capital in, is there any ownership or is this simply a royalty?\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nI'll start on the Abu Dhabi question and I'll let you pick up your question on advertising. It is all their capital, and we will get a royalty. So there isn't ownership. We own our IP and license it to them. It's essentially the arrangement. We're responsible for design and development,\nand we will be involved significantly in oversight of their operations, basically to ensure that the Disney experience, meaning the Disney theme park experience, is up to the level that we offer in the other six locations that we operate. By the way, we're not concerned about that at all. They've already demonstrated a commitment to quality in that regard. But this is essentially a license arrangement, but with considerable involvement of us. So although they will operate it, we will have employees embedded in the organization with them to help them operate a Disney theme park, basically the quality level that everybody's used to.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nEVP and CFO, Walt Disney Company\n\nYeah, hey, Jessica, and it's Hugh. Just to follow up on the advertising question. Right now, the advertising market is quite healthy for us. Live sports, as you know, is doing extremely well. You see that in the ESPN numbers where advertising for the quarter was up over 20%.\nIn addition to that, we continue, as we go into the upfront season, to see robust demand for our advertising. So I know there's lots of concern from a consumer perspective and what that might mean for advertisers. But right now, in particular, restaurants and healthcare have considerable demand for advertising. The one place that obviously continues to be a bit more challenged is on the DTC side, not driven by demand, but driven by supply as we have new entrants into that marketplace. But that said, there's still strong demand there for Disney advertising as well.\nOverall, you may recall back at the beginning of the year, we indicated that our advertising growth would be up, consistent with what we saw last year, which was 3%. We now expect it to be in excess of what we indicated back at the beginning of the year. So overall, the advertisers are certainly demanding what we can offer.\n\nCarlos Gomez\n\nEVP, Treasurer, and Head of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, Jessica. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. And our next question today comes from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Karnovsky\n\nSenior Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi, thank you. Bob, just on ESPN Flagship, as you move towards the launch, interested to understand better the approach from a programming standpoint, how you view the necessary critical mass of both sports rights and shoulder programming in a more tech-driven interface. How's that different from linear? And then just given the importance of some of the features you'll roll out, like betting and fantasy, how do you think about wanting to keep subscribers in that ecosystem versus giving them the option of consuming their flagship subscription through Disney+? Thanks.\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nFirst of all, to the last point, if you are a subscriber of linear ESPN, you will automatically get what I know we've been referring to as ESPN flagship. By the way, it will not be called that. And next week, Jimmy Pitaro plans to reveal not only the name, but he'll also talk about our pricing strategy. But the plan would be to basically be somewhat agnostic from a subscriber perspective so that we can still do our best to preserve the multi-channel ecosystem, but at the same time, obviously, want to grow our DTC business. The difference is that the ESPN linear service, if that's all that the consumer chooses to watch, will not have the bells and whistles and those additional features that the DTC service will have.\nBut again, we're giving the consumer the option of consuming both. From a critical mass perspective, we have obviously an unrivaled portfolio of licensed sports on ESPN and an unrivaled portfolio of studio programming and shoulder programming, the bulk of which will be on the linear service and, of course, on flagship, quote-unquote, flagship. At some point, I've got to stop using that word. That said, what we've already been doing and what we'll continue to do is give consumers of Disney+ and Hulu a taste of live sports on that service so that we have an opportunity to upsell them on the Disney DTC service, which obviously is a priority of ours.\nAnd again, that service will have many more features than the linear service will have. So I know, and this will, when we launch, will be much simpler, perhaps, than I'm even describing. We're going to limit the number of SKUs. We're going to make it very, very clear what is what, meaning what you get when you just watch linear, what you get when you sign up to Disney DTC. And I think the most important thing is that if you are a subscriber of Disney+ and Hulu, and ESPN DTC, I should have said ESPN, not Disney. If you're a subscriber of all three, you'll have a seamless experience there.\nThey'll be completely, ultimately integrated or embedded into the service. And that, I think, is a real plus from a consumer experience perspective.\n\nCarlos Gomez\n\nEVP, Treasurer, and Head of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, David. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question today comes from Michael Morris at Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Morris\n\nSenior Managing Director and Equity Research Analyst of Media and Internet, Guggenheim\n\nThank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask a couple more questions about the experiences segment and specifically about the outlook there. So you had a strong fiscal Q2. You didn't change the full year growth guidance. So can you provide an update on what you were seeing in the demand environment in the US in particular and whether that changed from the end of the last quarter?\nAlso, the growth rate, the implied growth rate in the back half of the year is for double-digit operating income growth. As you look into fiscal 2026, is there a reason that that double-digit growth isn't something that can continue?\nI know you've spoken to high single digits in the past in 2026. So wondering if there's any upside there. And then just finally, on international, you noted some softness in demand in China. And the question is, is that getting worse? How much of a headwind may that be going forward? Thank you.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nEVP and CFO, Walt Disney Company\n\nOkay. Hey, Michael, Hugh here. I think that was three questions, but I'll do my best to remember them all and answer them. In terms of the first piece, the outlook, the outlook is actually still quite strong for the experiences business. Bookings right now for Walt Disney World for Q3 are up 4%. And that's with about what we would say is about 80% in. And then for Q4, bookings are up 7%.\nThat's probably somewhere between 50% and 60% in at this point. So certainly looking very optimistic. And that was part of what factored into our change in the guidance going forward. In terms of your question on international, it's not getting any worse. And again, just to reiterate what Josh mentioned on the CNBC, attendance is actually still quite good. It's just per cap spending isn't quite as high. [crosstalk] That's China.\n[crosstalk] In China, correct. Because the Chinese consumer, as we know, is a bit challenged. So from that perspective, certainly feel good about the fact that we still have the engagement. Consumers are tightening their belts a little bit in that particular market. And that's what you're seeing flow through there.\nIn terms of expectations for 2026 and for first 2025, the only thing I would say is we guided to six to eight. Given the numbers that we're seeing, we're probably going to be at the higher end of that for the experiences business for this year. And then for 2026 and beyond, I'm not going to comment on that at this point. We'll do guidance on 2026 when we get to 2026.\nSo I'm not going to provide any further color on that until we get to that point, other than what I had mentioned earlier, which is the guidance in terms of growth rates remains intact.\n\nCarlos Gomez\n\nEVP, Treasurer, and Head of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, Mike. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. Our next question today comes from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Ng\n\nManaging Director of Global Investment Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good morning. Thank you very much for the question. Just two on Experiences. First, just with Disney Treasure hitting the second full quarter, or excuse me, the Q2 of operations, I was wondering if you could talk about key learnings from the Cruise launch so far and anything there that helps to inform expectations or strategy around the upcoming launch of Disney Adventure and Disney Destiny.\nJust as a Parks follow-up, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the international visitation to domestic parks and if you're seeing any changes there. Thank you very much.\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nI'll take the cruise ship. You take the rest. On the cruise ship side, as we've expanded, we've embedded in our ships even more Disney intellectual property and at a higher quality level. The ratings for the Treasure are just sky-high. People just love that ship, and for good reason. Obviously, the ships that are coming will take full advantage of everything that the Treasure has taken advantage of, and then some.\nSo we feel great about that business. It has been a great way for us to bring the Disney experience to more consumers around the world. As noted earlier on the call, the experience we've had is putting the ship that will sail out of Singapore on sale, as for instance. We see that business becoming a growth driver for the segment over the next three to four years as more ships are deployed.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nEVP and CFO, Walt Disney Company\n\nYeah. And Michael, in terms of the attendance, international attendance at the domestic parks, we've indicated in the past that that number has not gotten back to pre-COVID levels, but it is still in the double digits. We've seen a bit of an impact, but it's literally like in terms of the mix 1 to 1.5%. And what I would expect going forward is something similar to that. The good news is we're clearly more than making up for it with domestic attendance. Attendance at the parks has been terrific.\n\nCarlos Gomez\n\nEVP, Treasurer, and Head of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, Michael. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question today comes from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nKannan Venkateshwar\n\nManaging Director of US Media, Cable and Telecom Equity Research, Barclays\n\nThank you. Maybe it comes to Bob on the park side with the Abu Dhabi Parks announcement. You also have a long-term plan in place for the segment as a whole. Are there other opportunities in other locations around the world? I mean, now you have a presence in Singapore. You now have a presence in Abu Dhabi. So is there more opportunity for you to expand that footprint further as you look out longer term?\nSome thoughts on that would be great. Then Hugh, on the streaming side, when we think about operating leverage going forward, is that largely a function of revenue growth, or is there also cost opportunity as you align these platforms? As Bob mentioned, there might be fewer SKUs going forward. So does that also provide some kind of a cost opportunity where we see margins inflect? Thanks.\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nKannan, thanks for your question. We just announced Abu Dhabi, and now you're asking for more already. So thank you. With this as our seventh location, we feel that once it opens, it gives us the ability to be far more effective at reaching basically the world's population than we've been before.\nAnd while I'm not going to rule out the possibility of another location, there's nothing that's really being planned near-term to actually build another park in what would be an eighth location. However, I want to remind you that when we talked about a year ago about turbocharging that business with investment and capital, because the return on invested capital has been so stellar, we are continuing on that trajectory. To remind everyone, it's tied to the kind of deal that we made in Abu Dhabi. We're planning to invest approximately $30 billion to expand Florida and California, which obviously is a vote of confidence in those locations. But in addition, those will be highly accretive from a job perspective as well. We're also investing to expand in every other location that we operate.\nSo obviously, a bullish belief in the business itself with Abu Dhabi, as I said, and with the addition of the cruise ships, we're making ourselves very accessible to hundreds of millions of more people than we were in the past. So we're going to focus on this right now and the other investments that we're making. As I said, I'm not ruling out the possibility of another location, but it's not exactly something that's a priority right now for us.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nEVP and CFO, Walt Disney Company\n\nYeah. And hey, Kannan, I'll handle the streaming question. While your point is exactly right, with a business that is going to have the growth that we have expectations for in the streaming business, there will clearly be leverage that just comes out of the revenue growth itself. But in addition to that, we absolutely have opportunities to reduce costs. So the answer is both. We can certainly do it on the G&A side, and especially as we start to add more to the product, both in terms of the technology side of the product where we will be investing, and in terms of the content that's delivered, whether it's bringing ESPN on, and the additional content that we've been bringing in through bundling, we certainly expect to get operating leverage out of marketing over time.\nI wouldn't say that initially, especially as we launch ESPN, but over time, we would expect to get leverage out of the marketing line as well. So put those two together, yeah, I do expect some flow from top to bottom. We will use some of that to invest back in the business, perhaps in some international content, but I would also expect some of those cost reductions to go straight to the bottom line as well to give us accelerated margin growth.\n\nCarlos Gomez\n\nEVP, Treasurer, and Head of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, Kannan. Operator, we have time for one last question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question today will come from Peter Supino with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nPeter Supino\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nHi, good morning. Thank you. Question back on experiences. You mentioned $30 billion of expansion capital for Florida and California. I wondered if that is, if we're defining expansion in terms of attendance, is that capital that will enable more people to visit the park? More broadly, how do you think about your incremental return on capital on expansions in your experiences segment? Thanks.\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nYou know, the guest experience is obviously paramount to us. It's very, very critical. And with that in mind, we actually, with a governor, we actually limit the number of people that we let in because we don't want to decrease the guest experience. So as we look to expand, not only do we look to take advantage of the property that we have and the intellectual property that we have, but we look to add capacity so that we can let more people in without in any way impacting negatively the guest experience. And that's true really every place that we operate.\nIt's really important to us. And we're blessed with the fact that we have more available land, and we certainly have a lot of intellectual property to be mined. We've made announcements that are pretty specific about what we're building: a Villains land and a Cars land in Florida, as for instance, a Pandora in California, a Coco in California. I could go on and on. In terms of the return on invested capital, we've actually hit record levels in terms of return on invested capital in the business. Actually, when I returned to Disney back in 2022 and talked to Josh D'Amaro, who runs the segment about this, and he showed me what the returns on invested capital had been in the then recent past, but more like pre-COVID, it was extremely impressive.\nAs we looked at, as we determined how we allocate our capital as a company, obviously, we want to allocate it in a direction where the returns are stellar. This is one way that we do that. So I think that says it all, really.\n\nCarlos Gomez\n\nEVP, Treasurer, and Head of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, Peter. Thanks everyone for your questions today. We want to thank you for joining us and wish everyone a good rest of the day.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference call. We appreciate your attendance today. You may now disconnect your lines. Thank you. Good day, and welcome to The Walt Disney Company's Q2 2025 planning.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode. Should you need assistance, please signal a conference specialist by pressing the star key followed by zero. After some brief introductory remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. To ask a question, you may press star then one on your telephone keypad. To withdraw your question, please press star then two.\nPlease note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Alexia Quadrani, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nGood morning. It's my pleasure to welcome everybody to the Walt Disney Q3 2024 earnings call. Our press release, Form 10-Q, and management's prepared remarks were issued earlier this morning and are available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay and transcript, as well as the Q3 earnings presentation, will all be made available on our website after the call. As we previously announced, today's call will follow a new format consisting only of a question-and-answer session. Joining me this morning are Bob Iger, Disney's Chief Executive Officer, and Hugh Johnston, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nAs we start the Q&A session, we ask that you please try to limit yourself to one question in order to help us get to as many analysts as possible today. With that, operator, we're ready for the first question.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, ma'am. Before the first question, just as a reminder, please press star then one to enter the question queue, and star then two will remove yourself from queue. Today's first question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nManaging Director and Senior Media and Entertainment Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you. I'm going to try to squeeze into one on theme parks and one on NBA. So first, on theme parks, there's really a lot of moving pieces here. Can you provide color on global park demand and where you expect this protracted weakness? Maybe include the benefit from cruise ships since you have three ships coming on over the next, I guess, 18 months or so. And with the stated fiscal Q4 mid-single digit decline and the expectation that this will last for several quarters, is that the right level to think about OI as we think about fiscal 2025?\nAnd on the NBA, with the rights now complete, you'll likely have several hundred million dollars step up when the new contract begins in fiscal 2026. Are there incremental monetization drivers, including maybe WNBA growth, that can make the new contract profitable in the early years? Thank you.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nSVP and CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Jessica. This is Hugh. Good morning. That was a six-part first question, so I'll try to answer it as best I can. First, just to sort of peel apart Q3, again, I want to emphasize we actually had 2% revenue growth in Q3.\nThe reason, obviously, is the IP is so strong in our parks. It really does attract a strong audience, and people are reluctant to cancel vacations. So while we saw a slight moderation in demand, I certainly wouldn't call it a significant change. That said, 40% of the experiences business is actually not domestic parks. It's either international parks or consumer products, and that's from an operating income perspective. 60% is domestic parks, including cruise ships. Within that, we saw attendance flat in the quarter, and we saw per caps up a little bit.\nWe expect to see a flattish revenue number in Q4 coming out of the parks. As we mentioned earlier in the letter, really just a few quarters. I don't think I'd refer to it as protracted, but just a couple of quarters of likely similar results. Now, keep in mind, we do have some expenses attached to our ships coming in, and that'll affect us a bit in 2024 and a bit in 2025. Overall, I would just call this as a bit of a slowdown that's being more than offset by the entertainment business, both what we've seen so far, and our expectations for Moana 2, as well as Mufasa. Regarding the NBA deal, Jessica, first of all, let me just remind you and everyone that the deal doesn't kick in next year.\nIt's a year later. We have one more year on the current deal. And as we looked at it, first of all, one goal was to maintain what we'll call the A package, which means we've got the finals for 11 more years, or now we have the finals for 12 years, and they drive significant value for us. Also, overall, the deal reflects the value of live programming. We know that that's been an advertiser's delight and also an audience delight. It also reflects the growing value of basketball and the growing value of women's sports. There's a large WNBA component to this.\nAlso, as part of this deal, and has been the strategy of ESPN for a while, to lock in sports rights for a long period of time, it secures our ability to bring ESPN in the digital direction, particularly as we look to launch flagships sometime at the end of 2025. So we believe that by the time this kicks in in a year from now, that a lot of the pieces will be in place in terms of driving more advertising revenue, more distribution revenue, moving to digital. And another thing that we've done here is we've secured international rights, particularly to the finals, not in every market around the world, but in most markets, and that will drive some added revenue as well. Not going to be specific about the profitability in the early years, but there's tremendous value in this deal.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThank you. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question today comes from Ben Swinburne at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nBen Swinburne\n\nManaging Director and Head of U.S. Media Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. Good morning. Maybe for Bob, I wanted to ask you about sort of the outlook for Disney+, both in the context of where the product's going, but also how this becomes a significant earnings contributor to the company as you look ahead. When we look at the product, it's really broadening. You've obviously brought in Hulu. Now you're adding news, a lot of sports, and ESPN coming in.\nYou've added the international NBA rights to the product overseas. What's the vision here? And in your mind, does it support both continued subscriber growth and pricing power? I think there's probably some concern out there that the recent price increases might face some consumer pushback. So I'd love to get your thoughts on that big topic. Just wanted to clarify, Hugh, when you say flattish revenue, Q4, are you talking about at the experiences segment level, or is that just the domestic parks comment?\nJust wanted to clarify. Thank you.\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nWell, let me start by saying that what we've been seeing with streaming is significant success driven largely by the success of our creativity. Whether it's on the television side, I mean, the company had 183 Emmy nominations, for instance, led by shows like Sh?gun, The Bear, Abbott Elementary, and Only Murders in the Building, and I can go on and on. And obviously, on top of the television success creatively, we've had huge success in the motion picture front recently. And when you look at what the current motion picture lineup drives in terms of value on streaming, it's profound. So Inside Out, as it's in our comments today, the first film has had tremendous consumption since the first trailer for Inside Out 2 launched in November. The same thing is true for the early Deadpool movies, for the early Planet of the Apes movies.\nI could go on and on. So when we look across our portfolio of IP, and this includes Disney-branded, Fox-branded, obviously everything that's on Hulu, programming from FX, programming from ABC, National Geographic, what we're basically seeing is we're seeing growth in consumption and the popularity of our offerings, which gives us the pricing leverage that we believe we have. So every time we've taken a price increase, we've had only modest churn from that, nothing that we would consider significant. We believe that as we add these new features, like the channels that we're going to be adding later this year, and the success of our movie slate, and I'll get into that a little bit more, that the pricing leverage that we have has actually increased. We're not concerned. The goal is to grow engagement on the platform.\nAnd what I mean by that is, obviously, offering a wider variety of programming, which is why we're adding news, why we're adding the ESPN tile to it, why we're bundling aggressively to give consumers the ability to buy across all of our basically creative engines. We feel very bullish about the future of this business. We're not saying much more about it, except you can expect that it's going to grow nicely in fiscal 2025. The other thing I want to add is that we've been talking a lot about adding the technology features that we need to basically make it a higher return, a higher margin business, and a more successful business. We're doing that right now. We started our password-sharing initiative in June.\nThat kicks in earnest in September. By the way, we've had no backlash at all to the notifications that have gone out and to the work that we've already been doing. We know that we need stronger recommendation engines, and we're working on that technology, and we need to make our marketing more efficient. But by adding all of these features, both on the technological side and also on the programming side, we're bullish about the future of this business. And then when you think about it, Hugh mentioned Moana and Mufasa. Let me just read to you the movies that we'll be making and releasing in the next almost two years.\nWe have Moana, Mufasa, Captain America, Snow White, Thunderbolts, Fantastic Four, Zootopia, Avatar, Avengers, Mandalorian, and Toy Story, just to name a few. When you think about not only the potential of those in box office, but the potential of those to drive global streaming value, I think there's a reason to be bullish about where we're headed.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nSVP and CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nBen, to answer your other question, flattish was a reference to experiences.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThank you. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, ma'am. Our next question today comes from Robert Fishman with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\n\nRobert Fishman\n\nSenior Research Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nThank you. Bob, as you think about the future of content spending for Disney, especially after the NBA deal and all the content that you're just talking about now, what is the right balance of investment between sports, scripted TV, and movies going forward? And then for Hugh, can you just update us on free cash flow expectations this year with one quarter to go and how to think about the park's impact and the content spending on free cash flow in 2025? Thank you.\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nWell, we obviously are investing significantly in all directions because of the value that it creates and also because of the value that it represents to our future in streaming. We talked about sports, the long-term deals that we've made. Obviously, college football is part of that, and on top of the NBA, on top of the NFL. On the movie side, we've talked a lot about the creative improvements that our studio has brought to bear and the quality of the IP and the known quality of our IP. And television, I can't say enough about how great our television businesses have been performing, both in terms of the bottom line but also in terms of creatively. You don't get 183 Emmy nominations by accident.\nThat's the work of a lot of really great, talented people, meaning on the management side, working with a lot of talented creative people. It's a balance. It's a mix. I think it's one that you'll ultimately see really blended together as our streaming platform grows over time.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nSVP and CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nRobert, on free cash flow, we had previously guided to $8 billion. We don't have any news on that, but if there were a material change on it, obviously, we would have changed the guide.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThank you. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nSteven Cahall\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks. So Hugh, you've talked about DTC getting to double-digit margins with the big price increases and the paid sharing efforts coming. I was wondering if you could just update us on your thinking. Would love to get some timing around double-digit margins if that's something you're comfortable with at this point, but any context would be helpful. And then just on parks, as we think about cruise ship pre-opening costs in there, what's implied in the fourth quarter? And as we think about cruise pre-opening costs in fiscal 2025, what do those look like?\nI think you'll sail the Treasure, but you've still got the Adventure and the Destiny. I think the Singapore dock is a little heavier on cost, so I'd just love to understand that component. Thank you.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nSVP and CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nSure. Happy to talk about both. In terms of the journey on getting to double-digit margins, the levers haven't changed, and frankly, we're actually doing quite well with them. Bundling has had a positive impact on churn. So from that perspective, obviously, that helps us with growth, which is one of the drivers. Password sharing is just starting to roll out.\nThat's also going to be helpful in terms of driving growth. We've announced pricing, and we feel good with all of the value that we're providing to consumers with all the creative that Bob mentioned earlier and all the creative that's still to come. We do feel like we've earned that pricing in the marketplace, and we feel positively about that. With that will come scale benefits. The product improvements also should reduce churn and keep our consumers with us as they're evaluating their options. Then obviously, we're going to look at the entire cost structure and continue to drive productivity. In terms of timing, no update on that.\nIt's something that we've said we are approaching with great urgency. We still intend to do that. Obviously, I think we've made a ton of progress. We were losing $1 billion a quarter, not all that long ago, and now we're making money. Our expectation is we're going to continue on that journey to making more money to get to and then ultimately well surpass the double-digit margins that we've talked about. Regarding the cruise ships, we've shared a number for this year.\nThe number will be a little over double that in terms of the startup costs in 2025. So you can assume that that'll be about that. That said, the cruise ships tend to pay back very quickly, so we certainly feel positive about those investments.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThank you. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from David Karnovsky with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Karnovsky\n\nManaging Director and Head of U.S. Media, Entertainment, and Advertising Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Thank you. On sports, Bob, wanted to see if you could update on strategic partner conversations for ESPN. Is this still a priority? And if so, can you refresh on what you're looking for in terms of marketing or content? Then for Hugh, in the exec commentary, there's multiple references to tightly managing costs.\nSo I wanted to see if you could expand on this. Where are you realizing savings now? How much opportunity is left? Thanks.\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nI know I've sounded like a broken record because I've talked about strategic partnerships for ESPN over the last number of quarters. The only thing I can say is, believe it or not, we're still having conversations about it. We thought and continue to believe there may be opportunities to partner with others, particularly on the content side, and that's why we've continued to explore it. But nothing more to add.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nSVP and CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nRight. Regarding cost, recall, our original cost estimate was $5.5 billion. We raised that to in excess of $7.5 billion. Look, in big companies, my worldview is there's always opportunity to do more with less. We're going to continue to go after it aggressively as we can to both deliver the bottom line and to invest back in the business with all the great opportunities we have.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThank you. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question today comes from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Maybe first on the parks, any further details in terms of the softening and the flat revenues that you expect for Q4 and looking out into 2025? I mean, do you expect attendance to continue to soften or potentially turn negative? And just any commentary on what you're seeing or expectations are on the per-cap side? And then secondly, venue launches this fall, just any expectations in terms of what it could do to trends in the linear business for you guys? Thanks.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nSVP and CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nYeah, I'll take that. In terms of the parks business, I've kind of given you a lot of our expectation already. I'm not sure I'm ready to peel it down to attendance versus per-caps. I think, again, we're going to be pretty consistent with what we saw in Q3. We talked about the fact that the lower-income consumer is feeling a little bit of stress. The high-income consumer is traveling internationally a bit more.\nI think you're just going to see more of a continuation of those trends in terms of the top line. Then the bottom line will be reflective of the fact that we've got some one-time costs coming in and going out both this year and last year. I do expect to see international strengthen. Disneyland Paris has obviously felt some challenge due to the Olympics. Not a surprise, but something that happens. The good news is the Olympics are over in a couple of weeks, and the booking will certainly look good in that regard.\nSo overall, feeling positively on that front.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, ma'am. Our next question comes from Michael Morris at Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Morris\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim\n\nThank you. Good morning, guys. Wanted to ask you on ARPU at domestic Disney+. It did slip a little bit in the quarter, and you cited the impact of subscriber mix shift. Are you saying that that's a function of bundling in terms of mix shift, or is it mix shift to the ad-supported tier? And if so, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the CTV environment, how you're performing there? And just one follow-up on the experiences segment.\nWe generally think of parks vacations as being booked pretty well in advance. So it was a little bit surprising to hear about demand moderation within the quarter. So can you help us a little bit with how much visibility you feel like you have and if it does vary by quarter if there's maybe less advance bookings in certain quarters versus others? Thank you.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nSVP and CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nYeah. To answer the question on ARPU, you hit both points correctly. Number one, bundling has a small effect. And then in addition to that, the shift to the ad model certainly has a small effect as well. From a profitability standpoint, we're pretty happy with whether people choose the ad model or the ad-free model. Regarding visibility, we do have very good visibility, which is why I'm emphasizing.\nThese are really all changes at the margins: daily visitors, late bookers, and things like that. Looking forward, we have very good visibility into the book that we're expecting, which is why I've got a good level of confidence in the projections that I'm sharing with you.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThank you. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today comes from Bryan Kraft at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Kraft\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi. Good morning. I had two, if I could. Just first, on advertising, you highlighted the strong results from the Upfront this year, which is very encouraging. I wanted to ask what you're seeing more immediately in terms of advertising demand today, given some of the macro pressures that have recently come to light. Are advertisers becoming more cautious?\nAre you seeing that more in the real-time ad sales part of the business? And then just on the content sales and licensing part of the business, the press release mentioned increased sales of TV content and content sales, licensing, and other as a driver of OI performance this quarter, along with the box office, of course. Is there anything to read into this? Is it the beginning of a trend toward increasing content licensing to third parties, or was it just a timing benefit or a one-off? Thank you.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nSVP and CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nSure. Happy to talk about it. Ad market is actually very healthy right now. We saw overall advertising grow 8% for the quarter. ESPN was up 17%. DTC streaming was actually up 20%.\nSo certainly feeling very, very positively in that regard. And in terms of the categories, financial services, consumer products doing very well, consumer services doing very well, and technology doing very well. Auto is a little bit softer in that regard. But overall, the ad market is really, really strong and healthy for us. And a lot of that is a product of the fact that we have live sports and the fact that our streaming service is doing so well in terms of the IP that we have. It's an attractive audience.\nWe also have a new capability called Disney Streaming that allows us to basically sell across our platforms very effectively. We're selling audiences rather than just selling streaming channels, which enables advertisers to more effectively target the audiences that they're seeking. So from a technology perspective, we're seeing good payback. The second piece was around licensing. Yeah, the licensing numbers that you see are mostly a reality around the fact that we've had so much success at the box office. That's really what's driving things more than anything else.\nNo change in our licensing strategy, which has been pretty clear. The things that we consider core IP to the company, we don't license. There are things that are non-strategic. We'll continue to license tactically, but it's not a big strategy for us. The big strategy is producing our own IP and monetizing it.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThank you. Operator, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, ma'am. Our next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nKannan Venkateshwar\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Barclays\n\nThank you. Maybe in theme parks, I mean, there's a few growth elements, I guess, over the next few years in terms of cruise ships and broadly other CapEx investments that you're making in the park. Maybe if you could just step back and talk about what kind of growth impact you expect maybe over the next two or three years and if that can offset, to what extent that can offset some of the weakness you're seeing in the parks, that would be useful. One other segment which probably goes out of your numbers next year is India. That's been a loss-making business. To the extent you can talk about the potential earnings contribution once India is deconsolidated, that would be much appreciated.\nThank you.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nSVP and CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nYeah. Good morning, Kannan. Two things. One, obviously, the investments that we're making into the experiences business, we feel very, very good about. It's been a great returning business for a long time. So while I'm not here to give you long-term guidance in terms of that segment of the business, we wouldn't be making capital investments in an accelerated way if we didn't expect to accelerate growth out of those businesses.\nAnd that's true of the cruise ships as well. Now, keep in mind that the lead time on investments in this business are multiple years. So when exactly all of that manifests, we'll share with you as we go along. But obviously, we're investing because we're looking to accelerate growth, hence the term turbocharge. Regarding the India question, we'll share that when we close the deal. I think that's the right time to do it.\nWe'll lay it out for you all very clearly so that you can model it very, very effectively.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nOkay. Thank you. Thanks for the questions. I want to thank everyone for joining us today.\n\n[Video Narrator]\n\nVideo Narrator\n\nNote that a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that were referred to on this call to the most comparable GAAP measures can be found on our investor relations website.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Alexia Quadrani, Executive Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nAlexia Skouras Quadrani\n\nMD and Senior Analyst, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\n\nGood morning. It's my pleasure to welcome everybody to the Walt Disney Company's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Our press release was issued earlier this morning and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay and transcript as well as the second quarter earnings presentation will all be made available on our website after the call.\nJoining me for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chief Executive Officer; and Hugh Johnston, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Hugh, we will be happy to take some of your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.\n\nRobert A. Iger\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Walt Disney Co.\n\nThank you, Alexia, and good morning, everyone. Our strong performance in Q2 demonstrates we are delivering on our strategic priorities while building for the future. Overall, this was another impressive quarter for us with adjusted earnings per share up 30% compared to prior year. And I'm pleased to say this outperformance raises our full year adjusted EPS growth target to 25%.\nOur results were driven in large part by our Experiences segment and our streaming business, which achieved an important milestone with the entertainment portion of the streaming business, achieving profitability in the quarter. This is a testament to the turnaround we set in motion last year and the outstanding leadership of Disney Entertainment Co-Chairman, Alan Bergman and Dana Walden. It is particularly noteworthy when you consider we reported peak losses only 18 months ago.\nWe also remain on track to reach profitability in our combined streaming businesses in Q4. We've said all along our path to profitability will not be linear. And while we are anticipating a softer third quarter due in large part to the seasonality of our India sports offerings, we fully expect streaming to be a growth driver for the company in the future and we have prioritized the steps necessary to achieve this.\nIn March, we successfully launched Hulu on Disney+, bringing extensive general entertainment content to the platform for bundled subscribers, and we're encouraged by the early results. And by the end of this calendar year, we will be adding an ESPN title to Disney+ giving all U.S. subscribers access to select live games and studio programming within the Disney+ app. We see this as a first step to bring ESPN to Disney+ viewers as we ready the launch of our enhanced stand-alone ESPN streaming service in the fall of 2025.\nThe key to our success in streaming and what consistently brings consumers back for more is the array of exceptional content we produce that captivates audiences of all ages and backgrounds. Looking at our film studios. We have a number of highly anticipated theatrical releases arriving over the next few months, including Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, which opens this Friday, as well as Pixar's Inside Out 2, Marvel's Deadpool and Wolverine and 20th Century Studios, Alien: Romulus, which are all slated for this summer.\nLater this year, we're looking forward to Moana 2 and Mufasa: The Lion King. And in 2025, our slate remains just as robust with Captain America: Brave New World, Fantastic Four, Elio, Zootopia 2 and Avatar 3. Our series also continued to resonate with audiences and critics alike. FX Shogun has proven to be a global hit, with success on both linear and streaming. It's tracking as FX's most watch show ever on our streaming platforms, and it's driving the second largest number of sign-ups to our streaming services since 2022, behind only Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. This is a great example of how we are successfully reaching wider audiences with our combined linear and streaming ecosystem.\nIn Q2, series that aired on linear networks accounted for 17 of the top 20 most viewed series on our streaming platforms with almost 3 billion hours of consumption. Our linear channels are deeply embedded in our direct-to-consumer strategy as they continue to deliver high-quality content that reaches demographics not captured on streaming alone, allowing us to broaden our audiences and leverage our unmatched content engine across an expansive base.\nTurning to ESPN. Sports continues to stand out when it comes to convening large audiences with recent big ratings wins across a variety of sports. ESPN had a fantastic April in terms of total day viewership, the highest April since 2012. For Primetime viewership, it was ESPN's highest April on record. The NCAA Women's Final Four in Cleveland was the most viewed on record and the championship between Iowa and South Carolina was ESPN's most viewed college basketball game ever, men's or women's.\nWe also saw record-breaking ratings for the WNBA draft. Monday Night Football had its most watched season since 2000, and the NFL postseason also broke viewership records. The divisional playoff game between the Houston, Texas and Baltimore Ravens was ESPN's most watched NFL game ever with 32.4 million viewers. Looking at our experiences business, which remained an impressive financial driver in the quarter, we are focused on turbocharging growth with a number of long-term strategic investments.\nThat includes our Disneyland Forward initiative the first step in our expansion plans at Disneyland Resort, which received unanimous preliminary approval by the Anaheim City Council last month. This was a significant milestone and the final vote is expected to take place this evening. We're incredibly excited for the many potential new stories our guests could experience at Walt's original theme park including the much anticipated opportunity to bring Avatar to Disneyland.\nWhen you consider all of our businesses as a whole, from entertainment, to sports, to experiences, it's clear that no one has what Disney has. The turnaround and growth initiatives we set in motion last year have continued to yield positive results, and we are executing against our ambitious strategic priorities with both speed and determination.\nTo walk you through more of our results from the quarter, I will now turn things over to Hugh.\n\nHugh F. Johnston\n\nChief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, PepsiCo, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob. Diluted earnings per share, excluding certain items, for the second fiscal quarter were $1.21 and reflect the second quarter in a row of strong double-digit percentage year-over-year earnings growth. We also met or exceeded all of our financial guidance for the quarter. And as Bob mentioned, we are now targeting adjusted EPS growth of 25% for the full year.\nAt our Entertainment segment, second quarter operating income increased by over 70% versus prior year, driven by direct-to-consumer. Entertainment DTC revenue increased 2% sequentially and 13% year-over-year and generated operating income of $47 million. These results exceeded our guidance primarily due to expense savings. Core Disney+ subscribers increased by $6.3 million in the quarter, reflecting nearly 8 million additions domestically driven by charter entitlements and a slight loss internationally from the impacts of wholesale deal changes and price increases.\nDisney+ core ARPU increased sequentially by 6% or $0.44 reflecting price increases for the domestic premium tier as well as international ARPU growth, partially offset by lower ad supported ARPU domestically, driven by dilution from charter entitlements. And the recent Charter deal also drove Disney+ ad tier subscriber growth in the quarter. We ended Q2 with 22.5 million ad tier subscribers globally. We are pleased with the progress we're making in streaming, although as we said before, the path to long-term profitability is not a linear one.\nOn that note, we are forecasting a loss for entertainment DTC in the third quarter, the vast majority of which is due to Disney+ Hotstar ICC Cricket rights. We also do not expect to see core subscriber growth at Disney+ in the third quarter but anticipate sub growth will return in Q4.\nAs Bob mentioned, we continue to expect our combined streaming businesses to be profitable in the fourth quarter and expect further improvements in profitability in fiscal 2025. At Entertainment linear networks, a decrease in operating income versus the prior year was primarily driven by lower affiliate and advertising revenue domestically and lower affiliate revenue internationally. And at content sales, licensing and other lower Q2 results versus the prior year reflect the absence of significant theatrical releases in the quarter.\nFor Q3, we expect this business to generate modestly positive operating income, an improvement over the prior quarter and prior year. Moving to sports. Second quarter operating income decreased slightly versus the prior year, driven primarily by a decrease at ESPN, offset by improved results at Star India sports. As expected, at ESPN, lower results at the domestic business reflects higher programming and production costs from the timing of an additional college football playoff game in the quarter versus the prior year, which were only partially offset by higher ad revenue.\nDomestic affiliate revenue also decreased in the quarter. ESPN domestic ad sales increased by more than 20% versus the prior year or high single digits when adjusted for the college football playoff timing shift of an additional game as well as a new NFL divisional playoff game in Q2 of this year. Q3 to date, we are seeing healthy demand driven by the NBA playoffs and domestic ESP and cash ad sales are pacing up.\nAt Star, higher results in Q2 versus the prior year include the impact of a decrease in programming and production costs attributable to the nonrenewal of BCCI packet rights. Looking ahead, note that we are currently expecting to incur linear ICC rights expense at Star India in Q3. At Experiences, second quarter revenue grew 10%, operating income grew 12%, and segment margins expanded by 60 basis points versus the prior year. Parks and Experiences OI increased by 13% year-over-year and consumer products OI increased by 7%.\nStrong international Parks growth was driven by Hong Kong Disneyland Resort while Walt Disney World and the Cruise business both contributed to domestic growth. At Disneyland, despite growing attendance and per capita spend, results declined year-over-year due to cost inflation including from higher labor expenses. We continue to expect robust operating income growth that experiences for the full year. However, third quarter OI is expected to come in roughly comparable to the prior year.\nSeveral noncomparable or timing-related items are expected to adversely impact Q3 results, including timing of media and tech expenses, noncomparable items in the prior year at consumer products and the timing of Easter. Beyond these comparability related headwinds, the third quarter's results will be impacted by 3 additional factors, higher wage expenses, preopening expenses related to the Disney Treasure and Adventure Cruise ships as well as Disney Cruise Line's New Island look out key and some normalization of post-COVID demand.\nAs it relates to demand, while consumers continue to travel in record numbers, and we are still seeing healthy demand, we are seeing some evidence of a global moderation from peak post-COVID travel. While pressures from wages, preopening costs and demand impacts are expected to persist in Q4, we do expect year-over-year our experiences operating income growth to rebound significantly in the fourth quarter due to fewer comparability or timing factors.\nOn an enterprise level, we continue to make good progress on our cost efficiency initiatives and remain positioned to exceed our $7.5 billion annualized target. We still expect to generate over $8 billion in free cash flow this fiscal year and the shareholder return goals we've previously spoken about are also still very much on track. We repurchased $1 billion of stock in the second quarter. We continue to position the company for long-term growth and profitability and are making tangible progress on generating compounding earnings and free cash flow growth, which will enable us to continue returning capital to shareholders.\nI'll now hand the call back to Alexia for Q&A.",

Please go ahead.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nGood afternoon. It's my pleasure to welcome everybody to The Walt Disney Company's Q1 2024 Earnings Call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay and transcript, as well as the Q1 earnings presentation, will all be made available on our website after the call.\nJoining me for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chief Executive Officer, and Hugh Johnston, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Hugh, we'll be happy to take some of your questions. With that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, Alexia, and good afternoon, everyone. Just one year ago, we outlined an ambitious plan to return to a period of sustained growth and shareholder value creation. Our strong performance this past quarter demonstrates we have turned the corner and entered a new era. As previously noted, we're focused on transitioning ESPN into the preeminent digital sports platform, building streaming into a profitable growth business, reinvigorating our film studios, and turbocharging growth in our parks and experiences.\nBefore we dive deeper into our results, let me start by making a number of significant announcements that represent important and exciting steps forward. First, we announced yesterday the full suite of ESPN's channels will now be available direct-to-consumer as part of a new joint venture with Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery to create a new streaming sports service launching this fall.\nThis brings together content from all of these companies combined assets including all the major professional sports leagues and college sports. In the fall of 2025, we'll be offering ESPN as a standalone streaming option with innovative digital features, creating a one stop sports destination unlike anything available in the marketplace today.\nESPN is also adding a sports icon to its lineup with coach Nick Saban joining the network as an on-air commentator later this year. We're excited to share that in November we will release a feature-length animated sequel to Moana, which joins a very robust lineup of upcoming theatrical releases. We're also thrilled to share that we're entering into an exciting relationship with Epic Games, acquiring a small equity stake and launching a groundbreaking new games and entertainment universe that brings together Disney's beloved brands and franchises with a hugely popular Fortnite.\nI'm pleased to share that Disney's board has declared an additional dividend and will be embarking on a $3 billion stock buyback program in fiscal 2024. Oh, and one more thing. Next month Disney will become the exclusive streaming home of Taylor Swift's historic concert film Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour (Taylor's Version).\nI'll be sharing more with you about these announcements momentarily, but what's clear is that the important transformation we undertook last year is bearing fruit, and looking at our results this quarter, we can say with confidence our strategy is working. In Q1, segment operating income increased by 27%, and adjusted earnings per share rose 23% compared to prior year.\nWe've improved our entertainment streaming operating income by a remarkable 86% year-over-year and remain poised to reach profitability in our combined streaming business by the end of fiscal 2024 and build on our momentum to deliver significant sustained profit margins in the future.\nDisney's experiences business generated all-time records in revenue, operating income, and operating margin, and we are on track to meet or exceed $7.5 billion in cost savings as we continue to look for further efficiency opportunities across the company.\nDiving deeper into our announcements, let's first talk about ESPN, which continues to deliver meaningfully for the company and will be a key value driver in the future. ESPN's domestic sports business continues to grow, and even amid a challenging linear landscape, ESPN increased its overall audience in calendar year 2023, and it continues to break records in ratings. Ultimately, our mission is to make ESPN into the preeminent digital sports brand, reaching as many sports fans as possible and giving them even more ways to access the programming they love in whatever way best suits their needs.\nOne way will be through the new streaming sports service coming this fall that we announced yesterday in conjunction with Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery. This service will bring together our collective portfolios of sports channels and direct-to-consumer services on a non-exclusive basis, providing consumers with more of the sports they want in a single place.\nIt's important for us to serve the needs of consumers looking for a seamless way to access an aggregated collection of sports centric content, including capturing fans moving away from the full cable and satellite bundle, and it's an attractive business proposition for ESPN, allowing us to command per unit economics in line with established market rates for our sports content, just like we do with any streaming or linear service where we offer our programming.\nAnother exciting option available to sports fans will come in the fall of 2025 when we make the full suite of ESPN's channels available as a standalone and highly interactive digital destination. Not only will consumers be able to stream their favorite live games and studio programming, they'll also have access to engaging digital integrations like ESPN BET, Fantasy Sports, e-commerce features, and a deep array of sports stats, all of which we know will be incredibly compelling to younger sports fans in particular. It will also have very robust personalization features.\nESPN has long prioritized its desire and ability to serve sports fans wherever they are, and these steps will strengthen ESPN's ability to deliver on that promise. As you know, we've also engaged in productive conversations with potential content and marketing partners for ESPN. We've made progress towards securing deals and we expect to have more to share with you in the near future. We're excited to offer a more unified streaming experience, which we expect will deliver strong benefits in terms of higher engagement, lower churn, and greater advertising potential. When we launch our standalone ESPN service, we'll also make it available on Disney for bundled subscribers, just as we've done for Hulu.\nWe've already seen an incredible response to the beta launch of Hulu on Disney, which has far exceeded every metric, and we are looking forward to the full launch next month. This is all part of the ambitious streaming strategy we've been building from our acquisition of 21st Century Fox that expanded our vast content library and strong pool of creative talent, to the launch of Disney as the home to a century of content, to securing full control of Hulu and expanding our streaming offerings to reach greater audiences, to our significant investments in technology, and now taking significant steps toward ESPN's streaming future.\nDisney also has a great advertising story to tell with unparalleled scale and very strong advertising technology, and our ad supported Disney offering is off to a great start. We successfully expanded outside the US with launches in EMEA and Canada and grew to over 1,000 global advertisers in the Q1. That's a tenfold increase from launch. More than anything, the success of our streaming services is a testament to the amazing content we create. With six of the top 10 most streamed movies across all streaming platforms in the US in 2023, our best in class storytelling continues to entertain millions of people.\nWe received 27 Golden Globe nominations and won top prizes for FX's The Bear and Searchlight's Poor Things. At this year's Primetime Emmy Awards, we took home 37 wins, more than any other entertainment company, and we lead the industry with 20 nominations heading into the Oscars, which will air on 10 March 2024 on ABC. We're also proud of our recent Disney-branded programming successes. Percy Jackson & the Olympians, which premiered on both Disney and Hulu in December, has become a bona fide hit.\nBooks from the series returned to the number one slot on the New York Times bestseller list following the debut of the Disney series, and I'm thrilled to share that we just picked up a second season, and the hit children's animated series Bluey, which is exclusive to the Disney Channel and Disney in the United States, was recently the number one most streamed show across any streaming platform. Looking ahead, we have an exciting slate of originals coming to Disney, including Agatha from Marvel Studios, Skeleton Crew, and the Acolyte from Lucasfilm, Win or Lose from Pixar, and much more.\nAdditionally, later this month Hulu will launch FX's highly anticipated Sh?gun in the US and in March, all seasons of Grey's Anatomy, our number one streaming title globally, will join our extensive library of titles on Hulu. When the show returns next month for its 20th season, Hulu will be the only place to see the current and all previous seasons of this truly iconic series. Speaking of icons, over the past year we've all witnessed the creative genius and sheer power of a true cultural phenomenon, Taylor Swift.\nWhen her blockbuster concert film debuts on Disney on 15 March 2024, it will feature the concert in its entirety, including the song Cardigan and four additional acoustic songs which were not in the theatrical or digital purchase release of the film. We know audiences are going to absolutely love the chance to relive the electrifying Taylor Swift Eras Tour, Taylor's Version whenever they want on Disney+.\nTurning to our film studios, we have an incredibly robust slate of new releases as we continue revitalizing our creativity. Just consider the lineup of titles we will release through the end of 2026. This year we have Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, Inside Out 2, Deadpool 3, Alien: Romulus, and Mufasa: The Lion King. As I mentioned at the top of the call, this November will release a feature length animated sequel to Moana. This was originally developed as a series, but we were impressed with what we saw, and we knew it deserved a theatrical release.\nThe original Moana film from 2016 recently crossed 1 billion hours streamed on Disney and was the most streamed movie of 2023 on any platform in the US along with a live action version of the original film that's currently in development. Moana remains an incredibly popular franchise and we can't wait to give you more of Moana and Maui when Moana 2 comes to theaters this November. Looking to our 2025 theatrical slate, we're excited to bring audiences Captain America: Brave New World, Fantastic Four, Pixar's Elio, Zootopia 2, and Avatar 3.\nWe're already looking forward to 2026 and beyond with Frozen 3, the first Toy Story movie since 2019, and a new Star Wars movie that brings the Mandalorian and Grogu to the big screen for the very first time. These films will not only reach global audiences in theaters, but as we've consistently demonstrated, they will become important anchors on our global streaming platforms, driving subscriptions and engagement while also continuing to fuel growth in our experiences business.\nAfter all, one of the things that truly sets Disney apart is our unique ability to turn top quality IP into top quality experiences, leading to significant growth. That was certain y true this quarter. Every one of our parks was profitable in Q1, giving us an incredibly solid foundation to build upon as we invest significantly to turbocharge growth in this business. We've had a tremendous response from guests visiting our newly opened World of Frozen at Hong Kong Disneyland, as well as our first ever Zootopia Land at Shanghai Disney Resort.\nAs I've said before, we also have so many untapped stories just waiting to be brought to life in our parks across the globe as we continue to invest in this extraordinary business. It's not just our parks where we're creating new opportunities for consumers to engage with the characters and franchises they love.\nOur new relationship with Epic Games will create a transformational games and entertainment universe that integrates Disney's world-class storytelling into Epic's cultural phenomenon Fortnite, enabling consumers to play, watch, create, and shop for both digital and physical goods. This marks Disney's biggest entry ever into the world of video games and offers significant opportunities for growth and expansion.\nThe new immersive universe will allow fans to unleash their own creativity and experience the Disney stories and worlds that they love in groundbreaking new ways. Younger audiences in particular are huge consumers of video games. In fact, among Millennials, Gen Z, and Gen Alpha, a significant amount of time spent on screen-based platforms is playing video games.\nThis new universe from Disney and Epic provides us with a tremendous opportunity to not only meet more consumers where they are, but to allow more audiences to cultivate a bond with Disney's iconic brands and franchises, including Marvel, Star Wars, and much more. Looking at the renewed strength of our businesses this quarter, from sports to entertainment to experiences, the stage is now set for significant growth and success.\nIn that regard, we see ample opportunity to increase shareholder returns as our earnings and free cash flow continue to grow. Our current position of strength and confidence in our path ahead already led us to pay a dividend to our shareholders last month, and I'm pleased to share that the Board declared that our next semiannual dividend to be paid in July will be 50% higher versus the last dividend paid in January.\nThe Board has also authorized the company to begin repurchasing shares for the first time since fiscal 2018, and we plan to start by targeting $3 billion this fiscal year as we continue to invest in our growth businesses and maintain our strong balance sheet. We also expect to prioritize dividend payments and share repurchases in the coming years. I'm proud of our company's remarkable achievements, and I'm grateful to a deep bench of seasoned executives who are helping guide Disney into the future.\nThat includes Hugh Johnston, our new CFO, who has already proven to be an outstanding addition to the team. We feel very fortunate to have Hugh with us, and now to take you through more of our results this quarter, I'll turn things over to Hugh.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nSEVP and CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks Bob. I joined Disney a little over two.Months ago and the more I learn about this incredible company, the more excited I am about the opportunities ahead of us. I'm looking forward to continuing to partner with Bob and our management team as we execute on our strategy with a goal of delivering significant, consistent long-term earnings and free cash flow growth.\nWe are very pleased with this quarter's financial results. Fiscal Q1 diluted earnings per share excluding certain items increased by 23% versus the prior year to $1.22. Segment operating margin increased by 350 basis points reflecting both strong pricing and operating expense reductions. Both revenue and operating income at direct-to-consumer, Domestic, ESPN, and Experiences all increased versus the prior year and operating income across each of our business segments grew nicely in part due to the diligent and ongoing cost efficiency work we're driving throughout our businesses as evidenced by the realization of over $500 million in SG&A and other operating expense savings across the enterprise in Q1.\nMoving to our results by segment. At Entertainment, Q1 operating income more than doubled, driven by significant improvement at direct-to-consumer Entertainment direct-to-consumer operating income improved by about $850 million versus the prior year and by nearly $300 million versus Q4, and revenue increased sequentially.By over 10%, benefiting from higher subscription and advertising revenue.\nOperating income in Q1 was better than the guidance the company gave in the last earnings call, primarily due to expense favorability. Hulu subscribers increased by 1.2 million from Q4 to Q1 and Disney Core subscribers decreased sequentially by 1.3 million, in line with prior guidance driven by the expected temporary uptick in churn given the recent domestic price increases as well, as the end of the global summer promotion, those impacts were partially offset by strong ad tier net adds due to domestic growth as well as the launch in certain international markets in the Q1.\nDomestically, we saw continued net additions to our bundled offerings in Q1 which, as a reminder, have significantly lower churn versus our standalone products. Disney Core ARPU increased by $0.14 versus the prior quarter and by $1.07 versus the prior year, driven primarily by price increases. We expect Disney+ Core ARPU to increase in the Q2 due to the continued benefit of price increases which should only be partially offset by.The impact of adding Charter's Spectrum TV Select subs to the Disney Ad tier. I'll note that we are being paid on all entitled Charter subs, which will also be a key driver of accelerated Disney Core sub growth in Q2.\nWe expect net adds of between 5.5 and 6 million in the Q2. Domestic net adds are expected to be in the 7.5 million range, driven by charter entitlements net of cannibalization and international core subs are expected to decrease modestly reflecting changes to certain wholesale deals and slightly elevated churn impacts from price increases while subscriber growth will vary from quarter to quarter, we are confident in our prospects for ongoing sub growth over the longer term driven by the continued global strength of our content slate.\nAdvancing our Paid Sharing efforts, technology advances that are intended to improve our content promotion and discovery capabilities, drive up engagement and lower churn, the impact of making Hulu content available on Disney for bundle. Subs and continued adoption of the bundle. Domestically, which should both increase engagement and lower churn, a strategy we will repeat in Latin America this summer when we combine Disney+ and Star+ and our continued use of tiering to provide subscribers with more choices.\nAs it relates to the opportunity we see on paid sharing, beginning this summer, Disney+ accounts suspected of improper sharing will be presented with new capabilities to allow their borrowers to start their own subscriptions. Later this calendar year, account holders who want to allow access to individuals from outside their household will be able to add them to their accounts for an additional fee.\nWhile we are still in the early days and don't expect notable benefits from these paid sharing initiatives until the back half of calendar 2024, we want to reach as large an audience as possible with our outstanding content, and we're looking forward to rolling out this new functionality to improve the overall customer experience and grow our subscriber base for Q2. We are expecting revenue at Entertainment DTC.To grow sequentially and anticipate that operating losses will be relatively in line with Q1.\nWe still expect to reach profitability at our combined streaming businesses in Q4 of fiscal 2024 and have never been more confident about our path to creating a strong and sustainable streaming business with growing subscribers over the long term and ultimately double-digit operating margins, a business which we fully expect to be a key earnings growth driver for the company.\nMoving on to Entertainment Linear Networks, the decrease in Q1 operating income versus the prior year was due to lower advertising and affiliate revenues partially offset by lower programming and production costs. Lower domestic advertising revenue was driven primarily by lower impressions, including from strike-related impacts, in addition to an adverse comparison to the prior year, midterm-related political.Advertising at our own stations.\nDomestic Entertainment Affiliate Revenue decreased by 5% in the Q1 versus the prior year, a 5-point benefit from higher rates was more than offset by a 10-point decline from fewer subscribers. Adjusted for the non-carriage of certain networks at Charter as a result of our recent deal, the sub decline impact was closer to 7%. Lower programming and production costs benefited from strike-related impacts, and we also remained.Focused on driving ongoing cost efficiencies at content sales, licensing, and other results came in lower versus the prior year and below the guidance we provided due to the performance of theatrical titles in the quarter.\nWe do not have any new key theatrical releases in Q2 due to production delays stemming from the strikes, and expect content sales, licensing, and other operating income to come in roughly break-even for the quarter. Sports operating income improved versus the prior ear due to strength at ESPN, partially offset by lower results at Star India driven by higher rights costs from airing of the ICC Cricket World Cup at domestic ESPN year-over-year growth was driven largely by a decrease in programming and production costs from the timing of college football playoff games.\nDomestic affiliate revenue in Q1 was comparable to the prior year as an increase of 6% from higher contractual rates was offset by a commensurate decrease from few r subscribers. ESPN domestic ad sales in the quarter were down 2% versus the prior year, but up mid single digits when adjusted for various timing shifts and one-time impacts. The strength we are seeing gives us confidence that leaning into sports will continue to create value for our shareholders.\nQ2 to date we are seeing continued healthy advertising demand in the sports marketplace with domestic ESPN cash ad sales pacing up double-digit percentage points versus the prior year. The trend is still solid even when adjusted for the CFP timing shift of an additional game as well as an extra NFL divisional game in Q2 this year. Our experiences business posted strong Q1 results with year-over-year operating income growth of 10% at parks and experiences and 4% at consumer products. Record-setting results this quarter were primarily driven by our performance at Shanghai and Hong Kong theme parks, continued strength at Disney Cruise Line and the success of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 at our games busines.\nsegment margins expanded by over 50 basis points versus the prior year. An achievement delivered despite tough comparisons at Walt Disney World coming off its highly successful 50th anniversary celebration in the prior year and significant cost pressures driven by wage increases. We remain optimistic about the segment's continued top-line and profit growth notwithstanding the tough comps domestically in Q2, and we still expect robust OI growth in Experiences for the full year. We plan to invest approximately $60 billion into the business over the next 10 years, of which approximately 70% is earmarked for incremental capacity-expanding investments around the globe, which we expect to generate attractive returns.\nOn a total company basis, as Bob mentioned earlier, we are still on pace to meet or exceed our $7.5 billion annualized cost target by the end of fiscal 2024. I'm pleased with how this is tracking so far. Total expenses in Q1 were down 4% versus the prior year, and the efficiencies we've been realizing are a key contributor to that progress. We are also still on track to generate about $8 billion in free cash flow this fiscal year. Putting all this together, we are confident in the progress we are making and the path it puts us on to become a strong cash generator and earnings. Compounder starting in fiscal 2024.\nTo that end, we expect full year fiscal 2024 earnings per share, excluding certain items, to increase by at least 20% versus 2023 to approximately $4.60. You already heard from Bob about our updated plans for shareholder returns this year. As he mentioned, we intend to continue investing in our growth businesses while also maintaining a balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation. With that, we're happy to take.Your questions.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, Hugh. As we transition to the Q&A, we ask that you please try to limit yourself to one question in order to help us get to as many analysts as possible today. With that, operator, we're ready for the first question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, if you'd like to ask a question, please press star then one on your telephone keypad. If at any time your question has been addressed and you'd like to withdraw your question, please press star then two. Today's first question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nBen Swinburne\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. Good afternoon. You guys had a lot of news for us to chew on tonight. I wanted to maybe start, Bob, asking you about sports, since you led with that. You guys have a lot going on with ESPN, new channels, package, flagship, obviously having conversations. Can you kind of put it all into context for us and how you're sort of thinking about these different products and whether they address different parts of the market and what your sort of priorities are between the two?\nReally, what is success for Disney shareholders in sports? How do we think about that kind of financially and strategically? I was just wondering if Hugh had an update for us on expense growth this year. I think you guys guided to slight growth overall in 2024 last quarter. Seems like you're on track with your savings program. Any update to that would be appreciated. Thanks so much.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nSEVP and CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, Ben. Permit me to throw a couple of cliches your way, as you know ESPN has always aimed to serve the sports fan effectively, no matter where the sports fan is. All of the steps that we've been taking, that we announced today, and that we will continue to take are aimed at doing just that. When you think about today's environment, where you've obviously got some challenges in linear TV, a lot more competition both for people's time and just specifically in sports, and you think about the fact that ESPN finished 2023 in really good shape, ratings continue to rise.\nSports is still an advertiser's delight. You have to consider that ESPN has been successful in what their primary goal was. They're reaching sports fans effectively, which is why advertisers, distributors, sports leagues, and organizations feel they have to kind of be part of or partnered with ESPN. As we look to the future, we're obviously mindful of, one, the state of the multichannel ecosystem, two, where people are spending their time and their money with media, and you have to basically serve them effectively there. We've been saying for a long time that taking ESPN in the direct-to-consumer direction was inevitable and that we were looking for partners to do so.\nThis is really not a first stcp, it's a second step. The first step was launching ESPN some years ago, which has actually been quite successful. The second step is finding these partners to distribute basically the equivalent of a multichannel sports-centric tier via app. One, we're serving sports fans well. Two, we're doing it with partners. Three, we're doing it in a more modern way rather than cable and satellite. In this case, it's app based. That's a big step for us because we know that there are a number of people who have never signed up for multichannel television. This gives them a chance to do so at a price point that will be obviously more attractive than the big fat bundle.\nTwo, there are people who have left that ecosystem because they didn't want all those channels or that cost. This is a way of basically preserving a relationship or creating one with those that are no longer part of the multichannel ecosystem. The next step after this, and we announced today that we'll launch it in probably August of 2025, is to bring out ESPN flagship, I say on its own, but it will be bundled ultimately with Hulu and Disney+ and that will be a very, very immersive, very obviously sports centric app which will have features that this combination with Fox and with Warner Bros. Discovery will not have, such as integrated betting, integrated fantasy, likely to have some sales arm or merchandise capabilities.\nObviously, deep dive into stats and high degree of customization and personalization. Again, another kind of feature that we'll bring out to engage with small sports fans. I can't tell you right now how that ultimately will fit into all of this, except it will be a progression. We haven't really talked much about how it will be bundled except with our own services. I think success will be for us in this basically migration would be to maintain ESPN's position in sports in general, the affinity that its fans have with ESPN, and the attractiveness of ESPN to advertisers and sports leagues. That simple.\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nRight? I'll take the cost side. Ben, you're right. In the past we've talked about slight growth in operating expenses year over year. We obviously have terrific momentum on cost management coming out of the Q1, and the team is relentlessly looking for further opportunities to drive cost savings, both to reinvest back in the business, to continue the growth momentum that we have, as well as deliver margin growth to the bottom line. Net, no change in guidance versus what we said previously. We should do at least as well as the guidance we previously committed to, which was slight growth in operating expenses year over year.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, Ben. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. Our next question today comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Nathanson\n\nEquity Research Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nThanks. One for you, Bob. One for you, Hugh. Bob, answering Ben's question, we're still kind of wondering how does Hulu Live fit into the long term picture here? It's stopped growing. YouTube is twice the size. Think about the future of your offerings, how does that fit into what you just announced with direct over-the-top ESPN and then the sports bundle. For you, you broke some news too with a double digit margin target for streaming, any help on a timetable that gets. Is there or what factors do you think will drive you from here to double digits in the next couple years?Thanks.\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nAs you know, Hulu Live more reflects the bigger, fatter bundle of television channels. Like many other services that are out there, it just happens to be integrated or attached to Hulu if you subscribe to it. This, in a way, I guess you'd argue competes with Hulu Live directly, but it doesn't compete with Hulu because this will be bundled with Hulu. If you're a Hulu subscriber and you want to get this new sports service, you can buy that as an add-on to Hulu. As we see it, that's a real positive because if you consider the fact that Disney+ and Hulu will be together once we come out of beta in March, they're already together in beta.\nYou add a sports feature with so many sports that this new joint venture will offer that's very, very compelling in terms of reducing churn for Hulu and increasing engagement. We look at this as a huge positive for Hulu. You know, we're realistic about Hulu Live in terms of the impact this could have. Hulu Live is certainly a nice, important feature of our Hulu business, but the critical part of that business is Hulu itself.\nMichael, I'll take the question on DTC profitability and double digit. Yeah, I know for the first time we put out that our objective is to get to double digit margins. In some ways that probably shouldn't be a surprise to investors because the goal has always been to build what I would characterize as a good business. What does a good business look like? Number one, it's got growing subscribers, and number two, it has attractive margins, which we're defining as double digits.\nI know in a sense it's news, but in a sense it shouldn't be news because we've always wanted to build a good business in that regard. In terms of how we get there, it's really in many ways the way that we've gotten from where we were to the point we're at right now. Number one, we're going to grow subscribers. Number two, you'll see some level of pricing, and both of those things will probably be similar to what you've seen over the last couple of years. Maybe a slightly different balance, but roughly similar. We'll actually get some leverage out of marketing spend, content, and technology spend.\nAll of those will grow a little bit less, at a lesser rate than the rate of revenue growth. In terms of the specifics on how do we get there with sub growth, I think it'll be a couple of things. Number one, paid sharing is an opportunity for us. It's one that our competitor is obviously taking advantage of, and one that sits in front of us. We've got some very specific actions that we're taking in the next couple of months, which I discussed earlier, which will benefit us to some degree in the back half of this year and very much next year.\nNumber two, we'll see lower churn with the bundles that we're looking to put out. Number three, International remains a growth opportunity for us. If you put all of those pieces together, it's kind of doing a lot of what we've been doing with maybe some slightly different tactics to get to a level that, again, we would characterize as a good business. Not going to put a specific time frame on that right now. Some of that is going to be driven by the marketplace. Just know that we feel a sense of urgency in getting there, and that's probably the way we're going to operate the business.. We'll feel urgency, but only to get to a good, sustainable business.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThank you, operator. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Securities.\n\nJessica Ehrlich\n\nManaging Director and Senior Media and Entertainment Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you. You guys covered so much ground tonight. I have one question and two follow ups. You announced, or for the first time I've heard you say this, that in parks, 70% of the $60 billion in CapEx that you outlined over the next 10 years, 70% of that will go to incremental capacity. Like, over $40 billion in new parks and attractions. Can you give us some color on timing and location? There's been speculation that you may open a fifth gate in Florida. Just the follow ups to a couple things you said, one, unpaid sharing crackdown, which came up twice. Have you sized the number of borrowers?\nOn the sports JV, how do you plan to attract non pay TV subs to what sounds like it might be an expensive sports service? Without a significant decrease in traditional pay TV subs, who would actually save money? Like, how do you not cannibalize?\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nOkay, you asked a lot of questions on a lot of different subjects. I'll take the first one. On parks, timing, and location. You know, we're already hard at work at basically determining where we're going to place our new investments and what they will be. You can pretty much conclude that they'll be all over, meaning every single one of our locations will be the beneficiary of increased investment, and thus increased capacity, including on the high seas where we're currently building three more ships.\nIn a business that is obviously extremely positive to us, we may look expansively, at least in the next decade, in that direction. I'm not going to really give you much more of a sense of timing, except that, you know, we're hard at work at getting these things, you know, basically conceived and built. We've got a menu of things that will basically start opening in 2025, and there'll be a cadence every year of additional, basically additional investment and increased capacity. I'll let you take care of the paid sharing, Hugh.\nOn the sports service and the pricing, I think the way you have to look at it is the sports service is going to be substantially less expensive to consumers than the big bundle that they'd have to buy to get those same channels on cable and satellite. Again, designed for two things. One, for we believe there are a number of sports fans out there that want to watch sports on television but didn't want to sign up to the big, you know, cable and satellite bundle. We think they will be accretive to us.\nWe also believe that either consumers have left the bundle because it was not serving them well, or they may leave the bundle and we want to make sure that we grab them, too. We view this whole thing as one being a good proposition for sports fans because of the cost, and certainly being positive for us because of the dynamics in the marketplace right now.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nSEVP and CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nOkay. Jessica, I'll handle the paid sharing question. We have sized it. I don't want to put a specific number out there right now because these numbers are obviously rough estimates anyway. Suffice to say that the opportunity that we see on a percentage basis probably isn't all that dramatically different from what our competitor has found in terms of their subscriber base, in terms of getting at it. There are a couple of actions that we've taken in order to do that.\nNumber one, we have made some changes to the user language that we have in the US, Canada, and certain markets so that we'll actually have the opportunity to act on the paid sharing opportunity. Number two, the accounts that we think are doing unpaid sharing right now will get communication this summer, and we'll give them opportunities to allow their borrowers to start new subscriptions.\nLater this year we'll actually also have account holders who want to allow further individuals to access their account from outside the household. They'll be able to access the account, but they'll be able to do so for an additional fee. We've got a number of tactical actions to take in order to take advantage of what we think is a pretty good-sized opportunity in front of us, and it's one of the things that gives us confidence in our subscriber growth numbers.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThank you, operator. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Steven Cahal with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nSteven Cahal\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you. Bob, you mentioned a lot of content in your remarks. It seems like the operations are really starting to hum again. I think the lifeblood of the company is always going to be the studio output. It drives so much culture. I think that's an area you've said that you've been spending a lot of time on. Do you feel like the content is also now turning the corner like you've seen in the operations? If so, when do you think we might see some of the results of that renewed focus on the studio output?\nHugh, I think an inevitable question with the buyback announcement is what you expect you might end up ultimately paying for Hulu. Just wondering if you have any sense on the timing of that outcome or situation. Related to that, I think the exceed $7.5 billion in savings was a bit new. Curious just where you found those extra buckets of cost savings. Thank you.\n\nHugh Johnston\n\nSEVP and CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nSteven, I feel great about where we are with the studio. Let's not lose sight of the fact that in the last year the studio had some real success. Not to suggest that we didn't have some films that were not successful that we were really disappointed. We also had some great success too with a Guardians sequel and Avatar at the end of calendar 2022, but part of fiscal 2023.\nOne of the things that I've been saying before is that, you know, volume sometimes can be detrimental to quality. In our zeal to greatly increase volume, partially tied to wanting to chase more global subs for our streaming platform, some of our studios lost a little focus. The first step that we've taken is that we've reduced volume, we've reduced output. Particularly at Marvel, when you fix or when you address these issues in movies, you do three things. You get aggressive at making sure the films you're making can be even better. Sometimes you kill projects you don't believe in.\nOf course, you put new things in the pipeline that you do believe in, that you have much more confidence in. We're doing all of that. I've also observed over the years that managing creativity sometimes is best done with great partnerships. I have established great partnerships with the people at our company that really manage your creativity. Alan Bergman of the studio, Dana Walden on the television side, Jimmy Pitaro at ESPN. The partnership that Alan and I have is a strong one.\nWe believe that the time that I'm now devoting to this, and the attention that the two of us are giving this business, not only will bear fruit, but it's already starting to. We're very bullish about the films coming out. We mentioned Inside Out 2, and we talked about Deadpool and the Planet of the Apes film. We feel good about that. Obviously, the end of the calendar year, we've got Mufasa, a prequel to Lion King.\nWe are very excited about the addition of Moana, which was the number one streamed movie across all streamers in the US in 2020 and is at over 1 billion hours of consumption on Disney+. That's now going to be a release in November. I mentioned what we're doing after that. I'd say we're leaning a little bit more into sequels and franchises, some that we feel great about, like Toy Story, for instance, obviously Star Wars, Avatar we've talked about. Marvel is starting to focus on some of its stronger franchises going forward, but I'll leave it at that.\nI think given the environment and given what it takes to get people out of their homes to see a film, leaning on franchises that are familiar is actually a smart thing. We've got work to do still. We're not resting on our laurels or sitting on our hands. We're working hard at it. I feel quite good about the trajectory.\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nSteve, from my perspective, regarding Hulu timing on that, we've got a pretty clearly defined process. That process is going to take a little bit of time based on the work that needs to go into valuing the business. I would expect before we get to the end of the year that we should have this figured out and closed. Regarding cost savings, it's pretty well spread out across the board.\nOne of the things you tend to find is when a company goes on a cost effort, once you start to build momentum on that, people tend to find additional opportunities, and that's what gives us the confidence around the numbers to at least meet, if not exceed, them. No one specific area. It's content side as well as SG&A side. I think we just have momentum on managing our expenses more tightly, which is great news, I think, for investors.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThank you, operator. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today comes from Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Kraft\n\nLead Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOh, hi. Good afternoon. Since there's so much discussion about bundling and distribution, I was wondering if I could ask you if you could share any observations related to Charter integrating Disney into its pay TV programming tiers. Is there anything you could say about the percentage of customers actually using it, or engagement levels relative to the average Disney subscriber? Maybe lastly, do you think that this is a model that you'd like to replicate with other pay TV distributors over time as your agreements come up for renewal? Thanks.\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, Bryan. It's really early. They didn't start introducing this to their subscribers until January, and they didn't roll it all out right away. We're seeing some stats on this that are somewhat encouraging. I want to be careful that you know that because it's early, we're not sure whether those trends will continue or not. I do think that this kind of arrangement is one that we'll likely see with other multichannel distributors.\nIt seemed like it was a win-win for both of us, important to us obviously because it gives us access to more of their customers, and important to them in terms of bundling this service with their multichannel customers. I think you'll see more in this direction, but it's too early yet.We may have more to say about this next quarter when we know a lot more.\n\nBryan Kraft\n\nLead Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nWe have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question today comes from Michael Morris with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Morris\n\nSenior Managing Director and Equity Research Analyst, Guggenheim\n\nThank you. Good afternoon. One follow-up on the sports JV first, and that is, how did you get comfortable that the availability of the service won't drive accelerated cord cutting and become an economic drag on your business and the business more broadly? How do you expect this to impact your renewal discussions with your distribution partners? That's my first, and then my second. Bob, you've seen several iterations of the video game strategy during your tenure. Can you talk a little bit more about why this investment in Epic Games is the right move for you here, and what a product might look like and when that may come to market? Thank you.\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company",
    "content2": "Sure. Let me take the second part of the question first. Yes, you're right. We've tried our hand at video games in a number of different directions, and actually the one that ended up being the most successful for us was the license. In fact, we've licensed, I think, nine billion dollar franchises, including the Spider-Man franchise, which is the most successful video game.\nLast year after I came back, I sat down with Josh D'Amaro, who runs our experiences business, and his executive who actually manages games, Sean Shoptaw. One of the things they showed me, actually the first they showed me, were demographic trends. When I saw Gen Z, Gen Alpha, and even Millennials, and I saw the amount of time they were spending in terms of their total media screen time on video games, it was stunning to me, equal to what they spend on TV and movies.\nThe conclusion I reached was we have to be there, and we have to be there as soon as we possibly can in a very compelling way. We knew through our relationship with friends that there was already success when some of our characters and franchise were expressed showed up in Fortnite. We knew Tim Sweeney at Epic because we were involved. He was involved in our accelerator program, I think in 2017. I met with Tim and Josh and his team started a discussion about what if we create a gigantic Disney world a la Fortnite that could live next to Fortnite and be completely interconnected with it.\nA world where people could play games that we create, could create their own games, could watch, you can imagine the creation of short form videos, or we may even use the platform to actually distribute some of our content. Also, people that could interact with one another and ultimately some form of shopping as well, and other forms of creation. Obviously, there'll be some opportunities to buy digital goods, but maybe even at some point physical goods. I just think that given the demographic trends and given the success of Fortnite, and by the way, they're experiencing a really a great era of both customer satisfaction and growth as they return to some of their roots.\nThe numbers at Fortnite have been really compelling, and we just think this is just as we take our IP from our movies and our television and have them expressed in our parks. This is a great way to do it in games, and for us it's a way to have skin in the game with them with the investment of $1.5 billion, strengthen a partnership because we have skin in the game, but also build a world where we're actually not creating too much risk for the company. As we see it, this is the best of all worlds and in many respects from a business venture perspective, and certainly great for consumers who love to interact with our characters already in video game formats.\nI'm actually really thrilled about it. The second or the first part of your first question, accelerating cord cutting. Understand that we're going to get paid in this new joint venture for our channels at a level that's commensurate with the level that we get paid for those channels in the multichannel ecosystem. If a consumer moves out of that and then into this, then what we get paid for, certainly the channels that are in it, is equal to what we get paid there. We have some other channels that are not part of this new bundle.\nFrankly, if you look at our company and you look at what we've done with FX on Hulu, with the Disney Channel on Disney, with National Geographic on Disney+, you know, we're really very well positioned to withstand, you know, basically, you know, the continued challenges that the multichannel ecosystem will have. While, you know, there might be some de minimis economic impact on us with more cord cutting for those channels, we're backstopped in all of those channels with the content that exists or that we ultimately put on Hulu and Disney+. For us, it's very low risk and actually, as I talked earlier, potentially quite accretive to us in terms of signing up sports fans that have never signed up for the bundle or that may no longer want it.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nOkay, thanks for the question, and I want to thank everyone for joining us today.

Please go ahead.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nGood afternoon. It's my pleasure to welcome everybody to the Walt Disney Company's Q4 2023 Earnings Call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay and transcript, as well as the Q4 earnings presentation, will all be made available on our website after the call. Joining me for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chief Executive Officer, and Kevin Lansberry, Interim Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Kevin, we will be happy to take some of your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, Alexia, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we begin, this week we announced that Hugh Johnston will be joining the Walt Disney Company as Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer after 34 years with PepsiCo. It's great to have Hugh joining Disney at this important moment for our company. I'd also like to thank Kevin Lansberry, who stepped into the CFO role on an interim basis earlier this year and has provided strong leadership in the months since.\nKevin is returning to his role as CFO of our Disney Experiences segment, and you'll hear more from him in just a bit. Now let's turn to the quarter. Our results this quarter speak volumes about the underlying strength of our company and the remarkable amount of work we have accomplished this past year.\nQ4 adjusted earnings per share nearly tripled over the prior year, and all three of our businesses, Entertainment, Experiences, and Sports, saw significant increases in Q4 operating income compared to Q4 of fiscal 2022. The thorough restructuring of our company has enabled tremendous efficiencies and we're on track to achieve roughly $7.5 billion in cost reductions, which is approximately $2 billion more than we targeted earlier this year.\nOur new structure also enabled us to greatly enhance our effectiveness, particularly in streaming, where we've created a more unified, cohesive, and highly coordinated approach to marketing, pricing, and programming. This has helped us improve operating results of our combined streaming businesses by approximately $1.4 billion from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023, and we remain confident that we will achieve profitability in Q4 of fiscal 2024.\nAnd most importantly, our new structure has restored creativity to the center of our company, and we certainly know from our now 100-year history that nothing is more important or critical to our success. Indeed, our strong creative accomplishments helped drive impressive growth in Core Disney Plus subs with nearly seven million added in the quarter. This reflects the success of numerous popular titles that hit the platform, including Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, The Little Mermaid, and Elemental, continuing the trend of our theatrical releases being some of the most watched content on Disney Plus.\nKey originals also performed incredibly well across all our platforms, including Ahsoka on Disney Plus, The Kardashians, which is now our most viewed unscripted Hulu original series ever, and the spectacular Korean original series Moving, which has become a breakout hit.\nAs I reflect on our achievement this past year, I'm mindful of the fact that a lot of time and effort was spent on fixing, both contending with certain decisions made in the recent past and addressing the numerous challenges brought on by disruption and the pandemic. And while we still have work to do to continue improving results, our progress has allowed us to move beyond this period of fixing and begin building our businesses again.\nAs we look forward, we are focusing on four key building opportunities that will be central to our success, and they are achieving significant and sustained profitability in our streaming business, building ESPN into the preeminent digital sports platform, improving the output and economics of our film studios, and turbocharging growth in our experiences business.\nWe have already made considerable progress on these four opportunities, and we will continue to move forward with a sense of purpose and urgency. I've articulated many of my thoughts about our strategic initiatives, so today I want to discuss in more detail these four building opportunities as we enter this next phase. First is turning streaming into a profitable growth business, and I'm pleased to say our recent performance solidifies that we are on that path.\nIn the four years since we launched Disney Plus, which generated roughly 10 million sign-ups in the first 24 hours alone, Core Disney Plus subscribers have now reached over 112 million as of the end of fiscal 2023, including the nearly 7 million we gained this quarter. What's more, our ad-supported Disney Plus product grew by approximately 2 million subscriptions in Q4 to a total of 5.2 million.\nIn fact, more than 50% of Q4 new US subscribers chose an ad-supported Disney Plus product, and over the past six months, these AVOD subs spent 34% more time watching the service. We have the best advertiser technology in the streaming business globally, and we have just introduced new tools that will make this an even more attractive platform for advertisers, much as we've done with Hulu. And speaking of Hulu, we were pleased to announce last week that we will acquire the remaining stake in Hulu held by Comcast, which will further Disney's streaming objectives.\nWe remain on track to roll out a more unified One App experience domestically, making extensive general entertainment content available to bundle subscribers via Disney Plus.\nThat includes critical and audience favorites like Hulu's Only Murders in the Building, The Bear, Abbott Elementary, as well as titles from our extensive content library built over decades, including adult animation standouts like Family Guy and long-running hit series like 9-1-1, which is moving to ABC for season seven. We expect that Hulu on Disney Plus will result in increased engagement, greater advertising opportunities, lower churn, and reduced customer acquisition costs, thereby increasing our overall margins.\nWe will launch a beta version for bundle subscribers in December, giving parents time to set up profiles and parental controls that work best for their families ahead of the official launch in early spring 2024. Also, we have additional opportunities for improvement in our streaming business that will come from implementing stronger standards around account sharing, although given the timing of our planned rollout, we don't expect a meaningful impact until 2025.\nNow that we have realigned our pricing and marketing strategies, focused aggressively on getting the technology right, merged our creative and distribution teams, and restored creative excellence as our singular motivating priority with the content we create, we are bullish about the future of our streaming business. As you consider the components and the future of that business, just imagine the opportunities that a further combined Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN streaming experience could offer us as a company and our consumers.\nAnother core building opportunity is taking ESPN, which is already the world's leading sports brand, and turning it into the preeminent digital sports platform, allowing us to reach fans in compelling new ways and fully integrating key features into our primary ESPN offering.\nWe're already moving quickly down this path, and we are exploring strategic partnerships to help advance our efforts through marketing, technology, distribution, and additional content. As we continue to develop our streaming business, the continued strength of ESPN relative to the backdrop of notable linear industry declines demonstrates the value of sports and the power of the ESPN brand. Overall, our domestic ESPN business grew in revenue and operating income in both fiscal 2022 and in fiscal 2023.\nThis fiscal year also saw the network deliver its best overall viewership in four years and its highest viewership in the key 18 to 49 demographic in the same time period. ESPN viewership was up in each of the four quarters as well, maintaining steady success throughout the entire year.\nAcross ESPN networks, the company increased its already industry-leading share of sports viewership in fiscal 2023, and we continue to see stability in ad sales despite challenges facing the broader media industry. ESPN Bet will launch next week through our agreement with Penn Entertainment, and we're excited to bring sports fans this compelling new experience. Regarding our broader linear business, we continue to evaluate options for each of our linear networks with the goal of identifying the best strategic path for the company and maximizing shareholder value.\nHowever, our review of the business thus far has uncovered significant long-term cost opportunities, which we are implementing while continuing to deliver high-quality content. Speaking of which, I'd like to acknowledge the world-class journalists and producers at ABC News.\nOver the past few months, many have risked their lives to keep our audiences informed during relentless news cycles and made ABC number one in network news for the 11th consecutive year. Next is the need to strengthen the creative output of our film studio, which generates value throughout the entire company. To achieve this, we are focusing heavily on the core brands and franchises that fuel all of our businesses and reducing output overall to enable us to concentrate on fewer projects and improve quality while continuing our effort around the creation of fresh and compelling original IP.\nI'm devoting considerably more of my time to this with the goal of improving returns, always seeking to exceed the level of creative excellence audiences expect from Disney.\nMeanwhile, we have four of the top 10 highest-grossing films at the global box office this year, including Pixar's Elemental, which has grossed nearly $500 million worldwide, in addition to being the most viewed film released this year on Disney Plus. We have more new releases still to come in calendar year 2023, including The Marvels from Marvel Studios, which will be released this Friday, and Wish, our newest film from Walt Disney Animation Studios, which marks our company's 100th anniversary and will be in theaters beginning 22 November.\nWe're also looking forward to our strong theatrical slate in 2024, with several films tied to popular franchises like Deadpool 3, featuring Wolverine, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, and Inside Out 2. Additionally, Mufasa: The Lion King, and sequels from our Toy Story, Frozen, Zootopia, and Avatar franchises are all in the works.\nFinally, we have an opportunity to build Disney Experiences into an even bigger and more successful cash flow generation business. Parks and Experiences overall remains a growth story, and we are managing our portfolio exceptionally well. Even in the case of Walt Disney World, where we have a tough comparison to the prior year, when you look at this year's numbers compared to pre-pandemic levels in fiscal 2019, we have seen growth in revenue and operating income of over 25% and 30%, respectively.\nOver the last five years, return on invested capital has nearly doubled in our domestic parks, and we have seen sizable increases over that same timeframe across the total experiences portfolio as well. Not to mention the improved guest experience ratings we're now seeing at every one of our parks.\nAs we announced in September, we plan to turbocharge growth in our experiences business through strategic investments over the next decade. Given our wealth of IP, innovative technology, buildable land, unmatched creativity, and strong returns on invested capital, we're confident about the potential from our new investments. Looking at the company as a whole, today we are focused on driving profitable growth and value creation as we move from a period of fixing to a new era of building.\nWe have a strong balance sheet, and we expect free cash flow to significantly improve in fiscal 2024, approaching pre-COVID levels. Disney's experiences business, with its expansive offerings around the world, is a key differentiator and remains a powerful growth engine, expanding operating margins by nearly 300 basis points over the past five years.\nAs we transition ESPN to a streaming future and more fully integrate general entertainment content into Disney Plus, we will have a DTC offering unlike any other in the industry, and Disney's leadership and workforce around the world are second to none. When you combine all of that with our unrivaled portfolio of valuable businesses, brands, and assets, and the way we manage them together, Disney has a strong hand that differentiates us from others in the industry.\nOur results this quarter are a testament to the work we've done across the company this past year, and I'm bullish about the opportunities we have to create lasting growth and shareholder value, and to strengthen Disney's position as the world's leading entertainment company. With that, I will turn things over to Kevin. Thank you, Bob. I appreciate your kind words at the outset of the call.\n\nKevin Lansberry\n\nInterim CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nIt's been an honor serving as interim CFO these past few months. We are excited to welcome Hugh to the Walt Disney Company, and I look forward to working with both of you on all that's ahead. Now, to dive into this quarter's results. Diluted earnings per share, excluding certain items, increased versus the prior year to $0.82 in the fiscal Q4 and $3.76 for the full fiscal year.\nThis past year has been marked by both transformation and execution, and we are pleased with the momentum we are building and the results we've realized, including meeting our guide of high single-digit percentage growth in both revenue and operating income for fiscal 2023. Total company revenues for the year increased 7%, and segment operating income grew by 8%, excluding the impact of accelerated depreciation from the Galactic Starcruiser.\nFree cash flow for the year increased substantially, totaling close to $5 billion, driven by the work we've been doing on the cost efficiency front and by improvement in our underlying financial results. A few weeks ago, we published our recast financials aligned to our newly reorganized segment structure. Today, I'll be walking through the Q4's financial results for each of our three segments: entertainment, sports, and experiences, and I'll also provide some color for the year ahead.\nStarting off with entertainment, Q4 operating income grew by over $800 million versus the prior year quarter, driven by improvement in our direct-to-consumer business. We continue to make headway on our path to profitability in streaming, with Q4 operating losses at our entertainment DTC services improving by nearly $1 billion versus the prior year, or $85 million sequentially to $420 million.\nNote that our entertainment direct-to-consumer results exclude ESPN+. Including ESPN+, our combined streaming businesses had an operating loss in the Q4 of $387 million, a year-over-year improvement of a little over $1 billion, and a sequential improvement of $125 million. As Bob noted earlier, we added nearly 7 million Disney Plus Core Subs over the past quarter, reflecting strong content performance and our global summer promotion. Disney Plus Core ARPU increased sequentially by $0.12, driven by pricing increases and higher advertising revenue, partially offset by the impact of the summer promotion.\nThe Disney Plus Ad Tier added approximately 2 million subs during the Q4 and ended the fiscal year with 5.2 million subscribers. We anticipate core Disney Plus subscribers in fiscal Q1 will decline slightly versus Q4 due to the expected temporary uptick in churn from the recent US.\nPrice increases, as well as from the end of the summer promotion. However, we expect to see sub growth rebound later in the fiscal year. Growth in entertainment DTC advertising revenue of 4% in Q4 versus the prior year partially offset linear ad declines. The growth reflects an increase at Disney Plus, while Hulu results declined due to lower political and technology category advertising. We continue to expect to reach profitability at our combined streaming businesses in Q4 of fiscal 2024, although, as we have mentioned in the past, we don't expect linear progress from quarter-to-quarter.\nWhile we expect entertainment DTC operating losses in Q1 to be generally in line with Q4 due to higher sports rights costs at ESPN+ aligned with the start of the NHL season, we anticipate a modest sequential decline in Q1 for the combined streaming business.\nBut as we have also said previously, we anticipate upward momentum later in the fiscal year to be driven by realizing the full impact of price increases, the launch of the Ad Tier internationally, and subscriber growth. At Linear Networks, which now excludes our sports channels, Q4 operating income was flat to the prior year, reflecting lower advertising and affiliate revenues, which were generally offset by a decrease in marketing, programming, and production costs. Advertising revenue declines were driven by our domestic business, primarily at ABC and our own TV stations.\nDomestic entertainment affiliate revenue decreased by 4% in the Q4 versus the prior year due to a six-point decline from fewer subscribers and a 1.5-point adverse impact from the Charter blackout, partially offset by a roughly four-point impact from higher rates.\nAs Bob mentioned, we remain focused on driving additional cost efficiencies in this business over the long term. Content sales, licensing, and other lower operating results versus the prior year were due to lower theatrical results, partially offset by higher home entertainment results. We currently expect that Q1 operating income will be roughly break-even and comparable to the prior year. Moving to our sports segment, Q4 operating income increased by 14% versus the prior year.\nResults were driven by our domestic ESPN business from lower programming and production costs, growth in subscription revenue at ESPN+ due to both pricing and sub growth, and lower marketing costs, partially offset by lower affiliate revenue. The decrease in programming and production costs reflects the absence of the Big Ten.\nDomestic ESPN linear advertising revenue increased by 1% in the Q4 versus the prior year, despite the absence of the Big Ten, the Charter blackout, and a highly competitive marketplace. Domestic affiliate revenue decreased by a little less than 5% in Q4 versus the prior year, as 5.5 points of growth from higher rates were offset by adverse impacts of approximately 7.5 points from fewer subscribers and two points from the Charter blackout. As Bob referenced earlier, it's worth noting that ESPN's domestic business grew both full-year revenue and operating income in each of the last two years.\nThese results give us confidence in our belief that sports has the power to drive value for the company, even in the face of challenging industry headwinds. Finally, at experiences, Q4 operating results increased by over 30% versus the prior year quarter and 27% versus fiscal 2019.\nOperating margins at the segment were 22% in Q4, an increase of 3 percentage points versus the prior year. Our international operations continued their strong performance trend in the quarter, with significant growth across all sites versus the prior year. Disney Cruise Line, Disney Vacation Club, and Disneyland Resort also all saw strong year-over-year growth in both revenue and operating income.\nAt Walt Disney World, operating results decreased, driven by the accelerated depreciation from the closure of the Galactic Starcruiser, along with inflationary impacts and the continued comparison to the 50th anniversary celebration in the prior year. Looking towards fiscal 2024, we anticipate robust annual operating income growth at experiences to reflect continued strong performance at our international parks and Disney Cruise Line.\nWhile domestic parks and experiences are expecting solid growth for the full year, that growth will be heavily back-end loaded due to continued challenging comparisons in the first half of the year from the 50th anniversary at Walt Disney World, in addition to wage inflation. We continue to be bullish on the long-term positioning of our experiences business, as evidenced by a recent announcement on significant investments we plan to make over the next 10 years to turbocharge growth in this area.\nWe expect those investments to ramp up towards the back half of that 10-year period, with more gradual increases in the first few years. As has been the case historically, CapEx for the parks are largely effectively self-funded, given the strong returns these investments generate over time.\nI would also note that a portion of the investments in our theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong is funded out of joint venture cash flows. Before we conclude and move to Q&A, there are a number of additional items I'd like to share for context on the year ahead. First, on capital expenditures, fiscal 2023 CapEx totaled approximately $5 billion, roughly comparable to the prior year and in line with our most recent guidance.\nWe expect CapEx in fiscal 2024 to total $6 billion, an increase of approximately $1 billion versus fiscal 2023, driven by higher spend at experiences. CapEx at experiences in fiscal 2024 will look more comparable to fiscal 2019 levels and include spend at our cruise business ahead of the launch of three new ships in fiscal 2025 and 2026.\nOur enterprise-wide content spend in fiscal 2023 was $27 billion, in line with our guidance and about $3 billion below the prior year, as we significantly reduced our spend on entertainment content. As a result of our continued work to be more efficient in our content spend, in addition to impacts from the strikes and the timing of sports payments, we expect total content spend in fiscal 2024 to be approximately $25 billion, which is a decrease of $2 billion versus 2023.\nNote that sports rights now account for over 40% of our enterprise-wide content spend. Our annualized entertainment cash content spend reduction target is now $4.5 billion, excluding strike impacts and sports rights, versus $3 billion previously.\nWe expect this to be realized on a cash basis in fiscal 2024, although it will take a few years for the bulk of these savings to be reflected in the P&L due to the timing of amortization. On the topic of cost savings and streamlining our operations, we have eliminated over 8,000 roles. And while we are not currently planning to make further large-scale reductions to our workforce, we are taking significant concrete steps to continue addressing the cost basis of the overall company.\nWe have increased our annualized efficiency target for total company SG&A and other operating expenses to $3 billion versus $2.5 billion previously, including the strike impacts. Approximately $2 billion of these efficiencies were achieved in fiscal 2023.\nNaturally, we also saw inflation and volume-related cost increases throughout the year, including higher content amortization and costs related to expanded operations at international parks and cruise, which were impacted by closures and limited operating capacity in the prior year. The remainder of these savings are expected to be achieved by the end of fiscal 2024.\nOur expense base in fiscal 2024 is expected to only increase slightly versus the prior year, as these efficiencies and strike savings will mostly offset the year's planned volume-related growth and inflation. Adding the new $4.5 billion cash content spend reduction target to the $3 billion expense target brings our total annualized target to $7.5 billion, as Bob announced earlier.\nAll of these factors, in addition to continued growth and improvement across our underlying businesses, are expected to come together over the coming fiscal year to result in free cash flow generation of roughly $8 billion, a significant year-over-year increase and approaching levels we last achieved pre-pandemic. This continued robust free cash flow growth, alongside our strong balance sheet, will position us well to address our investment and shareholder return goals for the year and going forward.\nTo that end, we will be recommending to the board that they declare a dividend by the end of this calendar year. While this will be just the starting point, we do see ample opportunity to continue to increase shareholder returns in the future as our earnings and free cash flow grow in the form of increased dividends or share buybacks, and we look forward to sharing more as we move ahead.\nWith that, I will turn the call back to Alexia for Q&A.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, Kevin. As we transition to Q&A, we ask that you please try to limit yourself to one question in order to help us get to as many answers as possible today. With that, operator, we're ready for the first question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe first question will come from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. You may now go ahead.\n\nMichael Nathanson\n\nAnalyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nThanks. Hey, Bob. I have two quick ones for you. This is your first earnings call post the Charter-Disney agreement. So stepping back, what are the most important impacts to Disney after that agreement? And then how will you manage the company differently now that that is kind of the template going forward for new deals? And secondly, on film studio, you know your first stint, you had the most amazing content cycle on film we've ever seen.\nSo I wonder, what do you think is ailing the film slate this time around? And what are your priorities to fixing it as you lay out some of your top three priorities? But what are you doing in particular to fix the film slate going forward? Thanks.\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, Michael. Regarding Charter, first of all, as we said when we did the deal, we think it's a great deal for us. I also think it's a great deal for Charter. It doesn't really change things much in terms of our strategy because when you look at the deal, it actually ended up reflecting exactly what our strategic priorities are. That is streaming. And the distribution agreement for Disney Plus, as part of the overall Charter deal, does just that. So it leans into our streaming priorities, and that strategy doesn't change things much.\nHaving the opportunity to consolidate a bit on the channel side is, I think, a good thing at this point. In terms of the studio, nice of you to mention just what our great run. First of all, let's put things in perspective.\nRecently, we did have four really strong titles and four of the top 10 in the past year, led by Avatar, of course. But there were other successes too. That said, as I've looked at our overall output, meaning the studio, it's clear that the pandemic created a lot of challenges creatively for everybody, including for us. In addition, at the time the pandemic hit, we were leaning into a huge increase in how much we were making. And I've always felt that quantity can be actually a negative when it comes to quality.\nAnd I think that's exactly what happened. We lost some focus. And so working with the talented team at the studio, we're looking to and working to consolidate, meaning make less, focus more on quality. We're all rolling up our sleeves, including myself, to do just that.\nWe have obviously great assets, great stories to tell from the assets that we either have or that we purchased. And I feel really optimistic about the slate going forward, which is going to be a balance between some really strong sequels to some very, very popular titles, as well as some good original content, starting with Wish, which comes out Thanksgiving weekend. So I feel good about the direction we're headed, but I'm mindful of the fact that our performance from a quality perspective wasn't really up to the standards that we set for ourselves.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThank you. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo. You may now go ahead.\n\nSteven Cahall\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you. First on DTC, I mean, pricing is about to step up. You announced the cost-cutting program, some of which might be at DTC or Hulu. Bob, I think for a couple of quarters, you've just been talking about how confident you are in streaming profitability. I'm not asking for guidance, but is there any way for us to just frame what DTC can look like beyond break-even, since that's really the biggest driver of earnings growth and value creation? Then on the ESPN side, just as we think about that preeminent sports platform that you're looking to build, so many folks have already voted with their feet to be outside of the bundle.\nHow do you think about putting something into the market more quickly, maybe at a high price point that doesn't disrupt the bundle, just to see if the cord cutters or cord never have some demand? Thank you.\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nI'll take the second part first. Our plan when we bring ESPN direct-to-consumer, which is inevitable, which is going to happen, and we're planning for it, is to try to have what I'll call a soft landing, which is continue to make it available as part of the bundle for those people that want to remain in the bundle or people who feel that the bundle still has value to them, and at the same time, to make it available on a true à la carte basis in DTC form.\nSo it is our hope that it will serve basically the consumer in two ways, in the traditional way and in a new way. And we'll obviously see in terms of where we end up, the blend of basically consumers that stay in the bundle and those that leave. We're not concerned about it.\nAnd actually, as we model basically ESPN into the future, we see that in some cases, it will continue to be sold as part of the bundle. To the first question, the trajectory of DTC, we're not going to get specific. We're not giving any guidance beyond our guidance about becoming profitable at the end of 2024. But the building blocks are in place to turn this into a real growth business for us. And the recent announcement about purchasing the remaining stake in Hulu is just one of those building blocks.\nOn the pricing side, we did take Disney Plus prices up for the premium service, the non-advertiser-supported, by about 27%. It's still really early to tell, but we had taken those prices up significantly a year earlier, and churn was de minimis.\nSo we felt we had the room, particularly as we improved quality on the Disney Plus service, where overall our strategy regarding pricing is more sophisticated, more coordinated across the world than it had been before. As we look at growing that business, a smarter approach to pricing is one. Bundling is another. I'm going to come back to the bundle between Disney Plus and Hulu and then the opportunity to bundle ESPN.\nClearly, we've got technology improvements in the works, whether it comes to account sharing or whether it comes to basically lowering customer acquisition costs, churn, and lowering marketing expenses and growing margins. That's part of it. Advertising is a strong component of that. We did not take pricing up for Disney Plus advertiser-supported services.\nThe delta between the advertiser-supported and the premium service is wider because we like the ARPU that we get basically from both sides. So we feel really good about the potential of this business. Look, if you think about the portfolio of streaming assets that we will have, Hulu, Disney Plus, and ESPN, that's a very, very strong hand. In December, we launch a beta version of Hulu and Disney Plus combined. We feel really good about that. I saw basically some demos of that just yesterday, as a matter of fact.\nWe are basically putting it in beta so that we can prepare parents largely to basically implement parental controls because you'll be able to access Hulu programming on the same app. Then in late March, we'll launch it basically in full form.\nI think we have opportunities in terms of upsell capabilities, in terms of increasing engagement. We found that where we bundle, we lower churn. And again, these are steps that are all taken to ultimately turn this into a great business. Lastly, in terms of cost reductions, we created basically a one-world approach to streaming. We had multiple organizations before. We now have one run globally by Dana Walden and Alan Bergman. They have created an entirely new senior management team across the globe to manage these assets.\nWe're doing so much more cohesively, including, by the way, balancing spending in-market, local spending, and what I'll call global spending. One thing that we have recently really come to appreciate is the performance of our big title films, the so-called pay-one window films on the service. Elemental is one. Guardians of the Galaxy 3 was another. Little Mermaid III.\nThe numbers are huge. That's a differentiator for us, certainly when it comes to competing with Netflix, for instance, which is the gold standard. But by leaning more into some of those films, and while we improve the quality of them, it gives us the ability to dial back a bit on some of the spending and investment in series. And that blend of spending between films and series, we believe, gives us an opportunity to increase our margins and grow the business.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nAll right. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. You may now go ahead.\n\nBen Swinburne\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks. Good afternoon. I want to come back to the free cash flow commentary because that's pretty interesting and new. And also ask you, Bob, about your US sports business and ESPN. So on cash flow, $8 billion of free cash flow, $6 billion of CapEx, getting to $14 billion of cash from operations. You haven't done a number like that, I think, since 2018. And I'm just trying to understand if you think you can sustain and grow your company at that level of cash content spend.\nI think Kevin said $25 billion because that certainly allows you to really grow free cash flow from a base that's already higher than people were expecting in 2024. Hopefully, that made sense. And then on the sports side, Bob, people think about ESPN as a network facing cord-cutting, et cetera.\nYou clearly have a vision there that you think can grow over time. Can you talk a little bit about how you think about growing the sports business? Do you think you can, between linear and digital and other ancillary services, sort of grow your sports business over time? Because that would be another area where you'd certainly outperform expectations. Thanks so much.\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nI'll take the question about ESPN first. Interesting. I just saw statistics. ESPN is the number one brand on TikTok. Not the number one sports brand, not the number one media brand, the number one brand with about 44 million followers, which is an incredible statistic. ESPN is a very popular, high-end, in-demand product in the United States and unique, we believe. And we feel leaning into it is the smart thing to do because of its unique quality, how popular it is, and how profitable it has been.\nWe believe we have an opportunity there as we bring it in the direct-to-consumer direction to strengthen our hand when we do that by partnering with either tech companies that can provide us with marketing, technology support, customer acquisition help, or sports leagues that can provide us with more content. It's that simple. We're actually quite bullish about it.\nFrankly, if we were to just sit back and leave ESPN alone kind of as part of the linear bundle, we know ultimately where that would bring us. It certainly wouldn't bring us in a growth direction because of basically the continued decrease in multichannel subscribers. This is a way to really buck that trend, continue to allow it to be part of the multichannel bundle, but also make it available on an à la carte basis, basically taking a very popular product, in fact, and make it available and possibly strengthening it by doing what I described earlier.\nIt's that simple. When we think about the building blocks of the company, which right now we believe there are four, one of them obviously is streaming overall. Another one we've talked about, which is parks and resorts and turbocharging that growth.\nThe third I talked about earlier, which is returning the studio to basically the level of success that we became used to before the pandemic. The fourth is turning ESPN into a preeminent digital sports platform. Kevin, you talked about cash flow.\n\nKevin Lansberry\n\nInterim CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nYeah. Ben, with respect to cash flow, we do feel good about where we are ending up in 2024 from a content spend perspective. When you take a look at how we're getting to that year-over-year, lower content spend is clearly part of it, but the continued growth and improvement in our underlying business is also a huge component of that, as is the annualized efficiency targets that we have all implemented. Those things are driving a significant amount of year-over-year improvement in our cash flow.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nAll right. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Securities. You may now go ahead.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nManaging Director and Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you. Excuse me. Thank you. Bob, I was wondering if you could give us your sort of holistic view on advertising and what's going on. I mean, we know money's going into retail media networks and things like that. But how much can you, as a company, make up on AVOD versus what's going on with linear? And maybe you can give us your view on what is going on with linear for you. And then on India, it's been a notably challenging market, consistent money loser. Can you talk about your view of kind of ultimately where that winds up? Do you own it? Do you JV it? Do you exit the market?\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nJessica, first of all, in India, our Linear business actually does quite well, is making money. But we know that other parts of that business are challenged for us and for others. We are looking, I'll call it expansively. I know I've said this before. It always gets me in trouble. But we're considering our options there. If we have an opportunity to strengthen our hand, it is now maybe the most populous country in the world or maybe just still second to China and about to pass them. We'd like to stay in that market.\nBut we're also looking to see whether we can strengthen our hand, obviously improve the bottom line. In terms of advertising, we are actually finding that Linear is a little bit stronger than we had expected it would be. It's not back as much as we would like.\nIt's still a challenge, but it's not as bad as it had been. We've seen some slight improvement. Actually, the tech sector is still somewhat weak. But in general, overall, advertising has improved. We're finding obviously great demand for addressable advertising. I noted on an interview I did earlier that we've now put tools in place. We're using tools in Disney Plus to provide advertisers with better targeting. They're starting to work. And in general, sports has been very, very strong.\nSo as we look at the advertising marketplace right now, while it's not as strong as we would like it to be, it's certainly not as bad as some people think it is. And it's working for us. On AVOD, look, it's very, very clear that the tools that the new platforms provide advertisers are exactly what the advertisers are looking for. Those platforms are an advertiser's dream.\nAnd we know that the more data, the more detail, the more context, the more targeting we can provide, the better off we'll be. Hulu had an extremely robust advertising engine. We actually think we've got one of the best in the business, if not the best. And so actually, that combination of Hulu and Disney Plus with some of the tools that we put in place is going to give us the ability to have a blended CPM, grow engagement, grow advertising. So we're quite bullish about our position media-wise in an advertising marketplace.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nOperator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from John Hodulik with UBS. You may now go ahead.\n\nJohn Hodulik\n\nMedia and Telecom Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thanks. Maybe first a follow-up to Ben's question. Bob, is there an opportunity for ESPN to add local sports rights given what's happening to the RSN model or potentially add sports rights to be distributed outside the US? That's the first question. And then second question is Warner Bros. basically made some news recently by licensing some of their what would be considered some of their tentpole content, their DC universe to Netflix. Is that something you think that Disney can do or can lean into at least more so than you're doing now without diluting the Disney brand or the Disney Plus growth prospects? Thanks.\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nGood question, John. Thank you. We've actually been licensing content to Netflix and are going to continue to. We're actually in discussion with them now about some opportunities. But I wouldn't expect that we will license our core brands to them. Those are real, obviously competitive advantages for us and differentiators. Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, for instance, all doing very, very well on our platform. And I don't see why, just basically to chase bucks, we should do that when they are really, really important building blocks to the current and future of our streaming business.\nRegarding local sports, the technology that we will have for ESPN DTC will give us the ability to provide local sports in a pretty robust way, basically what the RSNs are doing. But we're not really aiming to do so by taking on significant risk.\nSo if we can find the right kind of business arrangements and partnerships, I think we'll look very seriously at providing local sports as part of that platform. But again, not if it results in us taking on too much risk.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nAll right. Thank you. Operator, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question will come from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. You may now go ahead.\n\nPhil Cusick\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHi, guys. Thank you. Bob, first follow-up on ESPN, clearly a big priority. Can you give us some update on types of potential ESPN partners and what the hurdles might be to get those partnerships announced? And then second, maybe if you could dig into the recent trends of parks. There's been some noise on pricing, but what have you seen from consumer demand, both in Orlando and around the country? And how do you think that Walt Disney World is doing versus the overall Orlando market? Thanks very much.\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThe first question.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nFirst question was on the conversation with Mr.\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nOh, thank you. Sorry. Sorry, Phil. I was listening to your second question. I forgot your first one. Senior moment. What basically we've been saying and what we've been exploring is that as we prepare to take ESPN in the direct-to-consumer direction, we believe that we have opportunities to strengthen our hand with entities that either provide us with technology, marketing support, for instance, or companies or entities, I should say, that can provide us with more content.\nWe feel we have an excellent hand, by the way, and could do it without that, but why not explore strengthening our hand? And so since I noted that we were interested in this back in July, we've engaged with a number of different entities. I can say that there's significant interest out there.\nThere are obviously complexities to it, but not complexities, or not hurdles, that are so high that we can't jump over them. We're going to continue to explore it. I would imagine we'll have more to say about this in the coming months. But I don't want to say much more right now, except, again, there's serious interest out there. I think there's a path or paths to deals, but we're working through them. Obviously, as soon as they're completed, we'll let everybody know. You want to take the consumer demand question?\n\nKevin Lansberry\n\nInterim CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nYep. So, with respect to the parks, and I think we've talked about it in our prepared remarks with respect to Walt Disney World, and just, we're lapping the 50th there. So we're going to continue to have a little bit of that lapping effect that will continue for a little bit as we go through Q1. But as I look out at the other domestic businesses, especially, Disneyland continues to look exceptionally strong, as does Disney Cruise Line. So bookings at all of those continue to be very, very strong going forward. So domestically, we feel good, and internationally, we feel pretty good. So we're not really seeing anything in terms of an economic hangover.\n\nPhil Cusick\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nThanks, Kevin. Thanks, Bob.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nOkay. Thanks for the question. I want to thank everyone for joining us today.

Please go ahead.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney\n\nGood afternoon. It's my pleasure to welcome everybody to the Walt Disney Company's Q3 2023 Earnings Call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay and transcript will also be made available on our website. Joining me for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chief Executive Officer, and Kevin Lansberry, Interim Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Kevin, we will be happy to take some of your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney\n\nThanks, Alexia, and good afternoon. In the eight months since I returned, we've undertaken an unprecedented transformation at Disney, and this quarter's earnings reflect some of what we have accomplished. First, the company was completely restructured, restoring creativity to the center of our business. We made important management changes and efficiency improvements to create a more cost-effective, coordinated, and streamlined approach to our operations. We aggressively reduced costs across the enterprise, and we're on track to exceed our initial goal of $5.5 billion in savings.\nAnd perhaps most importantly, we've improved our DTC operating income by roughly $1 billion in just three quarters, as we continue to work toward achieving DTC profitability by the end of fiscal 2024. I'm pleased with how much we've gotten done in such a short period of time, but I also know we have a lot more to do. Before I turn the call over to Kevin Lansberry, our Interim CFO, I'd like to elaborate on the state of our company and the transformative work we are still undertaking. As I've said before, our progress will not always be linear.\nBut despite near-term headwinds, I'm incredibly confident in Disney's long-term trajectory because of the work we've done, the team we have in place, and because of Disney's core intellectual property foundation. Moving forward, I believe three businesses will drive the greatest growth in value creation over the next five years. They are our film studios, our parks business, and streaming, all of which are inextricably linked to our brands and franchises. Looking to Disney Entertainment Studios, we're focused on improving the quality of our films and on better economics, not just reducing the number of titles we release, but also the cost per title.\nAnd we're maximizing the full impact of our titles by embracing the multiple distribution windows at our disposal, enabling consumers to access our content in multiple ways. For example, Avatar: The Way of Water, which is now the third highest-grossing film of all time, is also on track to be the biggest-ever electronic home video release for Disney domestically. Certain other titles will be sold in the Download-to-Own window as well. By focusing on big franchises and tentpole films, we're able to generate interest in our existing library.\nFor example, we're seeing tremendous engagement on Disney+ with the previous Guardians of the Galaxy films, the original Avatar, and the first four Indiana Jones movies. But the value of our Disney Entertainment Studios and the reason this will be a key growth business for us extends far beyond our library and new releases. What sets Disney apart are the numerous ways we're able to reach consumers with the stories and characters they love, including in our parks and resorts. We'll be opening new Frozen-themed lands at Hong Kong Disneyland and Walt Disney Studios Park in Paris, as well as a Zootopia-themed land at Shanghai Disney Resort.\nLater down the road, we will be bringing an Avatar experience to Disneyland, reinforcing the unrivaled worldwide appeal of our brands and franchises. Our parks and experience segment overall has had an impressive streak and will continue to be a key growth engine for the company, even as we navigate the cycles that come with operating this business. Our cruise line, in particular, showed strong revenue and operating income growth in Q3. Current Q4 booked occupancy for our existing fleet of five ships is at 98%, and we will be expanding our fleet by adding two more ships in fiscal 2025 and another in fiscal 2026, nearly doubling our worldwide capacity.\nIn addition to our cruise line, strong segment results for the quarter were driven by solid performance at our international parks, and we also saw continued strength at Disneyland Resort. Our Asia parks have been doing exceptionally well, reinforcing a clear opportunity for continued growth. Both Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland have experienced stronger-than-expected recoveries from the pandemic, and in Q3, they both grew meaningfully in revenue, operating income, and attendance. We saw softer performance at Walt Disney World from the prior year, coming off our highly successful 50th anniversary celebration.\nAlso, as post-COVID pent-up demand continues to level off in Florida, local tax data shows evidence of some softening in several major Florida tourism markets, and the strong dollar is expected to continue tamping down international visitation to the state. However, Walt Disney World is still performing well above pre-COVID levels, 21% higher in revenue and 29% higher in operating income compared to fiscal 2019, adjusting for Star Cruiser accelerated depreciation.\nAnd following a number of recent changes we've implemented, we continue to see positive guest experience ratings in our theme parks, including Walt Disney World, and positive indicators for guests looking to book future visits. This includes strong demand for our newly returned annual passes. We're making numerous investments globally to grow our parks business over the next five years, and I'm very optimistic about the future of this business over the long term. The third area that will drive growth and value creation for Disney is our direct-to-consumer business.\nWhen you consider our path to profitability in streaming, it's important to remember where we started and how we've adapted based on what we've learned. We overachieved with massive subscriber growth for Disney+ out of the gate, and we leaned into a spending level to fuel subscriber growth, which had been the key measure of success for many. All of this happened while we were still determining the right strategies for pricing, marketing, content, and specific international market investments. However, since my return, we've reset the whole business around economics designed to deliver significant, sustained profitability.\nWe're prioritizing the strength of our brands and franchises. We're rationalizing the volume of content we make, what we spend, and what markets we invest in. We're deploying the technology necessary to both improve the user experience as well as the economics of this business. We're harnessing windowing opportunities, perfecting our pricing and marketing strategies, maximizing our enormous advertising potential, and we're making extensive Hulu content available to bundle subscribers via Disney+.\nAs I announced last quarter, we're moving closer toward a more unified one-app experience domestically to pair high-quality general entertainment with content from our popular brands and franchises for our bundle subscribers. It's a formula for success that we have already proven in international markets with our Star offering on Disney+. We see a future where consumers can access even more of the company's streaming content all in one place, resulting in higher user engagement, lower churn, and greater opportunities for advertisers. We're also very optimistic about the long-term advertising potential of this business.\nEven amid a challenging ad market, this quarter, we began seeing early signs of improvement. I'm pleased to announce that as of the end of Q3, we've signed up 3.3 million subscribers to our ad-supported Disney+ option. Since its inception, 40% of new Disney+ subscribers are choosing an ad-supported product. On our pricing strategy, this year alone, we've raised prices in nearly 50 countries around the world to better reflect the value of our product offerings, and the impact on churn and retention has outperformed our expectations. Later today, we will release details regarding upcoming streaming price increases.\nI'm pleased to share that our ad-supported Disney+ subscription offering will become available in Canada and in select markets across Europe beginning 1 November, while a new ad-free bundled subscription plan featuring Disney+ and Hulu will be available in the US on 6 September. Maintaining access to our content for as broad an audience as possible is top of mind for us, which is why pricing for our standalone ad-supported Disney+ and Hulu offerings will remain unchanged. I'd also like to note that we are actively exploring ways to address account sharing and the best options for paying subscribers to share their accounts with friends and family.\nLater this year, we will begin to update our subscriber agreements with additional terms on our sharing policies, and we will roll out tactics to drive monetization sometime in 2024. Our DTC ambitions also extend to our sports business. Taking our ESPN flagship channels direct to consumer is not a matter of if, but when. The team is hard at work looking at all components of this decision, including pricing and timing. It's interesting to note that ratings continue to increase on ESPN's main linear channel, even as cord cutting has accelerated. This rating strength creates tremendous advertising potential across the board.\nOur total domestic sports advertising revenue for linear and addressable is up 10% versus the prior year adjusted for comparability, which speaks to the fact that the sports business stands tall and remains a good value proposition. We believe in the power of sports and the unique ability to convene and engage audiences. Yesterday, it was announced that ESPN has entered into an exclusive licensing arrangement with Penn Entertainment to further extend the ESPN brand into the growing sports betting marketplace. This licensing deal will offer a compelling new experience for sports fans that will enhance consumer engagement.\nWe're excited to offer this to the many fans who have long been asking for it. Overall, we're considering potential strategic partnerships for ESPN, looking at distribution, technology, marketing, and content opportunities where we retain control of ESPN. We've received notable interest from many different entities, and we look forward to sharing more details at a later date when we're further along in this process. Looking to our broader linear business, while linear remains highly profitable for Disney today, the trends being fueled by cord cutting are unmistakable. As I've stated before, we're thinking expansively and considering a variety of strategic options.\nHowever, we're fortunate to have an array of extremely productive television studios that we will rely on to continue providing exceptional content for audiences well into the future. Speaking of the content we create, I'd like to say a few words about the ongoing strikes. Nothing is more important to this company than its relationships with the creative community, and that includes actors, writers, animators, directors, and producers. I have deep respect and appreciation for all those who are vital to the extraordinary creative engine that drives this company and our industry.\nIt is my fervent hope that we quickly find solutions to the issues that have kept us apart these past few months, and I am personally committed to working to achieve this result. In closing, I returned to Disney in November, and I've agreed to stay on longer because there is more to accomplish before our transformation is complete, and because I want to ensure a successful transition for my successor.\nIn spite of a challenging environment in the near term, I'm overwhelmingly bullish about Disney's future for the reasons I shared at the beginning of this call: the work we've done over these past eight months, our core foundation of creative excellence and iconic brands and franchises, and because of the unrivaled talent we have at every level here at Disney. I have the highest confidence in our leadership team today, and I'm enormously proud of the ways each of them is helping steer the company through this moment of great change. And with that, I'll turn things over to Kevin.\n\nKevin Lansberry\n\nInterim CFO, The Walt Disney\n\nThanks, Bob. It's good to be here, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal Q3 diluted earnings per share, excluding certain items, were $1.03, a decrease of $0.06 versus the prior year. In the coming months, we will be presenting recast financials in line with our new reorganized segments: Disney Entertainment, ESPN, and parks, experiences, and products. So today will be the last earnings call where we will discuss our numbers under the existing structure. Now, turning to this quarter's results, starting off with direct-to-consumer, as Bob referenced earlier, we've improved direct-to-consumer operating results by $1 billion in just three quarters.\nFor Q3, operating losses improved by approximately $150 million versus the prior quarter and by approximately $550 million versus the prior year. These results outperformed the guidance we gave on the last earnings call, largely due to lower-than-expected expenses, including from realizing SG&A savings sooner than initially expected. Disney+ core subscribers grew by nearly 800,000 during Q3, in line with the commentary we made at our last earnings call, with international growth more than offsetting modest domestic net losses. As Bob mentioned, our progress will vary from quarter to quarter, and we are more focused on overall economics versus pure subgrowth.\nBut currently, we do expect that in Q4, we will see core Disney+ net adds rebound with growth both domestically and internationally. Disney+ core ARPU increased sequentially by $0.11, driven by higher per-subscriber advertising revenue domestically, as well as price increases in certain international markets. With over 40% of gross adds opting for the ad tier, the domestic Disney+ ad tier is continuing to improve our ARPU. We look forward to the additional market launches announced today, which should serve as a stepping stone on our path to profitability.\nDisney+ Hotstar subscribers declined this quarter as we adjusted our product from one centered around the IPL to one more balanced with other sports and entertainment offerings. I would also note that this business, with its significantly lower ARPU compared to core Disney+, is not a material component of our overall DTC financial results. We will therefore continue to focus our commentary on the core Disney+ product. Hulu and ESPN+ subscribers were roughly comparable to Q2. Hulu remained profitable in the Q3, with advertising revenue increasing versus the Q2, benefiting sequentially from a higher sell-through rate.\nIn Q4, we expect DTC ad revenue to continue to benefit from higher advertiser demand at Hulu, as well as from the ramp-up of the Disney+ ad tier. As we work toward achieving DTC profitability by the end of fiscal 2024, we don't necessarily expect the progress to be linear each quarter, as the impacts of the transformative work we are doing take time to realize. We expect to see more meaningful improvement in our DTC losses by the middle of fiscal 2024. These expectations and plans remain subject to all of the risks and assumptions we've previously identified and are noting here today, which will require close and ongoing assessment.\nBut we remain encouraged by the early results we've already realized and are optimistic about our path ahead. Moving on to our content sales line of business, operating results declined by a little over $200 million versus the prior year. Lower results in the Q3 versus the prior year were due to lower TV, SVOD, and theatrical results. For Q4, we expect this business to generate operating losses up to $100 million worse than last year's Q4. And at Linear Networks, operating income declined versus the prior year by $580 million, driven by declines at both domestic and international channels.\nThe decrease at domestic channels was driven by lower advertising and affiliate revenue and by higher programming and production costs driven by the NBA and the new Formula 1 agreement. While domestic linear advertising revenue declined year over year, ESPN ad revenue increased by 4%, demonstrating the relative strength of sports. Quarter to date, ESPN domestic linear cash ad sales are pacing down, reflecting in part the absence of the Big Ten this year. It's worth noting, however, that the absence of the Big Ten is expected to drive overall operating income favorability in Q4 versus the prior year.\nThe Q4 will also hold one additional Monday Night Football game versus the prior year. Linear advertising continues to see impacts from market softness. While sports is healthy, entertainment continues to face headwinds. Note that we expect DTC advertising year-over-year growth to partially offset linear declines in the Q4. We wrap this year's Upfront with overall volume roughly in line with the prior year. Growth in addressable revenue increased, representing over 40% of the total Upfront volume, and sports pricing is up single digits across the board.\nDomestic Linear Networks affiliate revenue decreased by 2% from the prior year due to a six-point decline from fewer subscribers, partially offset by four points of growth from contractual rate increases. International channels operating income decreased versus the prior year, driven by lower advertising revenue and, to a lesser extent, an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. Our parks, experiences, and products portfolio of businesses continues to be an earnings and free cash flow growth driver for the company, with both revenue and operating income increasing by more than 10% versus the prior year.\nInternational parks continued its strong growth trend, with year-over-year operating income increasing at all our international sites, but most significantly at Shanghai Disney, which saw record highs from a revenue, OI, and margin perspective. At domestic parks and experiences, operating income was up 24% versus pre-pandemic results in fiscal 2019, but declined 13% versus the prior year. In addition to the inflationary cost pressures we have discussed on prior calls and some of the near-term headwinds at Walt Disney World that Bob mentioned earlier, results reflect an approximately $100 million accelerated depreciation charge related to the closure of the Galactic Starcruiser.\nThese drivers were partially offset by favorable performance at our cruise line and at the Disneyland Resort. While Walt Disney World results were down year over year, as Bob mentioned, operating income was nearly 30% higher versus 2019 when adjusting for the Star Cruiser accelerated depreciation. Domestic parks attendance grew slightly year over year, reflecting comparisons against last year's strong trends coming out of the 50th anniversary at Walt Disney World. Per-cap spending was comparable to the prior year, with contributions from pricing, Genie+, and higher food and beverage spend offset by attendance composition changes and lower merchandise spend.\nExcluding the impact of the Star Cruiser accelerated depreciation, domestic parks and experiences operating margins in Q3 were roughly three percentage points below the prior year, and DPEP margins were slightly higher than the prior year. We continue to expect some moderation in demand at our domestic parks as we compare against our highly successful 50th anniversary celebration at Walt Disney World, and the burn-off of pent-up demand persists, while elevated travel costs are impacting international visitation.\nWe are also seeing continued cost pressures in the Q4, predominantly from labor wage rate growth, coupled with $150 million of remaining accelerated depreciation for the Galactic Starcruiser. However, we still expect all-in Q4 operating margins at DPEP to exceed the prior year due to the ongoing strength of recovery at our international parks and cruise line. Putting this all together, excluding the impact of accelerated depreciation for the Starcruiser, we are still expecting full-year total company revenue and segment operating income to grow at a high single-digit percentage rate versus the prior year.\nWe currently expect fiscal 2023 content spend to come in at approximately $27 billion, which is lower than we previously guided due to lower spend on produced content, in part due to the writers' and actors' strikes. We now expect capital expenditures for the year to total $5 billion. This is lower than our prior guide, primarily due to spending timing shifts for various projects across the enterprise. In the midst of the transformative work we have been doing, we are prioritizing long-term free cash flow growth and have generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow in Q3. Our balance sheet remains strong, with our single-A credit ratings reflecting that strength.\nWe have made significant progress deleveraging coming out of the pandemic, and we continue to approach capital allocation in a disciplined and balanced manner, prioritizing investments to generate future growth while also keeping an eye toward shareholder returns. And to that point, as we've mentioned before, we still expect to be in a position to recommend that the board declare a modest dividend by the end of this calendar year, with the intention to recommend increased shareholder returns over time as our earnings and free cash flow power grows. And with that, I will turn it back over to Alexia for Q&A.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney\n\nThanks, Kevin. As we transition to the Q&A, we ask that you please try to limit yourself to one question in order to help us get to as many of you as possible today. With that, operator, we're ready for the first question.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, we'll now begin that question-and-answer session. Once again, to ask a question, you may press star and then one. Withdraw your questions. You may press star and two. Our first question comes from Phil Cusick from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nPhil Cusick\n\nHead of U.S. Telecom Services and Communications Infrastructure Research, JPMorgan\n\nHi, thank you. Bob, the linear business is clearly under pressure, and you made it clear recently that all options are being considered. I'm curious, though, what the practical considerations are of separating assets like ABC, National Geographic, or others from both ESPN, where sports are integrated, or from Hulu, which is kind of the next-generation distribution platform. Can you talk about that? And then second, can we assume that most of those TV assets have been fully depreciated? Thank you.\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney\n\nClearly, if we are to do anything significant in terms of strategic direction for the linear nets, we have to keep in mind the need for content to ultimately fuel our DTC businesses, notably, and as you mentioned, Hulu. So anything that is to be done would be done with an eye toward maintaining a rich flow of content to fuel our growth business, and that will be streaming. There's obviously complexity as it relates to decoupling the linear nets from ESPN, but nothing that we feel we can't contend with if we were to ultimately create strategic realignment.\n\nKevin Lansberry\n\nInterim CFO, The Walt Disney\n\nPhil, this is Kevin. With respect to the assets, these have been around for quite a while at this point, and we're not going to comment specifically on where they sit from a depreciation standpoint.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney\n\nThank you. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich from BOA. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nInvestment Banking Analyst, BoA\n\nThank you. Bob, maybe just a follow-up on your prepared remarks and film being core strategic. Can you share with us how you plan to improve the movie performance and maybe the timeframe or create more original content? Just give us more color. And then a follow-up to something you said on DTC and password crackdown. Is this a fiscal 2024 full year? Will you be done by the end of the year, and is it on a global basis? How many password sharers do you think there are on your platform?\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney\n\nSo the second part of your question, Jessica, regarding password sharing, we already have the technical capability to monitor much of this. I'm not going to give you a specific number except to say that it's significant. What we don't know, of course, is as we get to work on this, how much of the password sharing, as we basically eliminate it, will convert to growth in subs. Obviously, we believe there will be some, but we're not speculating. What we are saying, though, is that in calendar 2024, we're going to get at this issue. So while it is likely you'll see some impact in calendar 2024, it's possible that we won't be complete or the work will not be completed within the calendar year.\nBut we certainly have established this as a real priority, and we actually think that there's an opportunity here to help us grow our business. Regarding our studio performance, let's put things in perspective a little bit. The studio has had a tremendous run over the last decade, perhaps the greatest run that any studio has ever had, with multiple billion-dollar hits, including, by the way, two that were relatively recent, or one in particular, Avatar: The Way of Water. And we also had a pretty strong performance with Guardians of the Galaxy 3, which has done, I think, approximately $850 million in global box office.\nThat said, the performance of some of our recent films has definitely been disappointing, and we don't take that lightly. And as you'd expect, we're very focused on improving the quality and the performance of the films that we've got coming up. It's something that I'm working closely with the studio on. I'm personally committed to spending more time and attention on that as well.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney\n\nAll right. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nBen Swinburne\n\nManaging Director and Head of U.S. Media Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. Good afternoon. Bob, the press is out with the price increase information for later this year tonight. I'm just wondering, now that you've been through one Disney+ price increase here in the US and multiple Hulu and ESPN increases, sort of how you're thinking about the pricing power of the product as you go into these even more significant increases and whether you think you can hold your customer base as you raise prices. And obviously, some big news with ESPN BET. Why now and why Penn? Can you just talk about your vision or Jimmy's vision for the ESPN product over time that stems from this announcement and other thoughts on ESPN's future?\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney\n\nBen, as you know, and I think as we've said before, we took a pretty significant price increase at Disney Plus sometime late in calendar 2022. We really didn't see significant churn or loss of subs because of that, which was actually heartening. It's important to note, though, that the price increase that we've just announced is a price increase for the premium product or the non-advertiser-supported product. We're actually keeping the advertiser-supported product flat in terms of prices.\nThat's being done for a reason. Obviously, as has been noted by Kevin in his remarks, the advertising marketplace for streaming is picking up. It's more healthy than the advertising marketplace for linear television. We believe in the future of advertising on our streaming platforms, both Disney Plus and Hulu, and we're obviously trying with our pricing strategy to migrate more subs to the advertiser-supported tier.\nIt also should be noted, as I think I mentioned in my remarks, that a substantial amount of new subscribers to Disney+ are signing up for the ad-supported tier, which suggests that the pricing is working for us in that regard. We're looking at this very carefully. One thing I think that I should also note is that we grew this business really fast, really before we even understood what our pricing strategy should be or could be. We're really just getting at, and I'd say in the last six months, a pricing strategy that's really aimed at enabling us to improve the bottom line, ultimately to turn this into a growth business, and as a component of that, obviously, to grow subs.\n\nBen Swinburne\n\nManaging Director and Head of U.S. Media Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOn ESPN?\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney\n\nOn ESPN BET, you say, \"Why now?\" Well, we've been in discussions with a number of entities over a fairly long period of time. It's something that we've wanted to accomplish, obviously, because we believe there's an opportunity here to significantly grow engagement with ESPN consumers, particularly young consumers. And why Penn? Because Penn stepped up in a very aggressive way and made an offer to us that was better than any of the competitive offers by far. And we like the fact that Penn is going to use this as a growth engine for their business and actually believe and trust in their ability in this partnership to grow their business nicely while we grow ours.\n\nBen Swinburne\n\nManaging Director and Head of U.S. Media Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney\n\nOperator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nMichael Nathanson\n\nEquity Research Publisher, MoffettNathanson\n\nThanks. Hey, Bob, I have two for you. One is, given the thinking you've done about the future of Disney, why doesn't it make sense to create two Disney companies, one focused on Parks, CP, Disney+, and then the studio IP that drives that flywheel, and then one on everything else? So why not make a clean break? And then secondly, on ESPN, you've been talking about partnerships.\nI wonder if you have a vision for the streaming content vision of ESPN that's different than the linear one we see, perhaps a sports bundle with either other networks or with league partnerships. So can you just expand on how the product will look differently down the road in streaming than it does now linearly?\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney\n\nMichael, on the first part, I'm not going to comment on the future structure of the company or the asset makeup of the company. As I've said, we're looking at strategic options both for ESPN and for the linear networks, obviously addressing all the challenges that those businesses are facing. I'm looking forward to reading your thesis on it. Maybe you'll give us some ideas about it, but I'm not going to make any comments about it right now.\nRegarding the second question and ESPN, the strategic partnerships that we're looking to create and that we're actually in discussions about are aimed at accomplishing a few things. One, content, meaning increasing the content that ESPN offers, and two, possibly, I'll call it distribution and marketing support. It's possible that we'll be able to do both.\nAnd this is all being done with an eye toward the inevitability of taking ESPN's flagship over the top. So when we look ahead and we see a business that will be primarily a direct-to-consumer business, we obviously have an eye toward how much content do we need in order to make that a successful business. That obviously ties to what the pricing model needs to be and actually how much distribution support we need. We've benefited greatly from the distribution support in the old business model from cable and satellite. Obviously, when you go DTC, you're kind of doing it on your own, or maybe not. Or maybe there's an opportunity with another entity to help in that regard. So we're basically looking quite expansively. I must say we're extremely encouraged with all the interest that we've had already in this regard.\nI think it's safe to assume, as we ultimately turn this into a streaming business, while we have a phenomenal hand right now, better than anyone else in terms of the content that ESPN offers, that we believe that adding more content under economical circumstances might be a wise thing.\n\nMichael Nathanson\n\nEquity Research Publisher, MoffettNathanson\n\nOkay. Thanks, Bob.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney\n\nOperator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Steven Cahill from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nSteven Cahall\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you. Bob, you said you're now on track to exceed that initial goal of $5.5 billion in cost savings, and DTC came in ahead in the quarter. As you think about the future of this business long-term and getting to kind of the price and cost structure that you're aiming for, do you have any expectations for longer-term DTC margins? It just seems like you're meaningfully below where Netflix was at a similar revenue scale.\nSo I'm wondering how you think about that 15% or 20% margin level as that business gets above $20 billion in revenue this year. And then just secondly, as a follow-up, given that you have the Hulu put coming up next year, what are your thoughts on your ability to fund that transaction as we head into that time horizon? Thank you.\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney\n\nOur streaming business is still actually very young. In fact, it's not even four years old. It launched in November of 2019. We love to have the margins that Netflix has. They've accomplished those margins, though, over a substantially longer period of time. They've done so because they figured out how to really carefully balance their investment in programming with their pricing strategy and what they spend in marketing. Because we're new at all of this, we actually have not really achieved the kind of balance we know we need to achieve in terms of cost savings, pricing, and money spent on marketing.\nOf course, all the other things that we're looking at from a technological perspective that grows engagement with our customers, like as if, for instance, recommendation engines would be one example of that, that have the ability to improve performance or obviously grow consumption. I would say that, and I obviously have to. I can't emphasize enough the time that we've spent and the effort that we've spent on managing costs.\nWe've done a tremendous job in a very, very short period of time of exceeding the cost reductions that we said we were going to achieve. That's obviously a major step in the direction of improving our margins. Pricing, as we've talked about earlier on this call and in our comments, is another way to do that. Password sharing is another way to do that. Getting the technology in place to grow engagement.\nThe advertising side of this business is another. So I'm reasonably optimistic and hopeful that we will be improving our margins in this business significantly over the next few years, but I'm not going to make any further predictions in that, except the good news is that we know how much work we have to do. We know the work that we have to do as well.\n\nKevin Lansberry\n\nInterim CFO, The Walt Disney\n\nStephen, I'll answer the question with respect to the Hulu put. So I'll remind everyone that the floor for that put is about $9.2 billion. We're very comfortable with our current liquidity position. We've got about $11.5 billion of cash on our balance sheet. We've got about $10.5 billion worth of revolving credit facilities and commercial paper. And we're going to have plenty of future cash flow to help fund all of this going forward.\nI would also like to note that from a balance sheet perspective, we've got a strong single-A credit rating that reflects the strength that we see in our balance sheet. We made significant progress recently deleveraging coming out of the pandemic. We're prioritizing free cash flow as a company, and we're being really disciplined and smart about how we go about allocating capital across the company.\nLast but not least, as I noted in my prepared remarks, we hope to still be in a position, or we plan to still be in a position at the end of this year to recommend to the board of directors that we put a modest dividend out.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nKannan Venkateshwar\n\nManaging Director and Telecom Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThank you. So Bob, I'm an MD, ESPN side. You've spoken about the need for partners. Could you talk a little bit about the priorities when you look at partners? Is it more in the form of direct capital infusion or maybe some kind of reach on the distribution side when it comes to streaming? What are the objectives you're really solving for?\nAnd then Kevin, maybe as a follow-up to the guidance, just triangulating between some of the segment guidance that you just gave and trends in the first three quarters, the full year high single-digit guide reiteration is obviously great, but it will need more acceleration in Q4 than we've seen in the first three quarters of FY. So if you could just talk through what the drivers of that acceleration are, that would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney\n\nKannan, we're not necessarily looking for cash infusion when it comes to partners. We're looking for partners that are going to help ESPN successfully transition to a DTC model. And that, as I've said, can come in the form of either content or distribution and marketing support or both.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney\n\nKannan, can you repeat your second question, please?\n\nKannan Venkateshwar\n\nManaging Director and Telecom Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nSo in terms of the guidance for high single-digit OI growth, just triangulating between the trends in the first three quarters and some of the segment guidance in the quarter, it seems to imply growth in the Q4 will be higher for OI. And so I just wanted to understand what the drivers of that acceleration are.\n\nKevin Lansberry\n\nInterim CFO, The Walt Disney\n\nYeah. Kannan, there's very significant growth across our direct-to-consumer business and at our Parks and Experiences business also. So those two businesses predominantly are the big growth drivers as you begin to look at relative to the prior year where we're getting that kind of growth.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney\n\nOperator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nBrett Feldman\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks. So I'm curious how your experience with Disney+ Hotstar has shaped your view on your long-term international streaming strategy. Are you thinking about maybe exiting those markets or any markets and maybe focusing more on content licensing or partnerships? And is it essential that you reshape that international strategy in any way to meet your long-term profitability objectives?\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney\n\nWe actually have been looking at multiple markets around the world with an eye toward prioritizing those that are going to help us turn this business into a profitable business. What that basically means is there are some markets that we will invest less in local programming but still maintain a service. There are some markets that we may not have a service at all.\nAnd there are others that we'll consider, I'll call it high-potential markets, where we'll invest nicely for local programming, marketing, and basically full-service content in those markets. Basically, what I'm saying is not all markets are created equal. And in terms of our march to profitability, one of the ways we believe we're going to do that is by creating priorities internationally.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney\n\nAll right. Operator, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Michael Morris from Guggenheim. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nMichael Morris\n\nSenior Managing Director and Equity Research Analyst, Guggenheim\n\nThank you very much. Good afternoon, guys. On the theme of considering options for Disney, there was an article published recently that speculated that the entire company could be sold to a larger technology company. Bob, my straightforward question is, do you see a plausible scenario where the entire company would be sold?\nMaybe a bit more broadly, though, when you think of maximum value of the Disney enterprise, do you think that can be achieved by being more aligned with a single technology partner, or is that value maximized through partnering with a variety of tech platforms? If I could just sneak one in on the Penn Entertainment announcement, will you forgo advertising partnerships with all other betting or sports gaming partners? And if so, how much impact will that have in exchange for building value in this partnership? Thank you.\n\nBob Iger\n\nCEO, The Walt Disney\n\nMichael, I just am not going to speculate about the potential for Disney to be acquired by any company, whether they're a technology company or not. Obviously, anyone who wanted to speculate about such things would have to immediately consider the global regulatory environment. I'll say no more than that. It's not something that we obsess about.\n\nKevin Lansberry\n\nInterim CFO, The Walt Disney\n\nOkay. Then, Michael, with respect to any foregone economics or no longer accepting advertising from other gaming companies, I don't see us in a position where we would ever be in that situation, so.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, The Walt Disney\n\nOkay. Thanks for the question. I want to thank everyone for joining us today.

Please go ahead.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nSVP for Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nGood afternoon. It's my pleasure to welcome everybody to the Walt Disney Company's Q2 2023 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay, and a transcript will also be made available on our website. Joining me for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chief Executive Officer, and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we'll be happy to take some of your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.\n\nBob Iger\n\nChairman and CEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThank you, Alexia, and good afternoon, everyone. Allow me to digress for a moment to congratulate Universal for the tremendous success of Super Mario Bros. It certainly proves people love to be entertained in theaters around the world, and it gives us reason to be optimistic about the movie business. Now, turning to our results, we're pleased with our accomplishments this quarter, which are reflective of the strategic changes we've been making throughout our businesses. We're also proud of what we continue to deliver for consumers, from movies to television to sports news and our theme parks.\nA few recent highlights include Marvel Studios' Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3, which topped the global box office in its opening weekend with $289 million. The first round of the NBA playoffs was the most watched ever across Disney networks, and we've been averaging 5 million viewers throughout the first 22 games, up 15% versus the comparable point in last year's playoffs.\nABC continued its run as the number one entertainment broadcast network for the fourth consecutive season, and at our domestic parks, we continued to improve the guest experience with our recent pricing changes and exciting new attractions, including the reimagined Mickey's Toontown at Disneyland and TRON Lightcycle Run at Walt Disney World. I've been back at the company for almost six months, and in that time we've embarked on a significant transformation to strategically realign Disney for sustained growth and success. I'm pleased to say that the strategy we detailed last quarter is working.\nOur new organizational structure is returning authority and accountability to our creative leaders, as well as allowing for a more efficient, coordinated, and streamlined approach to our operations. The cost cutting initiatives I announced last quarter are well underway, and we are on track to meet or exceed our target of $5.5 billion. We're delivering progress on a number of fronts, including a reduction in streaming operating losses this quarter, and I'm very optimistic about our direct to consumer business longer term.\nCombined, our brands, franchises, and robust library are a significant differentiator in this space, and the meteoric subscriber growth we've seen since our launch three years ago only further reinforces that. As I think about our path forward in streaming, we have a number of clear opportunities to further position our DTC business for success. First, as a significant step toward creating a growth business, I'm pleased to announce that we will soon begin offering a one app experience domestically that incorporates our Hulu content via Disney+.\nAnd while we continue to offer Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN as standalone options, this is a logical progression of our DTC offerings that will provide greater opportunities for advertisers while giving bundled subscribers access to more robust and streamlined content, resulting in greater audience engagement and ultimately leading to a more unified streaming experience. We will begin to roll out this one app offering by the end of the calendar year, and we look forward to sharing more details in the future. Despite the near term macro headwinds of the overall marketplace today, the advertising potential of this combined platform is incredibly exciting.\nWhen you drill down into the details, you can see why over 40% of our domestic advertising portfolio is addressable, including streaming, which we expect will continue to grow over time. We're also focused on the growth opportunity in programmatic advertising, and we are well positioned to scale as the market improves and audiences continue to grow. We've added more than 1,000 advertisers over the past year and now have 5,000 advertisers across our streaming platforms, with over 1/3 buying advertising programmatically today.\nIn addition, we plan to launch our ad tier on Disney+ in Europe by the end of this calendar year, which will drive both increased inventory and revenue over the long term. The truth is, we have only just begun to scratch the surface of what we can do with advertising on Disney+, and I'm incredibly bullish on our longer term advertising positioning. Meanwhile, the pricing changes we've already implemented have proven successful, and we plan to set a higher price for our ad-free tier later this year to better reflect the value of our content offerings.\nAs we look to the future, we will continue optimizing our pricing model to reward loyalty and reduce churn to increase subscriber revenue for the premium ad-free tier and drive growth of subscribers who offer the lower cost ad-supported option. Additionally, I'd like to share a few other key areas where we see opportunities for improvements in our streaming business. First, it's critical we rationalize the volume of content we're creating and what we're spending to produce our content.\nSecond, our legacy platforms enable us to expand our audiences and often augment our potential streaming success while at the same time allowing us to amortize our content costs across multiple windows. We also need to strike the right balance between our local and global programming, as well as our platform and program marketing. Finally, we must continue calibrating our investments in specific markets, looking at the total addressable market and ARPU prospects, and evaluating the profitability potential.\nAll of these factors combined are why we are confident that that we're on the right path for streaming's long-term profitability, the strength of our content, the one app experience, and the enormous advertising potential that comes with it. Rationalizing the volume of the content we make and what we're spending, maximizing windowing opportunities, recalibrating our investments internationally, perfecting our pricing model, and consolidating our global streaming business under the leadership of Disney Entertainment Co-Chairman Alan Bergman and Dana Walden, we're doing the essential work now to position our streaming business for sustained growth and success in the future.\nTurning to our parks, we see this business as a key growth driver for the company. This past quarter we've been especially pleased with the performance of our parks internationally. We have several international expansions underway that will allow our parks to continue to build capacity and drive longer term growth. At Disneyland Paris, our Avengers Campus has been a resounding success in its first year, and we have ongoing investment underway there, including a Frozen-inspired land currently in development. Our Zootopia inspired expansion opens later this year at Shanghai Disney Resort. Arendelle: The World of Frozen expansion is set to open at Hong Kong Disneyland in H2 2023 and Tokyo Disney Resort, which is currently celebrating its 40th anniversary, will be opening the new Frozen Kingdom, Rapunzel's Forest, and Peter Pan's Neverland in the coming year.\nRegarding our domestic parks, we just announced additional changes coming in 2024 that will improve the experience for guests visiting Walt Disney World, including further expanding access for annual passholders to visit on certain days without reservations, as well as removing the need for an additional reservation for guests with date-based tickets. This is just another example of how we're continuously listening to our guests and finding ways to improve their experiences. We have a number of other growth and expansion opportunities at our parks and we're closely evaluating where it makes the most sense to direct future investments.\nThe unyielding popularity of our world-class parks business and our unparalleled content powered by our brands and franchises is what sets Disney apart from the very beginning 100 years ago. Our timeless stories and characters have been the key to our success and hold a special place in the hearts of generations of fans and families. We're leaning into this across every segment of our business, as illustrated with our strong summer slate of theatrical releases including Disney's The Little Mermaid, Pixar's Elemental, and Lucasfilm's Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.\nAs we've been looking at the structure of the company these past several months, what's become clear is that there is an enormous opportunity to harness our full potential by increasing alignment and coordination in marketing across our businesses. That's why I named Asad Ayaz our first ever Chief Brand Officer in addition to his role as President of Marketing for our studios. For years, our businesses have been incredibly successful in marketing our content, experiences, and products.\nAnd now with greater integration of our touchpoints with consumers, especially streaming, we're able to be more efficient and more successful in reaching the right audiences with the right offerings from across our businesses. Disney means so much to so many people around the world. That's a privilege we take seriously, and I know I speak for our terrific chairman Alan, Dana, Jimmy, and Josh when I say that our goal is to continue finding innovative new ways that allow guests and audiences to have even deeper connections with us. And that's why I'm so thrilled to be taking this more proactive approach to our brand and marketing work. With that, I will turn things over to Christine.\n\nChristine McCarthy\n\nFormer Senior EVP and CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items, fiscal Q2 diluted earnings per share were $0.93, a decrease of $0.15 versus the prior year as improvements at DPEP and Direct-to-Consumer were more than offset by declines at our Linear Networks business, as Bob mentioned. We are making excellent progress on our cost-cutting initiatives and are on track to meet or exceed the efficiency targets we outlined last quarter. During Q2, we took a restructuring charge of approximately $150 million primarily related to severance.\nWhile we are continuing to refine our estimates, we currently expect to record additional severance charges of approximately $180 million over the remainder of this fiscal year, with the bulk of that additional charge expected in the Q3. We are in the process of reviewing the content on our DTC services to align with the strategic changes in our approach to content curation that you've heard Bob discuss. As a result, we will be removing certain content from our streaming platforms and currently expect to take an impairment charge of approximately $1.5 to 1.8 billion.\nThe charge, which will not be recorded in our segment results, will primarily be recognized in Q3 as we complete our review and remove the content, and going forward we intend to produce lower volumes of content in alignment with this strategic shift. Now to dive into our quarterly results by segment, starting with our Media and Entertainment Distribution business. A year over year decline in operating income was driven primarily by a $1 billion decrease at Linear Networks. DTC results improved versus the prior year, and content sales, licensing, and other operating results in the Q2 declined modestly.\nAt linear networks, results were consistent with guidance given last quarter, driven by decreases of approximately $800 million at our domestic linear networks and $160 million at our international linear networks. Domestic results decreased at both cable and broadcasting. At cable, this was largely due to higher sports programming and production costs, which were driven by the timing of costs for the college football playoffs and the NFL. We discussed last quarter, in addition to NBA contractual rate increases and higher sports production costs.\nLower broadcasting results reflected decreases in advertising revenue across the ABC network and our owned television stations. Q2 domestic Linear Networks affiliate revenue decreased by 2% from the prior year driven by a 6 point decline from fewer subscribers, partially offset by 3 points of growth from contractual rate increases. Rate growth was adversely impacted by 1 percentage point from the timing of revenue recognition from certain non owned TV stations. Q2 domestic Linear advertising revenue declined 10% year over year, although ESPN ad revenue was up 2% or flat when adjusted for certain non comparable items including CFP timing.\nThe sports advertising marketplace is currently stable with quarter to date ESPN domestic linear cash ad sales pacing up. However, the overall entertainment advertising marketplace has been challenging. While the weakness has moderated somewhat, we anticipate that some softness may continue into the back half of the fiscal year. But as Bob mentioned, we are optimistic about our ability to continue to be a leader in advertising throughout the business cycle, particularly as it relates to our capabilities in addressable, programmatic, and we look forward to sharing more details at our Upfront presentation next week.\nInternational Channels' operating income decreased versus the prior year, driven by lower advertising revenue, partially offset by lower programming costs. Moving on to the direct to consumer operating losses, improved sequentially by approximately $400 million versus Q1. During the Q2, Disney Core subscribers grew modestly with over 600,000 net additions. Core international subs increased by close to 1 million, while domestic subs declined slightly in the quarter from continued impacts from the price increase. Domestic ARPU increased sequentially by 20%, reflecting strong subscription revenue growth.\nWhile the softness we saw in Q2 domestic Disney+ net adds may linger into Q3, we do expect core sub growth to rebound in Q4. At ESPN+ and Hulu, subscribers increased slightly over the prior quarter. ARPU at Hulu was impacted by lower per subscriber advertising revenue and, in line with the comments we made last quarter regarding near-term softness in the addressable advertising space, DTC expenses, including programming and production costs and SG&A, declined in the Q2 versus Q1. Our direct-to-consumer operating results in Q2 outperformed our guidance by about $200 million,\ndue in part to timing shifts of marketing expenses and driven by recent slate changes at Disney+ and Hulu. The shift of some of those costs into the Q3 will contribute to Q3 DTC operating losses widening by approximately $100 million versus Q2. As we have noted before, the path will not be linear as the strategic changes and improvements we're executing on take time to deliver, but we remain confident in our long-term trajectory with continued opportunities to further improve results. Given our content curation strategy, planned price increases, expanding our relationships with our advertisers, and our ongoing disciplined approach to costs.\nAt content sales, licensing, and other, we generated a $50 million loss in the quarter, a bit shy of our prior guidance that results would be roughly breakeven. Lower results in the Q2 versus the prior year were due to a decrease in TV/SVOD distribution results, partially offset by improved theatrical distribution results due to the continued success of the Way of Water. In the fiscal Q3, we anticipate this business operating results will decline by $150 to 200 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by timing of the marketing of theatrical releases with key titles Elemental and Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, not premiering until very late in the quarter.\nMoving on to parks, experiences and products, operating income increased by over 20% versus the prior year to $2.2 billion, with increases at both international and domestic parks and experiences partially offset by lower merchandise licensing results at consumer products. Our international parks were a bright spot this quarter with strong year over year operating income growth driven by higher attendance and improved financial results at Shanghai Disney Resort, Disneyland Paris, and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort.\nAt domestic parks and experiences, operating income increased 10% versus the prior year, driven primarily by the continued post-pandemic recovery of our cruise line, partially offset by a comparison to a gain from a real estate sale in the prior year. Q2 domestic parks operating income came in slightly below the prior year but was still up over 50% versus 2019. Results generally reflect the cost pressures we cited in last quarter's earnings call, including wage increases, costs associated with new guest offerings, and other inflationary cost impacts.\nDomestic year-over-year increases in attendance and per capita spending were 7% and 2% respectively; per cap growth was more moderate this quarter as we are comparing against the first full quarter of offering Genie Plus and Lightning Lane at both parks in the prior year. Domestic parks and experiences operating margins were comparable to the prior year once adjusted for the impact of the prior year's real estate sale. Please keep in mind that in the back half of this fiscal year there will be an unfavorable comparison against the prior year's incredibly successful 50th anniversary celebration at Walt Disney World.\nWe typically see some moderation in demand as we lap these types of events, and Q3 to date performance has been in line with those historical trends. This comparison, coupled with inflationary cost pressures, including from a new union agreement, is expected to drive a modest adverse impact to domestic parks and experiences operating margins in the Q3 compared to the prior year. However, we expect the contribution from continued strong performance at our international parks in Q3 to result in DPEP segment level operating margins that are slightly higher than the prior year.\nDPEP will continue to be a growth business for our company, and we will manage all of these factors in line with our enduring focus on our guests. Before we conclude, I would like to note a couple of items related to our expectations for the total company this year, for fiscal 2023 cash content spend company-wide is expected to remain roughly comparable to last year, excluding any potential impacts from the writers' strike, and we expect that fiscal 2023 capital expenditures will total approximately $5.6 billion. This is lower than our prior guide of $6 billion, largely due to timing of projects at DPEP as well as lower technology spend at DMED.\nWe still expect fiscal 2023 revenue and operating income to grow in the high single digit percentage range. There are still many moving pieces, including macroeconomic factors, the state of the global advertising market, and content timing shifts which could impact our plans and expectations for the back half of this year. But as Bob mentioned earlier, we are incredibly optimistic about the long-term value creation opportunities that the changes we are currently executing on can generate for our company. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. With that, I will turn the call over to Alexia for Q&A.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nSVP for Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, Christine. As we transition to Q and A, we ask you to please try to limit yourselves to one question in order to help us get as many analysts as possible today. With that operator, we're ready for the first question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press Star then one on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, please press Star then two. Our first question will come from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nBen Swinburne\n\nManaging Director for Media and Entertainment Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, Bob. I wanted to ask you about what you learned on sort of two topics over the last several months. One is around the price increase on Disney+. You've sort of commented that you think it went well. Obviously, we can see the subscriber trends, and you sound optimistic that the company can continue to drive ARPU over time. You just talk a little bit about what you've seen in the customer base and reaction and engagement. That gives you confidence around pricing power for Disney+ looking ahead. And then a similar question around the cost rationalization and reorg at the company.\nNow that you're sort of deep into that, what have you learned about the opportunity for that to drive better financial results for the company? Christine sort of teased it that there might be more opportunities that maybe exceed expectations. Do you think there's more to do? I guess is the short question on the cost side. Thank you very much.\n\nBob Iger\n\nChairman and CEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, Ben. On the first question regarding price increases, first we were pleasantly surprised that the loss of subs due to what was a substantial increase in pricing for the non ad supported Disney product was de minimis. There was some loss, but it was relatively small. That leads us to believe that we in fact have pricing elasticity. With that in mind, I think one of the things that we not only have discovered but that we believe we have to do is that we've got to widen the delta between the ads free, the ad free service and the non-ad supported service, because we clearly would like to drive more subs to the ad-supported service, which we did in the quarter, by the way.\nThe obvious reason, because of the ARPU potential of the ad-supported service, Disney+. In fact, as we look to this upfront and after careful and considerable discussion with our sales team led by Rita Ferro, we see that there's going to be a substantial growth in digital advertising in this upfront. I mean, quite substantial, suggesting for the obvious reason because digital advertising is so attractive to advertisers that there's an opportunity for us to really lean into ad-supported and again raising our prices on the ad-free, keeping the prices on the ad-supported relatively modest, maybe perhaps no increases, increasing the delta, driving more subs in a higher ARPU direction.\nWe're heartened by it and we are optimistic and that is one of the strategies that we believe will help lead us ultimately to profitability and growth. Along with the second thing that you mentioned, which is the cost rationalization, and I'll tag team with Christine on this. Clearly we, as she mentioned, we're on. A path to meeting or exceeding $5.5 billion in growth, sorry in cost reductions that we mentioned last quarter that comes in two categories, content spend and SG&A. I'm going to let Christine handle the SG&A.\nBut on the content spend, we said at the time most of that will come starting in 2024 and leading and into 2025 because we were committed to so much content already in 2023. I'll let Christine handle the timing of the SG&A reductions and what potential impact that would have. Clearly, again, the price increases, the pushing more viewers, sorry, more subscribers to the ad-supported, and the cost containment are among the things we're doing to get to profitability.\n\nChristine McCarthy\n\nFormer Senior EVP and CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nYeah. Hi Ben, I'll just further elaborate on some of the SG&A progress that we've had. Thanks for picking up that. I did tease that by saying that we would meet or exceed our targets of $2.5 billion. You know, as we've gotten into this, it's been great cooperation throughout the entire company, which has been really rewarding because we're looking at this. Of course, you know, there's the reality of headcount reductions and we're going through those, but there's also other things that we're finding more and more opportunities on: eliminating redundancies, looking at ways to become more effective by utilizing resources, people, and other resources across other businesses.\nWe're really leaning into all the opportunities. There's technology, which we've also seen a lot of good progress. Some of it will be, and I say some will be realized in the balance of this year, really at the end of the fiscal year. But the real impact is going to help us in 2024. But once again, since we're all into it, I think once again having it be company-wide and having it be something that all of our business leaders have embraced, we're looking for a real comprehensive look throughout the SG&A buckets.\n\nBob Iger\n\nChairman and CEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nAnd one more thing to add to that, Ben. We launched Disney in many, many markets around the world, including many very low ARPU markets. And not only did we launch in those markets, we spent a lot of money on marketing in those markets and we spent money on local content. So as we rationalize this business and we head in the direction of profitability, clearly we're looking at opportunities to reduce expenses in those markets where the revenue potential just isn't there. Thanks.\n\nBen Swinburne\n\nManaging Director for Media and Entertainment Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you both.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nSVP for Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nOperator, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Phil Cusick of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nPhil Cusick\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nHi. Great to see the parks doing so well. Christine, can you dig into the contribution from Shanghai and where that is relative pre-COVID and to its potential? Bob, Florida is such a big part of the value of the company. But you have this political issue that only seems to get more press. It seems like you're stuck with this fight. So how should investors think about the risk, both the near term and long term business for Disney? Thank you.\n\nChristine McCarthy\n\nFormer Senior EVP and CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nHi Phil. Let me address our results at Shanghai. They were incredibly positive this quarter. We've been really gratified to see the bounce back from the pandemic closures that we had. We're not going to get into too many specifics, but suffice it to say that the business is doing extremely well on both an attendance and a per cap basis. We see that momentum continuing, and we also have some new attractions.\nWe've talked about Zootopia coming later this year, and we believe that that is going to drive even further attendance and spending at the park. But Shanghai is doing extremely well, and we've been really gratified to see that bounce back. Like I said, it was closed for quite a long period of time during the pandemic.\n\nBob Iger\n\nChairman and CEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nRegarding Florida. I got a few things I want to say about that, Phil. First of all, I think the case that we filed last month made our position and the facts very clear. That's really that this is about one thing and one thing only, and that's retaliating against us for taking a position about pending legislation. We believe that in us taking that position, we are merely exercising our right to free speech. Also, this is not about special privileges, or a level playing field, or Disney in any way using its leverage around the state of Florida. But since there's been a lot said about special districts and the arrangement that we had, I want to set the record straight on that, too.\nThere are about 2,000 special districts in Florida, and most were established to foster investment and development. We were one of them. It basically made it easier for us and others, by the way, to do business in Florida. We built a business that employs, as we've said before, over 75,000 people and attracts tens of millions of people to the state. So while it's easy to say that the Reedy Creek Improvement District that was established for us over 50 years ago benefited us, it's misleading to not also consider how much Disney benefited the state of Florida. We're not the only company operating a special district. I mentioned 2,000.\nThe Daytona Speedway has one. So do the Villages, which is a prominent retirement community, and there are countless others. So the goal here is leveling the playing. If the goal is leveling the playing field, then a uniform application of the law or government oversight of special districts needs to occur or be applied to all special districts. There's also a false narrative that we've been fighting to protect tax breaks as part of this. In fact, we're the largest taxpayer in Central Florida, paying over $1.1 billion in state and local taxes last year alone. We pay more taxes, specifically more real estate taxes, as a result of that special district.\nWe all know there was no concerted effort to do anything to dismantle what was once called Reedy Creek Improvement District until we spoke out on the legislation. This is plainly a matter of retaliation, while the rest of the Florida special districts continue operating basically as they were. I think it's also important for us to say our primary goal has always been to be able to continue to do exactly what we've been doing there, which is investing in Florida. We're proud of the tourism industry that we created, and we want to continue delivering the best possible experience for guests going forward.\nWe never wanted, and we certainly never expected to be in the position of having to defend our business interests in federal court, particularly having such a terrific relationship with the state as we've had for more than 50 years. As I mentioned, on our shareholder call, we have a huge opportunity to continue to invest in Florida. I noted that our plans were to invest $17 billion over the next 10 years, which is what the state should want us to do. We operate responsibly, we pay our fair share of taxes, we employ thousands of people. And by the way, we pay them above the minimum wage, substantially above the minimum wage dictated by the state of Florida.\nWe also provide them with great benefits and free education. So I'm going to finish what is obviously kind of a long answer by asking one question. Does the state want us to invest more, employ more people, and pay more taxes, or not? Thanks.\n\nPhil Cusick\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThanks, Bob.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nSVP for Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nOperator the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Nathanson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, MoffettNathanson LLC\n\nThanks. I have two, Bob. First, what do you think the impact of the slowdown in your DTC content spending will have on global subscriber growth? What does the move to one app in the US offered as a solution? And Christine, any help on future cash content spending? You said this year is flat, is this the peak year? And then we start seeing declines from this year? Any help there? Future cash content spending will be helpful. Thanks.\n\nBob Iger\n\nChairman and CEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nMichael. When we launched the service, let me remind everyone, it was only three and a half years ago, so we're still a startup in many ways. The goal was, as you know, global subs, and we wanted to flood the so-called digital shelves with as much content as possible to achieve obviously as much sub growth as possible. And now. As we grow the business in terms of the global footprint, we realized that we made a lot of content that is not necessarily driving sub growth and we're getting much more surgical about what it is we make. So as we look to reduce content spend, we're looking to reduce it in a way that should not have any impact at all on subs.\nWe believe that there's an opportunity for us to focus more on real sub drivers. One interesting example, and I should also throw marketing in too, is where, when you make a lot of content, everything needs to be marketed. You're spending a lot of money marketing things that are not going to have an impact on the bottom line, except negatively due to the marketing costs.\nOne thing we also know is that our films, those that are released theatrically, big tentpole movies in particular, are great sub drivers, but we were spreading our marketing costs so thin that we were not allocating enough money to even market them when they came on the service, as witnessed by the ones that are coming up, including Avatar, Little Mermaid, Guardians of the Galaxy, Indiana Jones, Elemental, et cetera, where we actually believe we have an opportunity to lean into those more, put the right marketing dollars against it, allocate more from basically away from programming that was not driving any subs at all.\nSo I guess this is part of the maturation process. As we grow into a business that we had never been in, we're learning a lot more about it. Specifically, we're learning a lot more about how our content behaves on the service and what it is consumers want.\n\nChristine McCarthy\n\nFormer Senior EVP and CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nHi Michael, I'll address your question on content spend. As you know, this is an area that Bob is spending a lot of time working with our creative teams on. But when you think about that $30 billion overall and Bob's targeted annualized saving in the $3 billion range, I just want to remind everyone that the sports component of that amount is now over 30% just due to the contractual rate increases that we've had in our contract rights, our sports rights. The other thing is in fiscal 2023 we said that we're going to be roughly comparable to last year. Remember last year we came in slightly below $30 billion. This estimate does not include any potential impacts from the writers' strike.\nWe have not estimated that because that's a new development, and we haven't really quantified what that would be because we don't know how long it's going to last. But in general, what we're really doing is looking at a lower volume of content, as I mentioned in my comments. And Bob is once again going through. All of the development slates and really looking at not only our Disney branded, but also a more curated approach to our general entertainment content.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nSVP for Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nOperator. Next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich of BofA Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nVice President and Senior Equity Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nThank you. Bob, you mentioned that in the upfront you will take a bigger share. I mean you'll lean heavily into digital and AVOD. I'm just wondering, in the face of accelerating pay TV universe decline, is that enough to offset linear losses or when will it be enough to offset linear losses and start to drive growth and in the SVOD universe decline, though I'm just wondering if you can give us your updated thoughts on ESPN and how it transitions and when it transitions to ESPN+?\n\nBob Iger\n\nChairman and CEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nWell, I'll address the ESPN first. We haven't really changed our position regarding basically migrating ESPN's flagship service as a direct-to-consumer or streaming platform. We think there's an inevitability to that. But it's a huge decision for us to make. And we know that we've got to get it right both in terms of pricing and timing. And obviously that has not only a direct impact on the linear channels, but it will have an even greater impact on it if we were to do that.\nWhat we see going on at Linear Networks, as you know, I'm not saying anything that you don't know, is we're seeing both sub declines and advertising weakness, and it's created worrisome circumstance for us because it's obviously having such a negative impact on the economics of that business. That's forcing us to take a look at the cost structure of those channels, which ultimately comes down probably more than anything to spending on programming. The decline in the business is, by the way, something that we predicted starting in 2015, 2016, which is why we got into the streaming business to begin with.\nBut the declines that we're seeing put even more pressure on us to turn that streaming business into a profitable growth business for us. That's why all of the steps that we're taking, both in terms of the organizational structure, the cost reductions, the marketing changes, and the changes in how we program, the averaging, leaning into advertising. We've also, by the way, Jessica, we've invested a fair amount in the technology needed to serve advertisers digitally much more effectively with automated sales.\nFunctionality and delivering in a very, very granular way exactly what advertisers want. So we're very bullish about leaning into digital advertising. We're bullish about how we're positioned there. We're bullish about Disney+ and Hulu and that combination. By the way, we think that by making Hulu available as a one app experience, we'll increase engagement and increase our opportunity in terms of serving digital ads and growing our advertising business.\nSo all things are kind of connected, ESPN, to the long term health of the bundle, the growth, and the need to grow streaming as a reaction to the deterioration of linear businesses, and of course, all the steps that we've been taking to get to profitability.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nSVP for Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nAll right, operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar of Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nKannan Venkateshwar\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Barclays\n\nThank you, Bob, on Hulu. The revenues of Hulu make it one of the biggest streaming businesses around, and it's also one of the oldest services around. But it doesn't seem to be profitable despite the scale. It sounds like you've made up your mind on buying the rest of Hulu based on the announcement of the combination with Disney. Does this combination allow you to change the cost structure of Hulu by maybe dropping content spending or the number of titles on Hulu, you know, raising price because it's now a single service? So any color on your plans with Hulu would be much appreciated.\nAnd Christine, on the Parks, could you help us scale the impact of the recent wage increases in Florida and how that might impact the year? And historically the business has delivered mid-single-digit or better revenue growth. You know, EBITDA grows faster than that. You now have a number of cruise ships, more attractions, higher price, but also higher cost. Could you help us think about the growth algorithm going forward more broadly? Thank you,\n\nBob Iger\n\nChairman and CEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nKannan. As you know, we have a contractual arrangement with Comcast that will enable them to put their share of Hulu back to us in early 2024. Starting in early 2024, there's, I guess, further right that we have to call their share from them. And it's not really been fully determined what will happen in that regard, except that as we look more and more at the growth or the future of our streaming business, and I mentioned at the first earnings call that I did after I came back that everything was on the table, and in fact everything was on the table. But I've now had another three months to really study this carefully and figure out what is the best path for us to grow this business.\nAnd it's clear that a combination of the content that is on Disney with general entertainment is a very strong combination from a subscriber perspective, from a subscriber acquisition, subscriber retention perspective, and also from an advertiser's perspective. So where we are headed is for one experience that would have general entertainment and Disney content together for the reasons that I just described. How that ultimately unfolds is to some extent in the hands of Comcast and in the hands of basically a conversation or a negotiation that we have with them. I don't want to be in any way predictive in terms of when or how that ends up. I can say we've had some conversations with them already. They've been cordial and they're aimed at being constructive.\nBut I can't tell you and I can't really say where they end up, only to say that there seems to be real value in having general entertainment combined with Disney. And if ultimately Hulu is that solution. We're bullish about that.\n\nChristine McCarthy\n\nFormer Senior EVP and CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nHi, Kannan, let me address your question on parks' earnings growth and the outlook. So, I think the way I would phrase this is. We do expect a really solid year overall for our domestic parks. That being said, we also expect increased costs, and we alluded to that in our Q1 earnings call. And they're really coming from a few areas. Most predominantly, one is wages with a new union contract coupled with inflationary trends. We do have some new guest offerings, so there's some incremental operating expenses that come along with those. And we also have the operational support for adding a fifth cruise ship to our cruise line fleet.\nI think you all know that we launched the Wish back last fall, so we continue to look at ways to address cost management. The team down there has done a good, great job throughout the pandemic and then coming out of the pandemic. But they utilize a variety of tactics to mitigate potential margin pressures and downside risk across the segments. And some of the levers that they can, you know, utilize to really address it are, you know, by looking at capacity at some of our new attractions. You know, they increase the footprint or increase capacity so we can open up the valve a little bit more on attendance and with some new attractions that are more based on newer IP.\nSo that will get more people not only coming in, but wanting to come in and enjoy the experience while they're there. And we also are really continuing to focus on meeting our customer needs there. But we think that this is a growth business for us. We've said so in the past. I do just want to give a call out to our cruise business. That business, as you know, was the most impacted and we had talked about that that was going to be the last business to come back from the closures during the pandemic.\nThat business has come back incredibly strongly over the last year, this fiscal year. Even looking out to the balance of our fiscal year, we're very encouraged by what we're seeing there and the reception to not only our new ship, but also our legacy ships within the fleet.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nSVP for Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nOperator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Michael Morris of Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Morris\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nThank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask one on direct-to-consumer advertising and love to hear any early details you can share about the Disney+ with advertising product. It wasn't mentioned as a driver and I realize it's early, but would love to hear any early takes there and thoughts about how that might pace over the course of the year. And then second, Bob, I'd love to ask about artificial intelligence, clearly a very hot topic right now and a technology that seems like it could be pretty impactful to your business. Both your ability to use it, but also just given how much intellectual property you have to protect something that could be a threat as well. So love any takes that you can share on how that would impact the business over time. Thank you.\n\nBob Iger\n\nChairman and CEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nMichael, I'm looking forward to a time where maybe AI does earnings calls for me. You wouldn't know the difference. Perhaps. Maybe they'd be better. I don't know.\n\nMichael Morris\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nI'd use AI to ask the questions too.\n\nBob Iger\n\nChairman and CEO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nIt's pretty clear that AI developments represent some pretty interesting opportunities for us and some substantial benefits. In fact, we're already starting to use AI to create some efficiencies and ultimately to better serve consumers. Getting closer to the customer is something that is a real goal of ours and we think that AI will provide some great opportunities to do that. But it's also clear that AI is going to be highly disruptive and it could be extremely difficult to manage, particularly from an IP management perspective. I can tell you that our legal team is working overtime already to try to come to grips with what could be some of the challenges here.\nWe're certainly not the only ones. I think this is across not only our industry, but industries. So I'd have to say overall I'm bullish about the prospects because I think they'll create efficiencies and ways for us to basically provide better services to customers. On the other hand, I think that there's a lot we're going to have to contend with that will be quite disruptive and quite challenging. Getting more specific is not something I really am prepared to do right now.\n\nChristine McCarthy\n\nFormer Senior EVP and CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nHi Mike, I will take the Disney ad tier question for you. As you know, we launched back in December, so we've just begun to scratch the surface of what we can really do on advertising on Disney+. We look at this as an incredible opportunity for longer-term advertising, advertising positioning. Just to remind everyone, we do have a lighter ad load on Disney+ versus what we have on Hulu. Also notwithstanding the very challenging macroeconomic advertising market, you know, we're still seeing our consumers come into the not only existing, but also new signups come into that ad tier.\nSo we're very encouraged by that. As Bob has mentioned previously, we have invested a lot in our ad tier technology and our data platforms. We're really providing state-of-the-art programmatic and addressable ad tools to our advertisers. So those are also investments that we've made and we believe are going to pay off not only today, but position us well for the future as the ad market overall gets stronger. The other thing I just want to mention is we will be launching the ad tier on Disney+ in Europe by the end of this calendar year. So that will be another platform that we'll have or another offering that we'll have for consumers outside of the US.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nSVP for Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nOperator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator, one last question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe last question comes from Doug Mitchelson of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\n\nDoug Mitchelson\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Credit Suisse\n\nThanks so much. Just snuck me in. Good afternoon, Bob. Integrating Hulu into the Disney app is intriguing, so I wanted to continue that conversation. When Disney was launched, you noted consumers should not have to buy through your entertainment content to get to Marvel, Star Wars, Disney, and Pixar content. And you thought at the time having separate services to give consumers choice was the right approach. Is that still the right approach to have multiple services to give consumer choice? And if the answer is yes, but you want the efficiency and flexibility of a single app, that would suggest that Disney is finally turning into a platform.\nI'm just curious if you see the opportunity to broaden the number of subscriptions that can live on that Disney platform or if you can expand the monetization of that platform in other ways while maintaining a premium experience for consumers. If I could just add one for Christine, is fiscal Q3 the peak for streaming losses? Thank you. Both.\n\nBob Iger\n\nChairman and CEO, The Walt Disney Company",
    "content2": "On the integrated app experience that we announced today. That's for consumers that have subscribed to both services for now. So in other words, it's taking what we call the dual bundle and putting it together in one experience, which is obviously good for consumers. Why have to close out one app and open another one? So it becomes a one app experience. We also think that it will benefit basically consumption in general, lower churn, and be more attractive. It's just an all in one. It's a bigger platform, basically more content than it offered before outside the United States.\nWe created that with Star, which doesn't have all the programming of Hulu, but it has a significant amount, and it's working quite well. And it's one of the reasons why we're going to launch that as an advertiser supported platform, as Christine mentioned. I think to answer your question, we're bullish about an app that goes well beyond the Disney+ branded content and includes general entertainment, which maybe at one point I called undifferentiated, that was a little harsh.\nThat includes quality curated general entertainment for the purpose of growing advertising, growing subscriber fees, growing engagement, growing lessening churn, and to address one part of your question, reducing costs.\n\nChristine McCarthy\n\nFormer Senior EVP and CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nHi Doug, and I'll answer your question on the direct to consumer losses and the peak losses. Just to remind everyone, we did say, and it is the case that we had peak losses in direct to consumer in Q4 2022. That was the quarter that we reported in November. So what you've seen since then is we improved on a sequential linked quarter basis. You've seen a $400 million improvement in Q1, another $400 million improvement in Q2. In my comments I did say that Q3 it would widen out by $100 million because of the timing of some releases and particularly the marketing of those releases.\nBut that will be an aberration because it's not a linear path. But we will be improving significantly from 2022 peak losses in Q4 through the balance of fiscal 2023. So you should assume that what you saw back in Q4 was the peak loss and we have improved for the next two quarters. There will be that one little blip in Q3 and then we expect to be back on the path for the balance of the fiscal.\n\nDoug Mitchelson\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Credit Suisse\n\nVery helpful. Thank you.\n\nChristine McCarthy\n\nFormer Senior EVP and CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nSVP for Investor Relations, The Walt Disney Company\n\nOkay, thanks for the question.

(Operator Instructions)\nAfter today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. (Operator Instructions) Please also note, today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for Walt Disney Company, Alexia Quadrani. Ma'am, please go ahead.\n\nAlexia Skouras Quadrani\n\nSVP of IR, The Walt Disney Company\n\nGood afternoon. It's my pleasure to welcome everybody to the Walt Disney Company's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay and transcript will also be available on our website.\nJoining me for today's call are Bob Chapek, Disney's Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we will be happy to take some of your questions.\nSo with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.\n\nRobert A. Chapek\n\nCEO & Director, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThank you, Alexia, and good afternoon, everyone.\nFiscal 2022 was a strong year for our company as we continued our journey of telling incredible Disney stories, utilizing groundbreaking technology in order to further develop our brands and franchises while customizing and personalizing experiences to make magical memories that last a lifetime. Those efforts resulted in truly phenomenal storytelling, record annual results at our Parks, Experiences and Products segment, and outstanding growth at our Direct-to-Consumer services, which added nearly 57 million subscriptions this year to reach a total of more than 235 million.\nWe are particularly pleased with growth in the fourth quarter, which saw the addition of 14.6 million subscriptions across our suite of services including 12 million Disney+ subscriptions, over 9 million of which were core Disney+. It has taken just 3 short years for Disney+ to transform from a nascent business to an industry leader. That transformation is the direct result of the strategic decision we made at launch to heavily invest in our Direct-to-Consumer offering, a decision made knowing that achieving rapid growth would result in short-term losses.\nBuilding a streaming powerhouse has required significant investment. And now with its scale, incredible content pipeline and global reach, Disney+ is well situated to leverage our position for long-term profitability and success. Our financial results this quarter represent a turning point as we reached peak DTC operating losses, which we expect to decline going forward. That expectation is based on 3 factors.\nFirst, the benefit of both price increases and the launch of a Disney+ ad tier next month. Second, a realignment of our cost, including meaningful rationalization of our marketing spend. And third, leveraging our learnings and experience in direct-to-consumer to optimize our content slate and distribution approach to deliver a steady state of high-impact releases that efficiently drive engagement and subscriber acquisition.\nWith these factors, we believe we are on a path to profitable streaming business that generates shareholder value long into the future. And assuming we do not see a meaningful shift in the economic climate, we still expect Disney+ to achieve profitability in fiscal 2024 as losses begin to shrink in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Christine will go into more detail on the drivers of our direct-to-consumer operating performance and provide more insight into our expectations going forward and some of our key assumptions. But first, I'd like to share a few highlights from the quarter.\nQ4 was another strong period for Parks, Experiences and Products, which continue to deliver phenomenal results despite the impact of Hurricane Ian. I want to thank the amazing cast members in Orlando who went above and beyond to help keep our guests safe and entertained during the storm. From protecting the many animals at Disney Animal Kingdom to packing thousands of meal kits, to donating and delivering emergency supplies to the community, I am so proud of how our team came together to support our guests, our neighbors and each other.\nOur Parks team is laser focused on enhancing the guest experience in creating those magical memories I mentioned at the outset. This focus, along with the investments we made to bringing new attractions and experiences to our domestic parks, is generating consistently strong demand, which, on many days, exceeds our current capacity. And we continue to manage attendance levels with a focus on providing guests with the highest quality experience in enhancing our Park's overall financial performance.\nOne of the things our guests love most is the opportunity to celebrate at our parks, as evidenced by the post-pandemic return and sell-out of special ticketed events like Boogie Boogie Bash and Mickey's Not So Scary Halloween party. I visited Disneyland with my family just before Halloween and the celebration was phenomenal. Tickets for Mickey's Very Merry Christmas party at Walt Disney World has now officially gone on sale and over half of all dates have already sold out.\nAs you know, we are about to embark on the company's 100th anniversary celebration. The fun kicks off in our parks on January 27 at Disneyland. where we'll unveil new platinum infused decor, Premier II, all new nighttime spectaculars and opened a highly anticipated Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway attraction. This is only one part of what will be the largest cross-company celebration in Disney's history with activations around the world, and we're so excited for fans and families to join us.\nAt our international parks, Disneyland Paris is enjoying a great resurgence. Our fantastic new Marvel Avengers Campus opened on July 20, and guests love a highly immersive and dynamic environment of the first-ever Marvel-themed land in Europe. Prior to the recent closure of Shanghai Disney Resort, we are seeing positive momentum there and at Hong Kong Disneyland. We are hopeful that the situation will improve and are thinking of all of our employees there as we manage through the challenging COVID environment. Our Disney Cruise line is showing strong signs of recovery. The new Disney Wish is in high demand, and we've seen a ramp-up in bookings for our base fleet.\nThis quarter was also exceptionally strong in terms of creative excellence across our content engines. Our teams received 57 Emmy Awards spread across a remarkable 37 different titles emanating from a wide range of brands, franchises and distribution channels. ABC ended the season as #1 in entertainment programming for the third consecutive year, and ABC News continues to be the most trusted source of news with #1 positions across all day parts. Theatrically, Thor: Love and Thunder, the character's fourth stand-alone film, earned over $760 million worldwide. This is our first time we released a fourth film based on a single Marvel character, and Thor's longevity is a great sign for Marvel and our ability to tell stories based on its characters long into the future.\nThe fourth quarter was also the first time in Disney history that we released tentpole original content from Disney, Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar and National Geographic, an indication that we are now at full cadence of new releases as we hit our steady state. As evidenced, Hocus Focus 2 was a smash hit, becoming not only the most watched premier on Disney+, but also a Nielsen record-setting streaming movie with 2.7 billion minutes viewed in its first weekend. And Marvel Studios, Ms. Marvel completed its run in July and She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, debuted in August, contributing to subscriber growth and driving substantial engagement.\nLucas Films' Andor, a spy thriller that explores the back story of Cassian Andor, a popular character from Rogue One, earned great reviews and showcases our ability to extend stories from the big screen to our streaming services.\nTurning to general entertainment. The critically acclaimed Prey from 20th Century Studios was Hulu's biggest premier ever across all films and series and was the most watched film premier on Star+ in Latin America and Disney+ under the Star banner in all other territories. Looking ahead, we are thrilled that audiences are returning to the box office for blockbuster films, and we have big plans for the big screen in the fiscal year 2023.\nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever opens this Friday, and Ryan Coogler has delivered yet another culture-defining powerful film. The reaction to this film's premier a few weeks ago was incredible, and fan anticipation is very high, as indicated by the strength of advanced ticket sales.\nUp next is Strange World from Walt Disney Animation Studios, which opens in theaters this Thanksgiving. The highly anticipated Avatar: The Way of Water opens on December 16 and is the sequel to the highest grossing film of all time. James Cameron and his team have once again created something truly magical using groundbreaking technology. Audiences are as excited as we are to return to Pandora. And given the strong performance of September's rerelease of the original Avatar, we can't wait for the film to hit screens.\nOur Searchlight Studio continues to deliver critically acclaimed films and 3 fantastic titles will be in theaters this quarter: The Banshees of Inisherin which has earned critical claims since its premier; The Menu starting Ralph Fiennes and Anya Taylor-Joy; and the Empire of Life from Academy Award winner, Sam Mendes.\nLooking even further to 2023, we'll see theatrical releases of 3 highly anticipated Marvel films, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 and The Marvels. And we could not be more excited about Disney live action's The Little Mermaid, a reimagining of one of the most popular animated films of all time, starting Halle Bailey, whose rendition A Part of Your World has already lit up the Internet. We're also bringing 999 Happy Haunts to Life with the hilarious new live action Haunted Mansion featuring an all-star cast.\nPixar will debut an all new original feature, Elemental, and Harrison Ford is back in the eagerly awaited fifth Indiana Jones film, which is going to be spectacular. Of course, all of our theatrical titles will eventually make their way onto our streaming platforms, complementing a robust slate of original content. Utopia+, a new series from Disney Animation debuts tomorrow, along with Save Our Squad, an original series from the U.K. that sees soccer superstar David Beckham returned home to mentor a grassroots team of young boys struggling to survive in their league.\nOn November 18, Disney+ will release Disenchanted, based on the successful Enchanted that came out 15 years ago. Marvel's Guardian of the Galaxy Holiday Special will follow right after, and Willow, another long-awaited sequel from Lucas Film, will premiere the following week.\nWe are so fortunate to have an abundance of content from all of our creative engines, paired with the wealth of knowledge and insight into what resonates with our fans. As we move forward, we will increasingly leverage that knowledge to refine our distribution decisions in order to best serve our audience and maximize the return on our content investments.\nTurning to sports. ESPN was the #1 cable network in total day and prime viewing amongst audiences aged 18 to 49 in Q4, and The Walt Disney Company was responsible for 40% of sports hours watched amongst that age bracket, the biggest share of any family of networks. ESPN continues to lead with its multi-platform sports ecosystem with reach across linear streaming, digital and social media, serving fans at massive scale. With the power and support of The Walt Disney Company behind it, ESPN is an unequaled reach machine.\nAnd the business is well positioned through our strategic portfolio of long-term rights agreements with an eye to remaining disciplined in our approach. We recently announced an extension with Formula 1 through 2025, which is one of the fastest-growing sports properties and is on pace to surpass last year's record audience on ESPN. The 2022 College football season is off to its best 9-week start in 5 years across our networks. And thanks to our incoming SEC agreement in 2024, we will remain the leading college football platform with over 60% of the college football market. And our new long-term NFL agreement includes Super Bowls and annual ESPN+ exclusive match-up and more regular season and playoff games and better scheduling. On October 30, we marked another milestone moment in our DTC streaming services and the growth of ESPN+ when the Broncos Versus Jaguar NFL game from London became our most viewed ESPN+ event ever.\nFinally, we are exactly 1 month from the U.S. launch of Disney+'s ad-supported subscription offering, which is a win for audiences, advertisers and shareholders. The launch will bring fans a new slate of subscription plans across Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ and the Disney bundle, giving viewers flexibility in choosing an option that suits their needs.\nThe offering also adds a key component to our total company advertising portfolio, and advertiser interest has been strong. We have been a leader in streaming advertising for some time and are bringing our years of experience, leading ad tech and relationships to this important opportunity. Disney+ has secured more than 100 advertisers for our domestic launch window, spanning a wide range of categories and our company has over 8,000 existing relationships with advertisers who will have the opportunity to advertise on Disney+.\nStrong base pricing reflects the value advertisers put on our audience, our brand safe environment for their messages and our sales experience. We also have proven technology to deliver a great advertising experience on day 1 and importantly, we have the ability to scale and innovate for audiences and advertisers alike. We are incredibly excited about the launch of our new ad-supported subscription offering for Disney+, which rolls out on December 8.\n2022 was an important year of recovery coming out of the pandemic as we made foundational investments in our long-term success. As we celebrate the 3-year anniversary of Disney+ this week, I can't help but reflect upon how our commitment to and substantial investment in our DTC business has helped create the world's most powerful suite of streaming services with the ability to reach hundreds of millions of viewers around the world with must-see content.\nServices, which aren't just content delivery systems, but platforms that bring us closer to audiences than ever before and enable consumers to access more of The Walt Disney Company's total offering. With our unmatched brands and franchises, robust pipeline of content capable of filling all of our distribution channels, unique experiences and strong connections to audiences around the world, I believe we are well positioned for future long-term growth, and I'm confident in the path forward.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Christine to talk in greater detail about our quarter and the year ahead.\n\nChristine Mary McCarthy\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nGood afternoon, everyone.\nWe have wrapped up another dynamic fiscal year. And as we enter into fiscal 2023, I will be diving a bit deeper than usual today into the results of our businesses, and we'll give some additional color on where we expect to go from here, especially given the inflection point that we believe we have now reached in our Direct-to-Consumer business.\nExcluding certain items, our company's diluted earnings per share for the fourth fiscal quarter was $0.30, and for the full fiscal 2022 year diluted EPS, excluding certain items, was $3.53. Our Parks, Experiences and Products segment had another stellar quarter with DPEP operating income in the fourth quarter more than doubling versus the prior year to $1.5 billion.\nOur domestic parks delivered significant year-over-year revenue and operating income growth despite an adverse impact of approximately $65 million to segment operating income from Hurricane Ian. And per capita spending remained strong, increasing 6% versus Q4 of fiscal 2021 and nearly 40% versus fiscal 2019, reflecting the continued popularity of premium offerings, including Genie Plus and Lightning Lane.\nWe are also making meaningful progress on the return of international visitors to our domestic parks, particularly at Walt Disney World, where the mix of international attendance in the fourth quarter was roughly in line with pre-pandemic levels.\nLooking towards fiscal 2023, while we continue to monitor our booking trends for any macroeconomic impacts, we are still seeing robust demand at our domestic parks and are anticipating a strong holiday season in Q1. Disney Cruise Line was also a meaningful contributor to the year-over-year increase in domestic parks and experiences' operating income in Q4, reflecting the successful launch of the Disney Wish in July and continued recovery of the existing fleet coming out of the pandemic. Quarter-to-date, occupancy for the Wish continues to exceed 90%, while we have also seen a meaningful pickup in the rest of our fleet with booked revenue up versus pre-pandemic levels.\nAt International Parks, fourth quarter results also improved significantly year-over-year, driven by continued strength at Disneyland Paris, partially offset by a decrease at Shanghai Disney Resort. As Bob mentioned, the situation in Shanghai has recently been challenging. The park is currently closed, and we do not yet have visibility to a reopening date.\nQ4 results at Consumer Products also increased versus the prior year, driven by higher merchandise licensing results across several of our key franchises, including Mickey and Friends, Encanto and Toy Story.\nMoving on to Media and Entertainment Distribution. Operating income in the fourth quarter decreased by $864 million versus the prior year as a modest increase at linear networks was more than offset by wider losses at direct-to-consumer and to a lesser extent, at content, sales, licensing and other.\nAt Linear Networks, operating income in the fourth quarter increased 6% to $1.7 billion, driven primarily by growth at domestic channels. The increase at domestic channels primarily reflects higher results at cable driven by lower programming and production costs, partially offset by a decrease in advertising revenue. Compared to the prior year fourth quarter, cable programming and production costs benefited from the timing of the NBA finals which were in Q4 of fiscal 2021 versus Q3 of fiscal 2022 as well as from lower costs for Major League Baseball programming due to fewer games under our new contract. These impacts were partially offset by higher NFL programming costs as a result of one additional game aired versus the prior year quarter.\nThe decrease in cable advertising revenue versus the prior year fourth quarter also reflects the timing impact of the NBA Finals. ESPN advertising revenue in Q4 was down 23% year-over-year. However, adjusting for the timing impact of the NBA Finals, it was down roughly 2%.\nNote that in Q1 of fiscal 2023, we also expect to see a timing impact versus the prior year from 2 college football playoff games that are shifting into the second fiscal quarter this year versus the first quarter last year. Quarter-to-date, ESPN domestic cash advertising sales are pacing down, reflecting in part the absence of these 2 CFP games.\nThe advertising landscape remains fluid. The sports marketplace, in particular, is delivering strong audiences across our platforms, with marketers looking to take advantage of live events and several categories, including political, pharma, insurance and restaurants, have continued to show relatively stable demand while others remain cautious in anticipation of potential economic softness.\nTotal domestic affiliate revenue in the fourth quarter increased by 2% from the prior year, driven by 5 points of growth from contractual rate increases, partially offset by a 4-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. Looking ahead, we expect to see linear subscriber declines accelerate more in line with industry trends.\nInternational channels' operating income decreased by $25 million in the fourth quarter versus the prior year, reflecting lower results from our ongoing channels and operation partially offset by a benefit from channel closures. At content sales, licensing and other, results decreased versus the prior year by a little over $100 million, in line with guidance due to lower TV/SVOD and home entertainment results, partially offset by higher theatrical results and an increase at our stage play business. While difficult comparisons may persist in the intermediate term at our TV/SVOD and home entertainment businesses, results will vary quarter-to-quarter. And we currently expect content sales, licensing and other operating results to improve slightly in the first fiscal quarter of 2023 on both the sequential and year-over-year basis.\nFinally, I'd like to spend some time talking about our fourth quarter results at Direct-to-Consumer, where our losses peaked in the fourth quarter at approximately $1.5 billion. Hulu and ESPN+ added approximately 1 million and 1.5 million subscribers, respectively, during the quarter, while Disney+ added over 12 million global subscribers, of which a little less than 3 million were at Disney+ Hotstar.\nCore Disney+ added over 9 million subs in Q4, accelerating as expected versus the $6 million net adds we saw in the third quarter, reflecting the success of Disney+ Day and our Tempo content releases in addition to continued growth from third quarter market launches. Nearly $2 million of these net adds were from the U.S. and Canada and a little over 7 million were international core additions. At the same time, core Disney+ ARPU decreased by 5% between Q3 and Q4, reflecting an adverse foreign exchange impact, and to a lesser extent, a slightly higher mix of subscribers from lower-priced international markets.\nARPU at each streaming service is also impacted by the mix of subscribers to the bundle. Our bundled and multiproduct offerings now account for over 40% of our fiscal year-end domestic Disney+ subscriber count. This shift has been purposeful as the bundle drives higher total company subscription revenue and higher long-term subscriber value due to notably lower churn.\nLower pay-per-view revenue at ESPN+ and slightly lower advertising revenue at Hulu and Disney+ Hotstar also impacted Direct-to-Consumer revenue in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. With our expectation that peak losses are now behind us, DTC operating results should improve going forward as we lay the foundation for a sustainably profitable business model.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect direct-to-consumer operating results to improve by at least $200 million versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, with larger improvement expected in Q2, reflecting a couple of key factors. First, our recently announced price increases across our Direct-to-Consumer offerings in the U.S. should begin to modestly benefit ARPU and subscription revenue in the first quarter. However, given that the Disney+ price increase will not go into effect until towards the end of Q1, this benefit will be realized more fully in the second quarter. Similarly, we do not expect the launch of the advertising-supported tier of Disney+ in December to provide a more meaningful financial impact until later this fiscal year.\nAdditionally, our commitment to cost rationalization will allow us to scale effectively against our investments. In particular, while DTC programming and production costs will increase from Q4 to Q1 over the course of the year, content expense and OpEx growth should slow as we approach steady state, and marketing costs should decline as we continue to focus on aligning our costs with our dynamic business models.\nAs it relates to subscribers, we expect ESPN+ and Hulu will continue to add new subscribers in Q1, and we expect core Disney+ subscribers to increase only slightly in the quarter, reflecting tougher comparisons against Disney+ Day performance. As we've mentioned before, subscriber growth will not be linear each and every quarter, and the trend is driven by several factors, including content releases and promotions. We expect Disney+ core subscriber growth to then accelerate in the fiscal second quarter, largely driven by international markets.\nAnd at Disney+ Hotstar, we are currently expecting that subscribers will decline in Q1 due to the absence of the IPL, but we do expect to see some stabilization in Q2. I'll note that our Direct-to-Consumer expectations are built on certain assumptions around subscriber additions based on the attractiveness of our future content, churn expectations for our upcoming price increases, the financial impact of the Disney+ ad tier and price increases, and our ability to quickly execute on cost rationalization while preserving revenue, all of which, while based on extensive internal analysis as well as recent experience, provides a layer of uncertainty in our outlook.\nBefore we conclude, there are a couple of other items I would like to mention around our fiscal 2023 expectations. Cash content spend totaled $30 billion in fiscal 2022, and we continue to expect it to be in the low $30 billion range for fiscal 2023. Capital expenditures totaled nearly $5 billion in fiscal 2022, in line with our expectations, and we currently expect that CapEx will increase in fiscal 2023 to a total of $6.7 billion, driven by higher spend across the enterprise.\nPutting this all together, assuming we do not see a meaningful shift in the macroeconomic climate, we currently expect total company's fiscal 2023 revenue and segment operating income to both grow at a high single-digit percentage rate versus fiscal 2022. We are confident about the opportunities we see to continue to transform our business for the next 100 years and look forward to sharing our progress with you all throughout 2023.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back to Alexia, and we would be happy to take your questions.\n\nAlexia Skouras Quadrani\n\nSVP of IR, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, Christine. (Operator Instructions) And with that, operator, we're ready for your first question.",

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Alexia Quadrani, Senior VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nAlexia Skouras Quadrani\n\nSVP of IR, The Walt Disney Company\n\nGood afternoon. It's my pleasure to welcome everybody to The Walt Disney Company's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay and transcript will also be available on our website. Joining me for today's call are Bob Chapek, Disney's Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we will be happy to take some of your questions.\nSo with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.\n\nRobert A. Chapek\n\nCEO & Director, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThank you, Alexia, and good afternoon, everyone. We had an excellent quarter powered by world-class storytelling, outstanding performance at our domestic theme parks, increases in live sports viewership across our linear channels and ESPN+ and significant subscriber growth at our streaming services which added 15.5 million subscriptions in the quarter, including 14.4 million Disney+ subscribers, of which 6 million were core Disney+ and 8 million were Hotstar. As of the close of Q3, we now have 221 million total subscriptions across our streaming offering.\nOur results showcased the ability of the Walt Disney Company's uniquely diversified businesses to power our ecosystem and explore growth opportunities across industries and distribution channels. I'll expand on all this and more, and then Christine will go through the details of our results and provide additional insight into our fiscal 2024 expectations for Disney+.\nCreative excellence in storytelling that build deep emotional connections with audiences is at the root of our success. And I am pleased to say that our creative engines are firing on all cylinders across franchise, general entertainment and sports. In a testament to the depth, breadth and quality of our creative teams, we received 147 Primetime Emmy Award nominations this year, including 92 for our streaming platforms and 21 for best program in a genre. Recognition across formats and distribution channels with 47 different shows receiving nominations, including titles like Only Murders in the Building, Abbott Elementary, What We Do in the Shadows and The Dropout right alongside shows from Disney, Marvel and Star Wars. And most recently, we received an additional 71 news and documentary Emmy nominations across ABC News, National Geographic, FX, Hulu and ESPN.\nIn addition to critical and industry recognition, we are thrilled by the audience response to our general entertainment offerings, response that is enhanced by a distribution strategy that maximizes reach by taking advantage of the strength of both our linear and streaming channels.\nGiven the multiple ways we bring our content to audiences, we take a thoughtful approach to each distribution decision to determine the best strategy for each of our many high-quality titles and platforms. Some like the buzz-generating Candy, the Kardashians and The Bear may be best served as Hulu Originals. Others like Abbott Elementary and The Old Man have become multiplatform hits by reaching different audience demographics across both linear and streaming.\nAnd when it comes to our key franchise content, I could not be more proud of the teams at Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars. The hugely successful Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness has earned nearly $1 billion at the global box office. And Thor: Love and Thunder, which premiered on July 8, has grossed over $700 million at the global box office and is the highest domestic grossing film of the Thor franchise.\nPixar's Lightyear marked the studios return to the big screen and the film debuted on Disney+ last week. Speaking of Disney+, which is now available in 155 markets after recently launching in 53 new territories, we released content with appeal across demographic groups, including Obi-wan Kenobi and Ms. Marvel as well as feature films like Disney's Chip n' Dale Rescue Rangers and Disneynature's Polar Bear.\nAs you know, Disney+ is still a young business and we are learning more every day about the services ability to attract new fans to our powerhouse franchises. For example, in addition to driving engagement amongst tens of millions of existing Marvel fans, we have seen each new Disney+ original Marvel series attract incremental viewership and new subscribers that hadn't previously engaged with Marvel content on the service, thanks to the episodic format that enables us to explore new characters and genres. The value of expanding the fan base is tremendous, and this new audience can then experience Marvel across our other offerings from consumer products to games to theme parks.\nLooking ahead, Q4 will feature a fantastic Disney+ content slate with a steady flow of key releases including Marvel's She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, Lucasfilm's Andor and Disney's Hocus Pocus 2, and we look forward to celebrating the second annual Disney+ Day on September 8 with activations across our synergy machine.\nGiven the global nature of Disney+, we are thrilled to bring international music sensation BTS to the service with an exclusive cinematic concert film and docuseries following the band's incredible journey. BTS and the K-pop genre at large carry massive global appeal and affinity, which will further extend our reach into that global fan base. And we continue to step up our investment in international local originals across formats including bringing the seventh season of Koffee With Karan, one of India's most popular talk shows exclusively to Disney+ Hotstar.\nOn the theatrical side, we have a robust slate debuting later this year, including the highly anticipated Avatar: The Way of Water, our newest animated film Strange World and the final film in Marvel's Phase Four, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. Excitement for this film is amazing, and the trailer received more than 170 million views in its first 24 hours.\nTurning to sports. Our industry-leading run of rights acquisitions positions us extremely well for the future. We will continue to focus on audience expansion and long-term profitability by being disciplined in our acquisition approach and making deliberate distribution decisions for each sport in the portfolio. The results of this approach were fantastic last quarter as The Walt Disney Company was responsible for 47% of sports hours watched by the 18 to 49 demo in fiscal Q3.\nOur innovative NHL deal has been a difference-maker across platforms with the Stanley Cup playoff viewership up 60% over 2021 across cable and broadcast, including significant year-over-year increases in younger demos and female viewers. We also secured exclusive TV rights for the upcoming 2023 to 2027 IPL season following a competitive process where we made disciplined bids with a focus on long-term value. We are excited to continue offering IPL to our linear customers in India where growth potential exists for our portfolio of more than 70 channels that reaches 90% of pay cable and satellite TV homes in the region.\nPay TV distribution in India continues to be a robust business with projected GDP growth expected to drive advertising and consumer spending. In fact, India is one of the only markets in which we are launching new linear channels.\nFinally, given the results of our recently completed upfront, it is clear that our unmatched portfolio continues to be highly sought after by advertisers. Combined with our deep expertise in ad tech, we are in a position of strength with record upfront advertiser commitment leading into the launch of our ad-supported Disney+ tier.\nSince the launch of Disney+, advertisers have been asking for the opportunity to connect with audiences alongside the most premium brands in content and streaming. As we shared earlier today, the Disney+ ad tier goes live on December 8, and we are taking a thoughtful approach by launching with a lower ad load and frequency to ensure a great experience for viewers. This approach, coupled with strong advertiser demand, translated into Disney+ earning industry-leading CPM rates at the most recent upfront.\nTurning to our parks. This quarter featured new magic around the world and strong operating performance. All of our theme parks are now open, and we continue to bring back more of the great experience that guests love that includes Character Meet and Greet, Nighttime Spectacular at Disneyland and Theatrical Performances. These offerings are not only big hits with guests, but also enable us to welcome more people into our parks each day.\nWe continue to see strong revenue and profit growth at our domestic parks and experience businesses. Even as our cruise ships and international visitation have yet to fully recover. Domestic demand at our theme parks continues to be strong, and we are seeing continued progress in those businesses still recovering from the pandemic. At the same time, the business model transformation we have achieved over the past few years have driven substantial increases in per capita spending and give us the flexibility to adapt should economic conditions change.\nWe celebrated 3 major milestones for our parks and experience business this quarter, each of which were priorities I said when I had the opportunity to lead our parks team. First, the innovative and immersive new roller coaster, Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind, opened in Epcot as part of the park's ongoing transformation to a place that is more family, more timeless and more Disney.\nSecond, we expanded the Disney Cruise Line fleet with a Disney Wish which sailed its maiden voyage on July 14. This is the first of 3 new ships and is infused with Disney storytelling, one-of-a-kind entertainment and a modern interior aesthetic. It is powered by liquefied natural gas, one of the cleanest burning fuels available.\nAnd finally, Disneyland Paris opened Avengers Campus on July 20, completing the first phase of our ambitious expansion plan. The new immersive area features 2 new attractions, 5 action stunts, encounters with Marvel superheroes and themed restaurants. I had the opportunity to help open this new land with stars from the Marvel Cinematic Universe and our cast, and I could not be more proud of the resort's ongoing transformation. Guests are responding in a big way to our enhanced offering at Disneyland Paris' per capita spending in Q3 was up over 30% versus 2019, a great sign of the site's potential for growth.\nI am incredibly pleased with our performance this quarter, our competitive position and the unique collection of assets and capabilities that sets us apart. Going forward, The Walt Disney Company's incredible employees, cast members and creative teams will continue to transform entertainment by combining extraordinary storytelling with innovative technology to create an even larger, more connected and magical Disney universe for families and fans around the world.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Christine.\n\nChristine Mary McCarthy\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our strong financial results this quarter with diluted earnings per share, excluding certain items increasing to $1.09 versus $0.80 in the prior year quarter. At Parks, Experiences and Products, third quarter revenues increased by more than $3 billion and operating income increased by $1.8 billion versus the prior year, reflecting improvements across both domestic and international parks and experiences.\nDemand at our domestic parks continues to exceed expectations with attendance on many days tracking ahead of 2019 levels. And our continued focus on improving the guest experience through the use of our reservation system to purposely manage capacity versus simply increasing volume has the added benefit of improving yield and optimizing overall economics. So even while the average daily attendance at our domestic parks across the first 3 quarters of this fiscal year was slightly below 2019, we have delivered significantly higher revenue and operating income over that same time period. This approach also provides flexibility with levers we can adjust if demand were to shift.\nPer capita spending at our domestic parks also remained strong, increasing 10% versus Q3 of fiscal 2021 and over 40% versus fiscal 2019. And in another sign of the robust demand we have seen at our parks and resorts, occupancy at our domestic hotels in the third quarter was 90%.\nLooking ahead, domestic demand at our theme parks continues to look robust with current forward-looking hotel bookings and intent to visit roughly in line with pre-pandemic trends. Improvement at our international parks in the third quarter was driven by Disneyland Paris, where both revenue and operating income exceeded 2019 levels. And we are seeing the same momentum well into Q4 as we continue to celebrate the 30th anniversary and the opening of Avengers Campus in July. Disneyland Paris' strong performance in the third quarter was partially offset by closure-related impacts at Shanghai Disney Resort, where the theme park was closed for all but the last 3 days of the quarter.\nAt the Media and Entertainment Distribution segment, third quarter revenues increased by over $1.4 billion versus the prior year, and operating income decreased by $645 million as an increase at linear networks was more than offset by declines at direct-to-consumer and content sales, licensing and other. Linear Networks operating income in the quarter increased 13% to approximately $2.5 billion, driven primarily by growth at our domestic channels. The increase at domestic channels reflects double-digit percentage operating income growth at both Cable and Broadcasting.\nGrowth at Cable was largely driven by higher advertising revenue and to a lesser extent, a decrease in marketing costs and an increase in affiliate revenue. Advertising revenue at Cable benefited from the timing of the NBA Finals, which represented 6 of the top 7 telecasts among the coveted P18 to 49 demo across all networks this quarter. Note that the final aired in the third quarter this year versus the fourth quarter of the prior year. This timing impact, in addition to the benefit of adding the NHL to our portfolio and strong pricing from the continued strength of live sports, drove ESPN advertising revenue growth of nearly 40% year-over-year. Demand for live sports remains strong. However, due to the NBA Finals' timing impact, fourth quarter-to-date domestic cash advertising sales at ESPN are currently pacing down.\nMoving on to Broadcasting. Operating income increased versus the prior year due to higher results at both ABC and our owned television stations. Total domestic affiliate revenue increased by 2% in the quarter. This was driven by 6 points of growth from higher rates, partially offset by a 3-point decrease from fewer subscribers.\nInternational channels' operating income was comparable to the prior year, reflecting increased sports programming costs, partially offset by advertising revenue growth. Both of these trends were driven by the airing of 35 additional IPL cricket matches in the third quarter versus the prior year. Note that results also benefited from the closure of certain channels over the past year.\nAt Direct-to-Consumer, lower operating results across Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ reflect increased programming and production costs, in line with the guidance we gave last quarter as we continue to strategically invest in our streaming businesses. At Disney+, we crossed the 150 million subscriber milestone and ended the third quarter with more than 152 million global paid subscribers, a net addition of more than 14 million subs versus Q2. Strong Disney+ core net subscriber additions of 6 million reflect growth in existing markets as well as launches in over 50 new markets during the quarter, and we currently expect Disney+ core net additions in the fourth quarter to accelerate modestly versus Q3 and particularly in the domestic market.\nAt Disney+ Hotstar, subscribers increased by over 8 million as the IPO concluded its 15th season in the quarter. Hulu added more than 600,000 subs during the quarter and ended the third quarter with 46.2 million paid subscribers and ESPN+ ended Q3 with 22.8 million paid subscribers, a net increase of about 0.5 million versus Q2.\nAt content sales, licensing and other, operating results decreased in line with our expectations by about $160 million versus the prior year quarter reflecting an unfavorable foreign exchange impact and lower TV/SVOD and home entertainment distribution results, partially offset by higher stage play and theatrical results.\nAs it relates to foreign exchange, note that the overall impact to the company's segment operating income was only modestly negative in the quarter, as our FX hedging program continued to be effective in mitigating the impact that changes exchange rates have on our businesses. As we continue to scale back on third-party content licensing, we believe content sales, licensing and other results will continue to face headwinds and expect fourth quarter operating results will decrease versus the prior year by close to $100 million.\nCash content spend across the company is now expected to total approximately $30 billion for fiscal 2022. This estimate is slightly lower than our previous guidance, largely due to timing changes and we expect annual cash content spend over the next couple of years to be roughly in the low $30 billion range as well.\nWe are also revising our full year forecast for capital expenditures to $5 billion compared to fiscal 2021 CapEx of $3.6 billion. Our new expectation for 2022 is roughly $500 million lower than our previous guide, in part reflecting timing shifts of various projects across the company.\nFinally, before we move to Q&A, I want to spend some time sharing a few updates on our fiscal 2024 guidance for Disney+. We are providing more detail on subscriber targets by separating our guidance into 2 categories: core Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar. Excluding the impact of any significant future macro headwinds, our core Disney+ subscriber target range is 135 million to 165 million by the end of fiscal 2024, largely consistent with previously provided guidance that non-Hotstar Disney+ subscribers in 2024 would approximate 60% to 70% of the expected 230 million to 260 million total subscriber base.\nWe are, however, updating subscriber guidance for Disney+ Hotstar to up to 80 million subscribers by the end of fiscal 2024. We intend to refine this target over time as subscriber visibility in India will be clearer once the ICC and BCCI cricket rights sales processes are completed. As you may know, we recently made the disciplined decision to not proceed with the Indian Premier League digital rights, and we'll evaluate these rights with that same discipline.\nAs we sit here today, we remain confident that Disney+ will achieve profitability in fiscal 2024 and look forward to several upcoming catalysts, including reaching a steady state of tentpole original content releases, delivery of premium general entertainment and international local originals and the upcoming launch of our ad-supported tier, alongside the new pricing structure announced earlier today.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back to Alexia, and we would be happy to take your questions.\n\nAlexia Skouras Quadrani\n\nSVP of IR, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, Christine.

Please go ahead.\n\nAlexia Skouras Quadrani\n\nSVP of IR, The Walt Disney Company\n\nGood afternoon. It's my pleasure to welcome everybody to The Walt Disney Company's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay and transcript will also be available on our website.\nJoining me for today's call are Bob Chapek, Disney's Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we will be happy to take some of your questions.\nSo with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.\n\nRobert A. Chapek\n\nCEO & Director, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, Alexia, and good afternoon, everyone. In Q2, Disney's employees and cast members continued to execute against our strategic priorities of storytelling excellence, innovation and audience focus, and I could not be more proud of what they've achieved. Our strong results this quarter, including fantastic performance at our domestic parks and continued growth at our streaming services along with the creative achievements of our content teams, once again proved that we are in a league of our own.\nWe have entertainment's most iconic brands and the world's favorite franchises, a high-quality creative pipeline that will continue to drive engagement and consumption and an unrivaled synergy machine with touch points that reach audiences across distribution channels, geographies and demographics, all of which come together to create a deep, emotional connection with audiences across generations. I'd like to share a few highlights from the quarter that illustrate these strengths, and then Christine will go through the details of our results.\nAs I said, our domestic parks were a standout. They continue to fire on all cylinders, powered by strong demand coupled with customized and personalized guest experience enhancements that grew per capita spending by more than 40% versus 2019. Response to next-generation storytelling like Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser has been phenomenal. In fact, guest ratings for this immersive experience, which opened March 1, are incredibly high and in line with our best-in-class offerings. Demand is strong, and we expect 100% utilization through the end of Q3.\nLooking ahead, we could not be more excited to officially welcome riders on Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind at Epcot on May 27. One of the longest indoor rollercoasters in the world, the attraction puts guests in the middle of an exciting adventure as they're called on to help the Guardians out of a jam. With our first-ever reverse launch and rotating cars that turn riders 360 degrees, guests won't miss a second of the story during our most immersive coaster experience yet.\nAt Disneyland Paris, we are thrilled to take the next step in our ambitious expansion plan: the opening of Avengers Campus this summer as part of the resort's 30th anniversary celebration. As Europe recovers from the pandemic, we've seen strong yield growth at Disneyland Paris and look forward to its continued recovery.\nAnother standout this quarter were our streaming services. We ended Q2 with more than 205 million total subscriptions after adding 9.2 million in the quarter. That includes 7.9 million Disney+ subscribers, keeping us on track to reach 230 million to 260 million Disney+ subscribers by fiscal '24. The growth of the platform since its launch reinforces its unique nature. Quite simply, we believe Disney+ is one of a kind, a service based on exceptional branded content with wide appeal across all 4 quadrants. It's certainly popular with families, but as a reminder, almost half of Disney+ subscribers are adults without kids.\nIn recognition of Disney+'s unique ability to attract viewers from a range of demographic groups, we are selectively enhancing Disney+ with general entertainment titles designed to drive sign-ups amongst specific audiences and deepen engagement amongst those cohorts. A benefit of our incredible creative engines and decades of general entertainment excellence is that we can reach these demographics not only through the creation of original titles but also by shifting resources from across our content ecosystem, especially as consumer behavior continues to evolve.\nOur strategy is not just to fill our distribution pipelines but to be thoughtful with each asset to best position it amongst our various distribution options. For instance, Dancing with the Stars is a beloved show that has entertained viewers for more than 30 seasons on ABC and is a wonderful example of content that brings the whole family together. We recently announced Disney+ will be the series' new home starting this fall.\nBeyond targeting specific demos, we are equally enthusiastic about our growth potential in international markets. We currently have over 500 local original titles in various stages of development and production. 180 of those titles are slated to premiere this fiscal year, increasing to over 300 international originals per year in steady state. We believe these premium local originals, along with branded content with broad international appeal, will attract new subscribers and drive engagement.\nOne example in production is Nautilus from our EMEA team. Based on 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Nautilus is the origin story of the iconic submarine from the perspective of its mysterious commander, Captain Nemo. This is just one example of how our global network of creative hubs can develop and produce original content with worldwide appeal. And by the end of we plan to roll out Disney+ to 53 new markets across Europe, Africa and West Asia, starting with South Africa next week.\nBefore leaving Disney+, I want to mention our recently announced plans to introduce an ad-supported subscription offering in the U.S. by the end of the calendar year and internationally in 2023. Expanding Disney+ access through multiple price points is a win for consumers and advertisers. Of course, all of our success is rooted in great content. Our general entertainment team continued its string of phenomenal series with Hulu's Pam & Tommy and The Dropout. And while not in the quarter, we could not be happier with the performance of The Kardashians, more great general entertainment content is ahead, like the second season of Only Murders in the Building on Hulu and the record-breaking 19th season of ABC's Grey's Anatomy.\nThis quarter, our studios earned 6 Academy awards, including Best Animated Feature for Walt Disney Animation Studios, Encanto; and Best Documentary Feature for Onyx Collective and Searchlight Pictures Summer of Soul. Pixar Animation Studios' Turning Red premiered on March 11 on Disney+ and became the fastest title to reach 200 million hours viewed on the platform. The Disney+ original series Star Wars: The Book of Boba Fett drew positive reaction from audiences, and Marvel's Moon Knight continue the studio's impressive track record.\nLooking ahead, our studios will continue to deliver high-quality content at scale with an exciting array of series and films coming to all of our distribution channels. In fact, our slate for the remainder of this year is incredibly strong with titles like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ms. Marvel, Lightyear, Thor: Love and Thunder, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and the long-anticipated Avatar: The Way of Water.\nFinally, I must mention the phenomenal success of Marvel's Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, which opened to roughly $450 million worldwide this past weekend. Domestically, it was the second-highest opening of the pandemic era and the 11th highest opening of all time. Our strategy of distribution flexibility has worked well for us, and these fantastic results are another sign of our ability to succeed no matter of the platform.\nThat success extends to sports. ESPN viewership was notably strong for the quarter across both live events and studio programming with ratings up double digits, and we remain encouraged by how fans are engaging with sports content coming out of the pandemic. Opening weekend of the NBA Playoffs was the most viewed in the past decade, and the ratings have been fantastic with over 4.3 million average viewers through 20 games on ABC and ESPN. Our groundbreaking NHL deal is unique in its exposure across ESPN, ESPN+, ABC and Hulu, culminating with the Stanley Cup Playoffs, which began on May 2. In fact, the combination of the NHL and NBA Playoffs going on simultaneously kicks off an exciting stretch of championship programming that also includes Wimbledon, the NCAA Women's and Men's College World Series, UFC, Boxing and more.\nComing off the success of Monday Night Football with Peyton and Eli, we recently debuted our new season-long MLB alternative broadcast, KayRod Cast with Michael Kay and Alex Rodriguez. And we began the inaugural season of PGA TOUR Live on ESPN+, featuring over 4,000 hours of live golf coverage from 35 tournaments.\nBefore I hand it over to Christine, I want to say a few words about our unique synergy machine or franchise flywheel, if you prefer. What sets Disney apart is our ability to reach people with our uniquely engaging content across an array of touch points to make our portfolio of businesses and brands a bigger part of their lives. This enables us to not only create new franchises like Encanto, but to also build on existing IP across our lines of business.\nOne example of this is our Toy Story franchise, which was created almost 3 decades ago with the release of the first film in 1995 and which is now brought to life across distribution platforms, geographies, businesses and time. In our parks, we've built a portfolio of 4 immersive Toy Story lands with more than 20 attractions and live character interactions available around the world as well as 2 themed hotels. The franchise is the cornerstone of Disney+ with all 4 feature-length films as well as the original short series, Forky Asks a Question, exclusively available on the service. And nearly 30 years after the film debuted, Toy Story is still a key consumer products franchise, generating over $1 billion in annual retail sales. And in just a few weeks, Pixar's Lightyear will tell the origin story of everyone's favorite space ranger when it hits theaters on June 17.\nOf course, Toy Story is just one of our many franchises, but it illustrates our unparalleled ability to bring stories to life in more ways for more people in more places. In fact, our franchise library and capabilities will continue to set us apart even further as we bring our IP to life through next-generation storytelling that is more integrated and connected across consumer touch points.\nAs we look to our second century, that's our mission: to transform entertainment by combining extraordinary storytelling with innovative technology to create an even larger, more connected and magical Disney universe for families and fans around the world.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Christine.\n\nChristine Mary McCarthy\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the fiscal second quarter were $1.08, an increase of $0.29 versus the prior year quarter. We continue to be pleased with our financial results with total segment operating income increasing by 50% versus the prior year quarter and by over 80% year-to-date. Our Parks, Experiences and Products segment continued to show strong signs of growth and recovery as operating income increased by nearly $2.2 billion year-over-year to approximately $1.8 billion. Growth was primarily driven by our domestic parks, which were open for the entire quarter. In the prior year, Walt Disney World was open, but Disneyland was closed for the entire quarter.\nWe continue to be pleased with the overall demand and attendance trends at our domestic parks. In fact, there were many days in the quarter where we saw demand exceed 2019 levels. However, we are continuing to control attendance through our reservation system with an eye on delivering a quality guest experience. As Bob mentioned earlier, per capita guest spending at our domestic parks increased by over 40% versus Q2 of fiscal 2019 and by 20% versus Q2 of fiscal 2021 with increases across the board on admissions, food and beverage and merchandise.\nLooking ahead to the third quarter. Our forward-looking demand pipeline at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland remains robust. And while attendance from international visitation is still in the early days of recovery, we are beginning to see some improvements. We are also thrilled that as of the end of March, all of our domestic resorts are now open, a major milestone as we continue to move through the impacts of the pandemic.\nAt our international parks, operating results improved versus the prior year due to growth at Disneyland Paris, which was open in Q2 and closed during the prior year quarter. This was partially offset by lower results at Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disney, both of which were impacted by COVID-related closures in the quarter.\nConsumer Products operating income increased in the quarter, reflecting higher sales of merchandise based on several of our iconic franchises, including Mickey and Minnie, Spider-Man, Star Wars and Disney Princess.\nMoving on to the Media & Entertainment Distribution segment. Second quarter operating income decreased by approximately $900 million versus the prior year as revenue growth of about $1.2 billion, primarily driven by Direct-to-Consumer was more than offset by higher expenses, including programming and production expenses at Linear Networks and Direct-to-Consumer, which came roughly in line with the guidance we gave last quarter. At our Linear Networks business, operating income in the quarter was $2.8 billion or roughly flat versus the prior year as modest growth at our domestic channels was offset by a decline at our international channels.\nDomestically, higher operating income at Broadcasting was partially offset by lower results at Cable. Broadcasting results benefited year-over-year from affiliate revenue growth in addition to higher advertising revenue due to the timing of the Academy Awards, which aired in Q2 this year versus Q3 last year. These impacts were partially offset by higher programming and production costs also driven by the timing of the Academy Awards.\nAt Cable, lower operating income versus the prior year was primarily due to an increase in programming and production costs. The largest component of the increased cost was driven by 4 additional NFL games versus the prior year, consisting of 3 regular season games as well as the return of the Pro Bowl. These impacts were partially offset by growth in cable advertising and affiliate revenue. Advertising revenue at ESPN increased by over 30% in the quarter, and third quarter-to-date domestic cash advertising sales at ESPN are currently pacing up significantly benefiting from a return to a pre-COVID NBA schedule that is driving increased viewership and pricing. Total domestic affiliate revenue increased by 5% in the quarter. This was primarily driven by 7 points of growth from higher rates, partially offset by a 3-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers.\nOperating income at our international channels decreased versus the prior year, driven by lower affiliate revenue and an increase in programming and production costs, partially offset by advertising revenue growth. At Direct-to-Consumer, operating losses widened to almost $900 million due to higher losses at Disney+ and ESPN+ and lower operating income at Hulu. The higher losses at our DTC services were largely driven by higher programming and production expenses, in line with what we noted in our guidance last quarter.\nAt Disney+, programming and production costs grew along with marketing and technology costs to support our growth around the world, partially offset by higher subscription revenue. We ended the quarter with nearly 138 million global paid Disney+ subscribers, reflecting close to 8 million net additions from Q1. A little over half of those net adds were from Disney+ Hotstar, which benefited from the start of the new IPL season towards the end of the second quarter. Internationally, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, we added over 2 million paid subscribers versus the first quarter with Latin America being the strongest contributor, driven by growth of the Combo+ offering.\nDomestically, net adds of approximately 1.5 million reflect in part the success of tentpole content releases, including Turning Red and Moon Knight as well as the strength of our bundled and multiproduct offerings. ESPN+ ended Q2 with 22.3 million paid subscribers, a net increase of about 1 million versus Q1. Operating results decreased compared to the prior year due to higher sports programming costs and lower pay-per-view income, partially offset by subscription revenue growth. And at Hulu, which ended the second quarter with 45.6 million paid subscribers, higher subscription and advertising revenues versus the prior year were more than offset by higher programming and production, marketing and technology costs.\nMoving on to content sales, licensing and other. Results decreased by approximately $300 million versus the prior year, driven by lower TV and SVOD results, which we discussed in our guidance last quarter, in addition to a decrease in home entertainment results. As a reminder, these impacts are deliberately aligned with our strategic decision to utilize our content on our own direct-to-consumer services.\nBefore I touch on a few things that we'd like you to keep in mind for the back half of the fiscal year, I'll quickly note 2 other relevant items for the second quarter. We recognized a revenue reversal of $1 billion related to the early termination of content licensing agreements with a customer in order to make that content available on our own direct-to-consumer services. Because substantially all of the consideration we received was recognized as revenue at the time that content was originally made available in previous years, we've recorded amounts to terminate the agreement net of remaining amounts of deferred revenue as a revenue reversal.\nFinally, a note on the impact of some tax-related items on our Q2 EPS. Our diluted earnings per share, excluding certain items of $1.08, includes an adverse impact of approximately $0.11 due to the impact of higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings, including the impact of a recent change in U.S. tax regulations. It's worth mentioning that while our annual effective tax rate has generally been correlated with the U.S. statutory rate, there are many complex puts and takes in any given period, which can lead to these variances quarter-to-quarter. And we currently expect the full year tax rate could remain somewhat elevated above the U.S. statutory rate.\nNow as it relates to the third quarter and the second half of fiscal 2022. At DPEP, closures at our Asia theme parks could adversely impact operating income in the third quarter by up to approximately $350 million versus the prior year. As a reminder, Hong Kong Disneyland was closed for the first 3 weeks of the quarter, Shanghai Disney has been closed quarter-to-date, and we do not yet have visibility to a reopening date.\nAs we continue to strategically prioritize leveraging our content for our own services, we expect content sales, licensing and other operating results to decrease in the third quarter by approximately $150 million to $200 million versus the prior year. The expected decrease is primarily driven by declines in content licensing along with a continued decline in home entertainment results.\nDirect-to-Consumer programming and production costs in Q3 are expected to increase by more than $900 million year-over-year, reflecting higher original content expense at Disney+ and Hulu, increased sports rights costs and higher programming fees at Hulu Live. At Disney+, while we still expect higher net adds in the second half of the year versus the first half, it's worth mentioning that we did have a stronger-than-expected first half of the year. Additionally, note that some of the Eastern European markets we're launching in towards the end of Q3, including Poland, are in regions being impacted by geopolitical factors.\nAs it relates to content spend, we previously stated that we expect fiscal year 2022 cash content spend to total as much as $33 billion. We've adjusted that amount to as much as $32 billion to reflect a slightly slower cadence of spending than anticipated during the first half of the year. Note that we are still expecting a strong content slate in the back half of the year. And as Bob mentioned, we are confident in our long-term subscriber guidance of 230 million to 260 million Disney+ subs by fiscal 2024. We also still expect that Disney+ will achieve profitability in fiscal 2024.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back to Alexia, and we would be happy to take your questions.\n\nAlexia Skouras Quadrani\n\nSVP of IR, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThank you, Christine. We are happy to be back here in person for this call, but to make it easier, I will help direct the questions. (Operator Instructions) And with that, operator, we're ready for the first question.",

Welcome to The Walt Disney Company's First Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised today's conference may be recorded. (Operator Instructions) I'd now like to hand the conference over to Jen Ketnick, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Walt Disney Company. Please go ahead.\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nGood afternoon, and it's my pleasure to welcome everyone to The Walt Disney Company's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast and we'll post a transcript of this call to our website.\nJoining me today are Bob Chapek, Disney's Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we'll be happy to take some of your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.\n\nRobert A. Chapek\n\nCEO & Director, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, Jen, and good afternoon, everyone. As we begin the final year of The Walt Disney Company's first century, I am pleased to share our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, starting with the highlights.\nOur adjusted EPS of $1.06 is up from $0.32 a year ago. Our Domestic Parks and Resorts achieved all-time revenue and operating income records despite the Omicron surge. And our streaming services ended Q1 with 196.4 million total subscriptions after adding 70.4 million in the quarter, including 11.8 million Disney+ subscribers. I'll share more about those items shortly. But first, I want to talk about this unique moment in the history of The Walt Disney Company.\nIt is perhaps fitting that our 100th anniversary comes at a time of significant change for us and our industry. In the midst of a global pandemic, fast-changing consumer expectations and a leadership transition, we reimagined our Parks business, substantially increased our investment in content creation and executed a reorganization that will facilitate our ongoing transformation. Each of those actions has helped set the stage for our second century, and as we approach that remarkable milestone, I am filled with optimism.\nWe have the world's most creative storytelling engine, an unmatched collection of brands and franchises and an ability to tell stories that form deep emotional connections with audiences. We have a portfolio of distribution platforms, including powerful and growing streaming services. We have diverse revenue streams that span business models and industries, but which all are interconnected to create entertainment's most powerful synergy machine.\nWe have the country's top news organization and the most trusted brand for following sports and our theme parks continue to be the most magical places on earth. In short, our collection of assets and platforms, creative capabilities and unique place and the cultural site guys give me great confidence that we will continue to define entertainment for the next 100 years.\nTo carry through on that promise, we will be guided by 3 strategic pillars: storytelling excellence, innovation and audience focus. Storytelling excellence is, of course, dependent on having excellent storytellers. I am thrilled to share that our legacy of being home to the most accomplished leaders in the industry will continue, as nearly all of our top creative executives have recently renewed, extended or signed new contracts. I could not be more excited to continue working with these creative powerhouses.\nThe quality content from our teams was recognized just yesterday with a fantastic 23 Oscar nominations, including 3 of the 5 best animated feature films: Pixar's Luca; Walt Disney Animation's Raya and the Last Dragon; and our newest franchise, Walt Disney Animation's Encanto, which received 3 nominations. Summer of Soul was recognized in the best documentary category, and Nightmare Alley and Westside Story both received best picture nominations. As you may have seen earlier today, we announced Westside Story will debut in most Disney+ markets on March 2 and we can't wait for our subscribers to see this incredible film.\nIn Q1, our studios took us deeper into the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Eternals and the Disney+ original series, Hawkeye. And returned us to that galaxy far, far away with another Disney+ original series of Book of Boba Fett. Our general entertainment teams also continued to produce programming of the highest quality. In fact, last year, our general entertainment team produced nearly 1/4 of the industry's best review shows. And Q1 saw 10 of their shows achieved a 100% critic score on Rotten Tomatoes. That includes Avid Elementary, the first Freshman Broadcast comedy to earn the 100% certified fresh score since ABC's own Modern Family in 2009.\nOur success in branded storytelling is, of course, no secret. However, it's often lost that the depth, breadth and quality of our general entertainment content is also a driving force behind the success of our streaming services. In fact, 6 of the 10 most watched programs across our services are general entertainment titles produced by our own team. And general entertainment is an increasingly powerful driver of engagement in most of our international markets where such content is already included in our service under the Star brand.\nGoing forward, integrating more owned general entertainment into our services, especially Disney+, will be a priority. In fact, just today, we added episodes of Grown-ish, Blackish and the Wonder Years to our domestic Disney+ service. Rounding out our content focus is, of course, sports. Sporting events continue to be the most powerful draw in television accounting for 95 of the 100 most watched live broadcast in 2021, and ESPN once again set the bar this quarter with live games across each of our 4 major U.S. sports, including the revolutionary Monday Night with Peyton and Eli. And I am pleased to announce that we have expanded our agreement with Peyton Manning and its Omaha productions company to extend our relationship through the 2024 NFL season, and we'll add alternative presentations for UFC golf and college football events for each of the next 3 years.\nWhile multiplatform television and streaming will continue to be the foundation of sports coverage for the immediate future, we believe the opportunity for The Walt Disney Company goes well beyond these channels. It extends to sports betting, gaming and the metaverse. In fact, that's what excites us, the opportunity to build a sports machine akin to our franchise flywheel that enables audiences to experience, connect with and become actively engaged with our favorite sporting events, stories, teams and players.\nTurning to distribution results. The continued growth of our streaming services was certainly a standout. Our success at Disney+ this quarter was not the result of any one item, but instead a combination of organic growth and powerful new content, our strategic decision to include the Disney bundle with all Hulu Live subscriptions and new market launches. The remainder of this fiscal year will feature compelling Disney+ originals from across our brands and franchises, beginning with Pixar's Turning Red and Marvel Studios Moon Night in March.\nAnd the back half of FY '22 will feature a truly stunning array of content, including 2 Star Wars series: Andor, and the highly anticipated Obi-Wan Kenobi, which I am excited to announce will premiere on May 25. We'll debut 2 Marvel series, Ms. Marvel and; fresh new shorts from Disney Animation and Pixar, featuring the worlds of Big Hero 6 and Cars; a live-action reimagining of the Disney Classic Pinocchio, starring Tom Hanks as Geppeto; and one of the most anticipated sequels in some time, especially in the Chapek household, Hocus Pocus 2. As I've said before, we continue to manage our services for the long term and maintain confidence in our guidance of 230 million to 260 million total paid Disney+ subscribers globally by the end of fiscal 2024.\nChristine will provide more detail into our theatrical results. However, I want to reiterate that we continue to see value in the moviegoing experience, especially for big franchise blockbusters. And given the performance of titles like Spider-Man: No Way Home, we are looking forward to kicking off our summer slate with another Marvel franchise film, Dr. Strange and the Multiverse of Madness. That said, audiences will be our North Star as we determine how our content is distributed. And we do not subscribe to the belief that theatrical distribution is the only way to build a Disney franchise.\nThis quarter, audience has proved us right, as Encanto became a phenomenon within days of its arrival on Disney+ after families continued reluctance to return to theaters resulted in a muted theatrical performance. With outstanding music from Lin-Manuel Miranda, it became the fastest titled across 200 million hours viewed on Disney+ and took social media by storm. People around the world express their fandom through their own content and conversation and the Encanto hashtag has been viewed more than 11 billion times.\nThe sound track, which debuted at #197 on the Billboard 200 Chart reached #1 shortly after debuting on Disney+ and 8 of the film songs hit the Hot 100 Chart, including We Don't Talk About Bruno, which became the first Disney song to reach #1 since A Whole New World in 1993.\nAt the same time, sales of Encanto merchandise defied traditional post-holiday declines and actually increased following the film's release on Disney+ on Christmas Eve and guests at Disney California Adventure have loved saying Mirabel in real life. These results are exactly what you would expect from the launch of a new Disney franchise and we are thrilled that Disney+ was the catalyst. We are more confident than ever in this platform as a content service, a franchise engine and is a venue for the next generation of Disney storytelling.\nFinally, I could not be more pleased with the performance of our Parks, Experiences and Products segment, which posted its second best quarter of all time. Over the last several years, we've transformed the guest experience by investing in new storytelling and groundbreaking technology and the records that our domestic parks are the direct result of this investment. From new franchise-based lands and attractions to craveable food and beverage offerings, the must-have character merchandise, there is more great Disney storytelling infused into every aspect of a visit to our parks than ever before.\nAt the same time, we're giving guests new tools to personalize their visits and spend less time in line and more time having fun. While we anticipated these products would be popular, we have been blown away by the reception. In the quarter, more than 1/3 of domestic park guests purchased either GE+, Lightning Lane or both. That number rose to more than 50% during the holiday period.\nWhile demand was strong throughout the quarter at both domestic sites, our reservation system enabled us to strategically manage attendance. In fact, their stellar performance was achieved at lower attendance levels than 2019. As we return to a more normalized environment, we look forward to more fully capitalizing on the extraordinary demand for our parks along with the already realized yield benefits that took shape this quarter.\nAnd we, of course, will continue to invest in the guest experience. I am personally looking forward to Star Wars: Galactic Star Cruiser at Walt Disney World, a 2-night adventure into the most immersive Star Wars story ever created. We are pleased with demand for this premium groundbreaking experience, which will welcome guests starting on March 1.\nLater this summer, we will debut an innovative new rollercoaster at Epcot, Guardians of the Galaxy Cosmic Rewind and Open Avengers Campus at Disneyland Paris, where the iconic queen jet landed a few weeks ago ahead of the resort's 30th anniversary celebrations.\nI want to close by thanking our 195,000 employees for bringing Disney magic to audiences and guests around the world, especially in times like these, when the world needs it most. Our company is truly extraordinary, and I am honored to work with the most talented team in the industry to create the next generation of Disney stories and experiences through our focus on storytelling excellence, innovation and our audience.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Christine.\n\nChristine Mary McCarthy\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, The Walt Disney Company\n\nThanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone.\nExcluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.06, an increase of $0.74 from the prior year quarter. Fiscal 2022 is off to a good start as evidenced by our first quarter results and our continued progress towards more normalized operations across our businesses.\nAt Park's Experiences and Products, operating income was up $2.6 billion year-over-year as all of our parks and resorts around the world were open for the entirety of the fiscal first quarter. In the prior year quarter, Walt Disney World Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort were open for the entire quarter, while Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Disneyland Paris were each open for a limited number of weeks and Disneyland Resort was closed for the entire quarter.\nAt our domestic parks, we were very pleased with the strong levels of demand we saw from both Walt Disney World and Disneyland. And as Bob mentioned, our reservation system has allowed us to strategically manage attendance. Overall, attendance trends at our domestic parks continued to strengthen in the quarter with Walt Disney World and Disneyland Q1 attendance up double digits versus Q4, in part reflecting holiday seasonality.\nPer capita spending at our domestic parks was up more than 40% versus fiscal first quarter 2019 driven by a more favorable guest and ticket mix, higher food, beverage and merchandise spending and contributions from Genie+ and Lightning Light. Putting these factors together, our domestic Parks and Resorts delivered Q1 revenue and operating income exceeding pre-pandemic levels, even as we continue managing attendance to responsibly address ongoing COVID considerations.\nLooking ahead to Q2, our demand pipeline for domestic guests at Walt Disney World and Disneyland remained strong, benefiting from our 50th anniversary celebration at Walt Disney World and new attractions and experiences at both parks. At International Parks, a profitable first quarter reflected improving trends at Disneyland Paris. We also saw improved results at Hong Kong Disneyland although the resort is now temporarily closed in response to a resurgence in COVID cases in the region. We expect International Parks will continue to be impacted by COVID-related volatility for the remainder of Q2.\nMoving on to our Media and Entertainment Distribution segment. First quarter operating income decreased by more than $600 million versus the prior year as revenue growth across our lines of business was more than offset by higher programming and production costs. Revenue growth in the quarter was primarily driven by increased subscription fees from our direct-to-consumer services. We also delivered record advertising revenues for the segment as we continue to see strong advertiser demand for our live sports and streaming and digital businesses.\nTurning to our results by line of business. At Linear Networks, you may recall that we guided to a decrease in operating income of nearly $500 million for Q1 versus the prior year. Operating income of $1.5 billion came in better than expected, primarily driven by our international channels, which I'll discuss in a minute.\nAt our domestic channels, both Broadcasting and Cable operating income decreased in the first quarter versus the prior year. Lower results at Broadcasting were impacted by an adverse comparison to prior year political advertising revenue at our owned television stations, as we noted in the guidance we gave last quarter. At Cable, the year-over-year decrease in operating income reflected higher programming and production costs and increased marketing spend, partially offset by increases in advertising and affiliate revenue.\nGrowth in advertising revenue was driven by ESPN as we benefited from the start of a normalized NBA calendar and increased viewership for football. ESPN advertising revenue in the first quarter was up 14% versus the prior year and second quarter-to-date domestic cash advertising sales at ESPN are currently pacing up. Total domestic affiliate revenue increased by 2% in the quarter. This was primarily driven by 6 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a 4-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers.\nOperating income at our international channels decreased slightly versus the prior year. These results came in more than $200 million better than our prior guidance primarily due to lower programming and production costs as well as better-than-expected advertising and affiliate revenues.\nAt Direct-to-Consumer, first quarter operating results decreased by $127 million year-over-year, driven by higher losses at Disney+ and ESPN+ partially offset by improved results at Hulu. I'll note that beginning this quarter, we are providing disclosure on our programming and production expenses by service as well as additional detail for Disney+ in our 10-Q.\nOperating losses at Disney+ increased versus the prior year as growth in subscription revenue was more than offset by higher programming, technology and marketing costs. We ended the quarter with nearly 130 million global paid Disney+ subscribers, reflecting over 11 million net additions from Q4.\nTaking a look at subscriber growth by region. We added 4.1 million paid domestic Disney+ subscribers, including a benefit of approximately 2 million incremental subscribers from our strategic decision to include Disney+ and ESPN+ as part of a Hulu Live subscription. In international markets, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, we added 5.1 million paid subscribers, primarily driven by growth in Asia Pacific and European markets. I'll note that growth in Asia included the benefit of new market launches in South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong in the quarter. Finally, we were able to resume growth in Disney+ Hotstar markets with 2.6 million paid subscriber additions in the quarter.\nOverall, we are pleased with Disney+ subscriber growth in the quarter and are looking forward to new market launches and a strong content slate later this year. As I've previously shared, we don't anticipate that subscriber growth will necessarily be linear from quarter-to-quarter, and we continue to expect growth in the back half of the fiscal year to exceed growth in the first half.\nAt ESPN+, we ended the first quarter with over 21 million paid subscribers versus 17 million in Q4. Results decreased compared to the prior year as growth in subscription revenue was more than offset by higher sports programming costs driven by the NHL and La Liga. And at Hulu, higher subscription revenues versus the prior year were partially offset by higher programming and production costs driven by increased affiliate fees for live TV.\nHulu ended the first quarter with 45.3 million paid subscribers, inclusive of 4.3 million subscribers to our Hulu Live digital MVPD service.\nMoving on to content sales, licensing and other. Results decreased in the first quarter versus the prior year to an operating loss of $98 million, driven by lower theatrical results and higher film impairments, partially offset by improved TV SVOD results. As I noted last quarter, while theaters have generally reopened, we are still experiencing a prolonged recovery to the theatrical exhibition, particularly for certain genres of films, including non-branded general entertainment and family-focused animation.\nThis dynamic contributed to increased losses in the quarter as we released more titles in Q1 this year versus the prior year, resulting in lower theatrical results. This was partially offset by income from our coproduction of Spider-Man: No Way Home.\nAs we look ahead, we would like to give you some context around 2 items that may impact our second quarter results. First, as we continue to increase our investment in content, we expect programming and production costs at DMED to increase versus the prior year, primarily driven by Direct-to-Consumer and Linear Networks. At Direct-to-Consumer, we expect programming and production expenses to increase by approximately $800 million to $1 billion, including programming fees for Hulu Live. At Linear networks, we expect programming and production expenses to increase by approximately $500 million, reflecting factors including COVID-related timing shifts.\nWe aired 4 additional NFL games at the start of the current quarter. And as a reminder, the Academy Awards will be held in Q2 of this year, while they fell into Q3 of the prior year. Second, at content sales, licensing and other, a difficult Q2 comparison to prior year TV and SVOD program sales is due in part to our strategic decision to hold more of our owned and produced content for our direct-to-consumer services. As a result, we expect operating income to be adversely impacted by more than $200 million versus the prior year quarter.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Jen, and we would be happy to take your questions.\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nThanks, Christine. As we transition to the Q&A, let me note that since we are not physically together this afternoon, I will do my best to moderate the Q&A by directing your questions to the appropriate executive. (Operator Instructions) And with that, operator, we're ready for the first question.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call may be recorded.\nI would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Emily Duncan, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Strategic Initiatives. You may begin.\n\nEmily Duncan\n\nThank you, Lydia. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Constellation Energy Corporation's third quarter earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Joe Dominguez, Constellation's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Eggers, Constellation's Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Constellation's senior management team, who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, all of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Constellation's website.\nThe earnings release and other matters, which we discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates regarding Constellation and its subsidiaries that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Constellation's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and other circumstances and considerations that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations.\nToday's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures.\nI'll now turn the call over to Joe.\n\nJoseph Dominguez\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Emily, and thanks Lydia, our operator this morning for getting us started. Thanks to all of you for your continued support, for your interest in the company and for joining us today at the end of a very busy week for all of you.\nAs always, I want to start by thanking the incredible women and men at Constellation for delivering another quarter of strong operational and financial performance. Powering America is a 24/7 business, and our continued success derives from the simple fact that our folks are exceptional at what they do. This summer, our nuclear plants delivered near-perfect reliability. Our power fleet of gas and renewables answered the bell when dispatched and our commercial and retail teams have once again proven why they are some of the best in the business.\nI'm going to turn to Slide 5 to get us started with our financial results. We delivered third quarter GAAP earnings of $2.97 per share and adjusted operating earnings of $3.04 per share, higher than the third quarter of last year. Our commercial and generation teams delivered outstanding performance and the stock has performed tremendously again this year, benefiting you, our owners. But this great performance also benefits our people through stock compensation plans that we have aligned with your interest as owners. This year, because of the magnificent performance over a number of years, these plans are triggered and create some nonrecurring O&M headwinds that Dan will cover in his section.\nBut notwithstanding these onetime events, what I don't want you to miss is the continued growth and strong performance of our business. On the data economy front, our team has never been more active with serious and knowledgeable customers. I know in the last call, I hinted that we are far along on a transaction, making use of a baseball metaphor that we were past the seventh inning stretch. That remains true, and we continue to progress. But as we have recently witnessed in real life baseball and as I'm sure, Dodgers and Blue Jays fans, especially can attest some of the later innings can seemingly drag out. Nonetheless, we're confident in our ability to complete these transactions, and we will let you know just as soon as we can.\nBut perhaps more important to you than any set of transactions is what we are seeing in the broader data economy market. Our general observation is that the market is hotter now than ever. And the real big difference we're seeing is buyer maturity. In the earliest days, we had a great deal of interest from a lot of customers. But I think it's fair to say in retrospect that many customers in the early days were exploring options, kicking tires, as some might say. Sometimes, they were wondering whether nuclear energy would fit into their own sustainability plans. And even the most serious buyers were still on the shallow part of the learning curve when it came to understanding our markets and the interconnection of really large [ loads ].\nToday, we're seeing a far more sophisticated and aggressive customer walk through our door. They have done deals. They understand pricing and term. They know they want nuclear. They understand the accounting and the collateral needs of a large transaction. They understand the interconnection process. Most importantly, they walk in our door with a strong understanding of what we can offer and what we need to secure on behalf of our owners and therefore, had to best execute.\nAt the end of the day, we are often paced by the speed of interconnection in these deals. But in terms of our own commercial terms, the negotiations move much more quickly than ever before.\nNow with regard to the interconnection process, we were encouraged to see the letter from Secretary Wright to FERC, ordering FERC to initiate a rule-making proceeding to develop a standard approach for quickly connecting large loads to the transmission system. It was a clear message from the administration. If America is going to maintain a leadership position in artificial intelligence, we need practical reforms to make it easier to connect large loads to the grid. As you know, this is something we have been saying for a long time. We look forward to FERC's quick action. They have a docket in PJM that is complete with evidence and with arguments. It's ready for decision.\nTurning to other developments this quarter. We reached a landmark agreement with the state of Maryland and other key stakeholders that lays out the path for the continued operation of Conowingo Dam for the next 50 years. On Slide 5, you can see a picture of the stakeholders that gathered together with Governor Moore and others to celebrate this outcome. You see the handsome guy in the middle of the photograph and to my right, is Governor Moore. This was a win-win outcome. It brought together previously opposed coalitions to create a long-term solution that helps and protects the bay, while ensuring the continued operations of a vital source of Maryland Clean Energy for the region. I want to thank Governor Moore and Attorney General Brown for their leadership. We look forward to continuing to work with them and other elected officials to explore energy options for Maryland and the region.\nLastly, Calpine remains on track to close in the fourth quarter. The DOJ is our final approval, and we presently are not seeing any effect on their work from the government shutdown. We're looking forward to getting the transaction closed, and to start working as a combined company to bring coast-to-coast solutions for our customers and to create value for you, our owners and for our communities.\nTurning to Slide 6. The momentum and support for nuclear has never been stronger. Nearly 3/4 of the public now supports nuclear energy. But it doesn't stop there. 9 out of 10 people think that the licenses on existing nuclear plants should be extended, and you know we're doing that work. And 2 out of 3 people believe we should be building more nuclear plants in the U.S. This is a tremendous level of public support. The public gets it and so do the policymakers. I'd point out to you that just in the last 10 days, the Trump administration and Westinghouse announced a public private partnership with the goal of building 10 gigawatts of new nuclear reactors. And the government is pledging $80 billion to help ensure it happens.\nOur nation recently announced a trade deal with Japan and the centerpiece of that was the investment of more capital in nuclear and the data economy. And then finally, Next Era, a company known for renewables announced the restart of Duane Arnold, all enabled by another contract with hyperscalers. And that's just what happened in the last 10 days, and it builds upon the bipartisan support that we've seen for nuclear tax credits that not only support new nuclear, but crucially support the existing fleet so that it could continue to operate, upgrade and relicense.\nStates are also leading the way through ZEC and other programs to ensure that clean, reliable nuclear power continues to benefit their citizens. Under Governor Hochul's leadership in New York, the state is looking to build 1 gigawatt of new nuclear built on a foundation of the new -- of the existing nuclear fleet that has been so successful for New York. The Public Service Commission has called for the extension of the ZEC programs, and we are involved in that proceeding. All of these developments are wonderful and a great affirmation of what I think has been the core principle of this company from its beginning.\nNuclear energy is the most valuable and important energy commodity in the world today, and Constellation produces more of it than any other private sector company in the world. But our advantage doesn't just stop with the existing fleet. I think the most valuable asset that we have, that presently isn't fully recognized is the nuclear sites themselves. This is the place where nuclear was built. It's the place where we have the infrastructure, the land, the capability and the talent to build the next generation of nuclear plants. These land assets that Constellation owns more than anyone provides unique value that is difficult, if not impossible, to replicate. And what it means to me is that the path to new nuclear in many places is going to walk through Constellation.\nTurning to Slide 7. Constellation has had an excellent track record, as you know, of working with stakeholders to find solutions. And we once again stepped up to meet the needs of the grid by answering Maryland's call with options for the state to consider that would bring new dispatchable generation resources to the state as well as the continued operation and expansion of the world's best 24/7 clean energy resources. As part of the Next Generation Energy Act of 2025, the Maryland Public Service Commission solicited applications for dispatchable generation and large capacity resources that could proceed through an expedited process known as a CPCN or Certificate of Public Necessity. In response, we're providing Maryland options to potentially bring up to 800 megawatts of battery storage and more than 700 megawatts of low-carbon natural gas to help Maryland meet its future energy needs.\nBeing part of the solution is who we are at Constellation, and no other company is doing more to bring and secure power for our communities than Constellation. As you know, we've committed to bring 835 megawatts through the restart of the Crane Clean Energy Center. We continue to provide nearly 600 megawatts from the relicensing of Conowingo that we spoke about a moment ago. We are bringing 160 megawatts of new nuclear uprates online at Byron and Braidwood beginning next year, and we're doing far more than this.\nAs we talked about last quarter, we're collaborating with customers to pioneer about 1,000 megawatts of AI-enabled demand response capacity. We're targeting 500 megawatts under contract this year and another 500 next year. And we have identified an additional 900 megawatts of uprates at our sites, including 190 megawatts at Calvert Cliffs in Maryland.\nConstellation has and will continue to support reliability everywhere and operate in our competitive markets, effectively and performing well. And we have seen that over a decade since deregulation with generators, the competitive market has provided the best solutions to customers.\nWith that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan for the financial results.\n\nDaniel L. Eggers\n\nAnalyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Beginning on Slide 8, we earned $2.97 per share in GAAP earnings and $3.04 per share in adjusted operating earnings in the third quarter, which was $0.30 per share higher than last year. In the third quarter, we saw fewer nuclear outage days, both planned and unplanned compared to the same period last year. These results reflect the outstanding efforts of our teams whose dedication and skill have driven higher generation volumes and help us operate more efficiently than ever with lower O&M expenses on a year-over-year basis.\nLast quarter marked the first period where we recognized a full 3 months of higher PJM capacity revenues following the breakout 2025, 2026 capacity auction. With our plants currently near or above the top end of the PTC zone, the non-CMC units captured almost all of the benefit of higher capacity prices. This capacity upside is partially offset by a reduction in PTC revenues compared to last year when more of our plants were in the PTC zone. Additionally, ZEC prices in both the Midwest and New York were lower compared to the third quarter of last year. As a reminder, for the full year 2025, our Illinois ZEC revenues are about the same as last year, but the timing is different since we booked banked ZECs last quarter, whereas in 2024, more of the ZECs were booked across the quarters.\nMoving to Slide 9. Our nuclear team continues to execute at levels of reliability and with a commitment to excellence that yields differentiated operating performance. During the third quarter, they once again hit that mark with a fleet-wide capacity factor of 96.8%. Our team consistently delivers a capacity factor about 4% higher than the industry average, which at our fleet size is the equivalent to having another reactor's worth of power on a full year basis.\nOur renewable and natural gas fleets performed near plan during the quarter, with renewable energy capture at 96.8% and power dispatch match at 95.5%. Consistent, reliable and excellent operations across our generation fleet, especially during the critical summer months, are a testament to the thousands of tasks and hours of planning, our teams complete on an ongoing basis to make sure we can meet our commitment to provide clean, firm and reliable power.\nTurning to Slide 10. Our commercial team continues to meet the needs of our customers, delivering tailored energy solutions that meet their evolving needs. This collaborative approach is driving strong performance with sales margins above the long-term averages we use in our forecast and above the margins we anticipated at the beginning of this year. The renewal rates for both power and gas remained strong. The quarter-over-quarter decline we experienced in our C&I gas renewal rate is almost entirely driven by the loss of one very large low-margin customer and expected part of the normal ebbs and flows of the business.\nOur relationships with long-standing customers remain strong and our scale and ability to deliver products to meet the needs of our customers remains a competitive advantage.\nContinuing on Slide 11. We are narrowing our full year stand-alone adjusted operating earnings guidance range to $9.05 to $9.45 per share. The commercial and generation businesses have had another outstanding year. Our commercial team's ability to optimize the portfolio and deliver value beyond targets is a key driver again this year. Additionally, the world-class operating performance of our nuclear fleet has also contributed upside to our gross margin. This operational strength reinforces the reliability and consistency of our company's earnings profile.\nOur stock has appreciated over 50% year-to-date, significantly benefiting our owners, but also creating O&M headwinds from stock compensation, which is offsetting much of the gross margin favorability this year.\nFinally, as a reminder, our revised guidance is stand-alone to Constellation and does not include any impacts from the Calpine transaction.\nSpeaking of guidance and looking to 2026 with the Calpine deal, we get a lot of questions on what to expect. We plan to provide combined company guidance and modeling tools on or around our typical fourth quarter call in late February. We expect to fold Calpine into our current base and enhanced EPS constructs. And as you all revisit your models in the interim, let me remind you when we announced the transaction in January, we provided preliminary expectations for EPS and free cash flow accretion. Those expectations were based on forward power prices and spreads that look relatively similar to today despite the market having moved around a lot since last December.\nCalpine also has a history of locking in sales or hedging its fleet like other generators to ensure meeting its financial commitments. So near-term open exposure is relatively limited. And the guidance included our view of expected synergies, which, as we talked about, we're not a major value driver for this deal, but were anticipated based on what we knew about putting the 2 companies together, and recognizing Calpine was long held by private equity outside of the public markets. It also reflected estimates for accounting policy harmonization adjustments and purchase accounting with fair value calculations, which are inherently difficult to model from your seats.\nWe will fill in all the details when we get to early spring. But I know it has been a little while since the deal was announced. So we thought a quick refresh back to our original conversation would be helpful for all of you.\nTurning to Slide 12. In September, we executed a renewal and upsizing of our credit facilities, positioning us for the close of the Calpine transaction. Combining the expanded revolver with the other liquidity tools that we use, we'll have $14 billion of liquidity after the deal closes, underscoring the strength of our balance sheet and the strategic flexibility afforded by our investment-grade credit rating allowing us to move forward with confidence.\nWe're also asked regularly about our capital allocation strategy after the deal closes, and it remains unchanged. With the significant free cash flow the combined company is expected to generate, our priorities remain clear. We will maintain a strong balance sheet and high investment-grade credit ratings targeting a return to our metrics by year-end 2027, deliver at least 10% annual dividend growth, pursue growth opportunities that meet our double-digit unlevered return threshold, and return capital to shareholders with $600 million remaining on our existing buyback program.\nOur goal remains the same: to deliver long-term value for our owners. The philosophy behind our capital allocation strategy is consistent even as we evolve into a larger, more diversified company with even greater opportunities.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back to Joe for his closing remarks.\n\nJoseph Dominguez\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Dan. So folks Constellation performed very well during the third quarter and throughout the year. But we've got 2 months basically to finish it up. And so we've got a lot of work going on in the business, and we remain focused on closing the Calpine transaction and bringing together these 2 great companies. We're looking forward to proving that 1 plus 1 will equal 3. And that the size and scale of the combined company will deliver value for our customers and for our nation that neither company could have done on its own.\nWe're working hard to execute transactions with our customers in the data economy. And we're working with the states and regulators to provide sensible solutions for meeting this moment where new generation and new capabilities are going to be needed to allow America to lead as it should on AI.\nConstellation is built on a foundation unlike any other company in the energy sector. That foundation enables us to consistently deliver value to our owners year after year. We generate strong cash flow and base earnings supported by a nuclear production tax credit, which continues to enjoy broad and growing bipartisan support. We have a strong earnings growth profile through the decade, and we are in the middle of strategic transactions or PPAs with hyperscalers, which we expect to complete, which will be additive to both our growth and our base earnings.\nWe benefit uniquely from higher inflation, which causes the PTC floor to automatically adjust and further strengthens the economics of our nuclear fleet. We're well positioned to capture value from the opportunities ahead, selling our megawatts at a premium through long-term contracts with customers, including those in the rapidly expanding data economy, which we've talked about quite a bit during this call.\nAs overall power demand grows and new generation resources are required, our existing fleet is ready to meet the needs with clean, reliable and available today energy, and our land gives us a great opportunity to participate in future development.\nWith that, I look forward to your questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Emily Duncan, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Strategic Initiatives. You may begin.\n\nEmily Duncan\n\nThank you, Tania. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Constellation Energy Corporation's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Leading the call today are Joe Dominguez, Constellation's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Eggers, Constellation's Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Constellation's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks.\nWe issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, all of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Constellation's website. The earnings release and other matters, which we will discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates regarding Constellation and its subsidiaries that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call.\nPlease refer to today's 8-K and Constellation's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and other circumstances and considerations that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures.\nI'll now turn the call over to Joe.\n\nJoseph Dominguez\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Tanya and Emily for Getting started. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call and for your interest in Constellation. I know it's a busy time with all these earnings calls going on around the same time and you guys are hopping from call to call. We appreciate your interest in what we're doing here. Last but not least, I want to thank our team here at Constellation for delivering another strong operational and financial quarter.\nWe always say this, people are the backbone of our success here. I'm really proud of the culture we have built together. It requires constant work and attention, and we're never perfect at it, but our leaders are all over it. They work at it every day. And that's why I'm especially thrilled to start the call by telling you that for the third year in a row, we've been recertified as a great place to work.\nNow I've talked about this before. This is the only certification you get based on the input from your own folks. And when you think about them as customers, as a service leader as we want to be, getting that feedback and their appreciation for what we're trying to do is everything to me.\nNow turning to the quarter and our financial results. We delivered second quarter GAAP earnings of $2.67 per share and adjusted operating earnings of $1.91 per share, improving on last year's second quarter performance. As always, Dan is here and he'll walk through the details. Now as you'll recall, last quarter, we were a bit frustrated by our inability to be in the market buying back shares due to where we were in the Meta Clinton deal process. In fact, to let you in on it, I think we were thinking it was a horse race as to whether we were going to get the call in before the announcement or vice versa.\nNow since the Meta announcement, we have executed $400 million in accelerated repurchases. And like the others we've done, these stock repurchases continue to generate a wonderful return. With long-term contracts like our Meta and Microsoft deals now becoming an ordinary part of our strategy and a normal course of our business, and hopefully, you think we're good at it. We don't have to pause stock repurchases. And to be crystal clear, you shouldn't assume anything about the timing of any new transaction from whether or not we're in the market purchasing shares.\nOutside of our strong financial performance, it's been an exciting time for the company since we last met. We saw the big beautiful bill signed into law, preserving and actually strengthening the nuclear provisions and serve as a continued demonstration of the unique and strong support for nuclear across party lines.\nWe announced that we were bringing the restart of the Crane Clean Energy Center forward into the second half of 2027. I remember when we talked about that, people were skeptical that we would restart in 2028. They were right to be skeptical. We're going to start it in '27. We received New York, Texas and FERC approvals for the Calpine acquisition, and we remain on track to close by the end of the year. And as we just discussed, we announced a 20-year power purchase agreement with Meta for the offtake of Clinton Clean Energy Center to help them meet their clean energy needs.\nThis transaction is a big win for everyone. The PPA ensures that over 1,100 megawatts of emissions-free nuclear energy will be around for decades to come. And it actually allows us to make investments to increase the output and bring even more megawatts to the grid in Southern Illinois at a critical moment for America, let have made this happen. We love the partnership, and I'm hopeful we can continue that partnership.\nBeyond the Clinton transaction, we continue to make very good progress with customers to reach additional agreements to sell our clean, reliable and available megawatts from our nuclear plants. Now look, this is always going to be the part of the call where we get questions. Inevitably, of course, you want to know exactly where we are in every deal. And inevitably, of course, I'm going to tell you that we can't comment on deals until they're done. And even then, we're going to keep some of the terms confidential.\nSo let me try to guide you here with as much as I can say. First, for those of you who are found of the baseball analogy, the described progress, I would simply say that we're in the late innings on one transaction. We're past the seventh inning stretch. We've so take me after the ballpark on that one. And I'd say we're in the middle to early innings on other transactions. But most importantly, from my perspective, we're seeing a continued acceleration of interest from a growing number of entities.\nThe second thing that I'd like you to remember here is that sometimes, you have the pricing and the deal terms done, but you need other things to enable a transaction, specifically in the case of front-of-the-meter deals, interconnection work with the utilities. So if you want to connect the dots here, I think on one transaction, we are well on the way to being done, but are waiting for some inputs from utilities.\nAs we said from the start of the company, clean and reliable megawatts are the most important energy commodity in the world today. Many customers we engage with every day believe the same thing. And that gives us great confidence that we'll be able to continue to transact, whether that be front of the meter or in co-located configure missions. When we announced the Calpine acquisition, we talked about the importance of natural gas' role in the data economy and the reliability of the system.\nAnd notably, in this regard, we were pleased to see Calpine's announcement supporting 190-megawatt data center near the Fat Hill Energy Center in Baski County. We expect to see more of these transactions in the future across the industry. And with respect to Calpine, we think the combination of gas and nuclear gives us a huge competitive advantage. It allows us to provide a differentiated product that combines fast and reliable interconnection at both nuclear and gas sites and the benefits of being able to provide clean and reliable energy product to our customers. Firm, cleaning energy that is priced at a visible rate for 20 years or more if the customer desires it. That's a big deal.\nNow let me shift gears a bit. justifiably given its skill, we talk a lot about data center customers. But you got to remember here that many of our businesses value and buy clean nuclear and that continues to accelerate. This quarter, I'm pleased to announce a significant new carbon-free energy transaction with Comcast, a company that's been a wonderful partner to Constellation for many years. As part of it, Comcast will be supporting upgrades. So again here, in this deal, we see a connection between private customer agreements and our country's objectives of preserving and growing clean and reliable energy.\nAnd finally, as we've talked about before, we see interest from governments. The interest was shown to you with the GSA deal. And while many of you have been grinding through industry calls this week and the last week, you might have missed that the New York Department of Public Service staff released an important white paper calling for a 20-year extension of the ZEC program in New York that covers over 3,000 of our megawatts.\nIn New York, the staff concluded that it's essential that nuclear be preserved to meet its clean energy goals and our facilities be relicensed. You remember that New York was the first state to have a policy to support existing nuclear plants, understanding their importance as clean, firm and reliable. Extending the ZEC program ensures that these plants will be there to support New York for decades to come. We commend the paper to your reading.\nAs I said, it's been an incredibly exciting quarter here at Constellation and in many respects, it's been a historically important quarter. It's a quarter where you see everything we have told you now coming to pass. The customer and bipartisan political support for nuclear getting the big beautiful bill behind us is just huge. Constellation's ability to execute deals has been demonstrated. The importance of reliable natural gas to both the data economy and to America, supporting our Calpine deal is more evident now than ever.\nOur continued ability to grow organically and inorganically through M&A and most importantly, the strength of Constellation's commercial and operational performance, and that's, of course, the foundation for everything we do and why I always start out the calls thanking our great team here.\nLet me turn to Slide 6. The passage of one big beautiful bill was an undisputed win for nuclear power. Now remember here, it was passed by all replicants and it preserved and actually expanded the nuclear credits from the Inflation Reduction Act, a bill that was passed by all Democrats. So it's one of the only things the 2 bills have in common is that it supports existing and new nuclear plants. There's a lot of things we have a hard time agreeing on as a country. And like you, I wish we could find more. But one thing is clear, the benefits of nuclear energy for families, for local communities, for states and the economy as a whole is something that we all can agree on.\nAnd I'd like to thank President Trump and the political leaders on both sides of the aisle for acting to preserve an advanced nuclear power in this country. The bill maintains the critical 45U production tax credits for existing facilities through 2032, and it gives us great confidence that those tax credits will be renewed going into the future. It also preserves the 45 clean energy tax credit for new nuclear and uprates, providing the full credit for projects that begin construction into 2033, and partial credit through 2035, recognizing that new nuclear will take some time to get going. In addition, it adds a new nuclear energy community bonus of 10% on top of the 45 live credit. We expect the Crane Clean Energy Center as well as every one of our uprate projects to qualify for this 10% bonus.\nFinally, the bill also extended the tax provisions that were set to expire with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. And I'll let Dan talk about these additional and significant positive impacts for us. Supportive nuclear from the administration did not stop, as you know, with the legislation. I was very pleased on behalf of the industry to join President Trump in the Oval office when he signed the executive orders. that signaled full support and a clear intention by his administration that they want to preserve and expand nuclear power because it's vital to the economic and national security of the United States.\nThe nuclear EOs rightly focus on common sense initiatives to expand the existing fleet with fast track licensing, increased domestic conversion and enrichment, and accelerate the deployment of new reactors, all while maintaining the NRC's track record of being a responsible regulator that places safety at the top of every consideration. And this administration like many policymakers on both sides of the aisle, those that American Energy is critical to winning the AI race against China.\nThe AI action plan unveiled in July calls for streamlining permitting of data centers and energy infrastructure and developing a grid that could match the pace of AI innovation, we're going to be at the heart of that. But it's not just Republicans who are taking actions to support nuclear, both new and existing. At the end of June, in addition to supporting the continuation of the ZEC program through 2049, which we just talked about, New York Governor Hocol, called for building 1 gigawatt of nuclear in upstate New York to support a reliable and affordable electric grid while providing the necessary 0 mission to achieve a clean energy economy.\nThis follows our work at 9-mile point on an early site permit. And as I've said to all of you before, I think one of the unique advantages we have here at Constellation is the real estate that we own around our existing plants because it just makes sense to us that when we build out new nuclear we're going to build it out in communities that already have all of the infrastructure and the enormous support for the existing plants and most importantly, a talented workforce that could operate the new nuclear units.\nWe're excited to participate. I know it's early innings on this work, but I think it is going to be a signpost for other states. And I'm excited for the opportunities to expand nuclear in places like Maryland, Illinois, Texas and Pennsylvania.\nTo sum this all up, while political and customer sentiment doesn't always follow logic in fact, in this case, it clearly does. Firm, clean, reliable nuclear power is the most important energy commodity in the world today and through Constellation, you, our owners have more of it than anyone. We will do great things together for America.\nTurning to Slide 7. I want to talk a little bit about the PJM capacity auction and what we see going forward. First, before I talk about future auctions, I think it's time to level set a little bit on the past. There's a narrative that's been building up that data centers are entirely responsible for prices going up. You got to remember here that, that narrative is false. Certainly, there's been a rise in demand driven by the growth in the data economy by things like vehicle electrification, by general economic growth and the reindustrialization of America as our nation pursues its America first strategy.\nAll of these things are cumulatively increasing demand and prices will rise through simple supply and demand economics. But the principal reason that we saw a step change in the PJM capacity prices because FERC order changes to the PJM market that were absolutely necessary to address reliability gaps. Why were those changes needed? Well, remember, those changes were needed because the market design that we used to have for tended that we live in a very tail land where all megawatts had equal reliability equal to nuclear.\nWhen the analytical evidence screened at us for many years that some forms of generation are simply more reliable than others. It took longer to effectuate the changes that it should have and the delayed auctions added to the uncertainty, but the design work is completed and the market is working. Already in this last auction, the market cleared 2,700 megawatts of new and operated generation capacity on what was a really short turnaround since the last auction, bringing in more supply to support the growing demand.\nAnd through PJM's RRI process, which Governor Spero and Constellation and many others supported, we know that more than 9 gigawatts of new firm reliable supply will come online by 2032. In addition, we saw more than 300 megawatts of generation participate in the auction rather than retire. We were happy to support the consumer protection price cap championed by Governor Sapiro and it worked. It starts to stabilize prices so that we could step into the higher prices that were inevitable as a result of the design changes that FERC has made.\nAnd we think that will continue to work to help customers transition. It's important because we understand the focus on customer costs, especially residential customers. But again, let's put this all in context. Starting with the critical fact that generation costs have actually declined 38% from where they were from 2010 and to 2024. This compares very favorably to an transmission and distribution costs, which have not declined, but instead have risen to 190% and 57%, respectively, and electric wires costs are not alone. Water, sewer and trash is up 77% on average car insurance, which we all pay for at least should, is up 125%.\nWe appreciate the impact on everyone's pocket book, and we will do what we can to mitigate these things. But the competitive generation market has been a remarkable story, particularly in comparison to other aspects of the energy ecosystem. And Constellation is doing more than anyone to meet its part to deliver the reliability that is needed for America. We're investing billions of dollars to restart, operate and extend the lives of nuclear generation. we had more than 1 gigawatt approved through the RI process, including Crane and the Byron and Brad wood upgrades. We're bringing Crane online earlier than planned, moving it up to the second half of 2027 with the aim to try to get it in the capacity auction for the period that begins June 1, 2027.\nWe still got some work to do there, but I'm hopeful we could get there. We have 3 large upgrades that we are completing engineering work on totaling nearly 900 megawatts that we could bring on Atlas at, Calvert and Libre with adequate customer support. And last week, we announced our collaboration with Grid Beyond to use AI to help our customers reduce peak energy use. This program will offer customers the opportunity to cut energy costs and unlock new revenue streams while helping the market maintain system reliability as we respond to growth.\nReducing peak demand by only a small map, 25% or 22 hours a year would allow 76 gigawatts of new demand to be absorbed. That's the most effective way to deal with the new demand. The latest auction results once again proved how markets, not monopolies, best work to attract enormous private investment, and we all see any observer all sees the tremendous interest by so many parties to build generation in these markets. And private investment by these companies means that companies and not captive Monopoly customers take the financial risk, the market risk, the technology risk and the construction risk rather than saddling captive customers with the consequences of poor decisions for decades to come. We have no doubt how policymakers will view these issues.\nTurning to Slide 8. In June, I was incredibly proud to announce that the Crane Clean Energy Center will return faster and it was great to have Governor Shapiro at the event. To give you some follow-up details on that. We've secured the fuel. We've got all the major equipment. We're 70% staffed, and we're walking through all aspects of the plant. And quite frankly, we're just so confident in the team there because the plant was in such phenomenal condition when Brian and the team laid it up in 2017.\nTo say I'm proud of all the work here has been an understatement. Before I turn it over to Dan, I want to touch briefly on the Calpine transaction. Details are here for you on Slide 9. The more time we spend with the Calpine team, the more I'm excited about the combination of the talented people in both companies. We've received 3 of the necessary approvals, and we're working with the Department of Justice on a second request for data. And hopefully, it puts us on a track to complete the work with the environment and have this transaction flows by the end of the year. The sooner we could get it closed, the sooner we could offer American families and businesses the unique capabilities of the combination of these businesses. And I'm super proud of the regulatory team that has worked to get the 3 approvals we've gotten, and I'm hopeful that we will get the last one here shortly.\nWith that, let me flip it over to Dan, and then I'll have some closing comments after Dan, and we'll finally take your questions.\n\nDaniel L. Eggers\n\nAnalyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)\n\nThank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. Beginning on Slide 10, we are in $2.67 per share in GAAP earnings and $1.91 per share and adjusted operating earnings in the second quarter, which is $0.23 per share higher than last year. Similar to the second quarter last year, the fleet performed exceptionally well and provided critical around-the-clock supply at a time when PJM saw peak loads materially outpacing its summer demand forecast.\nOur commercial team once again successfully managed a period of extreme volatility, where at times we saw triple-digit real-time pricing across much of the East Coast. In addition to the strong performance from our generation and commercial teams, we also recognized $201 million from the Illinois ZEC program for banked credits. This is similar to what you saw in the second quarter of 2023.\nAs you may recall, the Illinois ZEC program includes an overall cost cap as one of its consumer protection features, but allowed us to bank excess credits for use in future years if there was a -- of the cap, which is what we did again this year. The impact of these credits and the banking mechanism have always been included in our full year 2025 guidance.\nSlide 21 in the appendix provides more details on the mechanics of the Illinois ZEC program. Full year gross receipts for the majority of our fleet continue to be at or above the PTC floor, resulting in significantly fewer PTCs being accrued this quarter compared to the second quarter last year. This is a good outcome and the means tested program continues to work as expected, that will result in noise when comparing year-over-year results on a quarterly basis.\nThe extraordinary stock performance this year translates into higher book compensation expense for us creating some earnings wins that we will continue to monitor. That said, we are reaffirming our full year operating EPS range of $8.90 to $9.60 per share.\nMoving to Slide 11. As I mentioned before, our fleet performance was excellent during a period when it was needed to support unseasonably high demand across our operating footprint. Our nuclear team posted its second best fleet production ever in the second quarter and was ahead of plan with a capacity factor of 94.8%, producing more than 41 million-megawatt hours of reliable, available and emissions-free power.\nWe completed 3 refueling outages in the quarter with an average duration of 19 days, beating the industry average by over 2 weeks. Being able to execute on these outages significantly better than the industry, provides incremental benefit to the grid, energy in the communities where we operate and of course, more power to sell. It truly is a testament to the operational excellence of our nuclear organization.\nOur renewables and natural gas fleets were also ahead of plan for the quarter with renewable energy capture at 96.1% and power dispatch match 98.3%. Our plants continue to perform when they are most needed.\nTurning to Slide 12. Our commercial team is off to another strong start this year. We're creating value from continued market volatility by optimizing our portfolio, locking in higher-than-average margins on retail sales and finding success in selling value-added products around the clean attributes of our nuclear plants. We continue to see robust renewal and new business win rates with our power and gas products reflecting the durable relationships we have with these customers.\nOur scale and ability to develop products to meet the needs of our customers is truly a competitive advantage. We have spent a lot of time over the last 1.5 years talking about the incredible demand for long-term clean, firm and reliable power from the data economy customers and for good reason. But it has arguably overshadowed our success in selling these same products to our traditional commercial customers. For example, through June of this year, we have sold nearly double the volume of hourly carbon-free and emission-free products than we signed all of last year.\nLet me offer a little more to mention what we're seeing with these sales. Remember, the ability to offer Time Max Clean Power has only been around for just over 2 years in PJM. So we're encouraged by the growth in what is still a relatively new market. Also interesting is that our customers for these products have mostly been from industries outside of the data economy, reflecting the breadth of demand for these offerings.\nTheir products are rightly sold at a premium to typical C&I deals compensating us for the uniqueness of a scarce firm around-the-clock carbon-free energy solution. And finally, the duration of these products varies, but they are typically much longer terms than those of our traditional commodity business.\nAnother area where we're seeing tremendous growth is with data center customers we already serve. Focusing just on the accounts we have continually served over the last 3 years, we have seen their usage in the first half of 2025 increased 45% compared to the first half of 2023. This step-up in usage is probably not unique to Constellation, but it is indicative of the increased demand coming from the data economy, expansion of existing sites and gains in energy density even in existing facilities.\nTurning to Slide 13. I want to provide some brief comments around the financial impacts of the latest capacity auction. As a reminder for everyone, help with your modeling, with the nuclear PTC now in place, calculating the benefit from higher capacity prices is admittedly a little more involved than just the P Times Q and depends on expectations for gross receipts. When we are below the PTC floor, upside in pricing will first offset PTCs being generated and then went above the floor, we would retain the upside.\nFortunately, given where the current forwards are, our nuclear fleet is above the PTC 4 for 2026 and 2027. So the uplift in capacity markets will flow to our earnings outlook, assuming prices hold. This earnings upside above the PTC floor will show up in our enhanced earnings bucket. That said, for the 3 sites in Illinois that are in the CMT program through mid-2027, any revenues above the CMC price will be refunded to customers. So we will not realize any upside benefit for these 3 CMC plants in Illinois, even though they cleared the auction.\nSo from a financial impact perspective, we'll just focus on Constellation standalone and not include Calpine given where we are in the approval process. For 2026, the net EPS impact of Constellation is approximately $0.50 per share. For 2027, assuming we carry the same capacity prices forward to the '27, '28 auction, we would expect an approximately $1.50 per share increase in EPS and help calibrate with these earnings benefits. The Delta upside did say conservatively low number around -- low 200s per megawatt day embedded in our expectations.\nTurning to Slide 14. The strength of our balance sheet continues to be foundational to the company and our capital allocation. The combination of our investment-grade balance sheet and strong free cash flow create strategic flexibility to fund the Calpine acquisition as well as pursue future growth investments and return capital to our owners. On our first quarter call, we talked about our disappointment in not being able to repurchase shares on the short-lived dip.\nDuring the second quarter, following the announcement of the Meta transaction, along with reiterating that more long-term PPAs are part of our strategy, we were able to renew an accelerated share repurchase program for $400 million. We expect this view of data economy deals as now being normal forks to our business will afford us flexibility and when we can be in the market buying back stock going forward. And with this quarter's $400 million, we will have repurchased $2.4 billion for outstanding shares since the beginning of our buyback program, and still have about $600 million remaining under the current board authorization. We will remain opportunistic in returning that capital to our owners.\nLet me now turn to the one big beautiful Bill act. Joe already talked about our excitement around the support for the nuclear PTC provisions, but there are some key other benefits from the legislation constellation. The VA includes an incremental 10% bonus on the 45 like credit for nuclear energy communities that will provide incremental tax benefits for new Nuclear megawatts. We expect the Crane Clean Energy Center as well as our other up projects to qualify for this bonus. We also benefit from the general corporate provisions included in the legislation. Moving from 40% to 100% bonus depreciation on our entire capital plan, including fuel as well as an immediate deduction for research and development expenses will meaningfully benefit our cash position.\nThese provisions create an expected $200 million to $300 million of annual tax cash favorability per year for Constellation stand-alone. We expect that benefit to grow with Calpine and the capital plans there. We're excited about Constellation's performance and our financial position as we head into closing Calpine later this year. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Joe.\n\nJoseph Dominguez\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Dan. Great job. So look, Dan and I have covered, we had a pretty great first half of the year from our perspective financially and operationally. Real big wins on the policy front. We have some terrific significant opportunities on the horizon to kind of continue to build on the successes you have seen us achieve already. And we're focused on closing the Calpine transaction the second half of the year and really doing the work here to bring these 2 great companies together.\nOur company is really like no other, and our unique and strong foundation will create value for our owners year in and year out. So we produce robust cash flow and base earnings, which are protected by the nuclear PTC, which, as you've seen now, has tremendous bipartisan support. And I think we should reasonably expect the policy to be continued.\nOur earnings grow at 13% through the decade and any long-term deal we do would be additive to that growth as well as to our base earnings. We've had a track record finding ways to improve our earnings and just this update here, you're seeing what we're doing with the Cranes restart, we've done the deals with Meta and Microsoft, we've got the line acquisition. I think we're pretty smart about finding those things and getting them done. Calpine will add $2 in EPS and $2 billion of free cash flow before growth starting next year.\nAnd Dan, of course, covered some of the cash benefits of big, beautiful to us. We've got upgrades that we're now through the engineering process on, and we're open to partner with customers to bring to the grid. And then finally, not only does the PTC provide protection for the nuclear fleet, but in a world where people are concerned about inflationary impacts, the PTC gives us some unique protection through higher PTC floors that are adjusted with higher inflation.\nSo we feel like we have an unbelievable foundation for capturing value from all the opportunities we're seeing and for meeting the demand of the data economy and the demand of just growth here in America and capturing the value that you deserve as our owners. Our existing fleet can serve customers with clean, reliable energy that they need now for decades and decades to come. So an unbelievable platform. We think it's unmatched in the world in which you operate. And I'm excited to take your questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Emily Duncan, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Strategic Initiatives. You may begin.\n\nEmily Duncan\n\nThank you, Towanda. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Constellation Energy Corporation's first quarter earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Joe Dominguez, Constellation's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Eggers, Constellation's Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Constellation's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks.\nWe issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, all of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Constellation's website. The earnings release and other matters, which we will discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates regarding Constellation and its subsidiaries that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call.\nPlease refer to today's 8-K and Constellation's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and other circumstances and considerations that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures.\nI'll now turn the call over to Joe Dominguez.\n\nJoseph Dominguez\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Emily. First of all, let me thank Towanda for getting started. In our 3 short years, we've had a couple of occasions where the bridge call failed. So Towanda, stand your toes, hopefully, we won't need you. Good morning, everyone. Let me first thank the incredible team here at Constellation for getting us off to a strong operational and financial start. We are exactly where we want to be through the first quarter, and we will meet our commitments this year. We delivered GAAP earnings of $0.38 per share and adjusted operating earnings of $2.14 per share. As usual, Dan will walk you through the details in his section.\nI want to spend some time providing some higher level thoughts on what we're seeing in the market and what it means for Constellation's data economy strategy. The short story here is that we're seeing a very, very favorable environment. The business updates from the big tech companies where they've essentially doubled down on their capital and growth strategies, reinforces Constellation's overall strategic plan, the importance of America's nuclear energy to meet the coming demand and the strong logic of the Calpine acquisition. While we think there's some out there, we overstated the amount of new demand for their own reasons, we're confident that the demand could be met and that the markets will respond with demand response and new generation as needed.\nBut importantly, even a more rational view of new demand will give us ample opportunity to support both in front of and behind the meter data center development at significant scale. And as we look at both the entry as well as the amount of time it takes to bring new power generation on, we believe that the options for clean and reliable energy from our assets will be a compelling and durable strategic advantage for decades. This opportunity in turn, will allow us to make needed investments in clean energy so that we can relicense and keep running these one-of-a-kind assets through and beyond for America.\nNow in summary, here's what we're seeing in the marketplace. First, the business updates from the tech companies are telling us that Americans are putting AI technology to work in their businesses and in their lives. AI technology makes businesses stronger and helps them offer better products and services. We're seeing that right here at Constellation. For families, it helps them manage their daily lives and educate their children. We see our data economies maintaining and often expanding their needs to build new data centers to provide these products and services to customers. Now it's our job in the industry to provide the necessary power and that is precisely what Constellation will make happen. In fact, we're making tremendous progress today toward reaching agreements with our customers, which I'll describe a little bit more in a moment.\nThe second dynamic we're seeing is that it's clear that the cost of new entry, whether that be for combined cycle machines or solar with storage has gone up substantially as has the time built and site these assets. Now at the end of the day, in a tightening market, we compete with the cost of new entry as market new entry prices converge. And we believe our offerings for clean and reliable generation are far more attractive from a time and pricing standpoint than any competing action. Whether that's used to support on-grid data center development or behind the meter development. Locating AI facilities proximate to large clean and reliable power plants continues to make all the sense in the world. But practically, we do not need to have load co-located or behind the meter for us to achieve compelling pricing.\nTo be perfectly candid, we weren't sure about that at the beginning of this strategic effort. Initially, we were somewhat concerned that fair pricing might only be available in behind-the-meter transactions, structured like the [ Talend ] deal. But we are now convinced that we could achieve fair pricing at levels consistent with our owner expectations regardless of whether a client chooses to be in front of the meter or behind it, whether a client chooses to be near our plant or in a remote area. We demonstrated that when we achieve the Crane Clean Energy Center restart. We demonstrated that when we achieved the landmark GSA transaction that we announced in January, and we've demonstrated that time and again with CFE deals, and we certainly see further evidence in the deals we're working on now.\nOn-grid sales are increasingly attractive to us and to our customers for other reasons, too. The behind-the-meter approach depends on the cooperation of the local utility where our assets are part of the grid and their willingness to facilitate studies and collaborate. Now it's been no secret that hasn't happened and the regulatory process is presently tied up at FERC where the industry desperately needs some clarity. But I will tell you, there have been some benefit reverse over colocation. It's caused utilities to speed up the interconnection process because they came to understand that the studies we're taking far too long. And we want to take a moment to applaud the efforts of utilities to move more quickly, and we thank them.\nOne of the benefits of on-grid sale is that we could work with utilities anywhere in the RTO. And we could partner where it makes most sense and where they could bring these grid resources online as quickly as possible. This eliminates the need for extensive regulatory processes, it eliminates the complexity around behind the meter colocation, and it simply treats these customers like we've been treating all of our retail customers for decades. I do want to make clear that we still believe that behind-the-meter configurations will make sense for some customers, and we continue to get inbound in that area. It may be the case at the end of the day that the largest and perhaps the most important data centers from a national security standpoint, will involve grid configurations where part of the data center operates behind the grid and part of it operates in front of the meter.\nPresident Trump highlighted a configuration like that recently in one of his remarks. We urge FERC to provide clarity on the rules for behind-the-meter configurations and to provide latitude so that there could be innovation here following the President's lead. The third thing we're seeing is that the encouraging data center growth updates and the cost of new entrants all reinforce the strong logic of what we did with Calpine in that deal. As I'll discuss, that deal looks better to us every day. We acquired Calpine because it was an awesome company run by terrific peak. The combination of Constellation and Calpine people and assets will create new capabilities for our customers, large and small across America. But as we discussed, we were also mindful of value when we negotiated that Calpine deal. And if you now consider the cost of new combined cycle machines that Constellation Nextera and many others have reported, one can easily make the argument that Calpine was worth twice as much as what we paid for.\nNow of course, you might challenge me and say that the comparison of new CCGTs to the Calpine fleet is not completely square. You can say that the Calpine assets aren't new, and I agree with that. That is true. But you might also agree that unlike hypothetical new assets that face an uncertain world of interconnection queues, supply chain issues and delivery dates that are sometimes years away. Having a fleet of new plants that are up and running exceptionally well with a good team running them, might offset a couple of years of age. Anyway, we love the deal. And we don't so much love the equity volatility that our owners have experienced this quarter but so much of that is driven by macroeconomic factors that we cannot control. In our opinion, our stock does not -- our stock price does not reflect the full value of the particular opportunities we have here. The double-digit base earnings growth through the end of the decade or the prospect of securing additional above the PTC pricing deals.\nAs you can see from the disclosures, we have about $1 billion left in our buyback authorization from the Board. I tell you, we would have loved to have been in the market buying at these prices during the quarter. But as you've seen before, there are times where we have been unable to be in the market due to possessing material nonpublic information. We do look forward to sharing great news with you soon and resuming our buyback program at these compelling stock price levels.\nTurning to Slide 6. At the beginning of the call, I started with the big picture narrative we're seeing today. I now want to dig in a little bit. On Slide 6, we see the demand from data centers is coming and that the U.S. will rise to meet this challenge. So the Trump administration has made clear that the U.S. must win the AI race and the administration is taking steps to -- they understand that the data economy is critically important to national security and to our economies and will be an important driver of America's success. I can tell you that I've been in Washington a lot and I haven't had a single conversation with anyone from the administration or any member of Congress, where the importance of AI leadership has not come up.\nAnd notwithstanding news and rumors to the contrary, that we've seen the major tech companies get it to, and they've increased or recommitted to their capital plans for data center buildout. They are making these investments because AI is delivering for customers. And you could see it in their business results. Businesses and families are looking at the possibility of what AI could do for them. We have a number of projects here at Constellation where we're utilizing AI and I could tell you the tools are marvelously affected. They're going to change operations at plants, going to change our relationship with customers. We are going to discover new ways to do things that are going to bring enormous value to our customers and to our owners. We're a microcosm of the demand that is coming. There's just no doubt about that.\nAnd I've said this before, while the demand is strong, we have to be a bit cautious here that there are some claims that are a bit outsized in terms of the extent or amount of that demand. Claims that are difficult to substantiate either mathematically, or logically.\nAnd that's why we put Slide 7 in here. As I said, electric demand will be big for our industry. No doubt about that. But to be fair, some of the hyper believe about the size of the growth is coming from stakeholders who have their own motivations, including a desire to keep building out the wire system or competitive market utilities that simply want the right or permission to go back and build generation in a competitive market. We've been seeing that in a few places but we also see policymakers becoming skeptical about these claims. That skepticism is warranted in our view. We know from conversations from our customers and end users that the same data center need is being considered in multiple jurisdictions across the United States at the same time. Just like fishing. If you ever be fisherman, you put a bunch of lines in the water to try to catch fish. And the data center developers are doing exactly the same thing.\nSo sometimes the same project is showing up in multiple queues simultaneously. Same thing happens with renewable development, where we see these massive queues, but we know through experience that a fraction of what is in the queue gets built. I'll give you a few examples. In ERCOT, the large load interconnection queue grows from 200 -- or 20 gigawatts in 2025 to more than 100 gigawatts by 2030. A more than fivefold increase. Looking at the chart on the left, you could see the comparison of MISO, PJM and ERCOT forecast for load compared to forecast on national load growth. These 3 ISOs account for less than half of the total U.S. power demand, but they alone are projecting demand growth, notably higher than a wide range of consultants for the entirety of the U.S. it's hard not to conclude that the headlines are inflated.\nIn fact, we've done the math. And if NVIDIA, we're able to double its output and every single chip went to ERCOT, it still wouldn't be enough chips to support some of the load forecast in ERCOT. There's been a history of over forecasting. We've seen this before with electric vehicles. We've seen it before with the Internet. And utilities have historically overestimated their load forecast. The Rocky Mountain Institute, for example, recently put out a study based on FERC data and determined that in the last 10 years, utilities have overstated long-term demand forecast by 23% on average compared to what actually happened. We get it. Utilities have the plan to ensure that the system is reliable. But when I listen to some of the comments on these calls, I just have to tell you, folks, I think the load is being overstated. We need to pump the brakes here.\nMoving to Slide 8. In the early days of our data economy strategy, we heard concerns that the so-called window for our strategic execution would eventually close because low cost new resources would be added to meet the data center load and that our existing resources would lose out to these opportunities. We've also heard that we would lose out because we weren't incremental. Let me deal with that last issue first. As a number of the data center companies have noted in their plans, relicensing nuclear plants is incremental. We've seen that in policy space. Everyone gets it. We either include nuclear within the category of resources that participate in these sales or nuclear will fail to exist.\nBut just focusing on cost of new generation. It's clear that we're in a whole new ballgame on cost. The estimates for new build CCGTs consistently exceed $2,000 with some estimates being closer to $3,000 at KW and those are higher in certain locations in which we operate. For context, this is about 3x as much as we spent on Wolf Hollow and the Colorado Bend plants less than 10 years ago. So a 300% increase in less than 10 years. And as I alluded earlier, if we were to rebuild just the Calpine fleet, it would cost about $65 billion. Significantly higher for what we paid for the best operating natural gas fleet in the country. Solar is no exception to these increases. Solar plus storage is in a similar boat with costs now exceeding $2,500 per KW. And that's even without the tariffs. If we estimate what the tariffs would do to CCGTs and solar plus storage, we could easily see costs going another $5 to $10 higher for CCGTs on a megawatt hour basis and another $30 to $50 higher for storage and solar put together.\nThe important strategic point here is that Constellation's fleet ultimately will compete with these new entrants for the right to serve the growing needs of America. Early days of the discussion of the AI-powered dynamic and I got to tell you, I smile a little bit when I say early days. I mean, when we were talking about this last year, we often described our competitive advantage at Constellation in terms of speed and reliability as compared to new renewables because renewables are not reliable and we thought our competitive advantage over new natural gas in terms of speed and sustainability because gas met CO2. Implicit was this unspoken assumption that new power, either renewables or CCGTs would be less expensive for hyperscaler customers as an alternative option to our plants but that some we would be faster for new data centers and offer more reliability than renewables and more sustainability than gas.\nIt turns out that we were just thinking about old cost data. With the old cost data firming up, it's pretty clear that nuclear simply wins the match in every single dimension. Cost, reliability, predictability of firm prices for 20 years, what other resource could offer a 20-year fixed price that with my gas machines. I can't do that with renewables. The speed to execution, the sustainability value, the resilience value, the durability and policy support. All of that makes nuclear the clear winner. And folks, that's why I think people are wanting to contract with us and they don't care whether it's in front of the meter or behind the meter.\nLet me turn to Slide 9. One of the reasons we know that the competitive market will respond to the growing demand is because it always has. We are seeing that in response to the expedited program that FERC and PJM approved for new dispatchable generation in PJM, pardon me. And remember a product that historically was used to deal with peak hour demand was demand response. And we saw that go from 15 gigawatts of demand response in auctions that were held just a handful of years ago to 4 to 6 gigawatts of demand response in the recent auctions. We also know the reason that demand response didn't happen because the capacity market was broken and prices were ridiculously low. But now FERC has fixed those capacity markets. And we believe that demand response once again, is going to come back in the picture as early as this next auction. Remember, our grid was built for peak usage at the hottest or coldest hours of the year. But in most hours, we dramatically underutilized the grid.\nThe chart that you have here on Slide 9 is what we would call low dispatch diagram. It's a pretty common diagram to everyone in the business. And the colored lines here are every one of the different RTOs. Let me explain how it works. The x axis is 100% of the hours of the year. So we take 87, 60 hours of a year and that's the x axis, the Y axis is, how many of the power plants or how much of the existing power gen are you using during those hours? And if you study this, what you quickly see here is that for the vast majority of time, we don't utilize the grid. In fact, 80% of the time or so, 1/3 of the grid is not being used. And that means we have plenty of room, most hours to accommodate new generation. The Nicholas Institute at Duke did a pretty cool study on this just recently and it's been in the news ever since. And it basically said this, that if we've got customers to shave 25% at peak, we could add 70 gigawatts of new load, right? 76 gigawatts of data center just by getting customers curtail 25% of the time.\nSo DR is an incredibly powerful tool to meet all of this data center demand. What it will do is it will utilize the slack in the system most hours and cover those peak hours where there is a gap. We're seeing our data economy customers also pitch in a retailment methodologies. And just I think it was just this week that we saw the EPA relax rules on backup generation at data centers. So that backup generation could be co-optimized for the grid and take the pressure off these key hours. The point is there's a lot of tools out there, and we expect those tools to be used. And again, I think we'll see some of that here in this upcoming auction. It will put some downward pressure on the strand that we've seen in the prior auction, in my view.\nNow let me turn to Slide 10. Constellation has some unique advantages that will ensure with a large player in this space. We've talked about this. But again, we have existing megawatts that are available to deliver power. We have clean and sustainable energy, which is going to be useful just now in the environment, but also in the future as concerns about climate continue to resurface. We could offer price certainty that is very different than any price certainty we could offer from any other resource. We've talked about speed. And we've talked about the ability to work anywhere with any customer, any part of the grid. We could bring additional megawatts to bear, whether that's restarting nuclear plants, life extensions and of course, operates the plants. After Calpine closes, we're going to be able to provide this capability coast to coast.\nAnd finally, just as we look for partners, our investment grade credit rating is a huge competitive advantage because it gives customers confidence that we will be there and stand behind our contracts in the long term. We're well positioned to create additional value for our owners through our role serving the data economy customers, and we're super excited about that. Now let me close out with the Calpine transaction. It's been a few months since we announced the deal, so I want to tell people what we've been up to. But remember, what we're building here is the largest fleet of clean and reliable 0 and low carbon resources in the nation. We believe this will enable us to better serve families and businesses with new products and services at the best prices.\nAnd as we spend more time with the Calpine team and get to know them better, we're even more excited every day about the talent, the combination of talent and skill we're going to have as a combined team. We're making very good progress towards closing the deal and integrating the 2 companies. We have set up integration teams, and we're doing the work to get ready to close this year. The teams are energized, and we're looking forward to being one company and seeing what 2 very good companies could do when they aim to be great. On the regulatory front, we've made all the required filings at this point. We received a deficiency notice from FERC and a second request for data from the DOJ. As you know, in large transactions, things like that should be anticipated. We filed our answer to the FERC deficiency notice on April 28, and we remain on track to close the transaction by the end of the year, again, incredibly excited for that.\nWith that, let me flip it over to Dan. Dan will cover the financials. And then again, I'll talk to you a little bit more, and we'll get to your questions. Go ahead, Dan.\n\nDaniel L. Eggers\n\nAnalyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)\n\nThanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone. Beginning on Page 12, we earned $0.38 per share in GAAP earnings and $2.14 per share and adjusted operating earnings for the first quarter, which was $0.32 per share higher than last year. We have seen strong performance from our commercial business over the last several years and the start of this year continues that trend. The team did a great job positioning our portfolio at a colder-than-average winter, captured value from serving more load versus the first quarter of 2024 and managing market prices. During the quarter, we lock in margins that exceed our 10-year average, supporting 2025 and benefiting future backlog. As expected, we also realized higher prices for the Illinois ZEC and CMC programs when compared to the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by lower nuclear PTCs recognized during the quarter.\nWe continue to see this means tested PTC program working as intended. As you know, the PTC is determined on an annual basis, and each quarter is booked based on actual revenues plus forwards for the remainder of the year. As of March 31, we anticipate the gross receipts for the full year will be above the PTC floor across our entire fleet whereas at the start of the year, part of the fleet was projected to collect some PTCs. This full year expectation of higher prices resulted in us not booking PTC in the first quarter whereas we did book some in the first quarter last year. While this is a good outcome on a full year basis, it can create noise in quarterly results and impacts the year-over-year comparability. We're happy with the start of our 2025 in context of our plan and are reaffirming our full year operating EPS guidance range of $8.90 to $9.60 per share.\nNow moving on to our first quarter operational performance on Slide 11. Nuclear performance was strong, we produced more than 41 million-megawatt hours of reliable, available and emissions-free generation from our nuclear plants with a capacity factor of 94.1%. The team continues to deliver industry-leading refueling outage performance. We completed 3 refueling outages during the quarter, averaging 1 more days compared to the industry average of nearly 40 days. Our renewables and natural gas sleep also performed well with 96.2% renewable energy capture and 99.2% power dispatch match. As you know, Constellation continues to do our part to bring clean, reliable, firm megawatts to the grid. Last Friday, PJM announced a more than 1,150 new nuclear megawatts including the Crane Clean Energy Center and operate were chosen for the accelerated interconnection product.\nWe are pleased that PJM recognizes the importance of getting these projects on the grid quickly. And I want to thank our team for advocating for this important change. And on Crane, we are pleased with the progress we are making. Our restaffing is going more quickly than expected, we are getting multiple superb candidates applying for each position. To date, we have over half of the roughly 600 permanent employees we will need to run the plant, and the majority of them have been working at the site. I'm happy to share our first operator classes underway with the second one on course to start this fall as the days pass, and we address long lead time items like the PJM interconnect and staff training we are confident that we will meet and potentially beat our targets for both total cost and time to bring this plant back online.\nTurning to Slide 14. Our commercial team is off to another strong start this year, creating value by optimizing our portfolio and locking in higher-than-average margins, which are benefiting from continued market volatility as well as sales of value-added products around the clean attributes of our nuclear plants. Our renewal rates remain strong with both electric and gas customers, reflecting the durable relationships we have with our customers.\nTurning to Slide 15. It's understandable there is a lot of focus in the market right now on the risk of a recession and concerned about how power producers may fare in such an environment. Before I offer our perspective, let me start by noting that each recession is unique and carries its own impact our demand in terms of duration and magnitude. More recent recessions have temporarily impacted power demand by 1% to 4% although the year-over-year data is also complicated by weather, which is more complicated to normalize on a national basis. Generally, we have seen a strong bounce back in power demand on the other side of a recession. In today's environment, we view a temporary slowdown in the economy and lower power demand is likely being offset by the very real demand growth we are seeing across the nation, the impacts of ongoing electrification, onshoring of manufacturing and demand associated with the build-out of the data economy, we see counterbalances to any temporary slowdown or reduced power demand on other parts of the economy.\nThe biggest risk to our business in a recessionary environment has been the power price. Fortunately, compared to last recessions, we now have the nuclear PTC, which provides downside protection from a drop in commodity prices due to a recession. As you know, the nuclear PTC credit is means tested to ensure the continued operation of these critical power resources when prices are depressed, while not compensating them in higher price environments. We've also looked at other major potential risks associated with a recession, including lower retail volumes, bad debt as well as debt refinancing and we are confident in our ability to manage these collective headwinds with limited financial drag for our owners if recession were to occur. Constellation remains in strong financial health, especially when you think about our investment-grade balance sheet, ample liquidity and cash flows supported by the nuclear PTCs as well as existing forward customer sales.\nBefore moving on, I also want to comment briefly on the current tariff environment. While the ultimate impact will depend upon that goes into effect after this 90-day pause and anticipated negotiations, we estimate a negligible impact on O&M and roughly a 1% to 2% impact on our CapEx, including fuel for 2025 and 2026. We will continue to monitor and mitigate the impacts to both costs and our supply chain.\nFinally, turning to Slide 16. I want to spend a little more time on the PTC now that has been in place for a year and we are seeing some updates to key inputs, reminding us of the inflationary protections it provides. As a reminder, we have assumed that the PTC floor and actual credit grew at a 2% inflation adjustment as part of our base earnings forecast. So if the adjustment was more than 2%, our base earnings would increase while the official rate used in the calculation is not yet published, we estimate the inflation adjustment for 2025 to be between 2.3% and 2.6%. With the 2025 inflation adjustment in this range and then returning to our 2% assumption for 2026 and beyond, we will see an earlier step up in prices that has an incremental $500 million in revenues to base earnings for 2028. This adjustment both demonstrates the benefits of the nuclear PTC in providing visibility for the nuclear industry and reinforces the unique benefit of an inflation hedge in our business model compared to most other companies in the market.\nWith that, I'll thank you all and turn the call back to Joe.\n\nJoseph Dominguez\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Dan. Among Dan's many talents there's his ability to multitask. So while reading the script, he also wrote to me and note giving me a correction. I think I said 25% on the Duke study met 0.25%, but the study, again, to remind you, demonstrates with quite modest demand response at levels that we've easily achieved in the past. We could accommodate all new load on the system from the data economy using that tool. When we think about the backup, reciprocating engines at the sites, and then we see the new generation that the competitive market will bring as needed. We see no reasonable concern in that area.\nSo just to recap here, we're off to a fantastic start. We're exactly where we want to be. We're focused on closing Calpine and integrating the business. We like that combination more and more each day. We have a business here that is very different, very unique and stronger than we think anything else that is out there in the industry. We produced robust cash flow and base earnings, which are protected by nuclear PTC, a tax credit that has significant bipartisan support. Our earnings grow at 13% through the decade. And any long-term deal we do from here on will be additive to that base earnings growth. I think we have demonstrated a track record of continuing to improve earnings and to surprise you from time to time with things like Crane, Calpine and the GSA.\nCalpine will add at least $2 in EPS and $2 billion of free cash flow before growth starting next year. And not only does the PTC provide protection to the nuclear fleet, beneficiaries of higher inflation through higher PDC floors, and Dan just covered that. So we're poised to build on the foundation by capturing value from the opportunities that we see in the data economy and in the overall economy as it continues to grow and industries are onshore. Our existing fleet is vital to America. We understand that. We're going to continue to make investments in making that fleet better will live and increase the output. But we're in a position right now to meet the demands of the time and to support America at this critical point. And I got to tell you, I couldn't be prouder of the team we have here.\nWith that, we'll close down our prepared remarks and take your questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Emily Duncan, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations Growth. You may begin.\n\nEmily Duncan\n\nThank you, Michelle. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Constellation Energy Corporation's second quarter earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Joe Dominguez, Constellation's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dani Eggers, Constellation's Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Constellation's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, all of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Constellation's website.\nThe earnings release and other matters, which we will discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates regarding Constellation and its subsidiaries that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Constellation's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and other circumstances and considerations that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations.\nToday's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures.\nI'll now turn the call over to our CEO, Joe Dominguez.\n\nJoseph Dominguez\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Emily. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning, and thanks for your interest in Constellation. During this incredibly hot summer, we've had, our best-in-class nuclear fleet has once again met the challenge and is delivering clean, reliable 24/7 power. Combined with our renewable and natural gas fleet, we're providing the power to keep families cool and businesses running, supporting our country's economic growth.\nOur commercial business continues to do an awesome job, providing needed products to our customers and managing our one-of-a-kind portfolio. I want to thank the women and men at Constellation for their tireless efforts and for helping our customers meet their energy and sustainability goals.\nAt Constellation, we put our people first because they're the ones that are responsible for our success and because we think a good culture creates good results. In fact, I think it's the single most important driver of any company's success. Look, we're far from perfect, but we work hard to make this place some place where people want to come and spend a career doing important things for America and thriving. That is why we're so proud to report to you that Constellation was certified as a great place to work once again. We've been out as a separate company for about 2 full years, a little bit over that. And for 2 years, we've received this honor. And it's particularly impactful to us because you only get this certification through surveys and high marks by your people, independent surveys. So it's great to see that our folks are seeing the work we're doing. They believe in our mission, they're passionate, and they're 100% committed. And it shows up again here in results for you, our owners.\nIn this quarter, we're able to provide excellent results, but also raise guidance in just the second quarter. We delivered second quarter GAAP earnings of $2.58 per share and adjusted operating earnings of $1.68 per share. We are raising our adjusted operating earnings guidance from the initial range of $7.23 to $8.03 per share to a revised range of $7.60 to $8.40 per share. In effect, we're resetting the midpoint of our guidance to what used to be the top end of our guidance range. The fact that we do that here in Q2 as opposed to waiting until Q3 when these updates typically are provided should tell you how strongly we feel the business is performing. it's even more remarkable when one considers the compensation headwinds associated with stock comp where the stock has obviously performed very well over the first half. Dan will cover all of the financial details in his slides.\nIn terms of buybacks, we bought $500 million worth of our share during the quarter, bringing the total cash deployed on buybacks so far this year to over $1 billion -- or excuse me, to $1 billion. Although we've seen some slippage of late, we remain bullish on buybacks because our thesis is incredibly unique and compelling. We will grow base earnings by at least 10% through the decade, backstopped by the Federal PTC, and that growth does not reflect the opportunities we have in front of us from adding new clean, reliable megawatts to the grid to meet reliability needs or from selling to data center customers. And as we have been throughout the year, we remain quite confident in our ability to do better each year than our base earnings, delivering even more value to our owners.\nAnd finally, we released our third sustainability report, highlighting our efforts to help customers achieve their goals. I encourage you to read it. It outlines the good work we're doing on so many fronts as we lead the nation in the production of clean and reliable energy and provide unique and powerful sustainability products.\nNow before I turn to the operational updates, I do want to spend a few minutes on 2 topics that are garnering a lot of attention. The PJM capacity market auction results and the data center opportunities and the FERC proceeding concerning those opportunities. First, let me talk about the PJM capacity option.\nWe think, and PJM said this in its press release, we think the same thing. It's telling us what we already know. The demand for electricity is growing and supply and demand fundamentals are tightening. We foreshadowed all of this in our lengthy 2023 Q4 call when we walked through the market fundamentals in considerable detail.\nFortunately, the reforms FERC recently approved for the PJM capacity market are designed to incentivize the supply that we need, [indiscernible] incentivizing supply that can be counted on to operate when our customers need power. PJM proposed and FERC approved a design that provides greater compensation of the power plants like ours that historically deliver when the system needs power.\nWe previously have shown you data on how nuclear energy performs extraordinarily well through grid emergencies, while other resources, frankly do not, whether they are intermittent or dispatchable fossil assets. That means that nuclear is best positioned in this new market design and appropriately receives a fair level of compensation.\nIn light of the forecasted load growth in PJM, we expect to see higher sustained pricing for capacity to address reliability needs and send more accurate price signals to retain, operate and relicense our plants as well as incentivizing the development of new resources and customer demand response. Over the years, the PJM market has a proven track record of attracting investment through price signals and has developed over 60 gigawatts of generation to meet all of the needs of the grid. And we're confident that the market will respond to higher prices and add more resources as needed.\nWith that said, we know that higher prices impact families and businesses. And so our commercial team is working with these customers to provide solutions that manage the risk and smooth out bumps. But I think it's important to remember that adjusted inflammation, PJM energy and capacity prices are less today than they were 15 years ago. Markets work folks. What has changed for the customer is that the distribution and transmission elements of the bill have gone up. They've gone up to address reliability needs on those grid systems. But thankfully, that has been largely accomplished. And now we need to focus on investments on the reliability of the supply side. And that's what the capacity market is designed to do.\nOver the last 2 investor calls, we've emphasized that reliability is as critical as sustainability. They have to go hand in hand. Constellation's business is based on the thesis that the most valuable energy commodity in the world today is a reliable and zero emission megawatt of electricity. To us, the PJM results are just another data point that Constellation's thesis is right and that we're focused on doing the right things. First, by providing sustainability products to customers that expressly lead reliability to sustainability by time matching clean energy production to when our customers use energy. And second, by investments in relicensing and upgrading the clean energy centers that will reliably and sustainably power American families and businesses for decades to come.\nOn this second point, in its recent comments concerning the auction, PJM alluded to [indiscernible] to speed up the interconnection of needed resources. We look forward to seeing PJM's ideas, and we certainly will support those efforts in any way that we can. The case for prompt and decisive action by PJM is manifestly clear.\nIn sum, we need to invest to grow America's economy, and we need to invest and enable the technologies that support our economies and protect our nation. We think Constellation will play a big part in these efforts. That's our mission, and it is what inspires our people to make Constellation a great place to work.\nNow turning to Slide 6. We're continuing to do well in our discussions and negotiations with data center companies. The simple fact is that data centers are coming and they're essential to America's national security and economic competitiveness. We've heard this from a variety of policy bankers, a number of nations including China, are buying for AI supremacy. And it's absolutely critical that the U.S. not fall behind it. Time is of the essence. We simply cannot wait years for the data centers that are going to bring transformations. They're going to bring transformations in medicines, bringing new cures to diseases and treatments that research alone cannot do. They'll better predict whether. They'll provide material enhancements, and they'll do things for us on the energy supply system to more smartly manage the grid.\nEconomically, data center investment means considerable construction as well as permanent jobs, tax revenue, community development and other benefits to our states. We appreciate what the utilities in our states are doing to attract this crucial economic engine. We're doing our part, too.\nAll of our political leaders understand this, and that's why states are competing with each other, Republicans and Democrats alike, to bring the development of data centers to their jurisdictions. All of the policymakers we talk to want data center development wherever it occurs on the grid or colocated. But as you're all closely following, there's an active conversation underway by policymakers and stakeholders, trying to understand the implications of the different ways of power and data centers. We welcome that conversation, and we're confident that any thorough examination of colocation with nuclear plants will show that it is both the fastest and most cost-effective way to develop critical digital infrastructure without burdening other customers with expensive upgrades.\nAs we see it, utility connection will continue to make sense for some applications and in some parts of the grid. But where it's an option, we will continue to see customer interest in colocation, strong interest because there are just too many advantages of connecting large load directly to large forms of generation, especially clean generation. And I don't think that point is really debated.\nOn Slide 6, you can see some of the many quotes from key stakeholders including the utilities that oppose Talend ISA talking about the significant benefits of colocation. I'll outline 4 of them. First, and behind the meter, configuration, the data center customer, not other customers, pay for the infrastructure needed to connect to the power plant. Unlike in front of the meter projects, we're sometimes cost -- almost 90% or more of the costs are shared with other customers in these behind-the-meter configurations, the data center companies pay for the infrastructure. Second, co-locating a data center with the power plant is just more efficient, and it is faster, which can, I think the complaining utilities have acknowledged telling the FERC, \"significant new load can be served without having to expend resources on expensive system upgrades.\" That's from their filing. At a time when RTOs are struggling to integrate new resources faster and time is of the essence, this benefit is a big deal.\nThird, these behind-the-meter configurations are long dated. So they'll allow us to have the economic certainty to relicense nuclear plants and to operate them with all the attendant benefits that creates for the grid in our nation. Fourth, in terms of new clean generation, the common thesis for these forms of generation, whether they're SMRs or carbon sequestration technologies is to colocate them with industrial and data center look. We've seen that countless number of times.\nFor all these reasons, colocation will be an essential tool for maintaining our national security, developing new generation and our overall economic competitiveness. Friday's actions at the FERC may have slowed things, but ultimately will be constructive in our view. Notably, FERC did not grant requests by a small number of utilities to set the Talen Energy ISA for hearing or in the alternative to reject it outright. Instead the FERC ordered a technical conference that will provide all parties with the opportunities to talk about the benefits of colocation as well as other issues.\nLikewise, we thought the language of the deficiency letter was narrow. In fact, it mirrored standard deficiency letter language about a higher burden approved for ISA modifications that we've seen in a number of other applications. Just as an example of this, in the last 12 months, excellent subsidiary, ComEd, received 2 deficiency letters using the exact same language about a higher burden improved that we saw in the [indiscernible] letter. In both instances, the project was approved. Of course, look, we don't know what FERC ultimately will do with the [indiscernible] ISA, but we think the benefits are compelling and we look forward to the conference, and we're confident that any fair examination of costs will support colocation.\nSo at this point, we and our customers are continuing to make progress, and we hope to execute contracts. At the same time, on a parallel path, we'll participate in the FERC proceedings or in any proceeding where these matters are discussed. But that doesn't mean we won't have conversations with utilities outside these proceedings. In my view, transparency is part of who we are as a company, and the more we could share with policymakers, utilities and all stakeholders about how these facilities will operate, how they'll interact with the grid and their benefits, the better for everyone.\nI just want you to remember that in the grand scheme of things, colocation is not a new idea. It's actually quite an old idea. As PSEG and others have noted, cogen or combined heat and power projects were the first co-locators since I think they were the first [indiscernible]. And when I came into this business, those projects were a common feature of our system. And not surprisingly, utilities were not always friendly to Cogen, at least not at first. But policymakers insisted on non-monopoly alternatives to power and things get better.\nNow we're dealing with a whole new generation of policymakers and regulators, including many that weren't around when the Cogen policies were created. So we need to do a bit of work here to educate and inform. But Importantly, we simply don't see this as a zero-sum game. There's a great opportunity for Constellation and for the utilities to work together to bring grid-connected and co-located data economy growth projects to our states.\nHere's what I think. In the fullness of time, those jurisdictions that have clean energy centers like ours and offer both colocation and grid connection will be the most successful in generating business development and economic growth and jobs for their states.\nNow look, I want to close this part out by talking about something that I think kind of got missed in the overwhelming amount of conversation about the FERC process. I understand why there is a lot of attention on that, but we don't want to leave this topic without saying that we are making great progress on power sales for on-grid data centers through our 24/7 product.\nUtilities across PJM, and I think you've seen this in a bunch of the earnings calls, have been highlighting the growth of data centers in their service territory. In total, as you could see on Slide 6, they now identified 50 gigawatts or more that would come in over time.\nNow look, in fairness, I think there's a bunch of duplication in those numbers, and it's going to occur over a longish time line. But the point is, I think it's powerful that everyone is seeing the same thing, growth in this area. And those growth opportunities are good for Constellation because each of these grid data center projects, whether they're located in Illinois, Ohio or anywhere else in PJM or in other regions, they present an opportunity for our commercial team to sell clean and reliable power through our 24/7 product and other offerings to these clients.\nSo in conclusion, we continue to have multiple ways to serve our data center customers, both behind the meter as well as grid connected and create value for all of our owners. Nothing over the last quarter has changed our outlook, how Constellation can meaningfully participate.\nTurning to Slide 7, our fleet performance is laid out in this slide. And as you can see here, nuclear performance was again strong and ahead of plan for the quarter. We produced more than 41 million-megawatt hours of reliable, available and carbon-free generation from our nuclear plants with a capacity factor of 95.4%. That's including refueling outages, which we completed in an average of 21 days, again, industry-leading as always.\nOur renewables and natural gas fleet also performed well and exceeded our plan. with 96.6% of renewable energy capture and a 98% power dispatch match. Congratulations to those teams. Excellent work.\nTurning to Slide 8. We talk a lot about the advantage of creating value because our best-in-class carbon-free generation fleet is combined with an industry-leading commercial business. and the results here again demonstrate the validity of that point. Our commercial business thrives in volatile and changing markets. The markets we're seeing with spot [indiscernible] prices going up and down a bit throughout the course of the year. This quarter, our team priced in higher margins to customers to manage their exposure to volatile prices through firm products that offer price certainty. They optimized not only our individual generation and load positions, but they created the best positions using both. And they sold customized sustainability solutions.\nOn that point, we're seeing more evidence of our customers, not just data center customers, but customers as a whole, evolving in their sustainability journeys from buying annual clean energy products to starting to match their hourly consumption with clean energy. And again, I think the reliability to mention here plays hugely in the outstanding of customers that we need to match clean energy production with the time of use for their particular application. And they also understand that, that's the best way to ultimately make a difference in the environment and to manage the energy volatility.\nA good example that came to us this quarter when John Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab joined the growing list of high-profile customers that have turned to Constellation to power their operations with 24/7 carbon-free energy. As we did with the Comcast contract, the McCormick contract, that we highlighted on our last call, we spotlight this agreement with John Hopkins because it shows that it's just the hyperscalers. But rather a wide range of customers that are looking at 24/7 carbon-free energy matching as the best solution.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Dan to cover the financial update.\n\nDaniel L. Eggers\n\nAnalyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Beginning on Slide 9, we earned $2.58 per share in GAAP earnings and $1.68 in adjusted operating earnings, which is $0.04 per share higher than last year. Our commercial business continues to perform exceptionally well, creating value by optimizing our generation and load positions, demonstrating [indiscernible] thrives in volatile markets. We're also seeing margins above the long-term averages we use in our forecast, and above the enhanced margins we disclosed in February. This performance flowed through our quarterly results and contributed to our improved outlook for the year, which I'll discuss in a few minutes.\nCompared to last year, we benefited from the nuclear PTC. more nuclear output combined with lower costs and refueling outages and contribution from our ownership share in the South Texas project that closed last fall. And as discussed last quarter, our stock has performed very well year-to-date, which creates higher employee stock compensation expense year-over-year.\nFollowing on the quarter, we recognized $33 million in the Illinois ZEC program in June for banked credits, which is down a bit from the $218 million recognized last year. As you may recall, the Illinois ZEC program is subject to an overall cost cap as 1 of its consumer protection features. In earlier years of the program, we generated more credits than we could use under this mechanism. We were able to bank those credits for future years. For the 2023, 2024 planning year, the last second quarter, power prices had risen to a level where the ZEC price was nearly 0 and and we are instead able to use our bank ZEC to get back to the cost cap. For accounting reasons, we had to book these revenues at the start of the planning year and hence, the $218 million we recognized in the second quarter of 2023. This year, the forward prices have moderated and the ZEC creds for the 2024, '25 planning year will largely get us to the cap, using only $33 million of bank ZECs, which we then recognized this quarter.\nSo taking all these impacts together, when you think about our second quarter results, our year-over-year quarterly earnings were $0.04 higher, would have been $0.44 per share higher, if not for the timing of when we recognize the Illinois ZEC credits. Instead, we'll see these credits flow as a positive driver for the remainder of the '24-'25 planning year and have always been part of our full year expectations.\nMoving to Slide 10. We are raising our full year adjusted operating earnings guidance outlook with the midpoint of guidance going from $7.63 to $8 per share with a new range of $7.60 to $8.40. Joe and I spoke about our strong commercial performance to date, and that performance enables us to increase our earnings outlook for the year.\nAs you can see in the appendix on Slide 25, we increased our enhanced gross margin line by $450 million due to better optimization of our portfolio and higher commercial margins than planned. Our expectations for enhanced commercial margins improved by $0.15 to $1.90 per megawatt hour, which is on top of our base commercial margin of $3.50 to $3.60 a megawatt hour\nIn addition to an increase in stock compensation due to our share price, we have some O&M drag due to performance-based compensation as a result of the commercial team's exceptional execution and value creation for our owners. Our ability to optimize our generation and load positions is not limited to 2024, but has extended into our 2025 outlook as well. We increased our 2025 enhanced gross margin expectation by $250 million, some of which is from strong commercial backlog creation. All the rest is due to the higher prices from the PJM capacity auction.\nSo turning to Slide 11. Let's get into the financial impact of last week's capacity auction results. To level set everyone from the start, the nuclear PTC is now in place. So calculating the benefit from higher capacity prices is a little more involved than just a P x Q exercise. The nuclear PTC is a means-based credit and is calculated by filling the gap between gross receipts so all the market-based revenues coming to a plant and the PTC threshold value that we assume is $44.75 in 2025. What this means is that gross receipts per unit were below the PCC threshold of 44.75 in 2025. We expect to receive PTC revenues to get us to that level. For those units, the uplift from higher-than-anticipated capacity revenues following this auction must first replace the expected PTC that was bringing us to the PTC 5 Level before we're able to realize upside to earnings. For units that were already above the PTC floor, the full offside of the capacity price increase will be realized.\nAdditionally, any revenues above the CMC price will be refunded to customers. So we do not realize any upside benefit for the 3 CMC plants in Illinois, even though they cleared the auction. With all that clarification, capacity prices were higher than our expectations. And comparing to where power prices were for both 2025 and 2026, we are now seeing many of our PJM plants at or above the PTC floor in providing earnings upside for us. Forwards for 2025 are lower than 2026, so more of the capacity revenue upside in 2025 goes first to offset the expected PTC contribution.\nThe net earnings impact to 2025 was approximately $0.25 per share, which we reflected as part of the enhanced gross margin increase on Slide 25 of the appendix. For 2026, assuming that we carry through the same capacity prices in the 2026, 2027 capacity auction in December and used the end of quarter forward power prices. we would expect $1.25 per share increase in earnings against the previous assumption using $100 a megawatt day for the capacity auction. As a reminder, every penny of EPS is about $4 million pretax if trying to calibrate your forecast.\nTurning to the financing and liquidity update on Slide 12. Our investment-grade balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to have constructive conversations with the ratings agencies. During the second quarter, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program, completing $500 million of repurchases on top of the $500 million of repurchases we discussed on the first quarter call. We've now completed $1 billion year-to-date and $2 billion since the program began last year for a total of more than 16 million shares. We have roughly $1 billion remaining in our board authorized repurchase program, and we have more than $2.3 billion of capital still to be allocated for 2024 and 2025, and before taking into account the improving earnings outlook for both of these years.\nWe have considerable strategic flexibility to create further benefits for our shareholders through organic growth that meets our return thresholds, or through investing directly in our company. We believe firm, clean megawatts are the most valuable commodity in the market today, and we have more nuclear generation in competitive markets than all of our peers combined.\nWhen we look at our ability to execute and create value as well as the opportunities ahead of us, we continue to view our stock as compelling and unfortunately, even more so since the last time we met. We will continue to invest directly in it through buying back our stock. I'll now turn the call back to Joe for his closing remarks.\n\nJames McHugh\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Commercial Officer\n\nThanks, Dan. Great job. Constellations like no other company. We have a unique set of existing assets that really can't be replicated that create opportunities for us that no one else has. At our core, we have a visible base earnings growth of 10% through the decade that is backstopped by the federal government through the nuclear PTC and has a built-in inflation adjusted. Backstop is a huge differentiator, especially as some investors start to become concerned about clouds in the economy. Our country needs what we have, clean and dependable power generation to drive economic growth. And the argument for that just got stronger as the year has progressed. We could support both national security and meet environmental goals. Power demand is growing and, at the same time, reliability is becoming a premium product, and we have the most reliable generation in America.\nIncreased demand, combined with the change of the electric system to more intermittent, non-dispatchable resources means that volatile power markets will continue. We have a commercial team that is very capable of addressing and earning margins from that volatility.\nWe think Constellation is going to be a huge part of the solution for decades to come. Our clean and reliable nuclear plants, coupled with our ability to offer customers sustainability products will drive the U.S. energy transition and the growth in the data center economy. Politically, both Republicans and Democrats have consistently recognized that nuclear is both the backbone of our system from a reliability standpoint and is key to our sustainability goal. And that growth just -- that support just continues to grow, pardon me.\nOn top of the opportunities we have from volatile power markets, we have more than 180 million-megawatt hours of carbon-free [indiscernible] that we produced annually that can achieve additional compensation through in front of the meter deals, behind-the-meter deals, operates and other opportunities to invest in reliable clean energy and government procurements.\nNot many companies are growing at, at least 10% through the decade as their starting point with a federal backstop. But we're not satisfied with that. We think we will grow base earnings faster with both behind and in-front-of-meter customer deals and increasing our nuclear megawatts. On top of this, our commercial team is working to consistently create products and services that will capture additional value from the markets above our basis. That's our focus. That's what we do every day. So with that, let me turn it over back to you, Michelle, to handle questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your Emily Duncan, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Strategic Growth. You may begin.\n\nEmily Duncan\n\nThank you, Towanda. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Constellation Energy Corporation's first quarter earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Joe Dominguez, Constellation's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Eggers, Constellation's Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Constellation's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks.\nWe issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, all of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Constellation's website. The earnings release and other matters, which we will discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates regarding Constellation and its subsidiaries that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Constellation's other SEC filings for discussions of the risk factors and other circumstances and considerations that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations.\nToday's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. I'll now turn the call over to Joe Dominguez, CEO of Constellation.\n\nJoseph Dominguez\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\n[indiscernible], thanks for again a started this morning. And Emily, thanks for running through all that and laying out the agenda for today. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We had an excellent first quarter operationally and financially. We're making steady progress with technology customers on transactions that will power America into the future and employ thousands. And last week, we concluded meetings with our Board where they authorized another $1 billion in stock buybacks because we believe in our strategy.\nThis is the second buyback announcement in less than 6 months. Dan and I will cover all of those topics and more this morning, but I want to begin today with a celebration of Chris Crane, the former CEO of Exelon, who passed suddenly last month. We appreciate all of you who reached out and shared your thoughts and fun memories of Chris. If there ever was one, Chris was a nuked through and through. And as much as anyone, Chris deserves credit for the operational excellence of our fleet and improvements in other fleets around the industry. He was an operational genius. His reach was far and he touched so many people.\nHe and I spoke regularly after Constellation launched. He's happy to see how we are doing. His first thoughts were always about our people. His always so proud of folks here at Constellation, especially the women and men at the plans. They were his family. Many of us here worked with Chris for over 20 years, but you only have to be with him for about 20 minutes to know what he cared about. Safety and operational excellence was always number one, followed closely by the care and the development of the women and men who we are all privileged to lead every day. Those two things were his North Star. He was a leader for the industry and had conviction encouraged through a lot of hard times. He was an all-of-the-above energy thinker. He cared about nuclear because he was sure that you could not run a full time clean energy economy just on part-time power.\nWe've got a lot going for us here at Constellation, and we'll talk about that today, but one of the most important things we have is Chris Crane in our D&A. He trained and mentored Brian Hansen and Dave Rhodes and a lot of our other leaders. We're going to miss him, but you can be sure that his legacy of excellence will carry on here.\nIn February, we gave you a very thorough update on the company and the opportunities that lie ahead of us to create value for you, our owners. So we don't have to go through all of that again in detail, but I do want to reiterate a few points. Constellation will grow base earnings by at least 10% through the decade. And importantly, we have a number of opportunities to generate base earnings above those levels. In the coming years, the demand for clean, reliable [indiscernible] will only grow, and we think we're best positioned to meet [indiscernible] energy transition; to unlock value through compensation for the uniquely clean and reliable attributes of our 180 million-megawatt hour fleet; and to help America power the technologies of the future. whether that be EVs, electric heating and industrialization where we've got a lot to go or in the booming demand for artificial intelligence technologies and other digital infrastructure projects.\nI'd like to drill down on that last point for a moment. Over the last few months, a lot has been written about power demands in the technology industry. But I want to assure you that these challenges will be overcome as they have in the past because we all know here how imperative it is for America's national security and economic competitiveness that the U.S. leads the world in the development of these technologies. And we're working hard every day to make that possible.\nThe data economy and constellations nuclear energy go together like peanut butter and jelly. And as such, we're in advanced conversations with multiple clients, large well-known companies that you all know about powering their needs. Speed to execution is important to them as it is to us, but these are large and complicated transactions that require diligence and time to finalize. And while we're not done yet, I do expect that we will finalize agreements that will have long-term and transformational value. They'll ensure that our fleet and the jobs and economic community benefits that we already provide will be sustainable for decades to come. As demand grows, our nation's need for firm clean power grows proportionately. As we add new clean power, the role in important nuclear will only grow. We intend that Constellation will be a leader and adding new clean, reliable megawatts to the grid to meet the needs of American families and businesses. We're going to do that in three ways: First, we're extending the lives of our existing sites to power the nation into 2060 and beyond, creating more clean energy than all of the renewables ever built in this country.\nWe've already received or have announced license extensions at 5 and have more to come, assuming support policy. Continuing to run these plants through license extensions is quite simply the most important thing we can do for America's clean energy future. Second, we're adding megawatts by using uprates to increase [indiscernible] our current machines. And we already announced to you operates at Byron and Braidwood that will bring in 160 megawatts in the next few years. and we're looking at many opportunities to do that other plants. We believe that the opportunities will add up to 1,000 megawatts or perhaps more of clean, firm power to the grid. This is in addition to the many hundreds of megawatts of renewables that Constellation is adding through cores plus deals with customers and through our wind repowerings.\nThird, we're looking to partner with others to locate new technologies, including new nuclear at our existing sites. These sites already have, of course, community support and existing infrastructure for nuclear energy. And we think our simple thesis is this, if new nuclear is going to be built anywhere where we do business, it's going to be built on sites where there already is existing nuclear because that's where communities love the technology and have the capability to support more. So we believe that we're uniquely suited to provide this value and grow the industry.\nTurning to the quarter. We delivered first quarter GAAP earnings of $2.78 per share, and adjusted operating earnings of $1.82 per share driven by continued strong performance from the commercial business through better than historical customer margins and through optimizing our combined generation and customer business. Given the performance, we're confident in our full year outlook, and we look forward to another strong financial year.\nOur performance and creditworthiness is being recognized. Moody's upgraded our credit rating to BAA1, which is further recognition of our strong financial footing, and we issued the first green bond to fund nuclear power in the United States. I think that's really cool, think about it 5 years, the idea of using green bonds for nuclear would have been something that people would have scratched their head at, it happened. And you could see the enthusiasm in our near- and long-term outlook for our business through our continued share repurchases, buying 500 million shares to date with another 350 million of that coming since our end of the year February call.\nLooking at our strong free cash flows and near-term allocation opportunities, the Board, as I mentioned, previously authorized an additional $1 billion in share repurchases, bringing our remaining authority -- authorized buyback capacity to $1.5 billion. As Dan will explain, even after this new authorization, Constellation has ample cash available for growth investments, acquisitions and returning even more value to you, our owners.\nTurning to Slide 6. The importance of nuclear energy to our economy, electric system and meeting the country's environmental and clean energy goals was first recognized by states when they enacted zero-emission credit programs, and it's now been followed by the federal government through the nuclear production tax credit. Since then, the financial community has embraced nuclear energy understanding its importance to our country's success.\nAs I mentioned, we issued the first nuclear green bond in the U.S. There was significant demand for this product, and we were able to upsize our offering as a result. The strong demand from investors for our 30-year green bond is recognition that clean, reliable nuclear energy is critical to meeting the sustainability goals of the nation and will be beyond the present period of our current license lives. I mentioned that we received a credit upgrade from Moody's. Importantly, included as part of that upgrade, Moody's improved our carbon transition score to its highest level, a further recognition of the importance of nuclear energy to the energy transition.\nMore and more customers are acknowledging that nuclear should be part of meeting their own clean energy goals. Our customers are signing deals for hourly match carbon-free power from our existing plants, and we are talking to others about behind-the-meter opportunities at our sites. Congress has passed legislation to provide the necessary funding for bringing more of the nuclear fuel chain into our country, ultimately reducing geopolitical risks and supply. We expect DOE to issue a request for proposals imminently. And states across the country are taking action in favor of nuclear energy.\nState legislatures have 130 bills out there to support nuclear energy this year compared to 5 to 10 historically. States like Michigan and Minnesota have passed laws moving renewable standards to clean energy standards, which include nuclear. I was pleased to see that Governor Shapiro in Pennsylvania recently did the same thing. They're removing barriers to nuclear by repealing moratoriums on building new nuclear and they're developing regulations to support new development in the states. In places like Indiana and South Dakota, where there currently is no nuclear, there are plans to build nuclear. And 6 states, Red and Blue have created incentives in their state budgets to attract nuclear to their state. The momentum behind nuclear energy, both existing and new, continues to build as more and more policy makers recognize exactly what Chris Crane believed that you can't power a full-time economy on clean energy that is only part time.\nTurning to Slide 7. Nuclear performance was strong and ahead of plan for the quarter. We produced more than 41 million-megawatt hours of reliable available in carbon-free generation from our nuclear plants with an on-plan capacity factor of 93.3%. We completed 3 refueling outages during the quarter, with each lasting less than 22 days on average, and overall faster than we had planned. During our outage at Quad Cities, we anticipated a longer outage due to inspections on the low-pressure turbines that were installed as part of an upgrade in 2010.\nBut even with the additional work, we were able to complete that outage in 20 days, full 8 days faster than planned, kudos to nuclear and the entire team there. Our renewables and natural gas fleet also performed well with 96.3% renewable energy capture and 97.9% power dispatch match. The team is now completing our summer readiness work so that we're ready to go when the temperature turns up. Turning to Slide 8. Our commercial team is off to another great start. We continue to see strong margins in our customer business. We talked about this in the last call, our projections being based partly on historical margins. We're continuing to see strong margins as we get into the beginning here of 2024. They're also creating value because of our integrated generation and customer business, capturing value through optimizing our positions across the fleet. I talked a moment ago about customers choosing existing nuclear to meet their energy demands and we continue to meet our customers' need for hourly match clean energy. We recently signed 2 deals with 2 of our largest customers that I just want to briefly mention. In each case, we converted these customers from a renewable-only product to a product that now uses nuclear energy to fill in the gaps when renewables don't operate. Each will ensure that our customers have full-time power, clean power each and every hour that they are consuming it. The first is with Comcast. It's a new deal that includes offtake from new solar facility.\nThe second, which will be announced in the coming weeks, converts an existing core deal, which again is Constellation's off-site renewables program to now include hourly matched carbon-free energy with energy from our nuclear plants. So our customers are recognizing that in order to meet their goals and make the difference for their business, they need full-time clean power to run their full-time businesses. So now with that, I'll turn it over to Dan for the financial update.\nDan?\n\nDaniel L. Eggers\n\nAnalyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Beginning on Slide 9, we earned $2.78 per share in GAAP earnings and $1.82 per share in adjusted operating earnings, which is $1.04 per share higher than last year. As Joe mentioned, our commercial business has continued to perform very well. They do this through our generation to load portfolio optimization strategy, and we take advantage of our physical position in the markets to capture more value to the combined generation and customer businesses than they could if they were apart.\nOn the margin front, we are seeing margins come in better than planned and continue to trend higher than our long-term averages that we use in forecasting, as we discussed with you all on the last call. In addition, we had more nuclear output year-over-year and saw lower costs for our refueling outages in the quarter. And as a reminder, this was the first full quarter with contribution from our ownership share in the South Texas project. And speaking of first, this is the first quarter the nuclear production tax credit was in effect, favorably contributing to our earnings even after sharing some of the value of the PTC with our states. And as a reminder, we forecast the full year PTC value for our business based on the expected gross receipts at each plant.\nSo as prices realized through the year different from where we started the year, the value of the PTC can change relative to forecast, but the overall net earnings for Constellation should be the same as the mix of energy revenues and PTCs will balance to get us to the same place. Finally, our soft performance year-to-date has resulted in higher compensation expense year-over-year due to the timing of how we book compensation expense, it results in higher O&M during the quarter, and it will for the full year as well. We remain very comfortable with our earnings guidance range of $7.23 to $8.03 per share.\nTurning to the financing and liquidity update on Slide 10. I'm excited to expand upon some of the accomplishments that Joe mentioned in his opening remarks. As he said, firm clean megawatts are the most valuable commodity in the market today, and we own more nuclear generation in competitive power markets than all of our peers combined. We look at the opportunities ahead of us, continue to view our stock is compelling at the current share price, even after the strong performance we have already enjoyed this year.\nIn March, we entered into a $350 million accelerated share repurchase agreement, bringing our total repurchases to $500 million year-to-date. We have now executed $1.5 billion of share repurchases since the first quarter of 2023, buying back approximately 13.5 million shares in total. Having completed $0.5 billion authorization from December, we're happy to announce that our Board authorized an incremental $1 billion, bringing the total program to $3 billion. We will remain opportunistic with the remaining $1.5 billion authorization and still see our stock is attractive. Our high investment-grade credit ratings are a core principle to our capital allocation strategy. Our ratings are further strengthened by Moody's upgrade to Baa1 in March bringing it in line with S&P's BBB+ rating. The ratings action taken by Moody's recognizes the strong financial performance of the company and the stability provided by the nuclear PTC.\nLast, we issued the nation's first ever corporate green bond including nuclear with proceeds of $900 million. The funds from the 30-year issuance will be used to finance green projects such as nuclear uprates, who will increase the production of clean, carbon-free energy. We saw a significant demand despite pricing a bit a busy window for corporate supply allowing us to upsize from our initial target to $900 million, but still within our full year issuance plan. We also achieved very tight pricing when we look at both spreads and treasuries in line with 30-year holding company debt for regulated utilities. This is the second 30-year offering we have done in between the two, we had $10 billion in demand, demonstrating the strong investor confidence in us as a company and a belief that our assets will be a critical part of the U.S. energy mix for a long time to come.\nTurning to Slide 11 and our 2-year view of free cash generation and planned use of the cash. We'll update this slide and we make meaningful updates to our allocation plans like the increased share repurchase authorization we announced today, or the STP transaction last year. As you can see from the chart, even after the increase in share buyback authorization, -- we still have approximately $2.3 billion of unallocated capital in 2024 and 2025, providing considerable strategic flexibility for us to further benefit our owners. I'll now turn the call back to Joe for his closing remarks.\n\nJoseph Dominguez\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Dan. Constellations like no other company. We have a unique set of existing assets that create opportunities that no one else has. At our core, we have visible base earnings growth of 10% through the decade that is backstopped by the federal government through the nuclear PTC and has a built-in inflation adjustor. We're the largest and best operator of nuclear power plants in the United States. Our plants are especially well positioned to meet the challenge of reliability and clean that U.S. electricity markets need.\nOur more than 20% share of competitive C&I connects us to leaders in sustainability and the drivers of power demand, in particular, demand for sustainability products. Our country needs what we have, clean and dependable power generation to drive economic growth, support our national security and our environmental goals. Power demand is growing, and at the same time, reliability is becoming a premium product, and there is no more reliable power source than nuclear.\nIncreased demand, combined with the change of the electric system to be more dependent on intermittent, non-dispatchable resources means that we're going to see continued volatility and increased volatility for years to come. This presents an opportunity for us to drive additional value for our owners. In short, we think Constellation is a big part of the solution to America's energy supply. Our clean, reliable nuclear plants, coupled with our ability to offer customers what they need will support the energy transition and our national security. And that's why Republicans and Democrats recognize that nuclear is the backbone of the electric system today and will be tomorrow, and that support continues to grow.\nOn top of the opportunities we have from continued volatile power markets, and we've certainly seen movement in power markets. We have more than 180 million-megawatt hours of carbon-free electricity that we produce annually that can receive additional compensation through 24/7 clean attributes behind the meter opportunities, government procurements for clean energy and capturing prices above the PTC floor levels as we see increases in power prices as demand continues to ramp. These opportunities are on top of the 10% growth we have in our plan. Our task is to capture the additional opportunities as they unfold and to do better than our plan for our owners.\nWith that, let me open it up for questions."

[Operator Instructions] as a reminder, this call may be recorded.\nI would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Emily Duncan, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Strategic Growth. You may begin.\n\nEmily Duncan\n\nThank you, Latanya. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Constellation Energy Corporation's business and earnings outlook call. Leading the call today are Joe Dominguez, Constellation's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Eggers, Constellation's Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Constellation's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks.\nWe issued an 8-K this morning, which includes our earnings release detailing 2023 results along with a separate press release and business outlook presentation to be covered on today's call, all of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Constellation's website. The materials in the 8-K and other matters, which we discussed during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates regarding Constellation and its subsidiaries that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call.

Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures.\nPlease refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures.\nI'll now turn it over to Joe Dominguez, CEO of Constellation.\n\nJoseph Dominguez\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Emily. LaTanya, thanks for getting us started this morning and Emily for starting our agenda. Thank you all for joining us today. While this call is going to be focused on 2024 guidance and Constellation's future, I want to start out by commenting on the outstanding year we had in 2023, where we materially raised guidance in both the second and third quarter calls and yet still managed to exceed the top of the range in our full year results. It's Constellation's second full year in business, and I think it's powerful that in both years, we exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range and last year, just really [indiscernible] it. We hope that these results underscore for you the importance that our entire management team places on meeting all of our commitments to you, and we're going to continue to do that.\nAs always, the secret sauce here at Constellation is a unique mixture of best generation assets in the world and a best-in-class commercial business, all run by an outstanding team of women and men. And I want to take a moment thank them for the wonderful results because they're the ones that deserve the credit.\nTurning to 2024 in the future. I'm going to kick us off by focusing on our unique business and the advantages we see coming to us in this evolving marketplace. First, I'll talk a little bit about who we are, best operator of carbon-free nuclear plants in the world, backstopped by a nuclear PTC by the federal government and with a wide-reaching commercial business that's focused on the kinds of customers that need us the most.\nSecond, that in the changing power markets, we provide something that I think others struggle to do. And that's carbon-free energy and reliability together. We think that's going to be the bedrock of the future for the country. And third, that we're best positioned to capture value in volatile markets and through the energy transition by selling the clean and reliable attributes of our 180 million-megawatt hour nuclear fleet.\nNow Dan is going to follow up and discuss our 2024 EPS guidance range of $7.23 to $8.03 per share, our visible 10%-plus growth on the vast majority of our earnings through the end of the decade, which we call base EPS and our updated 2-year free cash flow outlook. Dan also will cover some of our new disclosures and walk you through that. And I appreciate that we've already heard this morning from a number of investors who find those to be very useful. Hopefully, you all will.\nSo let's get started on Page 5 of the materials. Constellation is a special company that supports our countries and our customers' economic growth and sustainability goals. As we've said from the very beginning when we launched this company, the most important and valuable energy commodity in the world today is carbon-free electricity that operates predictably and reliably. And we produce more of that than anyone. Our fleet has the best track record stretching back for well over a decade as being both the most cost-effective and reliable in the world. Our scale cannot be replicated because we already own more competitive nuclear generation than all of the other U.S. competitive nuclear generators combined.\nLikewise, our assets have a special longevity. The longevity of our asset base is unparalleled, and we could operate for at least another 30 to 40 years. In a conflicted political world, nuclear energy emerges as a consensus pick for both Republicans and Democrats because of its unique qualities. The reach of our customer business serving nearly 1/4 of all of the commercial industrial demand in the U.S. and 3/4 of the Fortune 100 puts us in the best position to use our unique assets and capabilities to meet the needs of our customers.\nIn the same vein, the combination of our assets and commercial business give us the ability to earn enhanced earnings over and above the base earnings of the company, just as we did the first 2 years of our business. We will continue to use our high investment-grade balance sheet and disciplined approach to capital allocation to create value for you including through share buybacks because we firmly believe in the future value of this company. And as our nuclear fleet and customer business help meet the growing demand for clean, reliable energy to power the U.S. economy, there are multiple opportunities for us to generate base earnings growth beyond the 10% that we're laying out today. And I'll walk you through that.\nThe world clearly is moving in our direction. In the coming years, the demand for reliable and clean energy will only grow. We're the ones that are best positioned to meet that growing demand for clean energy and to tackle the energy transition to unlock the value through compensation for the unique, clean and reliable attributes of our 180 million-megawatt hours of nuclear and to help America power the technologies of the future, whether that be EVs, electric heating, industrial electrification or the booming demand for the data economy that America must lead in for both economic and national security reasons.\nThe production tax credit uniquely gives us the ability to be patient so that we could capture the value in this evolving market through strategic hedging and portfolio optimization. Simply stated, because of the PTC, we can now decide whether and frankly, how to hedge our fleet. We don't have to hedge 1/3, 1/3, 1/3. And that option, that flexibility is enormously valuable and will drive enhanced earnings for us and we could use the cash flow from these earnings to consolidate the industry that on ourselves through buybacks and make double-digit unlevered returns on growth investments.\nIn some, no other company has such a potent combination of predictable growth, upside exposure to power markets, strong cash flows and the downside protection from the federal government.\nLet's turn to Slide 6. As I mentioned a moment ago, this team is committed to delivering on the promises we make because we know that delivering on promises is the way to create long-term sustainable value for our owners. So as we celebrate Constellation's second anniversary as an independent company, Slide 6 is a summary of the promises we made to you, promises we have kept. It's a long list, but I just want to highlight a few items. As I noted earlier, we've outperformed our financial expectations. Our balance sheet remains a competitive advantage and is now BBB, thanks to upgrades at both S&P and Moody's. We've accumulated growth of our dividend of 150%, exceeding our 10% annual target. We have also completed our first $1 billion buyback, and we started a second $1 billion buyback in January.\nNow for several calls, I've reiterated that we're happy to buy our shares all day long, and we still feel that way. And I'm proud to say that, that commitment to the future of value of this company has already delivered value for you.\nBuying back our own shares has been one of our best investments. It's already created $400 million in value. We successfully advocated for the inclusion of the nuclear PTC in the IRA, which is a game changer for our business. We've had a disciplined approach to M&A, adding our ownership in SDP to our fleet because of our focus on dual unit nuclear power plants and the competitive advantage they have.\nWe made the smart decision to aggressively by fuel and secure cost for this decade and beyond. We created a narrowly matched carbon-free energy product for our customers, and we're selling that product now to sustainability leaders like Microsoft. And I think it's going to position us well in this data economy. We've begun the process to extend the lives of our nuclear fleet, which brings our asset lives to 80 years. And we've maintained our status, and this is the most important thing. We've maintained our status as the best operator of nuclear power plants in the world. We're very excited to have accomplished all of that and all the things that are listed on this slide in 2 short years, but we're even more excited about what the future brings.\nAs I turn to Slide 7, we've talked about this before, but I want to spend a few moments talking about how the nuclear PTC and how it's fundamentally changed our business now that the program is in effect. Prior to the PTC, the outlook for our nuclear fleet was dependent on power prices, low or high, and our revenues would fluctuate year-over-year, sometimes quite significantly. The PTC has changed that. At its core, the PTC ensures that our fleet will have revenue visibility starting at $43.75 per megawatt hour in 2024. This provides our fleet with significant downside protection, ensuring its operation but we keep the upside above the PTC floor. And the upside is unlimited.\nIn addition, as you can see on the left-hand side of the chart, the PTC floor revenue grows with inflation and will support our earnings per share growth target. Now we're assuming that the PTC grows at 2% in our financial disclosures, including our 10% growth rate target. However, as you could see on the right, higher inflation than 2% would have a significant positive impact on our revenue growth. So if you believe that 2% is going to be hard to hold for a decade or more, this is a company that you ought to be interested in. For example, in 2028, the difference in revenue between the 2% and 3% inflation cases is more than $750 million and in a 3% inflation case, our EPS growth rate would be in the mid- to high teens rather than the 10% we're talking about on this call. It's really quite significant.\nLet me turn to Slide 8. And what we want to talk about here is the public support that's growing as well as the political support between Republicans and Democrats who recognize the importance to our energy system of baseload power, baseload clean power from a transition and a national security standpoint. You have quotes here from both President Biden and former President Trump, both whom are proponents of nuclear energy.\nPrior to the PTC, states stepped up with programs to ensure that these valuable resources do not prematurely retire. Now in Illinois, some of those programs were signed by Republican governors. Other times, they were signed by Democratic Governors. At the federal level, it was federal -- it was a former President and Trump, and you might recall this, he was focused on the need to retain baseload energy. It was the right idea. And remember, he proposed using DOE's authority, its emergency authority under 202C to support existing nuclear plants when he was in office. And it was Republicans both in the House and the Senate who were among the first to introduce tax credit bills for nuclear. So in a sharply divided political world where the parties don't seem to agree on much, each party recognizes the unique and critical nature of nuclear energy and how essential it is to our country. So as a consequence, we believe that the policy is durable now and into the future.\nLet's go to Slide 9. Slide 9 kind of shows you the many reasons why policymakers and the public have come to appreciate nuclear and I think it really does a good job here of summing up the case for nuclear. On the upper left-hand side, you could see that nuclear produces more energy for the same amount of installed capacity than any other energy technology. It operates more than 90% of the time, in our case, operates 95% of the time. And that's nearly 3 to 4x greater and wind and solar. It's also there 24 hours a day in the heat of the cold, day or night, no matter the weather. The grid reliability and support provided by nuclear is unparalleled by any other energy resource. And I got to tell you, this is not theoretical. We've already seen this an event after event, whether it was the polar vortex and [indiscernible] the Elliott Event, the Uri Event or numerous others, it was nuclear that carried this system on its shoulders and people know that.\nNow moving to the bar charts on the upper right side of Slide 9. Note the existing nuclear plants could run at least for 39 more years. And I'd say at least because we believe that some of our plants could actually run to 100 years, much longer than existing wind and solar operating today, and it's also longer than all the renewables that are being built right now, and we think all the renewables that will be built this decade.\nGoing to the chart on the lower left shows that nuclear has the lowest life cycle emissions of any technology. This is a big thing from a sustainability standpoint. Now we've included here everything from construction to the mining of fuel in this calculation. And that makes nuclear the best technology from a climate perspective. And then on the lower right-hand side of the slide, you can see that nuclear is essentially tied with solar as the safest technology, highlighting the safe operations of nuclear plants and the abundant power they produce and their ability to do that without emitting harmful pollutants into the atmosphere.\nAnd finally, look, unlike any other technology, nuclear is the only generation resource where we know and control where every gram of fuel is, and we have set aside the funds to restore the sites to greenfield condition after eventual plant retirements many decades from now. So in a nutshell, whether you're talking about sustainability, safety, reliability, waste management or long-lived durability, Nuclear offers benefits at levels that no other resource can. And that's not all. It uses a lot less land. It could be positioned almost anywhere and it creates more family-sustaining jobs than any other generation type for us, right? We just start -- we started the company with 13,000 employees. In the last 2 years, we hired 2,500 people and these are long-term jobs and the communities love those jobs. And of course, the politicians love those jobs. Nuclear is the backbone of the energy system now, and it will become even more important in the future.\nSo as we turn to Slide 10, I want to start talking to you about the kind of changing energy fundamentals we're seeing in the market. We all know that the clean energy transition must happen, and it is happening and Constellation's role in it will only grow. But as American transitions, there will be impacts on electric reliability and electric markets. BIA, the Energy Information Administration forecast that installed generation has to grow. And what you could see on the chart on the left-hand side is that what we're seeing is intermittent generation replacing dispatchable generation. It's been happening for a while. At the same time in the market, if you look at the chart on the right-hand side, you could see we're beginning to see for the first time load growth.\nAnd I'd say for the first time, we've seen load growth in places like Texas. But of course, PJM, we've kind of seen a flat line on load growth for a decade or more, but that is changing. PJM's peak demand forecast for 2028 increased by 2% just in the last year. ERCOT's forecast for 2028 increased a whopping 6.6% that increases being driven by economic development across the country. This past year, more than 200 manufacturing facilities have been announced and almost 0.5 trillion investments have been made since 2021. We're seeing onshoring of businesses from Europe and other parts of the world that simply don't enjoy America's affordable energy dominance. And we're seeing onshoring of supply chains here in America due to political tensions that are rising between the U.S., China and other nations. We're seeing electrification of transportation, buildings and manufacturing. We're seeing increases in the frequency of extreme weather events driving peak demand growth. And the demand growth is being talked about quite frequently in the data economy where AI is driving significant increase in these forecasts. So we think the combination of the energy transition, deteriorating supply reliability as we lose dispatchable generation and rising demand is all going to put a premium on clean energy resources that are reliable. And again, we own more of them than anybody in the world. And in short, we're seeing the signs in this marketplace for the first time in a while where we're seeing prices begin to converge on the cost of new build. And I don't know that we know that cost just yet. When we think about the offshore wind that has been challenged in the Mid-Atlantic and other areas. We're now seeing prices that are well above $100 a megawatt hour, and that's without the kinds of storage and other things that would be required to make those things anywhere close to the reliability of a nuclear power plant.\nSo as I turn to Slide 11, we want to kind of talk a little bit about the data economy. I know that it is something that is a focus for many of our investors. Boston Consulting Group believes that AI and regular data center demand will grow by 7% to 7% of total electricity demand by 2030. To put this in context, this is the equivalent of the electricity used for lighting in every home business and factory across the United States. It's a huge amount of energy. Most traditional data centers that were built 10 years ago were 10 megawatts or less. Today, it's not uncommon to see 100-megawatt data centers. And with our clients, we're talking about data centers that approach 1,000 megawatts. And they require 24/7 power. This is something that doesn't get talked about enough in my opinion. When we do system planning and I've done this over the course of my career, we don't just kind of willy nilly decide what generation we want? We first look at the load profile, what's growing in the economy. So for example, if it's peaking load like air conditioning or electric heating as an example, as we get into the energy transition that kind of load growth will call for a particular kind of generation, peaking gas, [ mid-merit gas ] or in the future batteries. But if the load growth is 24/7 base load growth, then it calls for a very different technology, and that's us.\nData centers are 24/7 consumers. We are 24/7 producers. So it's kind of a perfect marriage. And then when we add on top of that, our ability to provide clean energy to meet the sustainability objectives of this company. We think that there is an opportunity for us that is quite sizable. And we think the advantage Constellation could bring quite frankly, is that it could meet this demand across multiple jurisdictions, and we could frankly serve the needs of some of even the largest customers in the world. So it is certainly exciting for us and something I'm sure we'll talk about.\nAs we turn to Slide 12, what we're going to talk about here in 12 and 13 is both seasonal and day-to-day variability. And what I want to put in your mind is the challenge of serving load when we're seeing this sort of variability, a challenge that we don't believe we face at Constellation given the profile of our generation assets. Now look, before we start this, I want to be clear. We think renewables have an important place in our efforts to decarbonize. Constellation's off-site renewable business has grown rapidly and we're on track to grow the business by 3% to 4% of the volumes that we were talking about just in 2021.\nSo our customers very much like renewable energy, but they also are striving to get to 24/7 clean energy. And the intermittency of renewables does create some challenges for grid operators. So what you could see on this slide here is really kind of a macro seasonal disconnect between the performance of renewables and demand growth. You could see here that demand growth, no surprise here, is peaking in July and August. And we also see that a lot of renewable assets are underperforming in that period of time. When I did a lot of work in the Midwest, it was very common for a 10-year period or more that we would see capacity factors for wind in the Midwest drop to 5% or lower on the very hottest day as beer. That's why people talk about hot still days, it happens.\nAnd so again, it's -- if you have a lot of dispatchable energy, you can address this, but as dispatchable energy is retiring, this load has to be picked up by nuclear plants. It's one of the challenges we face. So it's not just a seasonal challenge. As we flip to Slide 13, you kind of see this on a day-to-day basis, particularly in the spring and the winter, these moves could be 50% of production or to give you some sense of the dimensionality of this. It's the equivalent of instantaneously turning on and off 5 nuclear reactors without notice. And so if you step back, you could well imagine that managing this much day-to-day and seasonal variability in the system that expect certainty and reliability is going to be a big challenge, and we're seeing that. but it's also an opportunity for us because as other firms are selling into this market and they have to deal with clients that need 24/7 power, right, and clean power like utilities, like the data economy. They have to translate the ability to find this power in the market into higher risk premiums into their bid, right? because there's going to be scarcity in certain hours. But that's not true for Constellation. Because our unique blend of reliability and clean assets gives us the ability to meet customer demand in any single hour. So those higher competitive risk premiums that other folks see turn into higher margins at Constellation and our owners benefit from better results and enhanced earnings while our customers benefit from reliable energy and sustainability.\nLet's take a look at Slide 14. We put an ERCOT slide in here because in many respects, we think ERCOT is an example of where other markets are going. And so that's just a powerful data point here. In 2023, ERCOT had 222 hours where demand exceeded 80,000 megawatts compared to just one hour in 2022. ERCOT also exceeded the all-time summer peak demand set in 2022 and 2021 by 11.8 gigawatts for an incredible 16%. And the system isn't just constrained at peak, I think historically, we would have said, well, then there are challenges at peak. But what we're really seeing here, and I think this chart does a really nice job of it, is that it's not necessarily peak demand that is driving high prices. When wind and solar make up less than 26% of the total demand, the prices in Texas start to move dramatically higher and kind of asymmetrically higher and into the thousands of dollars per megawatt hour. These high prices are signals that the market is giving to investors that there's a premium on reliability. And these prices quickly carry over into the average price of the year. For example, every hour at the maximum price of $5,000 per megawatt hour impacts the full year price around the clock energy price by $0.50 per megawatt hour. So you don't have to see a ton of these hours to move energy prices, and we've seen that. And we think that what's happening in ERCOT is eventually going to happen in other markets to different degrees. And frankly, ERCOT has some advantages in that the solar and wind profiles there are among the very best in the entire nation.\nSo the thematic is this. Reliability is equally as important as sustainability and we have to solve for both. And that's why we say the most valuable energy commodity in the world today is a commodity that does both of those things. And that's what Constellation owns. Nuclear sustainability attributes were ridiculously undervalued for so many years. And it's now beginning to be recognized, but it's only the beginning and we're still a long way off, as I mentioned before, of fully understanding or evaluating what clean and reliable energy together means. We think that spells a very good future for Constellation to exceed what we're talking about this morning.\nAs I turn to Slide 15, our states were the first to recognize how vital nuclear was in supporting the economy and the environment. New York, Illinois, New Jersey, Connecticut, they had controversial programs, I would say, in the ZEC programs for nuclear initially, but they all look pretty prescient now, don't they? And what we're seeing is that customers are following their lead showing a more willingness to contract for the attributes of our fleet. And we have quite a few ways to monetize getting paid for these attributes. And we're going to be able to sell those more and more as the state programs roll off. And as we progress through the decade, you could see on the chart on the left-hand side, we're going to have a full 180 million-megawatt hours of clean nuclear power to sell annually that is leveraged at exactly the right time these transitions in energy market and the economy are occurring.\nAnd so as I talked about it earlier, we see opportunities in the data center area for 24/7 clean generation because of the sustainable needs, because they need energy 24/7 and our dual unit sites are competing for behind the fence line opportunities with those technologies. Depending on the outcome of the treasury -- final treasury rules and if we don't get the right outcome, depending on the outcome of litigation, hydrogen remains an opportunity for us going forward. We are committed to the view that we are correct in the interpretation of the statute and will win.\nThe states and the federal government are now entering into the marketplace to look for hourly match carbon-free energy. We've seen that in the case of ComEd. And we continue to see opportunity with our customer C&I customers who want to follow the lead that Microsoft and ComEd have set for an hourly matched clean energy product. Importantly, when we talk about the 10% growth for base earnings through the decade, these opportunities aren't included in either our forecast or our expected growth rate. Now that's a little bit early to share what we think the value of the attributes would be. And I think this is the kind of thing that gets -- needs to get updated as contracts get signed. But if you just look at the chart on the upper right-hand side, you could kind of see the impact. If we sold attributes for half of our fleet at $10 per megawatt hour, and I'm not signaling that $10 the right price isn't. But that alone would be $900 million of additional revenue. And since there's no additional cost test to generate the revenues, the upside would be more than $2 of additional earnings per share. So you can kind of see how both inflation and the sale of attributes meaningfully change the 10% growth rate and make sizable leads to upwards of 20% or more. And remember, while we pursue the opportunities from the market through attribute sales, our revenues are protected by the PTC.\nOn Slide 16, I want to bring back a couple of the points I've already made. We're the largest generator of nuclear power in the country, all of which sits in competitive markets. And you could see from the chart on the left-hand slide here that if you accumulated all of the other merchant or competitive nuclear in the market, it still doesn't total what Constellation is. But more than that, our fleet is overwhelmingly dual units. If you think about the 25 units we're invested in, all but Clinton and Ginna our dual unit sites that enjoy those economics. And that's important both from the cost of producing the megawatt hour, but also behind the fence line opportunities with data centers and others.\nWe're the cleanest generator with the most attributes to sell in the market. And because we could operate in competitive markets, we have the opportunity to create value unlike any regulated peer. And we're the best operator of plans, and we've led the industry, and you could see this on the right-hand side, and we produce more energy by something like 4% of capacity factor than the industry average. That doesn't sound like a lot. But operating 4% better than the industry average is the equivalent of having another reactors worth of power or for you, $335 million in additional revenues with costs only higher for the fuel consumed.\nIf I turn to Slide 17, I want to talk a little bit about what we're seeing in the competitive C&I market and how these businesses kind of fit together very well from our perspective. The story here isn't just about sheer size. You could see on the upper chart here that we're the second largest retail supplier. It's the composition of the customers that we have. We've been focused from the beginning on the C&I customer base. Again, when you think about our generation profile, providing 24/7 power, we want to have the kinds of customers that have a load profile, demand profile that works best with our machines. And that is commercial and industrial customers.\nSecondly, these are the kinds of customers that have sustainability goals. So as we introduce products like 24/7 and as we continue to roll out core with its sizable growth, which is our offsite renewable program, it's become a real win-win for Constellation and its customers, and we could serve that load with lower risk than others meaning the margin expansion that we foresee will go into our earnings.\nNow Slide 18 talks about how we're uniquely positioned to help our C&I customers meet their demand. And frankly, like our country, Customers are on a journey here to meet environmental and sustainability goals. And to do that in a way that is most affordable. And we've positioned the business to be a great partner to these customers. We anticipated the drive for clean energy, and so we created the emissions-free energy certificates, the effects that now effectively memorialize nuclear generation. We've worked with PJM and other RTOs to have the data available to the market so that customers could see the hourly match because we know that this is moving towards hourly match and already has.\nCustomers wanted energy tied to specific projects. So we created our core off-site renewables program, and we work with renewable developers to match their projects with our customers. And as I've said several times here, we're leading the way with the first truly hourly match carbon-free program in the market. Customers now get to see a particular asset that produces their clean energy where we need it. And the big thing here, folks, I think the change has been the acceptance of nuclear as a sustainability solution, been around for a long time. And years ago, we couldn't get customers to look at nuclear, regardless of its economics, it's reliability or its environmental benefits. But that's changed. States led the way and customers increasingly accept nuclear and that opens the door for us to have a sales discussion. And once customers see what we could do from an affordability and time match perspective, they like it. And our customers are exploring behind-the-meter opportunities and we're looking at different partnerships as that landscape evolves.\nAs we move from just energy to more sustainability products. The other thing we're looking at is the duration of the contracts tends to expand. And so we see margins significantly above historic margins and the duration of term that is significantly longer. And that adds to visibility of our earnings for the decade and beyond. Our customer relationships and the focus on C&I will put us on the path to monetize the assets that we have, we uniquely have and the reliable and clean energy.\nSo I'll close this part of the presentation with Slide 19. The success in the outperformance of the past few years would not have happened had we not had this unique world-class generation portfolio with the best commercial team in the business. And we've integrated those 2 things as one part of the platform. Over the past 2 years, our commercial business has demonstrated that it could thrive in volatile and changing markets. And I think that's what we're going to see going forward. I think all of the data indicates volatility and change both from growing demand and the turnover and the composition of the fleet is going to lead the volatility and our team is well positioned to handle that because of the stability of our assets. So we're going to be able to price in higher margins to customers to manage their exposure through these volatile moments. We're going to be able to optimize our individual generation and load positions to create the best position using both understanding that we control fully now when we hedge, we're going to be able to sell customized sustainability solutions. And these businesses will work in tandem to serve our customers, help America transition and provide the carbon-free and reliable energy that we need. And I think it's going to produce results that are better than our current plan.\nSo now I'll turn it over to Dan to talk a little bit about the financial outlook and some of the changes that we've made. And again, very much appreciate the positive comments we already received. Dan?\n\nDaniel L. Eggers\n\nAnalyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)\n\nThank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. We're very proud of what we've accomplished since we launched, and we're even more excited about what lies ahead. I'm starting on Slide 21.\nAs Joe outlined, the nuclear PTC has fundamentally changed our business by providing revenue visibility, supporting earnings growth through its built-in inflation adjustment and protected against power market downside by providing a floor or base level of earnings while maintaining exposure to higher prices. From a mechanical perspective, the PTC will be treated as an after-tax revenue stream that will fill the gap between spot revenues at each plant. What we consider the after-tax earnings support our high investment-grade credit ratings and our strong free cash flow generation to support reinvestment or return of capital to our owners. We are transitioning our primary financial metric to operating EPS. Our guidance range for 2024 is $7.23 to $8.03 per share up considerably from the $6.28 earned in 2023, which I'll remind you as well ahead of our original expectations for last year.\nOn Page 31 of the appendix, we provide 2023 EPS by quarter to help you calibrate against last year. And since EPS is new, the easy rule of thumb is every $4 million of pretax equals $0.01 of EPS and ties back to some of Joe's slides earlier. More than just helping to prompt the change to EPS, the nuclear PTC is reshaping how we approach the sale of electricity from our nuclear plants. Historically, we hedge on a 3-year ratable basis to provide earnings visibility support our credit metrics and ensure that we have the cash needed to run the business with the downside revenue protection from the Nuclear PTC and current interpretation of gross receipts. We no longer need to hedge our generation output in the same way, allowing us to better take advantage the power price moves. This also means the traditional way of modeling the company is changing.\nTo help, we are also introducing new disclosures also provide simplicity, a longer time horizon and greater visibility into our business that you've all been asking for.\nTurning to Slide 22. Our total earnings can be thought of in 2 parts. First, we have a significant portion of our business, which delivers consistent, visible and easy to calculate earnings that will grow over time. This goes beyond the support the PTC provides our nuclear fleet and includes our commercial business and non-nuclear assets. We call these base earnings, and they can be easily modeled to use simple PxQ. For example, retail margins x volumes sold and the nuclear PTC price x generation output. Base earnings for 2024 of $5.45 to $5.55 per share, which we are confident will grow at least 10% through the decade.\nI'll discuss the tools for calculating base earnings in a moment. To get to our total EPS, we have a second bucket that we call enhanced earnings. Our company consistently makes more money than what is captured and the easy to calculate base earnings, but these earnings don't comport to the same PxQ math and can also vary year-to-year depending on market opportunities.\nOur extraordinary results last year, a good example of outsized value capture, created by market volatility that provided an opportunity for greater margins. When we look forward, you can think about enhanced earnings [indiscernible] including stronger-than-average retail margins, realized power prices above the PTC floor and capture value from volatility driven by the factors Joe talked about. We feel comfortable that enhanced EPS will add at least 10% to 20% to total EPS on top of base earnings, but we're doing better than that in 2024 and 2025 due to the big backlog gains and forward power prices in those years. This breakdown in the base and enhanced earnings are modeling tools, which will help provide visibility into our disclosures and greater clarity into our business.\nWe plan to refresh the split on base and enhanced once a year when we provide new guidance on the fourth quarter earnings call. During the year and for our quarterly results, we only report total EPS.\nTurning to Slide 23. Through the end of the decade, our base EPS will grow at a compound rate of at least 10%. And we see opportunity to do better since this outlook assumes a 2% inflation rate for the PTC adjustment, does not include getting paid for our clean and reliable attributes through data centers or additional CFE sales that Joe talked about or margin expansion from our customer business that we have seen in recent years to name a few potential drivers. All of those items would be additive to our growth rate. I do want to be clear that the growth rate will not be a straight line. It will vary from year-to-year due to a variety of factors, including the lumpiness of the PTC floor adjustments as well as the number and duration of outages in any year. You can see this most clearly when looking at 2026. At 2% inflation, the PTC does not increase that year. And it is a heavy outage year where we also expect longer-than-normal outages because we'll start in selling our turbines for the upgrades of Byron and Braidwood.\nOver the long term, we are confident that we will grow base EPS by at least 10%, and we've included all the tools you need to be able to model and validate our outlook.\nMoving on to Slide 25. You can see the types of simple tools that can be used to calculate base earnings. The model inputs, including costs can be found on Pages 32 to 34 in the appendix and will help you model out to 2028. For our generation fleet, we provide expected generation x price. [indiscernible], this is broken down by the CMC units in Illinois, New York units inclusive of the ZEC revenues and the remaining PDC units.\nOn the nonnuclear side, we provide capacity prices and volumes, historical renewable PPA prices and minimum expected spark spreads. On the commercial side, we provide 13-year average historical and forecasted margins for both our power and gas businesses, which captures the vast majority of the base earnings for our commercial business. We have other businesses like Constellation Home, energy efficiency and portfolio management that year in and year out consistently contribute to our earnings. These tools will help to easily model Constellation well into the future giving you much longer visibility in the base earnings.\nMoving to the next slide. We know that we'll earn more each year than our base earnings, and you can see that with our outperformance in the last 2 years. As I mentioned earlier, these earnings are not as easy to model from a PxQ approach, it can vary year-to-year as we take advantage of market opportunities. That said, we are confident that we'll continue to drive additional value from our competitively advantaged businesses.\nFor 2024 and 2025, commercial margins will be above the 13-year average used in base EPS, which we've already put into backlog through forward sales made in '22 and '23. For example, in 2024, we are seeing electric margins $1.75 per megawatt hour more than the 13-year average as we've monetized recent commodity price volatility and as customers have wanted the certainty that a fixed price product offers them. Enhanced earnings are also benefiting from plants where power prices are above the PTC floor as well as optimizing positions between our retail and generation businesses.\nWhen we look into the future and the assumptions underpinning base EPS, we expect enhanced earnings to add at least 10% to 20% to total EPS in typical years, but see that contribution higher for the next couple of years given the extraordinary commercial margins we've locked in.\nOn Page 35 in the appendix, we provide some inputs around enhanced gross margin, this should help add dimension to this earnings stream.\nI'll now turn to our capital allocation plan on Page 26, which should look familiar to all of you. Our goal is to deliver value for our owners through the capital allocation plan on our philosophy on how to do so is unchanged. Our high investment-grade credit ratings are our foundation. Our strength has been recognized by both S&P through our recent upgrade of BBB+ and by being placed on positive outlook at Moody's. Our high investment-grade credit ratings and strong credit metrics reflect the high-quality nature of our business. We remain committed to the dividend, we'll grow our dividend per share by 25% this year, starting with the March 2024 dividend, bringing our total dividend increase since we started in 2022 to 150%. We'll continue to target 10% annual growth in future years. We will continue to invest in our assets, which will supply the grid with clean energy from our nuclear fleet for decades to come and help decarbonize the American economy.\nOur 2024 and 2025 capital plans can be found on Page 36 of the appendix. On growth, we will continue to be disciplined on both organic and inorganic opportunities making investments where we exceed our double-digit unlevered return threshold. Last year, we were thrilled by a large part of the South Texas Project nuclear plant. We'll continue to look for acquisitions to meet our business priorities and return thresholds. Over the next 2 years, we'll also invest in organic projects that will grow and continue the operations of our invaluable carbon-free assets. We're making investments at some of our plants to get them ready for future behind the meter demand and [indiscernible] remains an opportunity for us, but is immediately dependent on the outcome of the final rules of treasury.\nIn addition, we happily invested alongside our owners last year, completing our first $1 billion share repurchase program. Our Board authorized the next $1 billion program in December, we've already been buying this quarter. We're excited about the opportunities to invest in our business the right returns, but we're also more than happy to keep buying our own stock.\nTurning to Slide 27. Let's talk about our free cash flow for the next 2 years covering 2024 and 2025. Starting on the left, we forecast approximately $6 billion in free cash flow before growth after accounting for base CapEx and nuclear fuel, which is still a lot of money to deploy.\nAs I mentioned on the last slide, we have nearly $900 million in organic investments over the next 2 years with returns that exceed our double-digit threshold. $900 million will be returned to our owners and common dividends, reflecting this year's 25% increase and then the projected 10% future growth. We then plan to return another $1 billion to owners to the share repurchase authorized in December and have already completed $150 million of that authorization. That leaves us with approximately $3.1 billion to $3.5 billion of unallocated capital over the next 2 years. This unallocated capital provides us the flexibility to pursue our strategic priorities including M&A and additional organic growth as long as those projects meet our return thresholds. And as you've seen us do, if those opportunities do not materialize, we will return the capital to our owners. Thank you all for your time today. We're incredibly excited about the opportunities ahead of Constellation and our great growth story. We look forward to another strong year in 2024 and delivering on our financial commitments.\nI'll now turn the call back to Joe.\n\nJoseph Dominguez\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Dan. Look, I'm going to close here basically where I started. We've had a fantastic run for the first couple of years of this business. But as we look at the fundamentals of power markets, as we look at growing demand need for sustainability solutions, we think there is a ton of room to run yet. And we think we have very durable policy in the PTC because of the kind of the unique position we're in where both political parties have strongly supported nuclear energy for all of the reasons that we covered earlier in the presentation.\nAt our core, we have visible base earnings growth of 10% through the decade, backstopped by the PTC and again, our assets are the best in the world run by the best people that operate those sorts of plants in the world. And this company can't be replaced. There's simply not enough nuclear out there to replace it. And we all know from having seen [ Vogtle ] what the cost of new nuclear is. And notably, having 25 of these assets and having to just replace 2 of them at [indiscernible] was $35 billion, should give you some sort of insight in the replacement value of clean energy that is also 100% dependable throughout any sort of weather event.\nOur businesses -- our commercial and our generation business are a great marriage. That 24% share of the C&I business gives us the ability to connect our unique capabilities with some of the most sustainable companies in the country, and that just seems to be growing. As we look at the dynamics of energy markets, it's impossible not to conclude that if we're going to continue on the energy transition, that reliability is going to become just as important as sustainability and we're able to do both of those things. We just think that we're a huge part of the solution for America and our clean, reliable nuclear plants, coupled with our ability to reach customers and help them achieve their sustainability goals, supports our vision as being the leading company in this space. On top of the opportunities that we've talked about, we're going to have 180 million-megawatt hours of carbon-free electricity that we could receive additional compensation for through 24/7 sales behind meter opportunities, hydrogen subject to the final rules or the outcome of litigation, government procurements, of clean energy and just simply capturing prices above the PTC price floor as volatility continues and accelerates in the markets.\nAll of these opportunities are all on top of what is a wonderful profile for the company of growing a very base and predictable part of our business that comprises a huge chunk of our earnings by 10% per year. And Dan and I have already discussed how that number could be considerably better. So that's the reason as we talk about capital allocation, that we're happy to buy the shares of this company all day long. Because the road we've traveled for the first 2 years is nothing compared to the future that we're going to have as a company here at Constellation.\nWith that, I look forward to answering your questions with the rest of the management team here."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call may be recorded.\nI would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Emily Duncan, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nEmily Duncan\n\nThank you, Abigail. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Constellation Energy Corporation's Third Quarter earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Joe Dominguez, Constellation's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Eggers, Constellation's Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Constellation's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks.\nWe issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, all of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Constellation's website. The earnings release and other matters we discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates regarding Constellation and its subsidiaries that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Constellation's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and other circumstances and considerations that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations.\nToday's presentation also includes references to adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures.\nI'll now turn the call over to our CEO of Constellation, Joe Dominguez.\n\nJoseph Dominguez\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Emily. Thanks to the operator for getting us started. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. I apologize if the quality of the audio wasn't great. We are all, if you could believe it, sitting around Emily Duncan's cell phone here because we lost a trunk line into the building. But as you could see from our numbers, pretty much everything else is going well around here.\nI want to begin by thanking the good people of Constellation for delivering an awesome third quarter. They continued the strong performance from the first half of the year and they are the best at what they do. For the third quarter, we earned $1.199 billion in adjusted EBITDA. As a result of this continued strong performance, we are again raising our full year guidance range to $3.8 billion to $4 billion. The strength is not limited to 2023, and you will see in our disclosures that we have raised our 2024 gross margin by $250 million.\nI want to emphasize here that STP is not yet in our final disclosures for 2024. As you recall, we estimated the average STP EBITDA contribution to be an incremental $190 million per year with 2024 a little lower due to the fact that we have an extra outage every third year. And as it so happens, 2024 is one of those years. However, we believe that the impact of that extra outage will be offset by the higher Texas energy prices we have seen since we've announced the transaction. So we're back to an estimated $190 million for 2024 with 2025 looking even better. We will provide all of the STP and other updated financials in our fourth quarter call.\nWe talked about this before, but it bears repeating. Constellation owns the largest and most reliable clean energy fleet in the country and has the best C&I and commercial platform in the business. We strategically couple these businesses with a strong balance sheet and, in turn, gives us a powerful competitive advantage across retail and wholesale channels. It translates into a unique ability to give our customers the certainty and visibility that they want on energy costs as well as to provide them sustainability solutions. All of that ultimately leads to margin expansion and creates value for you.\nBefore I turn to the operational performance, I want to talk about some exciting developments since our last call. First, as I noted earlier, we closed ahead of schedule on our acquisition of 44% of the South Texas Project, expanding our clean, reliable annual nuclear production to approximately 180 million-megawatt hours. We're looking forward to working and forging a strong relationship with our new co-owners, Austin Energy and CPS. This includes working to resolve pending litigation and explore mutually beneficial opportunities to improve performance.\nI talked last quarter about the fact that an average outage at STP lasts around 31 days. At Byron, we just completed an outage for a very similar machine in 17 days. And if you think that's amazing, consider that we just completed the Peach Bottom outage in 13 days. I was happy to see that Bryan Hansen, our Chief Generation Officer, was named as Chairman of the STP Board and will begin immediately to realize some of the opportunities we see in that asset.\nThe second development I want to highlight is that the U.S. Department of Energy awarded a $1 billion grant to the Midwest Hydrogen Hub, which includes our hydrogen project at La Salle. A portion of this award will offset our cost for the project. The award is proof that the DOE and the administration want existing nuclear energy to play a vital role in jump-starting domestic clean hydrogen production. However, it remains critical that the Treasury Department guidance confirms that using existing nuclear energy to produce hydrogen qualifies for the full clean energy production tax credit. Certainly, we think that the hub award is a good sign, but we need to see the right rules or the hub won't happen.\nThird, we signed a deal with ComEd to power its facility with hourly matched clean free -- carbon-free energy, which I'll cover in more detail in a few minutes. And finally, probably the most exciting thing is that we earned a 2023 Great Place to Work certification. I'm really proud of this because it's based on how our employees rate their experience at Constellation. 5,000 of our colleagues participated in the survey and 81% of them said that Constellation is a great place to work. That's 24 percentage points higher than the average U.S. company.\nOur people are talented, hard-working and they're passionate about what they do, and that shows up in our results over and over again. Our culture and our mission is also an asset in attracting the best talent in the market. We've onboarded 3,000 new colleagues since separation. That's pretty incredible for a workforce of about 14,000 people.\nNow I'll turn to the quarterly operational updates, starting on Slide 6. During the hottest summer on record, our fleet helped to support the grid and ensure that American families can cool their homes and that businesses have the electricity to power our economy. Our nuclear plants had a third quarter capacity factor of 97.2% but they ran at nearly 100% during June, July and August. The only reason we're at 97.2% is that in September, we started our planned refueling outages.\nOur power and renewable assets also ran extremely well. Our Texas fleet, which includes state-of-the-art CCGTs, produced 1.4 million megawatt hours more this year than last year, supporting ERCOT during an extremely challenging summer. This summer, ERCOT was affected not only by extreme heat but by unprecedented load and the impacts of a changing resource mix. For example, during the summer, ERCOT had 49 days with a peak higher than 80 gigawatts, exceeding the all-time summer peak demand set in '22 and exceeding 2021's peak by nearly 11.8 gigawatts or an incredible 16%.\nThe system is constrained not just at peak but in the hours after peak due to the intermittent output that comprises much of its generation portfolio. As the grid continues to change, we expect these conditions to amplify, and challenges could occur at any hour. The changes in ERCOT stack and the hours of challenging operating conditions will increase the importance of dispatchable generation and particularly clean, reliable, dispatchable generation. The quality of our gas fleet, coupled with our newly acquired STP assets sets us up for great success. I'd like to send a special thank you to the people who operate our nuclear and power fleets for all that they do.\nNow let me move to Slide 7. The success of the Commercial business is the foundation for our financial performance. This year, they knocked the cover off the ball. We're able to optimize our positions across both the generation and customer portfolios to create additional gross margin. And we can provide our customers certainty on energy bills in volatile times, which leads to margin expansion. We're also leading the way on sustainability solutions.\nIn the second quarter, we spent time talking about the Microsoft deal where we use nuclear and renewable energy to produce a time-matched clean energy product. We continue to see very strong interest in this product. This quarter, we're excited to announce an agreement with one of the largest utilities in the country, ComEd, to power its facilities with hourly match carbon-free energy from nuclear power.\nMicrosoft and ComEd are both sustainability leaders, and we're thrilled to be able to help them move forward in their efforts to address the climate crisis through the recognition of the importance of 24/7 carbon-free electricity made by nuclear energy. Matching regionally produced clean energy to the exact moment when a customer uses energy is essential to reaching carbon reduction goals while maintaining electric reliability and affordability. That is why our nuclear fleet is essential today and will be even more valuable tomorrow.\nWith that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan for the financial update.\n\nDaniel L. Eggers\n\nAnalyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Beginning on Slide 8, as Joe mentioned, the business continues to perform extremely well. We earned $1.199 billion in adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter, which compares to $592 million in the third quarter of last year. Our commercial organization continued with the success we have seen over recent quarters.\nOur renewal rates have been strong and margins remain above historical levels as market volatility and the desire of customers to control their budgets have created opportunity for our team. As we've discussed on prior calls, the volatility in commodity markets and higher interest rates are leading to more appropriate risk pricing by our competitors. These market conditions create opportunity for us to optimize our combined portfolio of generation and load, which we see in results for 2023 and as we look at the '24 and '25 with favorable gross margin uplift that I'll talk about in a moment.\nOn the generation front, our nuclear and power fleet performed extremely well during a record-setting hot summer. As Joe said, our nuclear fleet ran full out during June, July and August. And as a result of the extreme heat and load growth in Texas, ERCOT set 10 new peak demand records during the summer. In addition to record peaks, we observed more significant operating conditions in the subsequent hours after the peak load due to low intermittent output and a stretched thermal fleet which, at times, resulted in places above $1,000 a megawatt hour and is a $5,000 cap for a few hours.\nInvestments we made in our Texas fleet in advance of summer ensured we were ready to help support the grid when the plants were needed, and they ran more than they did the previous year. Through September, our Texas plants ran 13% more than they did last year.\nTurning to Slide 9 and our gross margin outlook. We have increased our gross margin forecast for 2023 and 2024, incorporating the continued strong execution and performance Joe and I have discussed. For 2023, total gross margin increased by $400 million to $9.2 billion. Our projected gross margin is now $850 million higher than our expectations when we began the year, reinforcing the unparalleled operating environment we have seen this year.\nIn 2024, our total gross margin including PTC's is $9.45 billion. Total gross margin increased by $250 million from our last update. Market prices increased across the major regions relative to last quarter. As a result, we expect to earn less nuclear PTC revenues at our 4 plants without state support due to higher expected gross receipts.\nTurning to our Commercial business. As we renew existing contracts and enter into new ones, we are seeing the favorable margin trends with our C&I customers and load auctions extending out into 2025. We have seen some moderation in margins from highs earlier this year and more participants in load auctions, but see opportunity for these margin trends to continue for some time as we anticipate sustained commodity market volatility, in part, due to the changing composition of the generation stack.\nWith the strength of our balance sheet, along with our integrated generation and load business, we are well positioned during this volatile environment to continue meeting our customers' needs while also creating value for our shareholders.\nMoving to Slide 10. We are raising our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance outlook by $400 million to a $3.9 billion midpoint and narrowing the range to $3.8 billion to $4 billion. This upward revision reflects the significant increase to our gross margin forecast since the beginning of the year. And as we flagged last quarter, the gross margin upside is somewhat tempered by an increase to O&M, driven primarily by increased compensation for our employees, including stock compensation due to the strong financial performance of the company.\nI should note that just -- considering that we just closed the STP acquisition last week, our gross margin and cost forecast do not yet reflect STP. We'll layer that plant into our year-end disclosures. That said, our updated EBITDA guidance for 2023 includes STP for November and December, which is a relatively small part of the increase to our guidance. And as Joe mentioned in his remarks, we anticipate contribution from STP to at least meet the $190 million of EBITDA starting in 2024, which again is not reflected in the gross margin or cost disclosures and in our earnings materials today.\nTurning to the financing and liquidity update on Slide 11. To help fund the STP transaction, we issued $1.4 billion of debt, including $900 million of 30-year and $500 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes. We saw significant demand with order books peaking at 7x across both tranches. We also achieved very tight pricing when we look at both spreads to treasuries and between the 10- and 30-year tranches, pricing competitively with recent utility holding company transactions.\nWe appreciate the support from our fixed income owners and the vote of confidence in the long-term need for our into the 2050 and well into their next licensed lives to 80 years. As we stated at the time of the announcement, the transaction will be credit-neutral and a debt issuance did not strain our forward credit metrics. In fact, our credit metrics are now projected to be at or above the 35% at Moody's and 45% in S&P that we laid out at the beginning of the year due to the additional cash flows captured in our earnings guidance.\nWe continue to execute on our commitment to return capital to our shareholders, completed another $250 million of share buybacks during the third quarter. When we look at the opportunities ahead of us, we still see our stock is attractive at current levels and we'll continue to be opportunistic with the remaining $250 million authorized by our Board. As we discussed in June, we have $1.2 billion of unallocated capital for 2023 and 2024, which will be used to create additional shareholder value through growth investments, M&A or return of capital to our owners.\nI should remind you that this $1.2 billion is based on our disclosures at year-end 2022 that we shared on the fourth quarter call and does not reflect any additional cash created by this year's outperformance and upward revisions to next year's expectations. We'll provide an updated view of all this on our fourth quarter call.\nI'll turn the call back now to Joe for his closing remarks.\n\nJoseph Dominguez\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Dan. So the management team here remains focused on creating value for our shareholders. You know our business is unique, and we continue to have many unique opportunities in front of us. As you know, we're the best operator of nuclear plants and the largest producer of carbon-free electricity in the U.S. And now with STP, we'll make more than 180 million-megawatt hours annually just from our nuclear fleet.\nOur Commercial business serves more than 22% of the competitive C&I market in the United States and is helping customers like Microsoft and ComEd meet their sustainability goals through products like our hourly matching product. Our businesses are essential to addressing the climate crisis and our assets are durable. The IRA provides long-term commitment to nuclear energy as part of the national security of this great nation. We have many ways to grow and bring even more value to our shareholders against a baseline earnings level supported by the PTC. And over the life of the PTC, we'll benefit from price war inflation.\nWe have opportunities ahead of us to create additional value for the clean, reliable nuclear energy that we provide like hydrogen, data centers and expanding our hourly matched product. We have ability to relicense our nuclear fleet to run at least 80 years without needing to replace it. We have many ways to grow and bring more value to shareholders. We generate strong free cash flow that could be used to fund robust organic growth at double-digit unlevered returns, pursue disciplined M&, A support our growing dividend and buy back our stock.\nEach of these opportunities will create additional value for you, our owners. And we're executing on that strategy. We closed the STP deal. We announced $1.5 billion in growth spend in operates, hydrogen and wind repowering. We doubled the per share dividend, and we bought back approximately $750 million of our own stock as part of an authorized $1 billion buyback plan. And there's more we can do. We have significant unallocated capital in '23 and '24, as Dan just outlined, and we could use those monies to further enhance our earnings growth and provide value to you.\nConstellation cannot be matched anywhere in the market. Our large clean carbon-free nuclear fleet, paired with our customer-facing business and strong balance, sheet provides us with unparalleled opportunities to create value for you. And that's what we're focused on.\nNow we, as a management team, stand ready to address your questions. Thanks, operator."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call may be recorded.\nI would like to now introduce your host for today's call, Emily Duncan, Vice President of Investor Relations.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. I'm going to start on Slide 5 of the deck.\nOnce again, we're off to a strong year operationally and financially, thanks to the focus and dedication of the women and men that do their best every day to produce and deliver clean, reliable and affordable electricity to our customers. For the first quarter, we earned $658 million in adjusted EBITDA. But the top line story here is that based upon our performance to date, we can project that we will end the year comfortably in the top half of our guidance range. And if we continue to execute, we expect to be at or near the top of that range.\nIn addition, 2024 looks better to us than when we reported in February. Our Commercial team had a tremendous quarter, not only generating better-than-planned earnings in the quarter, but they were able to lock in value for the remainder of this year and for next. On the back of their strong execution, our gross margin is up $50 million in 2023 and $100 million in 2024. As Dan will cover, all in 2023 is up $100 million from where we were in February. For 2024, we expect to come in notably above current consensus, which you could see using our disclosures on Page 25 of the presentation.\nAnd in our gross margin update, you'll also see how the PTC interacts with our portfolio to add value in the face of lower commodity prices. We think that the message here is pretty simple. Our company had a strong first year and is on track to have great years 2 and 3. Our business is unique, and we still have many opportunities in front of us to create value for our owners. We are the best operator of nuclear plants and the largest producer of carbon-free clean energy in the United States. We produced approximately 11% of our nation's clean energy last year.\nOur Commercial business serves 25% of the entire competitive C&I market in the United States, 75% of the Fortune 100. Our businesses are essential to addressing climate change and will be needed for decades to come to provide clean and reliable energy, as America simultaneously reduces its reliance on fossil fuels, and the transportation, industrial, agriculture and residential sectors all increasingly turn to electrification to reduce harmful pollution.\nInflation Reduction Act, the IRA, provides unique opportunities for Constellation and its owners. Through the Nuclear Production Tax Credit, the U.S. government has made a long-term commitment to our nation's nuclear assets, recognizing that, without them, we simply cannot meet the climate goals. The PTC provides downside commodity risk protection, as you could see in our disclosures today, while ensuring that our plants remain economic and reliable.\nThe PTC protection level rises with inflation, providing a structural inflation risk protection. Other provisions of the IRA create unique growth opportunities, like increasing the output from our nuclear plants through upgrades and hydrogen. And finally, it gives us the opportunity to extend the time horizon of our fleet to 80 years. And we've made this point, I'll make it again, no other clean energy assets. except hydro, can run for this long without being replaced.\nWe have many ways to grow and bring more value to our shareholders. Against the baseline earnings level support provided by the PTC, over the life of the PTC, we will benefit from forward price inflation that grows with overall inflation in the country. And as you can see on Slide 18, depending on your assumptions about inflation, there are some meaningful top line growth opportunity ahead for us in the PTC.\nWe generate strong free cash flow that can be used to fund robust organic growth at double-digit unlevered returns, disciplined M&A and fund a growing dividend and the buyback of our stock. Each of these will create additional value for our shareholders. And we're already doing this. We have announced $1.5 billion of growth in upgrades, hydrogen and wind repowering, double the per share dividend. And in March alone, we bought back approximately $250 million of our own stock as part of our authorized $1 billion buyback, which we will execute.\nAnd there's more we can do. We have $2 billion of unallocated capital in '23 and '24 that can be used to further enhance our earnings growth. At our current stock price, I'd be happy to use this capital to continue buying back our stock all day long. We will continue to look for investment opportunities consistent with or adjacent to our core businesses, and we are committed to the energy transition. However, in the absence of any near-term M&A opportunities or a ramp up in growth CapEx, we will, in the short term, use the majority of the $2 billion to repurchase our own shares.\nConstellation cannot be matched anywhere in this marketplace. Our clean, carbon-free nuclear fleet, paired with our customer-facing business, provides us with opportunities to grow and create value for you. It is the unicorn. I'll turn next to our quarterly operational updates beginning on Slide 6.\nNuclear performance was strong and slightly ahead of plan. We produced more than 40 terawatt hours of reliable, affordable and carbon-free generation from our nuclear plants, with an on-planned capacity factor of 92.8%. As some of you may be aware, during routine inspections during our Nine Mile Point one's refueling outage, we had an issue with nonsafety-related well. It's not uncommon in the industry, but it did extend Nine Mile's outage to 39 days. The cost of the repair is absorbed within our existing budget.\nBut the point I want to make here is that even with the extended outage at Nime Mile, we returned to service roughly in line with the industry average for a standard refueling outage of approximately 39 days. And the point here is that at Constellation, a long outage,is just average for everyone else. And while Nime Mile lagged, our ability to lead the nation in returning units from outages was demonstrated at both Byron and Calvert Cliffs, which completed their refueling outages ahead of plan and at an average duration of 21 days in total.\nOur renewables and natural gas fleet also performed well with 96.6% renewable energy capture and 98.4% power dispatch manage. The team is presently completing our summer readiness work to make sure that it's ready for the hot summer months to come.\nTurning to Slide 7. I'll talk a little bit about the Commercial business, but I already mentioned before they've had an incredible start to the business. It's a business that benefits from the opportunities that volatility in the commodity market creates. We're able to leverage our expertise to give our customers certainty of their energy costs in this volatile market environment, while realizing higher unit margins across both wholesale and retail as risk is more appropriately reflected in pricing.\nOur balance sheet strength is a key advantage to supporting our customers and being able to capture these healthy margins. Providers with more constrained balance sheets and less experience with volatile markets are not able to provide customers the certainty and the visibility that our customers desperately want and need. Our balance sheet strength allows us to provide this needed certainty to our customers.\nWe operate our generation and customer businesses symbiotically with each other, supporting and making the hall stronger. As such, we can optimize our positions across the combined generation and workload portfolios to create additional gross margin, particularly in times of volatility. And again, I'll just hit this, I think the results this quarter and what we've predicted for the remainder of the year and next demonstrate all of this. And we have continued success developing and providing sustainability products like core to our customers.\nAs I mentioned earlier, this strong performance creates additional value for both in 2023 and 2024. And before I turn it over to Dan for a full update on the financial outlook, I want to address our O&M disclosures from the last call. We're confident in the firmness of our forecast, and the entire management team is coming committed to ensuring that this forecast is met and it will be met. We will always look for additional opportunities to run our business as efficiently as possible. Dan?\n\nDaniel L. Eggers\n\nAnalyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Beginning on Slide 8, we earned $658 million in adjusted EBITDA, which is above our plan for the first quarter. The favorability to our expectations came with the strong results of Commercial, plus the updates the PJM winter bonus payment as we have gotten more clarity from PJM. Compared to the first quarter of 2022, our results were lower than the $866 million in adjusted EBITDA.\nOur quarterly shaping in 2023 will differ from last year, in part due to our hedge prices that are higher than last year, the comparability will be impacted by the start of the CMC program in June of 2022; timing of opportunities in the commercial business; the greater number of planned refueling outages in the first half of this year compared to last year; and the shaping of O&M.\nIn 2022, we saw ramping labor costs over the course of the year as we staff the organization. The difference in staffing levels and costs will be widest in the first quarter and then normalize as we move through this year. As Joe said, we remain committed to our 2023 O&M targets. For the full year, as Joe commented earlier, we expect to be comfortably in the top half of our guidance range of $2.9 billion to $3.3 billion.\nTurning to Slide 9 and our gross margin outlook, we are now forecasting to be at $100 million in both 2023 and 2024. Overall, forward power prices in '23 and '24 have seen downward pressure since year-end following the record warm winter that has created an oversupply situation in natural gas markets. Our existing hedges and the nuclear PTC support in 2024 effectively mitigate much of this pressure.\nWhen we look to 2025 and beyond, where we are comparably less hedged, we see prices at or above year-end levels, reflecting natural gas prices that are normalizing in the low $4 per Mcf range, and tightening supply-demand dynamics with announced plant retirements that are further supporting power prices. The upside to gross margins will then coming from the strength in our commercial business. where we are seeing better margins as risk is being more effectively priced given market volatility and higher liquidity requirements.\nFor 2023, our gross margin forecasts are up $100 million to $8.45 billion due to our existing hedges, strong performance by our Commercial team and the increased payment from PJM associated with Winter Storm Elliott. These drivers more than offset the weather-driven downturn in prices since year-end. As a reminder, the power new business to go line moves into the mark-to-market of hedges line when a transaction is executed, with this road naturally declining as we move through time and deliver on our plan.\nSo in the first quarter, we executed $250 million of new business and then increased our target by another $50 million, translating into the $200 million reduction in the new business to go line. In 2024, our total gross margin, including PTCs, is up $100 million from our last update to $9.05 billion when we take into account upward revisions to our Commercial business outlook of $100 million, our hedge positions and the PTC downside protection of $100 million.\nWith the drop in forward power prices the PTC is functioning as it should, stepping in to provide downside protection as some of our nonstate supported units fell below the PTC threshold. Taking into account the increase in gross margin and the cost lines we show on Slide 25 in the appendix, you can see that our outlook for 2024 is also higher than the consensus.\nTurning to the financing clarity update on Slide 10, we are delivering on our promise to return value to our shareholders. Our first quarter dividend has doubled from the level we paid in 2022, and we started our $1 billion share repurchase program that was authorized by the Board in mid-February. We view our stock as very attractive at these share price levels, and we aggressively initiated our share buyback, completing nearly 25% of the authorized program by repurchasing 3.2 million shares for approximately $250 million in March. We will continue to be opportunistic for the remainder of the authorized program.\nAnd we still have an additional $2 billion of unallocated capital in 2023 and 2024, that could be used to create additional shareholder value through growth investments, M&A or additional return of capital to our owners. In the first quarter, we also accomplished most of our financing plans for the year with good demand and at attractive rates. We remain on track to hit our credit metric targets and we continue to have constructive conversations with the ratings agencies. Both our S&P and Moody's ratings and metrics remain firmly in the mid- to high BBB equivalent range.\nI'll now turn the call back to Joe for his closing remarks.\n\nJoseph Dominguez\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Dan. And I'm going to go to Slide 11 and conclude our prepared remarks. And I'll just end where I started on the value that Constellation brings to you, our shareholders. We think it's a value that can't be found anywhere else. We own nearly 25% of the U.S. nuclear fleet, producing the most carbon-free energy in the country, nearly twice as much as our next competitor.\nThese plants can run for 80 years. That's a useful life that's longer than any other carbon-free generation that exists today. In the case of renewables, it will operate longer than any renewables that are built in this decade. We're the best operator of nuclear plants, period, and we provide power to nearly 1/4 of all competitive C&I customers in the U.S., including 3/4 of the Fortune 100. All of this puts us in the best position to meet the growing demand for clean energy and reliable, sustainable products.\nOur balance sheet strength is an advantage over others in the market. We have unique opportunities to create additional value for our shareholders, the increasing value of the PTC over time. through the inflation adjustment that's embedded in the law and our strong free cash flow allows us to fund a growing dividend, robust organic growth. And where we could find compelling M&A, we'll do it. But if we can't find those opportunities, then we're happy to return capital to you through share buybacks.\nI'll now open the call to questions."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Emily Duncan, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nEmily Duncan\n\nThank you, Justin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the Constellation Energy Corporation's fourth quarter earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Joe Dominguez, Constellation's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Eggers, Constellation's Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Constellation's senior management team, who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks.\nWe issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, all of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of Constellation's website. The earnings release and other matters, which we discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates regarding Constellation and its subsidiaries that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Constellation's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and other circumstances and considerations that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations.\nToday's presentation also includes references to adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures.\nI'll now turn the call over to the CEO of Constellation, Joe Dominguez.\n\nJoseph Dominguez\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Constellation Energy Corporation\n\nThanks, Emily. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our fourth quarter earnings call. We've been a stand-alone company for a year now, and what a year it's been. We really appreciate the confidence our owners have shown in the company and its future.\nI'm going to start on Page 5 of the deck with language that ought to look pretty familiar to you. A year ago, we laid out our strategy for the company and made commitments to you focused on creating value, namely that we create an enduring business with the unique ability to tackle the climate crisis, that we'd operate a premier and transformational ESG companies that sets a high bar and leads the way for others, and we'd protect our balance sheet and deliver exceptional value to our shareholders. Thanks to the hard working women and men that run our power plants and serve our customers, along with the corporate teams that support them, we're well on the way to delivering on these commitments.\nThis year, we produced 180 terawatt hours of carbon-free clean electricity from nuclear, wind, solar and hydro, which we estimate to be about 11% of all carbon-free energy produced in the U.S. in 2022. On the customer front, retail customers ranked Constellation as the #1 retail energy supplier. We continue to offer strong pricing and innovative solutions like CORe and carbon-free energy matching, what we call 24/7, that are meeting customers where they are today and anticipating where they're going to be a few years down the road.\nFollowing a bumpy 2021 marked by challenges in Texas during super storm Uri, our power business, which includes all of our hydro, renewables and natural gas plants has bounced back and arguably has had its finest year ever. The investments we made in the Texas fleet worked. Our clean nuclear energy centers continue a string of excellent years. Once again, our nuclear performance led the industry. To put this in context and give you perspective, our capacity factors have been the best in the industry for over a decade. Now that track record ought to give you great confidence in our ability to sustain performance. But there's a much bigger meaning to having the largest, most reliable and most resilient clean energy fleet in America. It means when the chips are down and the grid is facing a crisis moment, like PJM faced during winter storm Elliott, just the latest example of these harsh storms, Constellation's plans are the difference between keeping the lights on or having a Christmas without heat and light for millions. That's dramatic but it's also correct, and it's just that simple, and storm after storm demonstrates the same thing.\nI know this morning, you likely read the news in our release about the financial benefits we'll receive in PJM capacity bonus payments, payments that we earned during Elliott. And we'll talk about the PJM a little bit more this morning. But it's part of a much bigger story in energy, and it's part of the value thesis for this company. In 2022 at long last, clean nuclear energy finally got appropriate credit for the environmental value, the E, if you will, in ESG. That drove the IRA, and it drives interest in our stock. But candidly, however, our view is that clean nuclear energy continues to remain undervalued from both, a policy and ESG perspective. Because it's not just the E part of the ESG story that makes our assets important, it's the S, too. And what I'm talking about here is the enormous societal benefit of having affordable clean energy, together with high levels of reliability and resilience. It's what makes our assets among the most important of any class of energy assets in America, and it's what you will [own] here at Constellation.\nIn this regard, I [comment] to your reading Constellation Sustainability Report, which explains how clean energy pieces fit together and how Constellation's customer-facing business is helping C&I customers to develop and expand their sustainability plans by providing greenhouse gas emissions reports and clean energy products. As you know, providing highly reliable clean energy to power the grid is just the beginning of the future we see for the company. The IRA unlocked many opportunities. It gives us unique opportunities to grow by upgrading our existing plans and earning an enhanced PTC with those incremental megawatts, to grow by investing in hydrogen and to grow by extending the lives of our assets to 80 years and increase the number of megawatts to our fleet produces. These are the opportunities and investments you will see today in today's presentation.\nFinally, we talked at Analyst Day about giving back to society. In 2022, we walked the walk. One of the best ways to give back is to create family-sustaining job opportunities for people and communities that need them. That's why I'm happy to report that this year, we hired 2,000 new people across all of our businesses that will earn good wages and benefits and bring that value back to their communities. Earlier this month, we announced a historic pledge with the North American Building Trades Union to increased diversity in the [graft] jobs that are in the backbone of our company and the backbone of this nation. They're essential to the clean energy future. Our spending with diverse businesses increased by $200 million. Our people showed their heart and their passion and their generosity by volunteering 80,000 hours to their communities, and they gave along with the company $12.5 million in charitable contributions.\nNow all of this was done as we executed the financial commitments that we're here to talk about this morning. We achieved 2022 EBITDA of $2.667 billion, taking the top off our guidance range. We paid down $2.5 billion of debt and generated robust free cash flow to support our strong balance sheet, a strength that was recognized by the S&P in their upgrade and in their continuing positive outlook for our business. We distributed $185 million in dividends to shareholders and we delivered total value return of 75% versus negative 14% for the rest of the S&P 500. It was a good year. And as promised, we're meeting our commitment to you to provide an update on capital allocation.\nSo let's flip to Slide 6, and I'll walk you through it. At Analyst Day, we laid out our capital allocation philosophy. We've maintained a strong investment-grade credit rating. You saw we enhanced that this year. We provide annual dividends growing at 10%. We grow the business organically and inorganically where returns exceed a double-digit unlevered threshold. And where we don't have those opportunities or they don't meet the thresholds, we're going to return value to you, our owners. Now over the course of the year, we have significant developments. The IRA was enacted, it opened the door to the growth opportunities that we discussed in nuclear and hydrogen and will provide a floor of support for our business. And the whole geopolitical and energy world got turned upside down due to the war in Ukraine with long-term effects.\nGiven these developments, we made a number of decisions to support long-term value creation. We have secured nuclear fuel through 2028, which will allow us to withstand any future Russian supply disruption. We're investing in our nuclear fleet, so that it could provide clean energy on the grid for at least 80 years. And we've begun implementing a plan to upgrade plants to achieve more output with no incremental O&M. Our balance sheet and credit metrics remain strong and continue to be the backbone of our financial policies and they provide an enormous competitive advantage to us. We will double the share of dividend starting with the March 23 payment, and we'll then target 10% growth beyond. We will continue to invest in our assets, which will supply the grid with clean energy from our nuclear fleet for decades and help decarbonize America.\nI said a moment ago that we have the best assets and best operations. Our mostly dual unit fleet cannot be matched by any other asset class in America. We will remain disciplined in our evaluation of M&A opportunities, which includes making decisions, informed by our own assets and how they compare it to others. We've explained how we look at value and our strong bias to purchasing well-maintained and well-supported multi-unit sites. At this moment in time, we haven't found an actionable opportunity, but we continue to believe in the consolidation of the industry, and we will continue to be patient and disciplined as we explore every one of those opportunities.\nWith that lens, we and the Board believe it is more valuable in the organic opportunities we have at hand as well -- that there is more value, excuse me, in the organic opportunities we have at hand as well as in our company's own shares. Accordingly, we're going to invest $1.5 billion in organic growth that meets our double-digit unlevered return threshold, including uprates at Byron and Braidwood, the first we've authorized; investments in 300 megawatts of wind repowering and refurbishment; and we've allotted $900 million in capital to begin to satisfy the growing demand for clean hydrogen in our regions. Now Dan in his remarks is going to go into detail on those investment opportunities.\nIn addition, our Board authorized $1 billion in share repurchases, a direct investment reflecting our belief in the strength and value of our company. And even with these investments and the enhanced shareholder return vehicles we've announced today, we still will have approximately $2 billion in additional capital to be allocated in '23 and '24. This will allow us to pursue additional organic growth opportunities that meet our return thresholds, provide strategic flexibility for M&A. And to the extent that these opportunities do not materialize or if they don't materialize in this timeframe, we'll look at opportunities to return the value to you.\nNow turning to Slide 7. I already touched on this. I mentioned at the top of our call that our Power Generation business had an excellent year, tying our best ever dispatch match, meaning our ability to respond and operate the plants when grid operators order us to do so. Our nuclear fleet continues to lead the industry. 94.8% capacity factor makes it the seventh year in a row with a capacity factor over 94%, the best in the industry, as I said, for over a decade. Our 11 refueling outages averaged an industry-leading 21 days, matching our fleet record.\nTurning to the Customer business on Slide 8. Our team had an exceptional year and was able to create significant value, managing the portfolio through a very volatile year. We had strong and effective portfolio management success and load options. All whole, we served 208 terawatt hours of wholesale and retail load, and we continue to see strong customer renewables and new customer wins in both, our Power and Natural Gas business. And we had our best year ever in the CORe product. As you know, during these calls, I often update you on deals we've executed. But to put that in perspective, we've executed 6 deals for 12 customers, delivering 1.65 terawatt hours of renewable energy annually and creating strong margins for Constellation.\nTurning to Slide 9. The clean energy center strategy for the company is the key to accelerating the transition to a carbon-free future for America. In 2022, we made strides towards our corporate purpose of accelerating this future. We announced our intent to seek license renewals at Clinton and Dresden, with Dresden being our next step in bringing the entire fleet to 80-year lives. We're making hydrogen today at Nine Mile and using it as a test bed for the future growth opportunities that I mentioned before, and we're working with others to secure hydrogen hub DOE funding in many regions. And finally, we're exploring through a DOE grant, the ability to use our cooling towers to take carbon out of the air, a technology that could result in clean energy centers having negative carbon emissions. 2022 was a great year to show the potential of these clean energy centers. 2023 is the year that we will begin to put those plans in action.\nNow turning to Slide 10. As I mentioned before, PJM went through a great emergency in December. And it was the latest evidence that time and time again, always-on nuclear is there when other resources fail. It was true back in the '14 polar vortex when 22% of PJM capacity failed, with 81% of it being either coal or natural gas and nearly 1/4 of the wind not showing up either. Nuclear saved the day with 96% of the nuclear units operating and preventing a catastrophe. Reforms were made, as you recall, and PJM customers have paid about $58 billion in capacity payments since the rules were changed, all in an effort to avert the crisis that occurred during the polar vortex.\nBut disappointingly, we saw almost the same facts leading to PJM great emergencies during the winter holidays. Once again, nearly a 1/4 of PJM capacity failed with 90% of it being fossil. Folks, we know that renewable is intermittent, and it's difficult to plan a future around, but the other truth of it is that fossil assets are not performing during these severe storms. That forced PJM to issue emergency conservation orders, which were followed by alerts from governors and utilities across PJM. 38% of the natural gas plants did not operate when needed. In contrast, Constellation's nuclear plants ran at a perfect 100%. Let there be no doubt that clean nuclear energy saved Christmas this year.\nBut the point I want to leave you with is this. We're going to learn as a nation and a world that dispatchable clean generation is the most valuable thing in energy. We kind of know it already. That's why we're investing so much in things like battery and hydrogen and other forms of energy storage, all things that aim to pair renewables and provide more predictable and resilient clean energy. But you see, we already do that. Clean, reliable and resilient energy is what our fleet does every single day and better than anyone else in the world. And that's what you own when you own Constellation.\nNow I'm going to turn it over to Dan for the financial outlook.\n\nDaniel L. Eggers\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Constellation Energy Corporation\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. We have a lot of cover today from a finance perspective. We're excited to share our capital allocation plan, which we are confident will create value for our business, our customers and our owners. I'm going to build on Joe's comments by providing more details around our growth projects and cash flows. I will also give an update to our financial outlook as we roll forward our disclosures.\nBut I'll start with our 2022 financial performance. We had a very strong first year financially, earning $2.66 billion in adjusted EBITDA, which exceeded our narrow guidance range of $2.45 billion to $2.65 billion. Our commercial organization had an exceptional year in managing the portfolio, creating opportunities around our fleet and load in a volatile market. Our nuclear fleet performed extremely well during winter storm Elliott as Joe discussed earlier, and we anticipate being one of the primary recipients of bonus payments. The strong performance from the business was able to offset untimely generation outages, margin shaping and cost pressures we discussed in the third quarter call. The entire leadership team is very proud of how Constellation performed in its first year, both financially and operationally. And I'd like to echo Joe's appreciation to the entire organization for a job well done.\nWe're also introducing 2023 EBITDA guidance of $2.9 billion to $3.3 billion with a midpoint of $3.1 billion, which is up over $500 million from last year's midpoint. I'm going to use the following slide to talk to the key inputs to EBITDA and then free cash flow. Turning to Slide 12. I wanted to talk about the nuclear PTC included in the IRA, which we believe is truly transformational for our company. It provides downside commodity risk protection, backed by the U.S. government with unlimited upside to higher commodity prices. It supports unique growth opportunities in clean hydrogen and uprates, it extends the time horizon of our fleet to 80 years and includes structural inflation risk protection. Mechanically, the nuclear PTC is designed to provide downside support in the declining price environment, phasing up and down when a plants' market revenues are between $25 and $43.75 per megawatt hour with maximum support of $15 a megawatt hour.\nThis chart shows the illustrative payoff dynamics in 2024. The blue shaded box shows the revenue levels or the PTC support would be available up to the maximum $15 credit when revenues are at $25 and basing down $0.80 on the dollar until you reach $43.75 per megawatt hour, the point in which the PTC value would be 0. With this design, our effective revenues for nuclear plant will be between $40 and $43.75 over a range of revenue starting at $25. Equally important, we retain all of the upside when revenues are over $43.75.\nSo bringing this conversation to life, the green line represents an electricity price above the $43.75 threshold where we would not receive a PTC payment but would collect that price for our power sales which is consistent with history. The orange line represents a $35 price where we are in the PTC zone and would, in turn, capture $7 PTC, because we are below the threshold bringing the realized revenues to $42 a megawatt hour. Inherent to the drop in power prices in this case, the PTC provides significant downside protection to our business and is a materially positive change from history when facing a lower price environment.\nWe have positioned our portfolio in 2024 to reflect this new dynamic from the downside protection that PTC provides. There are still many unknowns about exactly how the PTC will work that needed to resolve in Treasury's implementation of the legislation. We expect to have this guidance before the end of this year, which gives us time to adjust our strategy once we have clarity.\nNow let me discuss how we are incorporating the PTC into our disclosures. Slide 13 provides our gross margin update based on prices at year-end. In 2023, total gross margin is projected to be $8.35 billion, up $100 million from last quarter, lifted by higher powered new business targets as we are seeing additional opportunities on the back of the strong performance in 2022. We are introducing our 2024 gross margin forecast of $8.95 billion, up $600 million from 2023. This is largely due to the timing of our hedges and higher prices. With this update, we have added a road to the bottom of our gross margin table for 2024 when the PTC program goes into effect. As you know, we're still waiting on final ruling [of] interpretation from Treasury around the nuclear PTC, but we want to provide some insight into the financial impact.\nSo let me explain what this line is and what it is not. This line represents the PTC value we would expect to generate from our plants that do not have state support. So the Pennsylvania and Maryland units as well as LaSalle and Illinois, and using the more conservative spot price methodology that calculates the PTC value without consideration of hedges. In this representation, we will use the forward 2024 prices at each update to determine whether PTCs would be generated. Since we are still in conversations with the states around existing programs, we have not included those units in this analysis.\nWith prices at December 31 above the $43.75 PTC floor that I discussed just a moment ago, we do not currently forecast PTC contributions in 2024, which is why there is no PTC revenues in this line on the table. We will plan to use this approach for addressing the PTCs with each quarterly update as we work to reach clarity on final implementation and Treasury and outstanding issues with the state programs. After we have resolution on these issues, we will look to have a more substantive overhaul of our disclosures to best reflect the value and importance of the nuclear PTC to our (inaudible) business.\nTurning to Slide 14. We provide an updated view of our CapEx outlook through 2025. As Joe mentioned, we are making investments to derisk our business and set us up to create long-term value. Our CapEx plans have increased from the '22 Analyst Day with investments in the mid $2 billion for the next 3 years. The majority of the increase can be attributed to the $1.5 billion of organic growth projects, increased nuclear fuel spend and an increase in baseline CapEx, largely around timing. I will use the next 2 slides to talk through where we are seeing increases and why.\nMoving to Slide 15. I'm excited to provide further details on the $1.5 billion of growth investments we are pursuing with each opportunity exceeding our double-digit unlevered return threshold. The IRA was transformational in many ways, including by allowing us to accelerate some projects where the economics are extremely compelling. We continue to believe that hydrogen produced in nuclear plants will play a critical role in addressing climate change by helping to decarbonize hard-to-decarbonize sectors. We have spent considerable time over the last year exploring how we could play a role in the hydrogen economy and create value for our business and our owners.\nNine Mile Point is the first -- was the first in the country to produce hydrogen from nuclear power.\nWe are active participants in the (inaudible) hub in the Midwest, the Mid-Atlantic hub and the Northeast hub, with each exploring commercial applications for hydrogen alongside nuclear-powered stations. We plan to deploy approximately $900 million of capital towards building a first-of-its-kind commercial scale, greenfield hydrogen production facility in the Midwest. This facility will initially have a capacity of 250 megawatts, the equivalent of producing approximately 33,450 TPA of hydrogen and will be built for ready expansion to 400 megawatts. Approximately 90% of the hydrogen produced is expected to be sold through off-take agreements with customers who will be co-located at our facility. And as Joe has said, we expect to announce commercial deals in the coming months.\nWe are in the early stage design -- early design stages of this project. Procurement of the appropriate equipment, construction and commissioning will take some time. We expect the facility to be in commercial operation in 2026. The support for nuclear in the IRA has also made extending the lives of nuclear assets to 80 years more likely, assuming continued support. It has also caused us to relook at nuclear upgrade opportunities that had been shelved a decade ago. The 45Y tax credit starting at $27.50 per megawatt hour for the production of new carbon-free electricity provides opportunities for us to expand the capacity at our plants. As a result, we have decided to pull forward planned turbine replacements in Byron and Braidwood and take advantage of the upgrade opportunity in the IRA by committing approximately $800 million from 2023 to 2029, demonstrating our firm commitment to preserving and enhancing our world-class fleet. Approximately $600 million of the spend was already embedded in our long-term plan towards the end of the decade.\nYou can now see this step up in baseline CapEx on the prior slide beginning in 2023. With our work to replace the aged turbines, we will invest an additional $200 million to fund even more efficient models and install higher efficiency, high-pressure turbines to gain additional capacity. These projects utilize the latest turbine technologies to address aging issues, increase operational reliability and reduce future turbine inspection frequency and duration. In total, we will increase the output of Byron and Braidwood by 135 megawatts. Turbines are long lead parts and will be installed during scheduled outages between 2026 and 2029, with increase in capacity coming from each round of [work.] We're continuing to evaluate other nuclear uprate opportunities, and we'll provide updates on additional investments as we validate the scope of work and appropriate economics.\nFinally, on growth, let me turn to our opportunities for wind repowering and refurbishing that Bryan talked about at the Analyst Day. We've identified $350 million of investments for approximately 315 megawatts. These projects have low risk of execution, will qualify for new PTCs and will make the existing sites more efficient to generate greater output at the same [wind] conditions. The first 70-megawatt parcel repowering is expected to be in commercial operation this year. We're excited about these growth prospects, supporting our commitment to be a leader in advancing clean energy goals and earning appropriate returns on our investment. We see these investments they first step and will continue to explore additional opportunities that meet our double-digit unlevered return thresholds while remaining disciplined in our decisions.\nTurning to nuclear on Slide 16. In response to the Russian-Ukraine conflict, our nuclear fuels team has worked diligently over the past year, using their deep relationships and buying power to secure enough nuclear fuel inventory and future contracts to meet our needs through 2028 even if existing contracted Russian fuel supply was disrupted. This inventory build will bridge our new fuel supply from now through 2028, at which point, multiple Western providers have stated they are able to have additional supply online. The incremental fuel buying is driving much of the CapEx increase with the remainder primarily due to sharply higher prices for uranium enrichments and conversion services as a result of the conflicts. We believe this is a prudent allocation of capital to ensure operating reliability given supply uncertainty.\nFrom a P&L perspective, since fuel [loss blend] in our operating expenses over time, we're forecasting year-over-year inflation in fuel costs but at levels still below $6 per megawatt hour when we get after the 2028 time period. We continue to work with the administration, Congress and other stakeholders to facilitate the expansion of domestic enrichment and conversion facilities within the United States to improve the security of nuclear fuel and its contribution to meeting our nation's carbon goals.\nTurning to O&M on Slide 17. Our costs have moved up but are generally flat across the disclosure period, setting the new baseline for costs for our current operations. These updates require some context to help better understand what we are seeing. When I look at the increase, there are several major buckets driving the changes from last year. First, starting with growth-related expenses. We talked previously about the need to ramp our spending on growth to support all the strategies we've been talking about over the past year and that are starting to bear fruit with the announced CapEx. This number will vary by year, but will remain less than 1% of our total O&M budget.\nTwo, we have an increase in cost but also have revenue offsets captured in our top line forecast. The conversion of growth investments into contributing projects will have associated O&M costs, including the big capital projects we just talked about like hydrogen, but also spending on initiatives of commercial that are capital-light, for example, our CORe growth strategy that have profitable revenue contributions. We're also anticipating higher future bad debt expense with higher prices and what are more predictable default rates, but we've been adjusting our pricing to reflect this higher cost. As our growth investments come online, you should reasonably expect O&M increases that are more than captured with higher revenues.\nThree, as we discussed on the last call, although we had some labor and supply inflation productions, we are not immune from inflationary pressures or the impacts of restaffing our workforce during these highly competitive times. As Joe said, the deeper work at Constellation the key to our success and ensuring that we not only attract the best talent but retaining them is paramount. To do this, we must be competitive with our pay and benefits.\nFourth, the CMC saved the plants retirement for 5 years, and the IRA now gives us greater confidence that these plants and the entire fleet will continue to operate for 80 years with continued policy support. Prior to the IRA passage, we're always looking over our shoulders about how long some of our units would run beyond existing state support mechanisms, and we're understandably making decisions on the level of investment in cost based on life expectancy. We have reversed those decisions, and as a result, they are contributing to some O&M increase from Analyst Day. When we look at the long-term value of these assets, we believe the additional spending is appropriate.\nAnd finally, we've learned a lot over the course of the year as our first year as a stand-alone company. We have found that some of our support cost assumptions were not sufficient to support our base business, let alone one poised to take advantage of our future opportunities.\nTurning to Slide 18, we show our projected credit metrics for 2023, which remains firmly in the mid- to high BBB equivalent range. At S&P, we are rated BBB and remain on positive outlook following our recent upgrade and remain Baa2 at Moody's with a stable outlook. The investment grade balance sheet continues to bring value and provide competitive advantages in today's markets, positioning us well as we head into 2023. Our balance sheet, along with our debt maturity profile with a weighted average maturity of 13 years, provides us flexibility as we continue to look to grow our best-in-class fleet both, organically and inorganically. It provides us with more opportunities to transact in volatile commodity markets where margins expand as risk is more appropriately reflected in pricing, and we are better positioned to service our customers, all while meeting our liquidity needs.\nTurning to Slide 19. Let's talk about our capital allocation plans for the next 2 years covering 2023 and 2024. Starting on the left, we forecast approximately $4 billion in free cash flow before growth after absorbing the increase in base CapEx and nuclear fuel that I covered earlier. Moving to the right, we continue to manage our balance sheet to our 35% CFO-to-debt target, which with the increase in earnings and cash flow, affords us about $800 million of debt capacity after higher net collateral requirements. Collectively, we have approximately $5 billion of cash available for allocation. Approximately $200 million will go towards the remaining capital and O&M spend related to the separation and for the ERP system implementation with the rest then going to our value creation [or] return commitments we've been discussing today.\nNearly $800 million will be returned to our owners with the doubling of the common dividend this year, growing 10% next year and beyond. $1 billion of the $1.5 billion of growth CapEx will be deployed over these 2 years, again, with returns exceeding our double-digit unlevered threshold. We then plan to return another $1 billion to owners through buybacks. That leaves us with approximately $2 billion of unallocated capital over the next 2 years. This unallocated capital provides us with flexibility to pursue our strategic priorities, including nuclear M&A and additional organic growth as long as those projects meet our return thresholds. And as you're seeing today, if those opportunities don't materialize, we'll return the capital to our owners.\nThank you all for your time today. We look forward to another strong year in delivering on our financial commitments, and I'll now turn the call back to Joe.\n\nJoseph Dominguez\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Constellation Energy Corporation\n\nThanks, Dan. Well, folks, as you can see, we had a pretty spectacular first year as a company. And now it's time to have another one. In '23, we're going to continue to focus on operational excellence, delivering on our financial commitments and working towards our purpose of accelerating the transition to a carbon-free future. We're focused on ensuring the success of the hydrogen work we're doing, delivering additional megawatts and extending lives of critical clean energy center assets. We'll work with Treasury and other states on IRA implementation issues, and we will continue to effectively deploy capital to the benefit of our shareholders. We will continue to update you throughout the year on these matters during our calls.\nNow, Justin, I think it's time for questions."

(Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Emily Duncan, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nEmily Duncan\n\nThank you, Amy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Constellation Energy Corporation's third quarter earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Joe Dominguez, Constellation's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Eggers, Constellation's Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Constellation's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, all of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of the Constellation's website.\nThe earnings release and other matters, which we we'll discuss during today's call, contain forward-looking statements and estimates regarding Constellation and its subsidiaries that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during the call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Constellation's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and other circumstances and considerations that may cause results to differ from the management's projections, forecasts and expectations.\nToday's presentation also includes references to adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. I'll now turn it over to the CEO of Constellation, Joe Dominguez.\n\nJoseph Dominguez\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Constellation Energy Corporation\n\nThanks, Emily. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. I especially want to thank the new owners of Constellation to the call. It's gratifying to see the continuing and expanding interest in our new company from all parts of the world. We had a strong quarter, delivering adjusted EBITDA of $592 million, which is a result of the strong operations and performance across the business. Dan will go through some of the details in his remarks, and we look forward to your questions at the end.\nAs always, I want to start with a shout out to the talented women and men, who help us to run this company and who listen in to these calls. Thanks for everything you do. Plainly, the biggest news during the quarter was the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which recognizes the vital role that clean carbon-free nuclear plays in meeting the country's climate objectives. We've had a little time now to absorb the transformational impact of the IRA to us and in our minds does 4 big things: first, it helps us to attract and retain count. This business is about human capital.\nAnd it's hard to keep people when you're constantly talking about plant closures. Thankfully, we're done with that. Second, and to the same point, the IRA keeps the plants open for our communities and for America. And it's not just about the carbon benefits, it's about the local air pollution reductions. It's the jobs and economic benefits, especially in hard hit areas of our nation, and it's about electric reliability and affordability. We've said this before, but it bears constant repeating. The most important energy commodity in the world today is a reliable, zero-emission clean energy megawatt.\nI don't care how you make it, but producing affordable clean energy that shows up whenever and wherever you want is the foundation of any modern energy system that deals with climate. The PTC begins to recognize the value of that scarce commodity, and we make more of it than anyone in America. Third, the IRA provides our owners consistent returns by creating downside protection through commodity cycles with inflation protection. We wanted to take a minute this morning highlighting the inflation protection mechanism of the PTC, given that -- given the concern that all businesses and investors rightfully have (inaudible) inflation at this moment in time.\nOur thinking is that inflation will be difficult to control for many reasons and that the Fed's stated goal of getting to 3% long-term inflation will be a significant challenge. Fortunately, the PTC automatically adjust higher in these scenarios, as you could see from the slide. In a 2% case, prices go to about $51 over the term of the PTC and $57 a megawatt hour in a 3% case. This gives us great confidence in our ability to favorably manage longer-term inflationary risks. Fourth, the IRA gives us an interesting opportunity to grow by operating our plants and to earn an enhanced PTC for incremental megawatts, to grow by investing in hydrogen and to grow by extending the lives of our assets to 80 years.\nI'll talk about a couple of these more in a moment. In sum, the IRA gives our investors a very unique investment opportunity, a clean energy investment with unlimited upside to higher commodity prices, downside commodity risk protection provided by the U.S. government, unique growth opportunities in hydrogen, life extensions and upgrades and structural inflationary risk protection. We were pleased to see that the S&P recognized that the IRA provides significant benefits as part of its reassessment of Constellation's risk profile and upgraded us to BBB while maintaining a positive outlook.\nA good investment credit rating is more important now than ever. If I can turn to Slide 6, I think this is a slide I'm pretty excited to talk about. If -- what it depicts is the life of our existing assets, the blue is the current license life of our fleet. And as you can see, it starts to dwindle down beginning in the 2030s and phases out by 2050. You can see in some of the other colors here, certain life extensions that we've already filed for or obtained in the case of a few of our plants.\nThe green that's shown on the chart is the additional life that we will get by going to 80 years. And just to provide some context on how big that opportunity is for Constellation in America, just extending the life of Constellation's clean energy units, not all the units in the country, just ours. Just extending ours will create as much clean power for America to fight the climate crisis as all of the renewable energy that's been built in America over the last 40 years, and it won't cost hundreds of billions of dollars to make it happen.\nIt's there for us at a modest cost through the NRC life extension process. Last week, we announced that we will be asking the NRC to renew the licenses of Clinton and Dresden in Illinois for an additional 20 years, allowing these plants to serve America to the middle of the century and beyond. The NRC process for renewals expected to take us about 4 years and it will allow Clinton to run to 2047, and Dresden to run to about 2050. This is Clinton's initial license renewal and with a subsequent renewal, it has the potential to operate until 2067.\nWith continued policy support, we believe that we'll be able to renew the licenses at all of our plants, which would mean parts of our existing fleet would be providing carbon-free, always-on generation well into the 2060s at least. Once licensed life is extended, our clean energy nuclear plants would have an operating life that is longer than any existing renewable energy source. And, in fact, longer than any new renewable energy source that would be put into service in the next decade.\nBut this isn't just about competition with other technologies. We need every zero-carbon resource and license renewal is a hugely important part of the climate tool chest. It gives our owners a unique investment opportunity for the long run. Turning to Slide 7. I want to talk a little bit about hydrogen. Like many others, we think that clean hydrogen will play an incredibly important role in mitigating climate change and reaching sectors of our energy and transportation, industrial uses that can't be reached through traditional electrification.\nHydrogen can be used to create sustainable aviation fuels for airplanes, reduced emissions in steel manufacturing and other industrial process, for fuel cells that provide power for long-haul trucking and even to create fertilizers and other clean agricultural products. The opportunities are virtually limitless. And the clean hydrogen provisions of the IRA, specifically the ability to earn both a nuclear and hydrogen PTC, means that nuclear plants can become COGS in the clean hydrogen market.\nAs you know, we will be the first to produce hydrogen from nuclear energy through our pilot project at 9-mile point. Last week, we also announced that we are a member of the Midwest Alliance for Clean Hydrogen or MachH2, which we'll be applying for a hydrogen hub funding from the DOE. We see Constellation participating in 3 ways, as shown on this slide. First, hydrogen by wire. They think about customers that are already using hydrogen at their industrial processes and want to use clean hydrogen.\nIn order to get the full tax credit they're going to need to prove that they're powering their electrolyzers with clean energy. And that will translate into contract opportunities with us to provide clean 24/7 power through our Constellation business. The second opportunity we have is to co-locate electrolyzers and make hydrogen byproducts at our sites. And the third opportunity is to power fuel cells with hydrogen, and that's what we're testing at 9-mile along with NYSERDA and the DOE.\nThere, you store hydrogen at times where the grid doesn't need power. And then you run that hydrogen back through a fuel cell and produce energy to the grid when it's needed. The key thing we're doing here is exploring optionality, so that we could use these 3 strategies interchangeably. And one of the technical things that we're trying to work on is being able to move from producing energy and putting it on the grid to making hydrogen with that energy and going back and forth in a matter of 10 to 15 minutes.\nThat way, we'll always be able to support the grid when the grid needs energy. And when the grid doesn't need the excess energy, we could be making hydrogen. As we turn to Slide 8, I want to talk a little bit about our operations. Our power and renewable fleet performed well with power dispatch match rate of 98.8%, and a renewable capture rate of 95.7%. Our nuclear fleet ran well but not perfect at 96.4% in its capacity factor. Our fleet will end the year with industry-leading performance, performance that has led continually for a significant period of time now.\nWe continue to operate at a capacity factor that is about 4% better than the industry average. And to put that in context for you on an open position at the PTC price floor. A 4% higher capacity factor for our fleet translates into over $300 million of incremental revenue. Turning to Slide 9 and our commercial business highlights. As I mentioned at the top, our commercial business performed well during the quarter with strong volumes of electricity and gas delivered to our customers, and we closed deals that provide carbon-free solutions to our customers.\nWe delivered 56 terawatt hours of electricity during the quarter, and we continue to see strong renewal and win rates across both our electric and gas businesses. Those win rates are reflected on the chart. We reached an agreement with the city of Chicago in collaboration with Swift Current Energy to purchase 100% clean renewable energy by 2025. As part of the agreement, the city will source its large energy users with 300 megawatts of new solar facility under construction in Illinois and will procure renewable energy credits for its remaining users.\nThis agreement will help Chicago lead the way in the fight against the climate crisis and yet is another example of how we're helping our customers meet their sustainability goals. Finally, I want to spend a moment on used fuel. Turning to Slide 10. We often talk about the fact that nuclear has many ESG attributes. It's got the lowest life cycle carbon emissions of any technology. It produces more carbon-free power on less land than any other source because of its incredible power density. It provides unprecedented reliable and affordable energy to all communities because we think reliability is just as important to society as sustainability.\nIt provides family-sustaining jobs in many poor communities across the country, and has a strong industry safety culture. And as I mentioned, through innovation, we could use that clean energy to decarbonize other sectors with hydrogen fuels. But one of the questions we often get from investors is about spent fuel or as we prefer to call it, used fuel. So I want to spend a few minutes talking about how fuel safety -- how fuel is safely secured and stored at our sites.\nFirst, I don't think we get appropriate credit for this, but we're the only large-scale energy-producing technology that takes full responsibility for all its waste, plants for its eventual disposal. And we prefund all of our plants' retirement obligations. That's not true for any other energy source, whether it's fossil fuels or renewable energy. We know where every gram of spent fuel is located and how it is packaged, tagged and tracked. In terms of volume, nuclear energy is extremely dense and produces less waste by volume than any other type of energy.\nFor context, all of the spent nuclear fuel produced in the United States from the dawn of the civilian nuclear era, when President Eisenhower gave his famous 1953 Atoms for Peace speech until now, all of it, could fit inside a super Walmart. By comparison, a single coal plant generates as much waste by volume in 1 hour as the entire U.S. nuclear power industry has produced during its entire history. Now after our fuel is used to produce energy, it's placed in water pools to cool down. Then it's placed in these 16-foot stainless steel containers that are shown on the picture in this slide.\nAnd there, the material could be safely stored for hundreds and hundreds of years. These containers are designed to withstand earthquakes, storms and projectiles, and they're completely passive, meaning they don't need any power or any source of energy to continue to operate. There's never been any unplanned radiation release from the containers, and they emit less radiation than a frequent flyer receives in a year. The safe storage of these materials gives us time to finally resolve disposal or to reuse the fuel as many technologies now propose to do.\nLook, it's not a perfect solution. but there are no perfect solutions in the energy sector, and we're extremely proud of what the industry has done, and we wanted to share this perspective because we know how important it is to many of our owners. Now with that, let me flip it over to Dan.\n\nDaniel L. Eggers\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Constellation Energy Corporation\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Starting with Slide 11, we earned $592 million in adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter, which was in line with our expectations. The commercial business continued to produce strong results benefiting in the quarter from favorability in customer load serving obligations, effective portfolio management and some successful load auctions. This favorability more than absorbed the drag from the shaping issues we discussed last quarter as well as higher bad debt expense with our residential customers. On the generation front, we ran into higher unplanned outages during the quarter, which Joe pointed to.\nAny time we aren't running the plant, whether planned or unplanned, is an opportunity lost, particularly at these prices. And with the runup this summer and spot power prices, replacement power costs were much higher than they've been in recent years, which impacted our results, even with overall output not down all that much. For context, every day unit was out this summer cost between $1.5 million and $2 million a day in replacement power compared to only $0.5 million to $1 million a day in prior years.\nTurning to Slide 12. Let me start with the commodity markets. Spot natural gas prices remained volatile, but somewhat higher during the third quarter, driven by a record hot summer and associated demand, higher competing fuel prices with international demand and below average inventory. Spot power prices have followed the increase in gas prices, while energy demand also reflected the warmer than normal weather and post-COVID load recovery seen especially in Texas. ERCOT saw its warmest July on record. PJM and MISO each set records for their single warmest day and [NISO] had its second warmest day on record.\nTurning to forward prices. During the third quarter, we saw increases largely on the same factors driving spot markets, elevated natural gas prices, higher coal and emissions prices, and the anticipated supply impacts of announced coal retirements. We continue to see backwardation in the 2024 and 2025 curves compared to 2023, although the steepness and backwardation has started to ease. Since the end of the quarter, forward prices for natural gas and power have remained volatile, and this is likely to continue given an underlying tight gas market, both domestically and globally, uncertainty over winter weather here and in Europe and the potential return of the Freeport LNG facility during the fourth quarter.\nMoving to the gross margin table. 2022 total gross margin increased $50 million from the prior quarter as a result of the strong performance of our commercial team. Open gross margin is up $50 million as a result of higher power prices in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic, offset by the mark-to-market of hedges since we are effectively fully hedged this year. During the quarter, we executed $100 million of new business between power and non-power. In 2023, total gross margin increased by $100 million to $8.25 billion.\nOpen gross margin is up $1.8 billion, largely offset by the mark-to-market of hedges and $150 million of power and non-power new business was executed during the quarter. We continue to sell at higher prices than in previous quarters and are now 92% to 95% hedged across the portfolio in 2023. When we look forward, we're excited about the structural price support that the PTC will provide our generation fleet for 9 years starting in 2024 through 2032. That said, recent prices have generally been well above the PTC derived support levels, and we have and plan to continue selling power to capture prices in excess of the PTC floor values and to support our customer business.\nTurning to Slide 13. We are reaffirming our adjusted EBITDA guidance midpoint of $2.55 billion and narrowing our range to $2.45 billion to $2.65 billion. We're happy with our operational performance this year and are confident in the decisions we are making for the long-term health of our company, some of which did bring us more toward the midpoint of our original guidance range. From an operations perspective, the commercial business is performing better than anticipated, with the cost of serving looming and lower than expected plus some optimization opportunities around our fleet and load given the market volatility.\nOur generation business continues to be an industry leader when we look at utilization rates expected to be over 94% for the year with costs still well below the industry. But we did have some inopportune outages of both nuclear and power that had higher replacement costs than we had experienced in a long time. And as I said, we've also made some strategic decisions around our business this year that have impacted current year earnings, but are the right decisions for our business going forward.\nFirst, we've been talking with all of you this year about the organic growth opportunities ahead of us, including our work on hydrogen. As we see opportunities to pursue these growth outlooks, many of us further benefit from the IRA, as Joe discussed, we have made the strategic decision to take on more growth-related O&M to advance these efforts. Second, as I talked about last quarter, we continue to find -- signed fixed price multiyear contracts for customers in the face of an extremely backwardated curve.\nWe have long-standing relationships with our customers and signing multiyear deals, provide them with the budget certainty and visibility that they need to run their businesses. These contracts are weighing on our second half results and will likely carry into the first half of next year, but have compelling economics for us over the full life of the contracts. Being a good partner to our customers is important to us. Our commercial business and positioning for a number of our future growth opportunities.\nThird, as we said before, we are not immune to the pressures of a tight labor market and wage inflation. Coming out of the separation and reversal of plant retirements last fall, our vacancy rates were elevated, and we've made significant progress in restaffing. We have reduced our vacancy rate from approximately 9% in February to 5% today. We want to ensure that we have the best talent to run our plants, sell to our customers and support our businesses. Accordingly, we took a look at our compensation packages and realize that we are out of step in some areas and have made adjustments to ensure we provide competitive pay.\nFinally, as you all know, and many of you benefited from, our stock prices performed very well this year. As part of separation, we wanted to have an ownership culture and reinstated equity as part of our long-term compensation for our key managers through executives. And while we would like to replicate this stock performance every year, this year is well above what was anticipated in our financial planning and is driving additional costs, particularly in 2022. We are happy with our results this year and remain focused on driving long-term value for the company and our owners.\nFinally, turning to the financing and liquidity update on Slide 14. Our balance sheet remains extremely strong and our risk profile is undeniably improved as a result of the IRA. As Joe mentioned, earlier this month, S&P upgraded our credit rating from BBB- to BBB, while maintaining positive outlook, a significant credit positive story for us. Along with the Ratings action, S&P revises business risk to strong from satisfactory, reflecting their view of a material improvement following the passage of the IRA.\nWe want to thank our colleagues at S&P for their thoughtful review of our business. The upgrade at S&P is also further evidence in the acknowledgment of the stability of our cash flows and competitive advantages we have going forward. We are now 2 notches above investment grade of both S&P and Moody's. We are maintaining our credit metrics that are well above our downgrade thresholds and remain committed to a strong balance sheet. Although we are also encouraged by S&P's openness to us taking advantage of our strong balance sheet to fund M&A opportunities as they come up over time.\nBeyond the validation of our metrics, business model and outlook, the ratings at parity between the agencies have some immediate benefits, including more favorable collateral requirements and credit terms with counterparties that have lowered our postings by several hundred million dollars since the quarter ended as well as lower rates on long-term debt in commercial paper. Our liquidity position remains strong with more than $2 billion in unused capacity as of September 30. As I close out, I'd like to remind everyone of the financial strength that sets us apart from others in the market.\nOur strength allows us to pursue organic and inorganic growth opportunities to grow the business while returning value to our shareholders. It also provides us with more opportunities to transact in volatile markets. Where margins expand as risk is more appropriately reflected in pricing, and we're better positioned to service our customers, all while meeting any additional collateral postings without the need for additional liquidity and those associated costs. I'd now like to turn the call back to Joe for his closing remarks.\n\nJoseph Dominguez\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Constellation Energy Corporation\n\nThanks, Dan. The company is strong. It's built for the long haul. And it's an essential company for America, as valuable as the IRA was to the company and to the nation. The thing I'm really proud about is extending the life and beginning really to extend the life of our fleet, what we did with Clinton and the announcement on Dresden. These are just the most important assets for America at this point in time. Financially, we're executing well, and our balance sheet is in great shape.\nOur investment-grade credit rating is extremely valuable. So I'll close with the value proposition. We're a unique company that can't be replicated. And our assets, as I said, are critical to meeting our climate goals. The IRA has derisked the business, providing [floor] excellent inflation protection and an exciting platform for growth. We own nearly 25% of the U.S. nuclear fleet, producing the most carbon-free energy in the country, nearly twice as much at -- carbon-free energy as the next generator.\nThese plants can run for 80 years, a useful life that's longer than any other carbon-free generation that exists today, and in the case of renewables that will be built over the next decade. We provide power to nearly 23% of all competitive C&I customers in the U.S., including 3/4 of the Fortune 100. This puts us in the best position to meet the growing demand for customer-driven carbon-free energy and sustainability products. We're the best operator of nuclear power plants in the country bar none, and that delivers enormous value.\nWe generate strong free cash flow through our best-in-class operations, our retail and wholesale platforms and our support for clean energy and our focus on costs. And finally, we intend to deliver value to you, our shareholders through our capital allocation strategy. We told you that we'd provide you with an update this year, and we're working on that. But as many of you know, there is some meaningful potential inorganic growth opportunities that align with our strategy, and we need to see how these things play out before we can provide an update.\nBut as a reminder, our capital allocation strategy starts with maintaining strong investment-grade credit ratings, which provide us a competitive advantage. We provided $180 million annual dividend growing at 10%. We believe there are opportunities to grow our business organically and inorganically, and we will see growth opportunities that exceed a double-digit unlevered return threshold and will deliver long-term value to our customers. And when we don't have those opportunities or don't have those opportunities in a particular time frame, we will return capital to our owners through a special dividend or share buybacks. With that said, I'll open it up for questions. And I apologize for the noise on our end, there was a little glitch with the mic."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call may be recorded.\nI would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Emily Duncan, Vice President, Investor Relations. Vice President Duncan, you may begin.\n\nEmily Duncan\n\nThank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Constellation Energy Corporation's second quarter earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Joe Dominguez, Constellation's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Eggers, Constellation's Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Constellation senior management team, who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks.\nWe issued our earnings release this morning, along with the presentation, all of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Constellation's website. The earnings release and other matters, which we will discuss during today's call, contain forward-looking statements and estimates regarding Constellation and its subsidiaries that are subject to various risks and uncertainties.\nActual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's materials and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Constellation's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and other circumstances and considerations that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations.\nToday's presentation also includes references to adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures.\nI'll now turn it over to the CEO of Constellation, Joe Dominguez.\n\nJoseph Dominguez\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Constellation Energy Corporation\n\nThanks, Liz, for getting us started and for Vice President, Duncan for her preliminary remarks, otherwise known as Emily to all of us, and thank all of you for joining us this morning and for your continued interest in Constellation and our mission to provide reliable, clean energy to families and businesses across America 24/7, 365.\nOf course, as we talked this morning, all eyes are focused on Washington and the proposed Inflation Reduction Act, which would be clearly transformational for Constellation, both in terms of support for our clean energy nuclear assets as well as creating new opportunities for clean hydrogen production and fuels. I'll talk a little bit more about that in a minute.\nBut Dan and I will focus most of our time on the excellent quarter we just completed and the strong numbers and operational performance across Constellation. As always, I want to begin with a shout out to our talented women and men who work at our plants, sell power to our customers and work in our corporate centers. I know a few of you listen in to these calls, and we want to thank you for everything you do for Constellation.\nAs you've no doubt read in the release on -- turning to Slide 5, Constellation posted a second quarter EBITDA of $603 million, and we reaffirm our full year guidance. Our balance sheet continues to give us a competitive advantage in the market, and customers are increasingly utilizing our platform of sustainability solutions, setting the stage for the launch of our 24/7 product. Dan will walk you through the financial results in his remarks, and I've asked him to spend a few minutes this morning reminding you of how our hedge program works.\nTurning to Slide 6. As you know, our people have led the way on the development of policies that support the continued operation of baseload clean energy nuclear assets. They produce the bulk of America's emissions-free energy 24/7, 365 days a year. So we're pleased to have that a small role in the crafting of the historic federal energy bill that now we believe is on the cusp of success. It recognizes the vital role of clean nuclear energy.\nIn that sense, the drafters of the IRA reached the same conclusion that many of our states have already reached, namely that without baseload nuclear assets, we don't stand a chance of achieving our climate objectives, our affordability goals, or the need to have reliable and resilient power on the grid that could withstand the extreme weather we increasingly face. The provisions in the IRA, I'm going to stumble through that a couple of times, not only support the continued operation of our assets, but create policy support, which, if extended, supports the 80-year license life that our assets could operate to, giving Constellation and its owners long-term clarity.\nLet me put this in context for you. By extending the licenses out to 80 years, our existing fleet of clean energy nuclear plants would have an operating life that is longer than any new renewable energy source that is going to be put on the grid this decade. But it's not just the longevity and the electricity side of it that excites us, it's what we could do to provide sustainable jobs for the future of our industry and ensure that those jobs create opportunities where opportunities are needed.\nLet me give you a little bit of a data point on this, just to tell you how extraordinary it is. From a job standpoint, extending the licenses at our plants to 80 years will create over 453 million people hours of work in high-paying jobs across the country, making the nuclear energy provisions of the IRA one of the largest creators of family-sustaining wages. The provisions of the IRA concerning clean hydrogen and, specifically, the ability of nuclear plants that earn both the nuclear PTC and the hydrogen PTC means that nuclear plants will become a key cog in clean hydrogen and sustainable fuels. States that took early action to preserve their nuclear plants should be able to receive credit on their -- from the PTC payments so that state consumers get the benefit of the federal programs, and work is underway to achieve that result.\nAll told, here's how we see it. Passage of the IRA would be a win-win-win. It preserves and extends baseload clean energy resources that are vital to America's energy mix and our fight against the climate crisis. It preserves thousands and thousands of family-sustaining jobs and creates even more jobs. And it saves consumers' money in states that have preserved these assets. For you, our owners, it means this. It resets Constellation's value as a critical infrastructure company with strong and more predictable financial results, unique growth opportunities and long-term durability on par with anyone.\nTurning to Slide 7 and our generation highlights. Our fleet performed extremely well during the quarter. Let me start with the fossil and renewable fleet, really focusing on Texas. During the extreme heat in July, our plants ran as expected with minimal outages, all that were scheduled with ERCOT to occur at times that they would not impact the grid. Our generation fleet's performance reflects the investments we've made in Texas along the way and shows how well we are positioned as a portfolio in Texas to serve customers well during extreme heat and price volatility.\nOur clean energy nuclear plants at a 94.2 capacity factor and power and renewables achieved excellent results. And preliminarily, in July, our data indicates that our nuclear plants ran at over 98%. I remind you, this is different than any other resource out there in the market in terms of its ability to withstand temperature fluctuations and operate 24/7, 365. There is no other clean energy resource out there that does anything near that.\nIn fact, when our nation saw unprecedented heat, the performance of the U.S. nuclear fleet as a whole save lives, providing baseload clean energy during times of record demand. And as we see the continued evolution of the stack and the move away from fossil fuels to more intermittent forms of generation, we think the importance of these assets will only grow over time.\nTurning to our commercial business and the summary on Slide 8. It again performed very well during the quarter, with strong volumes of electricity and gas delivered to our customers. And we closed a number of deals providing carbon-free solutions to help customers meet their sustainability objectives.\nCustomer renewals picked up significantly compared to the first quarter as we saw more customers come forward and be willing to interact. We doubled our renewal volume, making Q2 the best second quarter of renewals in 3 years. These renewals and our C&I business generally are an important part of our hedging strategy, which Dan will talk about in a second.\nIn addition, we're seeing margin expansion across the retail and wholesale channels, recognizing the higher risks in the market due to volatility. We also executed some of our largest core deals to date. Core deals, as a reminder, help our customers meet their carbon and energy goals, but they also support the development of new and additional renewable megawatts being added to the grid.\nWe've highlighted a number of the customers, Bank of America and P&C, in particular, who entered into very significant deals. In the future, our 24/7, 365 product will include nuclear energy as companies endeavor to reach even greater levels of sustainability by load matching their consumption with power produced at the same time. This will be a natural evolution of the core e product and other sustainability products that we have in the market.\nIn terms of our commitments, Slide 9 reminds you of what they are. We must, as a nation, do more to increase our clean generation and reduce emissions, and we have to help customers do the same thing. The transactions I just talked about with our business partners are part of leveraging our key advantages in helping them meet their sustainability goals.\nBut as we talked about on Analyst Day, to provide all of our C&I customers with the information they need, we need to give them reports explaining where they are on their path to sustainability. And I'm pleased to say that at the end of this month, we're going to have that in the hands of every one of our customers.\nThe other pillars of our carbon commitments are to grow our carbon-free generation to 95% of our output by 2030 and 100% by 2040, subject to policy and technology. That means we will be at zero emissions from generation by 2040, not, net zero, zero. And we're going to reduce our baseline operations-driven emissions to zero from a 2020 baseline. When we announced these commitments on Analyst Day, which, unbelievable, was just 6 months ago, we told you that we did it with the intent to set the bar in the industry, to be a leader. It's terrific now to see that other companies are following in our footsteps. And I commend those companies and their leadership. We have to keep pushing each other.\nTurning to Slide 10. This is a slide that should be familiar to you, and I just want to walk through it quickly before I flip things over to Dan. We intend to deliver value to our shareholders through our capital allocation strategy. We are on track to provide you that update later in the year.\nWe are committed to maintaining a strong investment-grade credit rating, which provides us a competitive advantage. And you've seen that advantage play its role in our success already in the 6 months of history of this company. We'll provide $180 million of annual dividend growing at 10%. We believe that there are other opportunities to grow our business organically and inorganically, and we'll seek those opportunities, provided that they exceed a double-digit return threshold. And if we don't find those opportunities, we're going to provide capital back to our owners through special dividend or share buybacks.\nAgain, we're going to see what happens here with the IRA. We'll gauge the reaction in the market. That will inform the decisions, but we are committed to providing you that information this year. I've heard some chatter and questions out there that maybe that slips, not going to slip. We will provide that information to the market.\nNow let me flip it over to Dan.\n\nDaniel L. Eggers\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Constellation Energy Corporation\n\nThanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 11. We had another strong quarter financially, earning $603 million in adjusted EBITDA. As expected, year-over-year EBITDA was slightly lower.\nWe benefited from higher realized energy prices and lower nuclear fuel costs, driven by the absence of accelerated amortization of fuel at Byron and Dresden. This was primarily offset by lower capacity revenues from both cleared megawatts in the Midwest and lower prices across PJM and New York. Higher nuclear outage costs were driven primarily by a long refueling outage at Salem and additional maintenance during our Byron following the reversal of the retirement decision last fall.\nWe are reaffirming our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.35 billion to $2.75 billion. As a reminder, we saw some favorability in the first half of the year by selling output from Byron and Dresden at higher prices after the retirement reversal due to the passage of the Clean Energy Jobs Act.\nAs of June 1, Byron, Dresden and Braidwood all shifted to the first 12-month cycle under the 5-year CMC program, with revenue starting at $30.30 per megawatt hour. This price is lower than the prices we realized for Byron and Dresden in the first 5 months of this year. We plan to provide an update for our 2022 EBITDA guidance range on next quarter's call.\nTurning to Slide 12. Since we launched in February, we've gotten a lot of questions from both new and legacy investors about our approach to hedging, including how and why we hedge. So I'm going to spend a few minutes to revisit our hedging program. From a business perspective, there are several reasons why we hedge as we do.\nFirst off, we serve 215 terawatt hours of retail and wholesale electric load annually in our commercial business, which accounts for the majority of our forward power sales. Our C&I customers generally sign contracts on a multiyear basis with an average term of at least 2 years that are often signed as long as 6 months before going into effect.\nEach year, 60 to 70 terawatt hours of these contracts come up for renewal, where we have a renewal rate around 80%, depending on the year. And then we typically win 1 out of every 3 new contracts where we seek to add customers. This leads to a fairly consistent stacking of contracts that effectively takes the shape of 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 over 3 years. Matching our generation output to these customer needs provides transaction efficiency and liquidity, particularly in the out-years.\nSecond, the CMC mechanism in Illinois represents about 27% of our generation, creating a hedge for the next 5 years. With the run-up in power prices over the last 12 months, the contract prices are now below market and benefiting the Northern Illinois customers. But as you know, the Illinois plants would have shut down without the CMC law, so we would have been receiving no revenues at these sites without the law. Instead, we are now in a place to potentially extend the licensed lives of these strong dual-unit sites, improving both the duration and economic value of these assets.\nThird and foundationally, delivering on our financial covenants is of utmost importance, and our hedging program allows us to do that by providing certainty in the near-term earnings and cash flows. Improved visibility helps us in several ways by supporting the balance sheet and our investment-grade credit ratings, a competitive advantage clearly seen in these recently volatile commodity markets, and providing confidence in our capital allocation decisions, including long-term investment needs and return of capital to shareholders.\nWe do have some flexibility within our hedging program to be opportunistic when we see attractive prices or pull back when we don't. So we'll manage the portfolio accordingly to capture the most possible value as we see market conditions. You've heard this from us since our Analyst Day, meeting our financial commitments is paramount to us, and our hedging program allows us to meet these commitments, delivering value for our shareholders.\nNow turning to Slide 13. We provided an update to our gross margin disclosures, which is marked to June 30, 2022, for prices and positions. Looking at the table, you can see that the total gross margin for 2022 is unchanged from March 31 as we are nearly 100% hedged across the major regions. Open gross margin is up significantly since the first quarter earnings call due to the increase in power prices across all major regions, offset by the mark-to-market of hedges since we are effectively fully hedged. The commercial team continues to perform well and executed $100 million of power new business during the quarter.\nIn 2023, total gross margin is up $200 million since last quarter to $8.15 billion. Open gross margin is up $500 million, partially offset by mark-to-market of hedges and execution of $50 million of power new business during the quarter. Across all regions, we capitalized on higher prices during the quarter. Executing sales at price levels well above those of previously executed hedges, we are now 88% to 91% hedged across our portfolio.\nWe've all watched the dramatic increases in forward gas and power curves over the past 12 to 18 months. But an interesting phenomenon also worth noting is the steep backwardation in the curves across our regions, with 2022 and '23 significantly higher than the out-years. There was around $30 a megawatt hour of backwardation in the forward groups at NI Hub and West Hub between 2022 and '24. This steepness in the curve is unique. Looking back at history, the past 3 years' backwardation would have been about $3 to $5 per megawatt hour. And the curves are pretty flat when we look back to the 3 years before that.\nI talked about the importance of our retail customers a few moments ago. Many of our retail power customers sign multiyear contracts at a fixed price, providing them with the visibility and certainty they need to manage their businesses and budgets. However, when combining a fixed-price contract with a steep backwardation in the commodity curve, we've been running into some margin pressure in the near term as we deliver at a lower-than-market price now and then make up for make up for the pressure in the out-years when the cost to serve is then lower than the fixed price contract.\nWe are managing through this headwind, but wanted to flag since these are different -- use a different market conditions than we've encountered before. I should stress, as Joe pointed out, we have seen some margin improvement this year. There's a little bit of a timing phenomenon, but operationally, this is a good outcome for us.\nTurning to the financing and liquidity update on Slide 15. Our credit metrics remain very strong. We have a BBB- rating at S&P with positive outlook and a Baa2 at Moody's with a stable outlook, and our metrics are 10% to 20% higher than our downgrade thresholds. As a reminder, we have already retired or paid down nearly $2.5 billion of long-term debt and term loans this year, completing our debt paid out for the next 2 years.\nAnd as Joe mentioned, the value of having an investment-grade balance sheet continues to grow and provide competitive advantages in today's market. We continue to be in a strong liquidity position, with more than $2 billion in unused capacity and a cash balance of $800 million as of June 30.\nWe have received many questions about our pension since the separation. As of June 30, our pension-funded status is just over 93%, which has improved since year-end due to a combination of the $192 million pension contribution we made in February and the positive impact from higher discount rates on the liability that have collectively more than offset the impact of asset returns.\nAs a result of the higher-funded status, we've been derisking the asset mix of the portfolio, which has helped to mitigate the impact of negative equity returns in the first half of this year. We will run a full remeasurement of our pension, OPEB and related trust assets at year-end in normal course. Any change that differ to the assumptions previously embedded in our projections are recognized over time rather than immediately in our financials. Therefore, such changes will have no impact to our current year earnings.\nOur financial strength sets us apart from others in the market. This strength provides us with more opportunities to transact in volatile markets, where margins expand as risk is more appropriately reflected in pricing, and we are better positioned to service our customers, all while meeting any additional collateral postings without the need for additional liquidity and those associated costs.\nI'd like to now turn the call back to Joe for his closing remarks.\n\nJoseph Dominguez\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Constellation Energy Corporation\n\nThanks, Dan. I want to just close by talking a little bit and summarizing Constellation's value proposition. It was a decade ago that we were really starting this discussion about the importance of preserving the nuclear plants. And I think just so much has changed during that period of time. And really, a lot has changed here in the last year or 2, where you've seen some of the horrible policy decisions that in closing these plants have an impact on electricity prices, reliability and, of course, the fight on the climate crisis.\nSo it's just so great to see this package coming together in Washington. And we're confident it will pass, and it's going to really change America. So it's a great thing. We just think we're a unique company that cannot be replicated. We own 25% of the U.S. nuclear fleet. And we produce 10% of the carbon-free antigen, nearly twice as much as the next largest carbon-free generator. And these plants could run for 80 years, well beyond 2050, in most cases. We provide power to nearly 23% of all competitive C&I customers in the U.S., 3/4 of the Fortune 100. This puts us in a position to meet the growing demand for customer-driven carbon-free energy and sustainability solutions.\nWe think we're the best operator of nuclear plants in the country, and the metrics back that up. We thrive in times of volatility, as both Dan and I discussed earlier. We generate strong free cash flow through our best-in-class operations, retail and wholesale platforms, and we support clean energy across the country with a good focus on cost and reliability. We have a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit rating is extremely valuable, and we deliver value to our shareholders through disciplined capital allocation.\nI'll now turn it over to the operator for questions."

(Operator Instructions) Later, we will conduct question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call may be recorded.\nI would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Emily Duncan, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nEmily Duncan\n\nThank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our first Constellation Energy Corporation earnings conference call as a stand-alone company. Leading the call today are Joe Dominguez, Constellation's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Eggers, Constellation's Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Constellation's senior management team, who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks.\nWe issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, all of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Constellation's website.\nThe earnings release and other matters which we discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates regarding Constellation and its subsidiaries following the completion of the separation from Exelon that are subject to various risks and uncertainties.

Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call and for your interest in our company. As you can imagine, there's quite a bit of excitement here in Baltimore as we gather as senior executives to celebrate the occasion and milestone of our first earnings call.\nWe had a strong quarter with good performance and across the board here at Constellation, exactly the way you want to start off. Our nuclear team, our power and renewables business, and our commercial business all performed exceptionally well throughout the quarter. It's a strong start, and I just want to pause for a second and give a shoutout to the talented women and men for everything they do for our company. You're the reason for our success.\nSince this is our first quarter, I wanted to start on Page 5 of the deck and take a moment to remind you what we're all about here at Constellation. As you know, we produced the most carbon-free energy in America and have one of the lowest carbon intensities of any large power company in America by a very wide margin. But we're not resting on our laurels. We announced on Analyst Day our goal for our generation to be 95% carbon-free by 2030 and 100% clean by 2040. That's not net clean. That's clean. Our power and renewables business has some of the best natural gas and renewable energy facilities in the nation, and they are producing some strong results.\nAnd finally, our commercial and customer-facing business deliver sustainable energy solutions to millions of families and businesses across America, including many of the nation's leading companies. We support our communities by providing good-paying jobs, generously contributing to charitable organizations, volunteering and delivering clean energy and solutions everywhere we sit. All of this work is supported by a strong investment-grade balance sheet that we carefully manage to provide liquidity throughout the commodity cycle.\nIn sum, we are committed to being a leader in solving the climate crisis. We have the financial tools in place to provide maximum flexibility, and we remain a stalwart presence in the communities that we're privileged to serve.\nLet me flip to Slide 6. Delivering the results that we report today in a very complicated energy world is, of course, challenging. But it's only part of the challenges we faced here at Constellation during the first quarter. In addition to running the business and delivering strong results, our folks have handled the corporate separation with Exelon, standing up new teams and capabilities. We have many leaders in new roles, and I'm proud to say that the separation has gone smoothly and without disruptions.\nOur IT platforms have had no issues. We're on track to separate the platforms and terminate the transition services agreement between Exelon and Constellation on time and on budget. Thanks again to the hard work and excellence of the teams at Constellation and Exelon who are working on those issues.\nOur plants continue to operate at world-class levels, and our customers continue to receive top-notch service and be linked to clean energy products. In fact, some of the highest customer satisfaction scores we've ever received as a company we've received this quarter.\nSince separation, we have delivered first quartile adjusted EBITDA of $866 million. We paid our first dividend. We reduced our debt by nearly $2.5 billion ahead of schedule, and strengthening that strong balance sheet that I mentioned at the outset is a core strength of ours and a competitive advantage. Dan will get into the details of all these achievements and more. But I want to say that, consistent with our past practice, while we are reaffirming guidance today, we will not revisit guidance until we get through the summer.\nFrom a policy standpoint, states continue to lead on addressing climate change. Maryland enacted the Climate Solutions Act, which will help the state reach its greenhouse goals. Importantly, for the first time, it recognized nuclear energy as an essential resource in achieving these goals.\nIn Pennsylvania, the regulations for the state to join RGGI are finalized. As a result, Pennsylvania is poised to participate in the program and reduce emissions by 225 million tons by 2030, producing cleaner air for families across the Commonwealth.\nBoth of these important policy outcomes are the result of the excellent work by our internal teams led by Kathleen Barron and all of our community partners. We appreciate that partnership. At the federal level, we continue to work with industry, labor and environmental partners to ensure that nuclear energy is part of the next federal energy package, and earning the same tax credits that other technologies have enjoyed for a long time and ensuring that this vital technology is an American resource for decades to come.\nNow we all know that we're not across the finish line in D.C. with the anticipated tax package, but we believe that progress is being made, and we remain cautiously optimistic that a favorable outcome will be achieved this year. And look, I know that all of you, like the folks here at Constellation, like to look out the windshield at what's in front of us and not so much look in the rearview mirror. But I do think it's important sometimes to pause and remember the journey we've traveled.\nIt wasn't so many years ago where policymakers and even climate scientists ignored the vital role of nuclear energy as part of an overall strategy to solve the climate crisis while providing affordable and reliable power to customers. Environmental groups, many who cut their teeth in the antinuclear movement, pressed hard to close plants. And unfortunately, some entire countries took that advice.\nThe very thought that nuclear would receive state policy support was a joke to some. Well, obviously, all of that has changed in a few short years as people across the globe have come to understand the critical importance of clean nuclear energy.\nUnfortunately, the change in mindset came too late to save some plants in Europe, where the painful consequences of very poor energy decisions are revealed today in more pollution and less energy and national security. No one is happy about that.\nAnd although you know that we've been a strong voice and at the leading edge of this discussion about nuclear for years, I'm not reminding you of the history to tell you that we are right all along. That's not important right now. What's important is this, as you evaluate our company, our ESG bona fides and our staying power for decades, we believe that it is more evident than ever that we operate the clean energy assets that America needs to battle through the climate crisis. So as we all step back and look at the windshield of the future of energy policy and ESG considerations, we believe that Constellation is perfectly positioned to benefit from the continuation and expansion of policy support and should be a central part of the ESG interest.\nAs I said at Analyst Day, ESG is not a bolt-on here. It's a strategy that we intend to grow. That is why in our first quarter, we established a sustainability council filled with leaders across the company to advise us on ESG issues. We launched 9 employee research groups, sponsored by members of the Executive Committee, and these groups demonstrate our core value of respect, belonging and diversity by bringing people together, respecting what makes us different and special while promoting inclusion at the best energy workforce in America. They also support learning and development of our people.\nFinally, we continue to strengthen our workforce. The photo that you see here on this slide is of the Simeon Career Academy electricity class at our Braidwood Clean Energy Center. Simeon is a public vocation high school on the South Side of Chicago, which provides college prep and career-focused education. Its student body is diverse, filled with many African-Americans and other groups that historically have not proportionately benefited from the jobs and economic opportunity in the energy field. At Constellation, we're determined to make this change.\nWhat I think is really cool here about this photo and what I've seen time and time again in my career is this concept that you can't be what you can't see. And we have here African-American leaders, managers here at the company, teaching African-American students about careers in nuclear energy. You can't beat that.\nAs I turn to Slide 7, I want to talk a little bit about generation operating highlights. Overall, we produced 40.4 terawatt hours of carbon-free energy across our nuclear and renewable fleet, which avoided approximately 30.2 million metric tons of CO2 during the quarter. Nuclear had a 93% capacity factor, and performed 3 outages averaging each 22 days, well below the industry average.\nAs you know, one of the ways that we manage cost after the Texas events last year was to push some work into this year. So our outages this spring were a bit more complicated than usual as we had to do some catch-up work. We did a good job getting after that work, and we have to-date completed our most difficult planned outages for the year, and we are happy to have it successfully behind us as we headed into the summer. The fall outages we have planned for later in the year are the easier ones. Good work by nuclear there.\nOur Texas fleet ran well during the winter, even during the extreme weather we saw in February. And overall, we had a 99.4% power dispatch match rate during the quarter. In my view, we validated last year's weatherization work on the Texas fleet, and we're done with those expenses. Finally, our wind and solar fleet had an energy capture of 96.1%, again exceeding our plan.\nTurning to Slide 8. Our commercial business performed very well during the quarter and delivered energy solutions to customers both new and old. During the quarter, we delivered 53 terawatt hours of wholesale and retail energy to our customers across the United States. On this slide, we show our trailing 12-month average win rates for power and gas and our renewal rates for power. As you can see, we've had a great deal of success in winning new customers and even more success retaining customers due to our product offerings and strong customer relationships. I'm not surprised that we didn't miss a beat here in the business. But look, it's very good to know that we retained and expanded relationships as we separated from Exelon. Our customers continue to look to us to provide solutions to help them meet decarbonization goals. We executed long-term deals with Comcast and Sheetz to provide them with renewable energy. These deals support 350 megawatts of new renewable generation being built, represent 12% of Comcast power needs for its operations, and will supply 70% of Sheetz's entire Pennsylvania needs, with nationally -- with national RECS that are energy matched. Great work there.\nTurning to Slide 9. At Analyst Day, we talked about how nuclear plants could do more than just supply carbon-free electricity to the grid. We can become clean energy centers that can solve the climate crisis by helping to produce the fuels that will help decarbonize other sectors of the economy.\nI want to talk about hydrogen here. With the right policy support, we've done enough work now to believe that nuclear power plants will be the most competitive place in America to produce clean hydrogen. As we speak, we are completing the construction of our first electrolyzer project in New York under a DOE grant to test the technology. Like many others, we believe that clean hydrogen will play an incredibly important role in mitigating that -- the air pollution that is causing the climate crisis and the local health issues in the communities that we serve. Hydrogen can be used to create clean aviation fuels, to reduce air pollution, reduce emissions in steel manufacturing and other industrial processes. It can be used to power fuel cells that power long-haul trucking and even to create fertilizers and other clean agricultural products. The opportunities for clean hydrogen are almost limitless. And again, we think we can make it at our plants cheaper and more effectively than any other place in the U.S.\nFor the past 6 months, we've been working with a diverse set of public and private partners to develop a bid for a hydrogen hub, powered by nuclear energy and funded under the grants that were included as part of the bipartisan infrastructure bill. We'll have a lot more to say about this as we get closer to fruition, closer, frankly, to the submission of the bid, and you should look for us to provide a more detailed update next quarter.\nFinally, I want to end with the technology piece here with a new DOE grant that we received. We were awarded a multimillion-dollar grant to explore using new direct air capture technology, so-called DAC technology, direct air capture, that would help scrape carbon out of the air using our cooling towers at the clean energy centers. It's pretty cool how it works.\nOccidental has created a new membrane that we'll install in the cooling towers of our power plants. It's got a material that chemically interacts with high-moisture, higher temperature air. And as the water vapor from our cooling towers passes over the membranes, the membranes actually trap the CO2 in the air and could then be extracted.\nWe expect this process will allow us to capture up to 250,000 tons of carbon dioxide each year, which will do something really unique at our nuclear power plants. These clean energy centers won't be -- won't just be this place where we produce as much clean energy as anywhere in the planet in a concentrated basis, but they'll actually allow us to remove CO2. So we'll be able to go net negative at these clean energy centers, and we'll be able to use that technology to meet our 2030 and 2040 emissions goals.\nThen lastly, on the commercial side, I want to say that we announced our 5-year collaboration with Microsoft for that 24/7, 365-day energy realtime matching solution. By combining renewable energy, clean energy, with exciting new battery storage, fuel cells, hydrogen technologies, we're going to be able to provide our customers with a realtime data-driven accounting solution that matches their consumption of clean energy with the production of clean energy on a geographic and time standpoint.\nAs we develop the product, we'll be working with Microsoft to give customers a transparent and independently verified view of their sustainability efforts. We've also been working with the RTOs. In particular, we work with PJM and others to ensure that their systems give us the geographic and timestamp data so that we can match renewables and clean energy generation with the consumption by our governmental and commercial customers.\nWe expect PJM to provide load-matching data to members this year. That's important because we're not going to be able to decarbonize the power sector with clean energy until we have the capability to do with clean energy what we've been doing with energy since the dawn of electricity. That's matched consumption to production. I want to thank PJM for acting upon our request and leaning into this body of work.\nAnd finally, before I turn it over to Dan, I'm going to touch on Slide 10 to reiterate our capital allocation strategy. We intend to deliver value to our shareholders through our capital allocation strategy and through a very disciplined strategy of capital management. We are committed to maintaining strong investment-grade credit ratings, which provide us a competitive advantage. We will provide a $180 million annual dividend growing at 10% per year. As I said, we awarded the first dividend in the first quarter.\nWe believe that there are opportunities to grow our business organically and inorganically, and we will seek opportunities that exceed a double-digit return threshold and will deliver value over the long term to you, our owners. And where we don't find these opportunities or where they do not meet the thresholds, we will give money back to you, our owners, through special dividends or share buybacks. As I mentioned on Analyst Day, we'll provide you with that clarity on exactly how we will return value in the back half of the year.\nAnd with that, let me flip it to Dan for his update.\n\nDaniel L. Eggers\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Constellation Energy Corporation\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our first quarter results, power and gas markets, and provide an update on our gross margin disclosures and balance sheet.\nStarting with Slide 11. We delivered strong financial results in our first quarter as a stand-alone company. We earned $866 million in adjusted EBITDA, which is up nearly $1.3 billion year-over-year. These strong results reflect the absence of Winter Storm Uri from last year, which is a $1.2 billion EBITDA impact. This number is consistent with the first quarter 2021 impact at Exelon Generation of $0.90 per share on the Exelon share count or approximately $880 million after tax.\nWe also benefited from higher hedge prices in the first part of this year with the reversal of retirements of Byron and Dresden in September, we're able to sell that output at higher prices, providing some timing favorability before the CMC contracts go into effect in June. We should see some of this benefit continue over the first 2 months of the second quarter as well.\nOur commercial business captured value through optimizing the portfolio and strong new business execution during this period of higher prices. Nuclear fuel amortization expense was lower in the first quarter of 2022 relative to 2021 primarily due to the absence of accelerated amortization following the reversals of the buyer and interest in retirements. Lower capacity revenues reflect less volumes clearing, particularly in the Midwest, and we faced additional costs for nuclear outages as we catch up from our COVID- and Uri-related maintenance deferrals that Joe referenced.\nWe are reaffirming our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $2.35 billion to $2.75 billion. As you think about full year expectations, in the first quarter, we benefited from some unique opportunities, including the expected stronger power price realizations at Byron and Dresden and some timing opportunities in the commercial business. Also, we ended the year fully hedged in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic. And as I'll discuss in a few minutes, are now fully hedged across our portfolio, which limits the impact of rising prices in 2022 but is showing up in our 2023 disclosures.\nTurning to Slide 12. As you know, we have seen a dramatic rise in natural gas and power prices over the last 12 months or so, both in the prompt year and also across the 23 to 25 forward price curves, which you can see on these charts. Starting with Henry Hub natural gas prices, forwards have increased on average $0.75 per million BTUs since the beginning of the year through March 31 and $1.50 since the beginning of 2021. As of Tuesday, spot gas was $6.49 per million BTU, and forwards in '23 are at $5.25, levels we have not seen since 2008.\nThe increase in gas prices are driven by a combination of growing demand post-COVID, lower storage levels and a tight supply and demand balance in the domestic natural gas market. In addition, the tragedy in the Ukraine has exacerbated the rise in gas prices as the EU and the U.K. look to replenish, depleted storage and find other sources of supply outside Russia.\nUnfortunately, for those involved, we do not see a change in these dynamics in the near term at the very least and expect higher natural gas prices to continue. As you know, higher fuel costs will have a significant impact on the price of power. The continued rise of both natural gas and coal prices have certainly supported higher power prices out the curve. Power prices are further being supported by a number of other factors, including clean air regulations expected to increase allowance prices in some of our key markets and the continued retirement of coal units. As you can see in the charts, 2023 NiHub and West Hub forwards are 80% to 100% higher since January of 2021.\nTurning to hedging. We've increased our hedge position since last quarter that can be put into 2 primary buckets. First, with these upward moves in prices, we have used the flexibility in our ratable hedging program to lock in more forward sales for 2023 and beyond. Locking in these prices reduces the volatility in our earnings outlook, provides more certainty to future earnings and cash flows, and provides us with greater visibility and confidence in future capital allocation decisions.\nSecond, our New York hedge position is considerably higher than last quarter, which reflects the interplay of the New York ZEC program and forward prices. We have a refresher on the New York ZEC program on Slide 18, but in simple terms, the New York ZECs were designed with the consumer protection mechanism that adjusts the ZEC prices as we cross revenue thresholds, which we are now projecting for tranche 4 that begins in April 2023 for the next 2-year term. At current prices, we are effectively fully hedged for our New York output over the Tranche 4 ZEC term. With that context, looking at 2023, we are now 86% to 89% hedged on a fleet-wide basis, which is between 11% to 14% higher than where we were hedged at Analyst Day. And while we do not show it here, you're safe to assume that we have increased our 2024 hedge position by a similar amount, which reflects both our normal hedging activity and the New York ZEC effect. As a reminder, the carbon mitigation credits in Illinois represent approximately 27% of our hedge position in each year of the contract.\nMoving to our gross margin update on Slide 13, and I should note, these numbers are calibrated at March 31 to the prices and positions, as you may recall, the gross margin table that we shared at our Analyst Day in January were based on November 30 forward prices, but we included a $50 million downward adjustment in our EBITDA guidance to reflect the drop in prices during December.\nAccounting for these prices, total gross margin would have been $7.3 billion for 2022. Looking at the chart, you can see the total gross margin for 2022 is unchanged accounting for this adjustment. Open gross margin is up significantly since Analyst Day due to the higher prices across all regions, which is then offset by the mark-to-market of our hedges. We had strong performance across power and nonpower new business, executing $250 million of power new business and $150 million in nonpower during the quarter. As I referenced on the last slide, we're now effectively 100% hedged for 2022, so power price moves are having very limited impact on our results at this point.\nIn 2023, total gross margin is up $300 million since Analyst Day to $7.95 billion, driven by higher prices in all regions. We executed $150 million in power and nonpower new business. Contracted revenues decreased by $50 million, driven by the interplay of current higher prices and the dynamics of setting the ZEC level for the next tranche of the New York ZEC program, which I said begins in April 2023. These higher prices resulted in a decline in the ZEC level itself but is offset by higher power prices that are showing up in our open gross margin calculation.\nTurning to the financing and liquidity update on Slide 15. As Joe said, our investment-grade credit rating is the cornerstone of our financial policy. Investment-grade ratings and a strong balance sheet provide us with many competitive advantages, including ample access to liquidity, the ability to participate in customer channels like wholesale load auctions and provides flexibility in how we provide credit support, such as using final guarantees in lieu of letters of credit.\nOur credit metrics remain very strong and are well above agency thresholds. Following separation, S&P raised their outlook from stable to positive and Moody's from negative to stable, both while reaffirming ratings at BBB- and Baa2, respectively. Since separation, we have retired or paid down nearly $2.5 billion of long-term debt and term loans, which completed our debt paid out for the next 2 years.\nWe saw opportunities to accelerate our debt reduction this quarter and pulled forward a $523 million senior note due to be retired in June, and then in April, we paid off the $880 million term loan originally due in August for the CENG acquisition. Given the sharp rise in commodity prices and higher volatility, we've received a lot of questions about our collateral position. So I'm going to spend a moment on it.\nFirst and foremost, our investment-grade credit ratings provide significant advantages to our liquidity and our ability to run the business. In the bottom left chart, you can see we have access to $5.7 billion in liquidity facilities and use less than half of our availability, leaving ample capacity for times of stress.\nYou will also see in our 10-Q that we have a cash position as of March 31 of $1.6 billion, much like you saw on our September 30 financials last fall, we have benefited from significant cash collateral postings to us, driven by the dramatic rise in gas and power prices during the quarter.\nAs a reminder, we saw a significant amount of generation directly to customers through our retail and wholesale channels, limiting the amount of transactions across the exchanges, which thereby reduces our collateral needs when prices move in either direction. This arrangement positions us differently from some market participants.\nSo let me now answer the question as to why so much cash collateral came into us again this quarter. Two primary reasons. One, we sell a significant amount of gas to our customers. Unlike power, we have generation length, we are naturally short natural gas because we don't produce the physical molecules. We procure the gas and they execute the sale to a customer, and given our contracting cycle, we procured gas at much lower levels than the market today. These rising prices have, in turn, required counterparties to post cash collateral to us.\nAnd two, we participate in some power markets where we have more loads than generation length with New England being a good example. Because we have procured power for these customer obligations, as prices rise, the counterparties, again, need to post to us. The combination of these 2 positions leads to the much higher cash balances that you see in our 10-Q. For those calibrating your models excluding these cash collateral movements, we'd still point you to a year-end net debt balance in the low $5 billion range, which would be consistent with the credit metrics on this page, assuming our free cash available for allocation is used for purposes other than incremental debt pay-down.\nI'd like to now turn the call back to Joe for his closing remarks.\n\nJoseph Dominguez\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Constellation Energy Corporation\n\nYes. Thanks, Dan, for that good comprehensive summary. Look, as I think about the last quarter, I'm going to flip to Slide 15. You're familiar with our value proposition. But the things that were important for us were to get the separation done, demonstrate that we continue the performance in the commercial business and the other operating businesses to the same levels or better than what we had done when we were all part of Exelon.\nWe've certainly benefited from some of the changing fundamentals around natural gas and coal. And well, I'm sure we'll get questions about our long-term views. I think it's safe to say that the short-term market, the 12- to 18-month market is something that is heavily influenced by a lot of behaviors. But we've seen fundamental changes. We're not going to go back to the gas price and coal price environment that we saw just really, frankly, 12 to 18 months ago. And that provides strong support for nuclear.\nI talked a little bit about policy where we have gotten some successes at the state level, and we're obviously still waiting on the federal government. Here's what we believe. Given the importance of nuclear energy, we don't think there will be an energy package that happens this year or anywhere down the road that isn't going to include nuclear energy. And that's a sea-change difference. And when you're an owner of this company, that's an option you have.\nTalked a little bit about the technical optionality we see with the nuclear plants becoming clean energy centers, where we can power the grid, but we could do much, much more than that. We can capture carbon at the sites, and we can make other hydrogen-related products at the sites that I think are going to be competitive advantages for years to come.\nYou've seen a lot of supply chain issues, inflationary pressures occurring to other businesses. Not saying we're immune from those things. But certainly, given the composition of our fleet and the fact that our costs aren't rising with the oil and gas and coal costs, certainly to the same degree as others, gives us, again, a competitive advantage.\nAnd then finally, look, we're going to manage this business in a very disciplined way, both with regard to growth but also the balance sheet itself. Dan talked about that balance sheet giving us a competitive advantage, and it has. We're seeing margin expansion as others who frankly don't have the same balance sheet capability really having to increase margins, and we're getting the upside of that.\nSo I like where we're at here at the end of the first quarter. We have hedged into higher-priced markets. And frankly, our objective is to ensure that we hit the targets we've given to the Street or do better. And so we've hedged, and we've continued to hedge, as Dan said, into '24 and beyond, into the higher prices that we like to see. I'm sure you'll have some questions about that. But I like where we are positioned.\nSo with that, let me flip it back to you for your specific questions. As I said, the senior team here is ready to answer them."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website.\nAt this time, it is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jim Vena, Chief Executive Officer for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Vena. You may now begin your presentation.\n\nVincenzo James Vena\n\nCOO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nThank you very much, Rob. Listen, thanks, everyone, for joining us. Beautiful 36-degree day here in morning in Omaha, Nebraska, absolutely perfect day to be railroading this type of [ data ] that I love, not too hot, not too cold. It's just [ a slam dogs ] so Eric and team should continue to deliver what they've delivered this past quarter, and we'll get into that in a minute.\nSo here with me, we're going to review the third quarter 2025 numbers. Here with me is Jennifer, our Chief Financial Officer; Eric, our Operations Chief; Marketing Sales Chief, Kenny Rocker. As you'll hear from the team this morning, our third quarter results serve as a proof point that we are successfully executing on our strategy. We are focused on driving continued improvements in our pursuit of what's possible.\nNow let's dig into our results on Slide 4. Union Pacific reported 2025 third quarter earnings per share of $3.01, excluding $41 million of merger-related costs, our adjusted earnings per share of $3.08 increased 12% versus last year. Core pricing gains and continued operational efficiencies drove the strong financial results in the quarter. Freight revenue excluding fuel, grew for the sixth consecutive quarter and set a best-ever record. In addition, we set best-ever quarterly records in workforce productivity, fuel consumption, terminal dwell and train line. As a result, our third quarter adjusted operating ratio was 58.5%, a 180 basis point improvement versus last year. Importantly, our safety and service results also improved, demonstrating the team's commitment to our goal of running the safest and most reliable railroad in North America. Next, the team will walk through the third quarter in more detail, and then I'll come back and wrap it up before we go to Q&A.\nAnd with that, Jennifer Hamann, you are up.\n\nJennifer L. Hamann\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Union Pacific Corp.\n\nThank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a walk down of our third quarter income statement on Slide 6, where our operating revenue of $6.2 billion increased 3% versus last year. Digging into the top line further, freight revenue totaled $5.9 billion, up 3%. Volume was down slightly in the quarter, driving a 25 basis points reduction in freight revenue. Fuel was also a modest headwind with surcharge revenue of $602 million, down $33 million as lower fuel prices impacted freight revenue 50 basis points. Strong core pricing, combined with a more favorable business mix to drive a 350 basis point improvement in freight revenue versus 2024. Importantly, our ability to yield pricing dollars net of inflation that are accretive to our operating ratio is directly supported by a consistent and reliable service product.\nWrapping up the top line, other revenue declined 2% to $317 million. Lower revenue from the transfer of Metro operations was partially offset by a favorable comparison to a onetime contract settlement of $12 million in 2024.\nSwitching to expenses, our appendix slides provide more detail, but I'll walk through the highlights as operating expense increased only 1% to $3.7 billion. Compensation and benefits decreased 1% as 4% lower workforce levels and record productivity more than offset the impact of wage inflation. Compensation per employee increased 2.5% versus last year, and we expect full year compensation per employee and up around 3%, which is consistent with the increase we've seen year-to-date. Fuel expense grew 1% driven by a 3% increase in gross ton-miles, partially offset by a 2% decrease in fuel prices from $2.60 to $2.56 per gallon and a 1% improvement in the consumption rate. In fact, our fuel consumption rate set a best ever record in the quarter as we yielded benefits from our fuel initiatives. Purchased services and materials expense increased 6% due to merger-related costs and equipment and other rents declined 11%, driven by favorable contract settlements of $13 million, improved cycle times and lower [ fleet ] costs were partially offset by higher state and local taxes. Reported operating income grew 6% to $2.5 billion.\nBelow the line, other income grew 10% to $96 million on real estate gains. Our reported net income totaled $1.8 billion with earnings per share of $3.01. When you exclude the $41 million of merger costs in the quarter, our adjusted earnings per share totaled $3.08 and our adjusted operating ratio came in at 58.5%. Overall, really great quarterly financial results enabled by successfully executing on our strategic priorities.\nTurning to cash generation and the balance sheet on Slide 7. Third quarter cash from operations totaled $7.1 billion, up 6% or $381 million versus last year. As we discussed when we announced our merger with the Norfolk Southern, we have paused our share repurchase program. We are prioritizing the reduction of debt and paid down $1 billion in long-term notes during the third quarter. With that, our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio finished the quarter lower at 2.6x. Our cash balance ended at just over $800 million after funding our capital program and paying the increased third quarter dividend, our 19th consecutive year of providing our shareholders with an annual dividend raise. As we close out 2025, we expect our cash balance to steadily grow with our strong cash generation.\nLooking now to the remainder of the year on Slide 8. With just over 2 months left in the year, we are proud of how we have executed on our strategy this year. We've handled volume growth while improving our service and efficiency. Notably, the third quarter continued this trend as we handled the highest absolute volumes of the year while setting several best ever operating records. Meanwhile, some of the key economic indicators like automotive sales and housing starts, are generally softer than when we established our Investor Day targets last September. Against that backdrop, we have achieved very solid results with reported year-to-date EPS growth of 8% and 80 basis points of operating ratio improvement. For the fourth quarter, volumes are currently running down 6% as international intermodal volumes reflect the tough comparison against last year's strong growth. This level of decline plus merger cost and pause share repurchases obviously creates a headwind to earnings and margin expansion compared to last year's record fourth quarter. The team understands the task and is working hard to drive more volume to the railroad in a safe, efficient manner.\nDespite the somewhat challenging close to the year, we still expect to achieve our 3-year EPS CAGR view of high single to low double-digit growth. We also are reaffirming our view on accretive pricing, industry-leading operating ratio and return on invested capital. It is an exciting time at Union Pacific as we execute on our strategy and deliver for our customers in a way that I have not seen us do in [indiscernible]\n\nKenyatta G. Rocker\n\nExecutive Vice President-Marketing & Sales, Union Pacific Corp.\n\nAs Jim mentioned, set a best ever quarterly record. Eric and the operating team continue to deliver excellent service, enabling our commercial team to lead with confidence and deliver strong pricing results.\nLet's jump right in and talk about the key drivers for each of these business groups. Starting with our bulk segment. Revenue for the quarter was up 7% compared to last year on a 7% increase in volume. Strong core pricing gains were partially offset by lower fuel surcharges and business mix. Strength in coal was driven by strong customer demand due to favorable natural gas pricing and the continuation of Lower Colorado River Authority shipment, which started in April. Lower domestic grain demand was more than offset by strength in export lead shipment and business development in Mexico along with increased volumes from new grain products facilities. Lastly, increased [ potash ] shipments drove favorable year-over-year volumes in the fertilizer market.\nTurning to Industrial. Revenue was up [ 3% ] for the quarter on a 3% increase in volume and a 1% increase in average revenue per carload. Strong core pricing gains were partially offset by business mix and lower fuel surcharges. Demand and business wins increase petrochemicals, construction and metal shipments. However, these gains were partially offset by decreased volume in our energy and specialized markets.\nPremium revenue for the quarter declined 2% on a 5% decrease in volume and a 3% increase in average revenue per car, reflecting business mix and lower fuel surcharges. Overall, intermodal volumes were challenged by [ Lower of West Coast ] imports, resulted in a 17% decrease in international volumes. However, our domestic segment delivered record-breaking volumes this quarter, driven by exceptional service and business lines, reduced autoparts production and OEM quality hold contributed to lower automotive volume.\nTurning to Slide 11. We expect continued strength in some of our bulk and industrial segments, which is encouraging. However, we will be -- it will be outweighed by lower -- international volumes and tough comparisons. The commercial team's strong focus of first 9 months of the -- year-over-year challenges with soybean exports.\nMoving to Industrial. We're positioned to finish strong in our petrochemicals market. That's driven by the investments we've made in our Gulf Coast franchise and the strength of our service product, which continues to help us win with new customers. In fact, we recently won new petrochemical business that began earlier this month. It's a meaningful addition that reinforces our competitive position in the region. We also anticipate solid performance in the metals and minerals markets, where our team is laser focused on business development to outperform the market.\nOn the other hand, our energy and specialized markets are expected to remain challenged, primarily driven by fewer petroleum shipments as we continue to balance volume at the right margin -- is expected to continue facing challenges driven by reduced auto parts production and OEM quality holds. As we look ahead, our strategy is clear and our confidence is grounded in our outstanding service performance whether it's powering growth in bulk, driving wins in industrial or unlocking new opportunities in premium, execution is what set Union Pacific apart. Together, we are building a stronger, faster and more competitive railroad, and we're just getting started.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Eric.\n\nEric J. Gehringer\n\nSVP of Transportation, Union Pacific Railroad Company Inc.\n\nThank you, Kenny, and good morning. Starting on Slide 13, where our results do an excellent job, demonstrating the team's unwavering focus on our strategy to lead the industry in safety, service and operational excellence. Our vision is clear. And fundamentally, the railroad is operating exceptionally well, showcasing robust fluidity, consistency and reliability. Most importantly, we are achieving these results safely. Our safety-first mindset is delivering measurable progress as both personal injury and derailment rates continue to improve versus our 3-year rolling average. Rail is the safest land-based freight transportation method, and we will continue doing our part to make it even safer through ongoing investments in our network, employees, technology and communities.\nFreight car velocity, the best measure of fluidity on the railroad improved 8% to 226 miles per day, a third quarter record. Further, September marked our best ever. Let me repeat that, our best ever monthly performance at over 230 miles per day. Driving the performance was a record terminal dwell of just over 20 hours, increased train speed and the continued reduction of daily car touches across our network. These improvements are not only driving strong productivity gains within our operations, but also delivering significant efficiencies to our customers, reducing equipment cost and accelerating the delivery of their products to market.\nOn the service front, both intermodal and manifest service performance improved year-over-year to 98% and 100%, respectively. These strong results reinforce our strategic approach and underscore the importance of maintaining a proactive buffer of resources. As Kenny and his team bring business to the railroad, we aren't waiting weeks to react. We have the locomotives, crews and freight cars prepositioned and ready to provide the high quality of service we sold to our customers.\nNow let's review our key efficiency metrics on Slide 14. As noted earlier, strong network fluidity is continuing to drive productivity across our railroad, and that's evidenced by the results on this slide. Locomotive productivity improved 4% versus last year, reflecting the continued benefits associated with our efforts to reduce locomotive dwell time. Last quarter, our team set a goal to reduce locomotive dwell below 15 hours. And this quarter, we delivered, achieving a record 14.9 hours. This underscores our dedication to maximizing asset efficiency. Workforce productivity -- which includes all employees, improved 6% and marked an all-time quarterly record. Our active train engine and yard workforce decreased 4% against flat volumes versus last year. We remain focused on effectively leveraging technology to optimize our workforce, while also recognizing the importance of balancing our resources as we plan for the future. Train length in the quarter grew 2% versus last year to just over 9,800 feet, an all-time quarterly record, a remarkable accomplishment when you consider the mix headwinds associated with softer international intermodal shipments which were down 17% year-over-year. We will continue adapting our transportation plan as we harness technology and infrastructure investments to safely generate mainline capacity for future growth.\nWrapping up. Operationally, the team continues to raise the bar, delivering exceptional results quarter after quarter. It's the perpetual dissatisfaction that I've spoken about before. That's our mindset. It's imperative we continue driving efficiency while demonstrating consistent and reliable service. This enables Kenny and his team to be more competitive in the marketplace with a new long-term business. While we do have a historic opportunity ahead, the focus remains on today, further optimizing the best rail franchise in North America, I'm confident we'll continue improving in the pursuit of industry-leading safety, service and operational excellence.\nJim?\n\nVincenzo James Vena\n\nCOO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nEric, Jennifer, Kenny, thank you very much. Okay. I think you did a great job. But why don't we just turn to Slide 16, I'd just like to wrap it up before we get the questions. So first, as you heard from Jennifer, we are executing our strategy of driving strong financial results. In the third quarter, we handled the highest absolute volumes of the year while setting several best ever quarterly operating records. Kenny highlighted how the team is focused on outperforming our markets while pricing to the value we're providing our customers. Eric and team have the network operating extremely well as evidenced by our record operating results. Over the past several quarters, we've demonstrated agility with our buffer of resources. We will continue driving efficiencies while providing consistent and reliable service to win with our customers.\nTo wrap it up, we are confident in our ability to lead the industry in safety, service and operational excellence. In the upcoming weeks, we will hold our special meeting and shareholder vote. We'll also be filing our merger application with the STB. At that time, we will provide more details on the opportunity with the Norfolk Southern to create America's first transcontinental railroad. Our results today demonstrate we are focused on the day-to-day business of optimizing the great Union Pacific franchise.\nAnd with that, we're ready to take your questions. Rob?",

You may now begin your presentation.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nThanks Rob and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. Another beautiful day in Omaha. A little bit of thunderstorms last night, but the skies are clear this morning and wonderful day to be railroading. So good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today for Union Pacific's second quarter 2025 earnings call. I'm joined in Omaha by our Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Hamann, our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales, Kenny Rocker, and our Executive Vice President of Operations Eric Gehringer. As you'll hear from the team this morning, we are delivering on our strategy and our results demonstrate our commitment to leading the industry as we set new standards for safety, service, and operational excellence. Now if we turn over to Slide 3. This morning Union Pacific reported 2025 second quarter earnings per share of $3.15.\nWe had two unusual and offsetting items in the second quarter, a deferred tax benefit, and the labor expense for crew ratification agreement, both of which Jennifer will discuss in more detail. Excluding those items, our adjusted earnings per share is $3.03, up 12% versus last year's adjusted results. Volume growth, core pricing gains, and productivity improvements drove the solid results in the quarter. Our adjusted second quarter operating ratio was 58.1%, improving 230 basis points versus last year's adjusted results. Freight revenue excluding fuel surcharge grew 6% in the second quarter, setting best ever quarterly and year to date records in 2025. In addition, we set quarterly records in both quarters for workforce productivity with second quarter ranking as the best ever. Importantly, we efficiently handled the first half volume growth while also improving our safety and service performance.\nI'm very comfortable with where we are and pleased with the level of execution I see across the company. Next, the team will walk you through the quarter in more detail, and then I'll come back and wrap it up before we go to Q and A with that. Jennifer, second quarter results.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nEVP and CFO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nAll right, thank.\nyou, Jim, and good morning everyone. I'll start with a walkdown of our Q2 income statement on slide five with operating revenue of $6.2 billion improved 2% versus last year, while freight revenue of $5.8 billion set a Q2 record and increased 4%. Breaking down the drivers of freight revenue, volume growth in the quarter added 375 basis points. Fuel surcharge revenue of $569 million declined 100 million or 225 basis points as lower year-over-year fuel prices reduced our freight revenue price combined with mix for a 200 basis point benefit to freight revenue versus last year as strong core pricing dollars more than offset the continued business mix impact. We are disciplined in our pricing, supported by a strong service product, and for the third consecutive quarter yielded price dollars net of inflation that were accretive to our operating ratio.\nWrapping up the top line, other revenue declined 16% to $311 million. Included in the year over year change are the items that we've discussed previously, last year's intermodal equipment sale, and the Metra transfer. Also impacting other revenue in the quarter were lower accessorial and subsidiary revenues. Switching to expenses, our appendix slides provide some more detail, but I'll walk through the highlights as operating expenses increased only 1% to $3.6 billion against a 4% increase in quarterly volume. Looking closer at the expense lines, compensation and benefits increased 5% driven by the brakeperson buyout agreement of $55 million. This is the third and final brakeperson agreement, further enabling more efficient car handling when you adjust for the brakeperson agreement. Quarterly compensation and benefits expense increased 1% while our cost per employee increased 3.5%.\nThese results demonstrate how a 3% lower workforce level and strong productivity almost entirely offset the impact of wage inflation. We would expect a similar level of increase in compensation per employee for the full year as we continue to leverage process improvements and technology to offset wage increases. Additionally, in the quarter, we transferred close to 250 employees to Metra, completing the majority of the transfers we began in Q2 2024. Fuel expense declined 8% on an 11% decrease in fuel prices from $2.73 to $2.42 per gallon. Our fuel consumption rate improved 2% and set a second quarter record. Ongoing benefits from our fuel and locomotive initiatives coupled with running a more fuel efficient business mix drove the improvement. Equipment and other rents increased 5% driven by lower equity income and our business mix. Finally, other expense improved 5% versus last year.\nLower casualties, including environmental costs, more than offset last year's $46 million gain from the intermodal equipment sale. Our reported operating income grew to $2.5 billion as second quarter record income tax expense improved 14% as the state tax legislation change provided a one-time deferred tax benefit of $115 million more than offsetting the tax increase from higher income. Our reported net income totaled $1.9 billion and earnings per share was $3.15. Excluding those unusual items in the quarter, adjusted earnings per share was $3.03. Our adjusted operating ratio came in at 58.1% reflecting the 90 basis points impact of the brakeperson agreement. Overall, a very strong quarterly performance by the team executing on all elements of our strategy and demonstrating what's possible from the Union Pacific franchise.\nTurning to shareholder returns in the balance sheet on slide 6, our second quarter cash from operations totaled $4.5 billion, up more than $500 million versus last year. Through the second quarter we returned $4.3 billion to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. In keeping with our investor day commitments, we announced a 3% dividend increase last week. This marks the 19th consecutive year of annual increases. Our adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio finished the quarter at 2.8 times, and we remain A rated by our three credit rating agencies. Looking out to the remainder of 2025 on slide 7, we expect third quarter other revenue to be in line with our second quarter results due to continued softness in the autos market and lower accessorials.\nAdditionally, other income will look more like first quarter results as a result of lower expected real estate gains. For volume, everyone recalls the benefit that we experienced in the second half of 2024 from the surging international intermodal flows through the west coast ports month to date. In July, we are seeing the impact of the tariff pause as reflected in the current volume surge. Similar to last year, we're seamlessly handling this volume, although we do expect volume to moderate to the point of sequential declines through the quarter. On the flip side, our diverse franchise is providing numerous growth opportunities which Kenny will discuss a bit later. Operationally, we plan to stay the course and keep driving improvement, working safely, controlling our costs, providing good service, and seeking out price opportunities that reflect the value of that service product.\nOur second quarter results support our conviction in the three-year targets introduced last September. Specific to 2025 EPS growth will be consistent with attaining our three-year EPS CAGR of high single- to low double-digit growth. Further, we reaffirm our view on accretive pricing, industry-leading operating ratio, and ROIC, and of course our capital deployment strategy is unchanged. The team is confident, energized, and ready to deliver value for our stakeholders. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Kenny to provide more details on the business.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nThank you, Jennifer, and good morning. We delivered a solid second quarter. Freight revenues totaled $5.8 billion, which was up 6% excluding fuel surcharges, driven by strong core pricing gains and increased volume. Confident in the strength of our service product, the team remains bullish on our pricing strategy, and this approach continues to deliver positive results. Let's jump right in and talk about the key drivers for each of these business groups. Starting with our bulk segment. Revenue for the quarter was up 10% compared to last year with an 11% increase in volume, while a lower fuel surcharge and business mix resulted in a slight decrease in average revenue per car. Strength in coal was driven by strong customer demand due to favorable natural gas pricing and the start of Lower Colorado River Authority shipments.\nSofter domestic grain demand was more than offset by strengthened export shipments to the Gulf and Mexico, resulting in double-digit growth. Grain products volume was also up for the quarter, which continues to be driven by new soybean crush production in Nebraska and Kansas. Turning to industrial, revenue was up 4% for the quarter on a 3% increase in volume and a 2% increase in average revenue per carload. Strong core pricing gains were partially offset by business mix and lower fuel surcharges. Rock shipments remained solid this quarter, driven by strong customer demand and favorable weather conditions compared to last year, and increased shipments of industrial chemicals were partially offset by continued softness in our forest products markets.\nPremium revenue for the quarter was down 4% on a 1% increase in volume and a 4% decrease in average revenue per car, reflecting the mix impact of increased international intermodal shipments, and lower fuel surcharges. Intermodal volumes continue to show year-over-year growth as our business development efforts offset market uncertainty and slower consumer spending. Automotive volumes were down based on reduced OEM production. Turning to Slide 10, despite the challenging market outlook, our hustle mindset, and continued focus on business development gives us the edge to outperform.\nStarting with bulk, we expect coal volumes to significantly exceed last year's levels driven by current forecast on natural gas prices through the remainder of 2025 and the new volume. LCRA grain had a strong first half of the year, and while we are still a couple months from fall harvest, the 2025 crop looks favorable and we are working to finalize customer demand. We're evaluating competitive risk to the fourth quarter exports as it relates to grain products. Our intense business development focus will offset policy related uncertainty. Renewable fuels and associated feedstocks. Moving to industrial. Our strong investments in our Gulf Coast franchise continue to help us win in the petrochemical markets. For example, we are proud to serve Dow's new expansion in Freeport, Texas, which began operations last month. We anticipate stable performance in the metals and minerals market.\nTariff activity continues to impact metals shipments, but this is balanced by continued strength in construction, specifically in the South. With our exceptional service, we're well positioned to capture that demand. Additionally, we anticipate petroleum volume to remain challenged due to business shift and our commitment to balance volume at the right margin.\nWrapping up with premium as Jennifer indicated, strong comparisons and port shifts will challenge international and domestic intermodal volume. We saw an uptick in automotive volumes at the end of Q2 and we recently converted new auto parts volume originating from Mexico. That said, softer vehicle sales are a concern.\nWhile we remain mindful of external pressures, including potential tariff implications that could influence consumer behavior, we're focused on the strength within our control, and I am confident we'll win in the marketplace. That confidence is reinforced by the investments we're making to expand our capabilities and our footprint. Just last week we opened our new Kansas City intermodal terminal, our fourth new intermodal terminal in the past few years. Since 2020, we've invested over $1.4 billion to support growth and expansion in our intermodal business. But our focus extends beyond premium. The industrial development team is actively driving carload growth, managing nearly 400 projects that are opening new doors for us. So as we move into the second half of the year, I'm encouraged by our dynamic service adaptability of our team. What truly sets us apart is our relentless ability to rise to any challenge.\nFrom unexpected international modal volume to surges in coal, we've proven we will deliver. Our commercial and operations teams are working together to unlock growth in unexpected areas. We don't wait for opportunities; we create them, turning momentum into impact and driving results that matter. With that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance.\n\nEric Gehringer\n\nEVP Operations, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nThank you, Kenny, and good morning. The team delivered another strong operating performance in Q2, demonstrating exceptional results behind our strategy of safety, service, and operational excellence. Our agility was once again on full display as we effectively handled a 30% surge in coal and renewable shipments, all while providing the service we sold to our customers. Ultimately, it's another proof statement highlighting our robust and reliable service product, which is imperative as we strive to grow with our existing customers and unlock new markets. Moving to key performance metrics on Slide 12. Safety remains our top priority at Union Pacific, and our goal is to be the safest railroad in North America. Importantly, we are making continued progress towards that goal with improvements in both personal injury and derailment rates versus their three-year rolling average.\nWe won't stop until each and every employee goes home safe every day. Freight car velocity, the best measure of fluidity on the railroad, improved 10% to 221mi per day. Driving the performance was both reduced terminal dwell as well as increased train speed which improved 7% and 3% respectively. We continue to leverage new technology to enhance terminal processes and adjust transportation plans, eliminating touch points while simultaneously improving cycle times. Importantly, we are turning our customers' assets faster, enabling growth through efficiency. Also key is how that translates into our service for our customers. In the second quarter, both intermodal and manifest service provider performance improved year over year to 99% and 97% respectively.\nOur buffer of resources coupled with further improvements in line of road variability, terminal run through dwell, and first mile last mile performance is generating a very high level of service for our customers. It's great work by the team as we deliver on our service commitments. Now let's review our key efficiency metrics on slide 13. As I mentioned before, fluidity is king and the results on this slide are a byproduct of the exceptional results throughout the quarter. It's the team pushing the limits of what's possible to drive continuous improvements across our railroad. Locomotive productivity improved 5% versus last year, a second-quarter record as we efficiently handled a heavier business mix while also improving dwell times across the network. Workforce productivity, which includes all employees, improved 9% and marked an all-time quarterly record.\nSimilar to Q1, our active train engine and yard workforce decreased 1% again, demonstrating excellent operating leverage against the 4% volume growth. We are confident there is more opportunity in front of us as we leverage technology to make our workforce safer and more efficient. Train length in the quarter grew both sequentially and year-over-year. In fact, the Q2 set an all-time record at nearly 9,700ft. It continues to be an ongoing source of productivity as we look to reduce crew starts, improve asset utilizations, and build capacity on our network. Wrapping up, we have tremendous operational momentum that is enabling growth across our railroad. Our footprint is unparalleled and built to handle that growth. It's on us to execute it in an efficient, service-focused manner.\nWe will continue to work hand in hand with Kenny's team, remaining agile with our customers to quickly adapt to changes in demand and traffic flows.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nJim, Eric, thank you very much and the entire team. But before we get to your questions, I'd like to quickly summarize what you've heard from all of us. First, as you heard from Jennifer, the team is delivering on our strategy. We're generating carload growth and price by delivering the service we sold to our customers while driving continued productivity into the network. We are controlling what we can control. We produce quarterly records in freight revenue and operating income, and a best ever record in freight revenue excluding fuel. I'm confident our 58.1% adjusted operating ratio will be industry leading. Kenny summarized second quarter volume and revenue drivers and discussed his thoughts for the second half of 2025. Unknowns remain, but we are focused on outperforming our markets and pricing to the value we're providing our customers.\nThe second quarter surge in coal and our ability to seamlessly handle it demonstrates the value our buffer of resources provides as we compete and win business. Next, Eric reviewed our strong operating results. Safety metrics continue to show great improvement as we strive to lead the industry and bring our employees home safe. Operationally, the network is running at a very high level, delivering on our service and operating plans. We will remain agile and ready to handle whatever comes our way. Wrapping up, we remain committed to the long term guidance that we laid out at our Investor Day last September. You see that in our results and in last week's dividend increase. We are confident we will remain the industry leader as we drive value for our shareholders.\nThe foundation is built, we are growing with our customers, and we have strong momentum as we continue to maximize the value of this great franchise. In addition to today's earnings release, we also just announced that Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern are engaged in advanced discussions regarding a potential business combination. There are no assurances that we'll reach an agreement, but we are talking. We will not comment any further until there's something to disclose, and we will not take any questions relating to this topic during the Q and A with that. Rob, we're ready to start the Q and A. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Mr. Vena. We'll now be conducting the question and answer session. If you'd like to ask a question at this time, please press star one from your telephone keypad and a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star 2 if you'd like to remove your question from the queue. For participants that are using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. Due to the number of analysts joining us on the call today, we'll be limiting everyone to one question to accommodate as many participants as possible.\nThank you. The first question today comes from the line of John Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nGood morning, John.\n\nJohn Chappel\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you.\nGood morning, Jim.\nThat's quite a curve ball with the press release and not taking any questions about the thing everyone's going to ask you about. So let me phrase it this way, and you can answer it how you so choose. Everything you just laid out before the mention of the press release is everything you said you're going to do, and you're gaining momentum is amazing. The OR is best in business. You know, pricing, balance, everything's working the way it's supposed to, and you're doing this in a very tough freight environment. So why now potentially take on, you.\nNo, a multi-year distraction that could.\nPotentially sidetrack the organic momentum that you're already building.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nSo why don't we back up a little bit in time because I think you have to think about things in time and place. So I've been involved with Union Pacific with a short little time when I was on sabbatical, as I describe it, since 2019. And since 2019 it was a journey to be able to have a team, which I'm very proud of the team that's sitting here with me and everybody that works at Union Pacific to fundamentally drive the efficiency, drive the productivity, drive, drive that customer focus, drive the capability to deliver and sell and be able to move products at a high level for our customers in an efficient manner. If we look forward, truly, we look at what's possible and what's better and that's what this is all about.\nEverything else in the world is moving ahead, technology-wise, and fundamentally going to change. So I've been railroading for maybe way too long. And I remember when there was five people on trains and there was four and three. I also remember when locomotives couldn't communicate and we could not run in train power. If you stand still, you get left behind. So I love where we are because if you fundamentally have a railroad that's operating the way we operate and the way we can react, then you can do things that help the nation, help our customers win. And that's what it's all about. So sorry for the long answer, but I thought I'd frame it for you.\n\nJohn Chappel\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nI appreciate it. Thanks, Jim.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with J.P. Morgan. Please receive their question.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nMorning, Brian.\n\nBrian Ossenbeck\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nHey, good morning, Jim. Good morning, team. Thanks for taking the question. So we'll just ask more of a philosophical one for you, Jim. You know, we've seen efforts to give shippers options like reciprocal switching, you know, over the past. The court obviously just remanded that back to the STB. But what's your view on just conceptually the reciprocal switching, open access, giving shippers more options maybe in exchange for the news you just announced and you've also talked about. The rail industry hasn't done a great job for intermodal growth in the past, making some tough decisions. Wanted to see if you had some further comments on that. Maybe a direct to shipper offering at some point. So that's a lot of theoretical stuff, but I appreciate your thoughts on that, Jim. Thank you.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nSo who are we at Union Pacific? Okay. I can't talk about the industry in general. People, I think, have very similar goals. We want, we know that if we provide service at a high level and the service is what we sold the customer, we have a range of customers that need different types of service. Some need speed, some need consistency, some need storage, and some need additional. But everything that we do, from the technology we put in place to make it easier to enter faster into our intermodal facilities, faster, being able to trace cars, being able to tell where all their equipment is, working on innovative solutions, is that's how we win. And nothing changes.\nIt doesn't matter whether it was two weeks ago or today, nothing changes in what we think we need to do to continue to grow this and absolutely help the country. The more we can move off of highways onto our railroad, the more we allow our customers to be able to win in the marketplace by giving a tie in with them and have that service and product where it should be is a win. So that's the way I look at it, Brian. Hopefully you can see the philosophy that we all have here.\n\nBrian Ossenbeck\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nAppreciate it, Jim. Good luck. Thank you.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Chris Weatherbee with Wells Fargo. Please receive your question.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nMorning, Chris.\n\nChris Wetherbee\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nGood morning, Jim. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, you know, about a month or so ago, I think in a public forum, you noted that you'd only do things that you thought were possible. And I guess just maybe big picture as you're thinking about the industry moving forward here, I think your comments were interesting about not standing still. I guess when you think about what's possible, is this the landscape that would allow changes to occur, whether it be from a shipper perspective, from a technology perspective, from a regulatory perspective? I guess we're just trying to get a sense of how you see sort of the receptivity of the other stakeholders in the industry as you think about what Union Pacific is trying to accomplish over the next several years.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nI think it's a great question, and I do talk about what's possible, and that's the way we think here. It's Union Pacific is. And if you take a look at what we've done, we don't look at and we never have, but we're very, very.\nDiligent in going through any decisions that we make. I can go back in my time here, and I could go back to my time to the other great railroad that I work for, Canadian National Railways. Okay, great company, great franchise. When I came here and the team, we decided that what we wanted to be able to do is make sure that we make smart decisions: how we move ahead, how we operate, how we sell. Kenny does that in his team every day. Jennifer keeps us grounded. Some of the discussions you would find very interesting on making sure that we are driving to the best decision possible.\nBut that's who we are, if we can fundamentally operate a railroad in a safe, provide great service, and be operationally excellent, then we can look at what's possible and decide what we want to do. Next, we never take decisions lightly. We do not flippantly wake up one morning and say we're going to do something like we just announced that we're in discussion and we thought about it yesterday. We've done a lot of homework to get us to this place. I'm not going to comment. Nobody would expect me to. You know, only a fool would expect me, in the middle of when we're having discussions, to start getting into any detail. None of you are fools. I've met you all. You guys are smart people. At the end of the day, I'm very comfortable where we are.\nWe're diligent on decision making. We thought it was prudent for us, where we were, and to be fully.\nTell our shareholders and everybody exactly what we're, where we at this morning after the quarter that we had, and we're moving ahead. So, thanks for the question.\n\nChris Wetherbee\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks, Jim. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question is in the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nGood morning.\n\nStephanie Moore\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nHi, good morning. Thank you. Can you hear me?\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nI can hear you clearly. How are you this morning?\n\nStephanie Moore\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nGreat. I'm doing very well.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nI figured if I ask you questions, you won't ask me a question and we'll do a two way. Go ahead.\n\nStephanie Moore\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nYou're more than welcome to ask me whatever questions you'd like. Well, you know, maybe I'll jump away from the topic, detour real quick here. You know, I wanted to talk a little bit about the rail itself. I mean, you've made tremendous progress. The network is working.\nAs well as it has. So as you think about the back half of the year and you talk about really the cost performance as we go from Q2 to Q3, if you wanted to share any puts and takes about anything that might not continue from the second quarter into the third quarter. At the same time, how we should think about maybe some potential benefits as we look to the back half of the year and ultimately hitting that full year target. Thank you.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nYou know what, you guys are probably getting sick and tired of listening to me already. So I've got a couple people here that can give you a real wholesome view on it. And all three of you, please jump in. But Eric, why don't you start about what you see second half, what you're thinking about operationally, what's possible. And Jennifer and Kenny, you guys want to jump in? Away we go. Okay.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nYeah. So two quarters in and certainly in this quarter, we're already demonstrating a very high level of productivity and certainly a very high level of service to our customers. When you think about the second half and as we think about how we're going to execute that, you know, the game plan really isn't different. We've got a great team executing against some very challenging goals, and they're delivering on those goals now. We're looking for opportunities always. It never ends. That perpetual dissatisfaction that I've spoken about before. That's our mindset or seeing what's possible. So I still see opportunities in how we think about improving service from a dwell perspective, which also has the benefit of driving efficiency to make Kenny even more competitive in the market. With this team, I still see opportunities.\nOn the locomotive dwell side, we set our second best record ever in Q2 at 15.4 hours. There's no reason that can't be below 15. The team's up against that. Even outside of the core transportation team. It's about how we think about automation with an engine. The plan isn't different. It's to continue to be safe, it's to continue to give good service, and it's continue to find new and inventive ways to be efficient.\n\nEric Gehringer\n\nEVP Operations, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nYeah. So I'll go through a few things I mentioned in my script. Certainly we expect for our coal business to be up significantly. We're looking at grain. We've got a great harvest out there. We'll see where the demand takes us. I like the fact that our network, and Eric has a network that we can move wherever the grain and traffic flows take us. On the industrial side, you know, I'm excited and pumped up about the wins that we have in the marketplace. We're winning as our customers are expanding on us, and they're aligned with investments that we made in the Gulf Coast. On the premium side, the fight will be on international intermodal, and bottom line is we've got to backfill that volume. And some of the ways we do that is on the domestic side.\nAnd I'll tell you, when you have a strong service product like we have, we're going to introduce new products. We're going to introduce a seven-day-a-week service from Tacoma into Chicago. We're going to introduce a seven-day-a-week service from Memphis to Dallas. We're going to introduce the Kansas City intermodal terminal. That's the fourth one in the last few years. So when you got a strong service product and you're introducing what we're doing, I feel really good about where we expect to be.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nEVP and CFO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nYeah. So Stephanie, Eric and Kenny both hit great points in terms of the railroad's running really well. Kenny and his team are out there executing. We called out the one-timer that we have relative to the expense line with the labor agreement. Certainly that's not going to repeat itself as you're thinking sequentially Q2 to Q3. So all really good progress and feel really good about those things. The only thing I'll remind you of, and we've talked about this before, is that this is going to be a little bit of an unusual year for us. When you think about the volume cadence, usually you have your stronger volumes in your Q3 and Q4. Because of the strong comp that we have with International Intermodal and how we see that trending, that's likely not going to happen.\nIn fact, we're expecting some sequential declines through the back half. But set that aside. The team is executing at a very high level and we'll continue to do that.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please receive your question.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nMorning, Tom.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nSenior Equity Research, UBS Securities\n\nYeah, hey, Jim. So I want to see you. Since you had the Crain's magazine article back in May, we really had a dramatic impact on the discussion on consolidation. There's been, you know, enough time. I would imagine some of your good contacts and buddies on the customer and shipper side have reached out to you and probably giving you some feedback. Can you offer any thoughts on kind of what the flavor of that feedback is or, you know, shippers are gravely concerned? Are they mechanical shippers? Are they excited about, you know, maybe intermodal shippers are excited about a transcon railroad? Is there anything high level you can give us and just, you know, kind of initial shipper response over the last couple months? Thank you.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nSo, Tom, we deal with our unions and our employees all the time, and we decided this round to have direct negotiations, and we've signed up close to about 36% now of our employees are signed up or have a tentative agreement. That's the way our relationship is with our employees. We want our employees to come to work, deliver. We need them to work and be very efficient. We give them everything we can to make sure that they work in a safe manner and all the training necessary using technology. So that's how I look at the labor and Union Pacific. It's in a real positive place, and we're moving ahead just like we want to under all the agreements that we have. Appreciate the question.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nSenior Equity Research, UBS Securities\n\nYeah, I think I was really asking more about shipper feedback on potential transcontinental.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nYes, Tom, I said it from the start, it's pretty clear you never negotiate publicly. I think we came out and were very specific in what we said this morning. And that's about all I'm going to say. I'm not going to get into any other detail when you're in the middle of negotiation. I don't know about you guys, but last time I looked, when I went and bought a home, and I've only moved like 19 times. I don't go tell everybody on the street what I'm thinking and where I am and what I'm going to pay or anything else. You're in negotiations, so it's advanced negotiations, which is good, but that's it. It's as far as I'm going to say, Tom. Okay.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nSenior Equity Research, UBS Securities\n\nFair enough.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nMorning, Basco.\n\nBascome Majors\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Susquehanna International Group\n\nGood morning, Jim.\nAs you look out long term.\nUP has been pretty committed to the modification approach to refreshing your locomotive fleet over the last three years. Is that agreement, which I believe predated your arrival, Jim, comes to an end here in the next couple of quarters. How do you feel about the fleet today? What are your intentions and desire to continue refreshing it longer term? And, you know, does a combination make that a little more complicated than it would have been otherwise? Thank you.\n\nEric Gehringer\n\nEVP Operations, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nSo let's start with reminding ourselves that it takes five critical assets, five critical resources to run this railroad, and locomotives is one of them. So what you always want to make sure you're doing, and we do it every single day, is to ensure that, to your point, we're making the proper investment in our locomotive fleet. And to be clear, we are, as we look at the modernization program, that's one part of it. It's a very important part of it. It's what allows us to continue to improve reliability, renew the fleet, deliver fuel improvements, as well as greenhouse gas emission reductions. But we also have our overhaul program, which is another way to keep our fleet in a specific operational order that runs efficiently, runs reliably. We also have investments that we make every single day in our shops when we do modifications to the locomotive.\nSo as I look out, all three are going to remain very important. Now, the distribution of where we spend in those three buckets may change based on the condition of the fleet or the mix of traffic, but all three are critical components for us to deliver a consistent and reliable service product to our customers.\n\nBascome Majors\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Susquehanna International Group\n\nThank you.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nThanks, Bascome.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter, with Bank of America. Please proceed with their question.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nMorning Ken.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning, Jim and team, and certainly a loud announcement this morning. So I want to ask about the operating potential. Right. You're at a 58.1 maybe. Can you talk about where you think you can still take this railroad in terms of operating ratio efficiency? And Jen, you talked about the ability to hit the upper single digit, low double digit target. I think you were kind of saying specifically to this year. Right. I just want to clarify that. Where it hadn't been. I don't think that specific before. And Jim, just can you clarify just using words. Right. You mentioned it's an advanced. Is there different stages of discussions that like we should be taking away with the advanced comment? Thanks.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nWell, that was pretty good. Ken, three questions. Jennifer, why don't you reiterate what our saying we're going to deliver moving forward, our guidance.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nEVP and CFO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nYeah, thanks Ken. We have not said anything different on that EPS piece than what we've been saying all year. We're reiterating our three year target. We're confident in our ability to hit that. We've said that this year's performance will be consistent with hitting that. So, really, there's been no change there, and you know, obviously the world's changed a little bit since last September. You know, we weren't expecting tariffs; we weren't expecting some of the things in the economy. Conversely, we're running as well as we ever have. So, lots of puts and takes all in. We're still very confident in our ability to hit those targets.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nYou bet. And on the second piece is of operational efficiency. Ken, you know me, you and I have talked about, if we haven't talked 100 times, I'd be surprised. I'm very consistent on that. I don't get out and tell people and put a number out and say this is what we're going to deliver because there's so many puts and takes in operating the railroad. But bottom line is our goal is to be the most efficient. That would mean driving the operating ratio the lowest in what the business and the mix that we have can deliver. And that's what it's all about for us and we're real happy in the last few quarters I think we've been in the position that we're leading the industry in that and we want to continue to do that. What it looks like down the road.\nI don't know, you know if Kenny could go get a whole bunch more price, he would really help us on the operating ratio. Maybe I'll have to push him a little harder. Kenny, I know you. You've told me a few times that I pushed Kenny a little too hard.\nSo.\nI just thought I'd remind you about that. Did I miss any of your questions? Because you had three or four.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nJust the advanced comment. I just want to understand, is there a signal there or what it means? I don't know what you're trying to send with that comment.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nThere's nothing there. Just read it and think about what it says. That's it. It's as simple as that. You're a smart guy. Okay.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nAppreciate it, Jim. Thank you.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Daniel Imbro with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nGood morning, Daniel.\n\nDaniel Imbro\n\nmanaging Director, Stephens\n\nHey. Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question, Jim. Maybe a different question on regulation here. To follow up on part of Chris's question earlier, just with the new administration and maybe lower regulatory backdrop, are we seeing any progress on things like zero to zero, one man crews? I mean, you mentioned you knew when it was five man crews, four man crews. I mean, any progress on that push towards automation or any closer to a more efficient future with the new administration?\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nYeah, you know, Eric has really been leading a lot of that discussion with the FRA, and I'll let him speak. Go ahead, Eric.\n\nEric Gehringer\n\nEVP Operations, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nDaniel, we're definitely seeing momentum. You know, we've always appreciated our partnership with the FRA as an example. Right now, those engagements, they've been very effective, they've been prompt. We're trying to move as quickly as possible, both at the railroad and the FRA, but also in the industry. You pointed out some of the technologies, and certainly those are parts of our discussions, but it's broader than that. You know, as we look at technologies, even outside of what's related to the number of people in the capital locomotive, there's a lot of opportunity for us to continue to improve safety by being allowed to implement technologies, some of which have been around for a while, some of which that are just new, and some of which that we're developing. I'm very happy with where we are with all of them.\nI think the way to measure us against that is the speed at which we can get through those conversations and get it on, not just our railroad, but many other railroads, because the net benefit is a safer railroad industry.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nSenior Equity Research, UBS Securities\n\nGreat.\nAppreciate the answer.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is on the line of Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJason Seidl\n\nStock Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning. You know, I guess with your line of questioning or how limited you could be, I could ask about if you guys tied up too much money in Bouchard for $10.5 million a season, but I'm going to try anyway. You know, there's been a lot of talk about, you know, opening up some of this watershed traffic or accessing it. Can you talk about sort of the market that's out there for the rail industry in terms of how much business you think is available to access, whether it be through a deal or through railroads working together more closely?\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nWell, let me talk real quick about the business and the way we look at it. Okay. What's important is if you build the fundamentals and have a very efficient railroad, you can open up markets that you can handle within the physical plant that you have. That's real important for us.\nDelivering at a high level to deliver what we sold and what we agreed to with the customer, and they know we're consistent and not just for a short period of time, is real important for us to open up opportunity, and that's what's real important. You know what, I have a little fun with Kenny every so often, but Kenny's real close to the truck customers and what we're doing and how we're looking at it and how we want to build together to win. Kenny, why don't you fill in some of the gaps? Yeah.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nI'll just say through our interline alliances, we've always looked at which markets we can open up. When you have a strong, efficient network and service product that we have today, obviously that allows us to look at new opportunities and allows our customers to look at opportunities. We're going to keep with that mindset and see if we can grow the business.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nPerfect. Thank you very much. Thanks for the question.\n\nJason Seidl\n\nStock Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please receive your question.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nGood morning, Scott.\n\nScott Group\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning. I'll just stick to some of the fundamentals for now. Jennifer, any thoughts on second half operating ratio? Second half price mix as you sort of think about the business, and then I know, Kenny, this just huge strength in coal, putting aside the contract win, what's the sense from customers about the sustainability of this? Do we need to just think about, we need to start thinking about coal a little bit differently just given everything going on, the power markets.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nEVP and CFO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nOkay, Scott, I think that was about a three part question, but I'm going to give you extra credit because you asked about the fundamentals of the business. In terms of, you know, how we think about or obviously Jim's talked about that, that's an outcome of all the efforts that we're putting forward. You know, our challenge and our task as a management team is to make continuous improvement, and we feel very confident in our ability to continue to drive improvement as we move through the back half of the year. You mentioned price mix.\nYeah, as we look at the back half of the year, we do actually think, assuming our belief is correct, which I think it is, in terms of what's going to happen with International Intermodal as a part of our business mix, we should see that mix piece turn more positive as we move through the second half. That is an expectation that we have in there. Scott, I think you're spot on with that. Even though, one last comment and then I'll let Kenny talk to coal. Just as a reminder, on the coal piece, while it is, you know, has a higher arc than our International Intermodal, it is still below the system average. So, Kenny.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific Corporation",
    "content2": "Yes, I talked about the natural gas prices. That's certainly playing a role. More importantly, the service product that Eric and his team is providing us, being able to pull ahead more tons and deliver more trains, especially in a time where they need it, when natural gas prices are where they are. We benefited from that. Obviously, we've talked about the wind, which is also uplift for us with LCRA, and I think you had a question about the future. We'll see what happens. I mean, we're looking closely at the impact of data centers out there and cloud computing. Will it have an impact on coal overall? Maybe we'll see some retirement get pushed out. Right now, we're really being opportunistic with the service and capturing what we can.\n\nEric Gehringer\n\nEVP Operations, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nIt's been a great opportunity for us to reinforce the buffer resources that they're there. Kenny brings the business to the railroad. We're not waiting weeks and months. We're finding out we have the locomotives, they're pre-positioned, we have the crews, and we get that volume on the railroad.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nEric Gehringer\n\nEVP Operations, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nBuild in America?\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nYeah, you bet. Scott, thank you very much. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, we asked everyone a chance to ask a question. We ask you limit questions to one. The next question comes from the line of Richa Harnain with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nGood morning.\n\nRicha Harnain\n\nStock Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey everyone. Good morning. Maybe you can talk a little bit about how you see your intermodal channel partners, the IMCs, fitting into the equation of driving, you know, more domestic intermodal and enabling more conversions. You know, it seems like you're doing more transloading services through your own subsidiaries. Do you think that's sustainable or you can grow it? You know, Kenny, you talked about the new products you're introducing on the domestic side seven days a week in various markets. Are your IMC partners able to keep up? I know, just a bonus one if you throw me a bone given it's on the core business. Kenny, you also talked about, I think, over 400 projects and you have in line of sight winning those, and maybe you can talk about customer feedback on turning those on.\nIf those conversations are being accelerated by the new tax plan, anything on the long-term outlook for the revenue growth would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nYeah, I'll just talk high level about intermodal, and I tell you we're excited about the framework we have with our portfolio of private asset customers and our own Railbox. When we talk to BCOs, they like the fact that they've got a choice of IMCs and private asset owners to look at. Our Railbox is very compelling, competitive, and we've seen it compete very favorably in the marketplace. The second part of your question is around industrial development, and yes, the team is out there hustling to bring on more traffic, engage. We've had some really strong wins already this year. We look at those as 40-year assets that will be around for a while. We've seen the cadence there.\nA slight uptick in run rate from what we've seen in the previous year. It's hard to pinpoint that's because of the administration or some policy change. We're encouraged about the future of how those projects will shake out.\n\nRicha Harnain\n\nStock Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nGreat. Have a good day. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski, Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nMorning, Brandon.\n\nBrandon Oglenski\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi. Good morning, Jim. I guess I want to ask one on the historical perspective of the industry, just given your career, like how has the interchange process for customers evolved? I mean, we always used to talk about Chicago as being a real pain point, so I guess can you talk to where that is today, some of the challenges that you still see with your shippers, and maybe some of the inherent limitations on dealing with that given today's structure.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nI think you always have to look at how you simplify the movement of products, and we do that internally in how we use our network, and it's a great example of how we operate. You can come out of the LA Basin with a number of different products, not just intermodal, and decide how you're going to move it to the different markets and what you've sold to the customer on speed. The more you can do that, you remove touch points. We do that all the time, Eric. We spend a lot of time looking at ways that we don't have to process cars in multiple hump yards or multiple switching facilities. That's one of the, you know, here I am talking about our secret sauce.\nWe spend a lot of time worried about and have technology that helps us be able to examine it. For us, that's real important. That's the way we operate. If you can have a much more fluid, less touching railroad, and that's what we've driven, it helps us being able to provide a higher level of service, because you remove some of that noise that happens when you hand off. You know, if it gets to the hump yard in Inglewood and you hump it there and then you want to go all the way to Minneapolis and you're trying to figure out that you, you know, we used to touch those cars two or three times. Every time you touch, something could go wrong.\nIf you do it in a much more seamless manner the way we have, and also in a cost efficient manner, it's a win-win. Sorry for getting into the detail, but that's just the way my mind works. I think Eric does as good a job, or maybe even better than me at looking at that stuff. I give the team a lot of credit, and Kenny loves it because we remove some of the noise on how we move the traffic and make it less expensive for us to move. That's the way I look at it. Thanks for the question.\n\nBrandon Oglenski\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Barclays\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please receive your question.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nMorning, Walter. How are you?\n\nWalter Spracklin\n\nDirector and Co-Head of Industrials Research, RBC Capitals\n\nMorning, Jim. Good, good.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nYeah, my Oilers didn't make it again.\n\nWalter Spracklin\n\nDirector and Co-Head of Industrials Research, RBC Capitals\n\nYeah, our lease didn't either.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nOut of a gun.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nOkay. Keep on going back to railroad.\n\nWalter Spracklin\n\nDirector and Co-Head of Industrials Research, RBC Capitals\n\nAbsolutely. I'm going to put merger, you know, if we put aside merger talk to you, I mean, you and I, we have talked in the past about US bound traffic making its way up through Canadian ports, and that's been a target for you in terms of repatriating that. I was wondering, have you ever quantified that as a total addressable market as to how much, how much you could reach repatriate, and if you, even if it were to go after that, is the port a big bottleneck at all in terms of you getting that volume, or is it, you know, forget that volume, if we get more east, west fluidity, it's really domestic that you're going to focus on, not international intermodal.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nWell, I think you, as a railroad, we look at all ways to be able to grow our business and win in the marketplace. The entire supply chain is the only way you win. You can have the most efficient one piece of it that will not, Walter, allow you to win that business. If you can deliver it. Listen, the Canadians, and I was there with CN, they've done a CN, and I don't know CP quite as well, but I'm absolutely sure that Keith's all over it big time. He's a smart guy, same thing with Tracy, very smart person. At the end of the day, they're working hard to make their supply chain better. My job and all of us here is to have a competitive product that we can win. We are competing as railroads every day.\nI'll be honest. If I could figure out a way to drop about three trains a day coming out of Canada going into Chicago and winning that marketplace, I think that's my job and that's my responsibility and I would do it. Kenny, anything you want to add?\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nYeah, just to reiterate, very strong service product. You heard me talk about ways that we can penetrate those markets. How do you get a service product that we've created from Tacoma into the Chicago market? That's one way. Another way is creating a new ramp at Twin Cities. We are on offense when it comes to trying to go out there and grab new business.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nWalter, thank you very much. Appreciate it.\n\nWalter Spracklin\n\nDirector and Co-Head of Industrials Research, RBC Capitals\n\nThank you, Jim.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Yeah.\n\nJordan Alliger\n\nEquity Research Analyst and VP, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi. Morning. Just curiosity question, you know, simultaneous with the discussions you're having with Norfolk Southern, do you actually pre discuss or engage in like pre merger chats with the Surface Transportation Board around this? Thank you.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nYeah, listen, I appreciate the question, but like I said, we've given all the information that one those two lines that we put out, and that's where we are right now. I think that's a lot of information we handed out today. For us, that's where we are, and we'll see what happens next. I appreciate the question. Thank you.\n\nJordan Alliger\n\nEquity Research Analyst and VP, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. This is you with your question.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nSenior Analyst and Managing Director, Bernstein\n\nHey, guys, and Jim, thanks for disproving the thesis that boss are somehow in this quarter. Very good call numbers. Thank you very much. Kenny, as you're looking at the tariff impact on the grain export risk, you know, I guess it occurs to me that the export side of the equation is going to be a negative. As you're looking across the business, whether it's metals or some of the more domestic movements, are you seeing any positives as freight holders are kind of being redirected or, you know, tariffs are incentivizing additional production inside of the US? Can you talk a little bit about how that balances out from an overall impact on the book of business? Thanks.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nYeah. David, first I want to say the biggest positive is the service product that we have out there to handle the stops and starts that come with tariffs that we've seen over the last, call it, seven to nine months. Also, traffic flows have changed. When you have a prepared service network and strong service, that's the positive for us. Taking a step back, if you look at it externally, we are starting to see a few green shoots out there. I met with a customer a couple months ago that said they were shifting some of their production from Asia into Mexico, and we've got a strong service product coming out of Mexico. I mentioned our industrial development pipeline. We're keeping an eye on that to see if we see a little bit more growth on the metal side over the long term.\nWe think that will be a positive for us even if it does not happen today or next week. Encouraged by that.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nSenior Analyst and Managing Director, Bernstein\n\nThank you very much. Appreciate it all.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Ari Rosa with Credit Suisse. Let's hear your question.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nAri, good morning.\n\nAri Rosa\n\nSenior Analyst, Credit Suisse\n\nHey, good morning, Jim. Congrats on a nice quarter here. Jim, you talked about evolving to the changing business environment. It's not really M and A specific, but I was hoping you could talk about what constraints you think UP has from kind of a structural network perspective that inhibit its growth, and what prevents you from taking more share off the highway, especially with the service levels as strong as they are today.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nOkay, you know what, I've answered that sort of type of question a lot, and I like to push my team a little bit. Jennifer, it's yours.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nEVP and CFO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nWell, thank you, Jim. I'm going to channel my inner Kenny Rocker on this one.\n\nAri Rosa\n\nSenior Analyst, Credit Suisse\n\nI think, first of all, it does start with the fundamentals of how we approach our customers and how we can be flexible with them, and how we can provide a great service product. One of the things we really have not talked about, maybe, and should talk about more, is Eric and his team are very much partnered with Kenny's team to say, what does this customer need? We are deep into those conversations, not just saying, here is our service product. Do you like it? It is more, what service product do you need, and how can we introduce that? How can we service you better to meet those needs? Kenny referenced earlier, we are introducing a couple new intermodal service products.\nI know we've got lots of examples too on the manifest side where in those customer discussions they've told us they need either more frequent day a week service, maybe changing time of day, et cetera. Eric and his team have worked with that, and that's picked up incremental carloads. I'd also take you back to something that Jim brought when he first got here. I know you've heard us talk about this: speed of decision making, speed of market, supporting those customers. When they come to us with a business opportunity, they're not talking to us about something they want to do sometimes in two years or three years. Sometimes it is, but sometimes it's in the next 30 days, in the next 60 days. This is the opportunity we have.\nBy being much more nimble, we've layered the organization that's allowing us to jump in there and attack that as well. Well, and with the strong service product, we're saving money for our customers by taking days out of their transit time. That's real money for our customers in terms of inventory, and in terms of their equipment assets. It's an all of up kind of effort, and it's winning. Kenny just raised his hand, so I think he wants to add something.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nJennifer, you got an A for that. That was good.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nEVP and CFO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nThank you.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nThe one thing I'll add that Jim and Eric have brought to us is around car supply and equipment supply, and you know, nearing 100% in that order fulfillment number. We're really excited about that, and customers are excited. It gives us an opportunity to get one or two more cars out of that facility. That's another win for us.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nAri, thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please, your question.\n\nRavi Shanker\n\nStock Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thanks. Thanks for all the discussion today. Jim, maybe just a follow up to a previous question. Obviously you've had many, many, many customer conversations over the years. To what extent have you been effectively asked by your shipper customers to see if you can put together something like a transcon railroad, because they want a service like that, and they want to take trucks off the road? To what extent kind of has this been precipitated by customer conversations?\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nCustomers tell us this. They've been very consistent with me my entire career. What's my service, how do I move to the markets, what are my options? It comes down to what do you charge me for it? If we can win on the service, we can win on that. Customers are happy. You can see that, like fundamentally this quarter. I think sometimes we get caught up in other noise, but if you look at fundamentally, this quarter, we were able to grow our business. We were able to increase our revenue. We were able to show how efficient we could be when our total compensation was up at 1% above with all the inflationary. That's who we are. That's what we sell to our customers. If we do that, our customers are aligned with us.\nThey want to be with Union Pacific, they want to be with this railroad, they want to win, and they want to be with the railroad that opens opportunity for them. It's as simple as that. That's all I have to say. Thank you very much.\n\nRavi Shanker\n\nStock Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nUnderstood. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nMorning, Jeff.\n\nJeff Kaufman\n\nEquity Research, Vertical Research\n\nThank you. Hey, good morning. Congratulations. Terrific quarter. Thank you for squeezing me in. Jen, have you looked at the one big beautiful bill and assessed how that might impact the opportunities in cash flow at the company?\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nEVP and CFO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nYes, we have looked at that. Going back and restoring 100% bonus depreciation obviously is a benefit. We think, you know, for us it's probably cash, $250 to 300 million incremental on an annual basis.\n\nJeff Kaufman\n\nEquity Research, Vertical Research\n\nOkay, that's the primary impact for their other.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nEVP and CFO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nThat's the primary impact. You know, we do make some investment tax credit purchases. Those are still available through the bill, R&D credit regulatory. I think that's all there.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nYeah, so there's lots. Jennifer, the only thing I would add is, you know, the administration talking about deregulation, making sure that the businesses have the opportunity to work, win because we do compete against everybody else in the world is real important to us. I like some of those things that work specifically in the big beautiful bill, but help us to compete better and be able to move our products within the US and internationally. Thank you for the question. I guess Operator, that's the last question. If I can just tie it up, I apologize for the curveball that we sent out, but we thought it was prudent to put that out. Fundamentally, what is more important to myself, the entire team, and all 30,000 of us that work at Union Pacific is to move this company forward.\nWe like where we are. Do we have more work to do? Eric says it well, we are never satisfied. I never wake up in the morning and say, my God, what am I going to do today? It's who can I push, and what can I do to deliver better operations and better value to our customers? We are excited. We had a great quarter. We have to build on this for the third quarter, and we are looking forward to having a discussion with all of you, for sure, when we report after the third quarter. Have a great day. Thank you very much for listening in and taking the time.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day."

If anyone today should require operator assistance, please press star zero from your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website at this time. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jim Vena, Chief Executive Officer for Union Pacific. Mr. Vena, you may now begin.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nGood morning, Rob, and thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Union Pacific's first quarter results. I'm joined in Omaha by our Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Hamann, our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales, Kenny Rocker, and our Executive Vice President of Operations Eric Gehringer. As you'll hear from the team. Excuse me. We had a solid start to the year. Our reported operating ratio was 60.7%, flat compared to last year. Even with a 90 basis points headwind from fuel and leap year, we delivered record first quarter operating performance. Further, we had the strongest carload growth of the Class 1s as we worked closely with our customers to meet their needs in an uncertain environment.\nNow let's discuss first quarter results. Starting on Slide 3 this morning, Union Pacific reported 2025 first quarter earnings per share of $2.70, which reflects a $0.19 or 7% headwind from fuel and leap year.\nOur reported Q1 2025 net income of $1.6 billion was essentially flat versus last year. Reported Q1 2025 operating income was flat as 7%. Volume growth, robust core pricing gains, and strong productivity were offset by business mix, fuel, and the leap year. Freight revenue grew 1% versus last year, and if you exclude the impact from fuel surcharge, freight revenue increased 4%, both Q1 records. Looking to the rest of 2025, we will continue to execute our strategy that emphasizes safety, service, and operational excellence, building on the strong foundation with our record Q1 operating performance, we are positioned to deliver. I'll let the team walk you through the quarter in more detail and then come back and wrap it up before we go to Q&A with that. Jennifer. First Quarter Financials, all right.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nEVP and CFO, Union Pacific\n\nThanks Jim and good morning everyone. I'll begin with a walkdown of our first quarter income statement on Slide 5 where operating revenue of $6 billion matched last year's level even with lower quarterly fuel surcharge revenue, a reduction in other revenue, and the leap year comparison. Freight revenue of $5.7 billion increased 1.1% despite the roughly $70 million impact of having one less day in the quarter. Digging into the freight revenue drivers further, our strong volume growth in the quarter added 650 basis points to freight revenue. Fuel surcharge revenue of $565 million declined $100 million as the impact of lower year-over-year fuel prices more than offset the higher volume, reducing freight revenue to 275 basis points. Core pricing was very strong and reached the highest quarterly level in the past 10 years. Further, pricing dollars net of inflation were accretive to our operating ratio.\nDespite these robust results, quarterly business mix combined with price for a 250 basis points drag on freight revenue. In addition to volume growth and our lower average revenue per car business lines such as Intermodal and coal, we had the additional dynamic of lower volumes in our higher businesses like petroleum, soda ash, and finished vehicles. Wrapping up the top line, other revenue declined 19% to $336 million. Included in the year-over-year change are several items including some that we have discussed previously, such as last year's Intermodal equipment sale and the Metra transfer. Quarterly results were also challenged by reduced other auto parts shipments at a subsidiary and lower accessorial revenue. Finally, you'll recall that Q1 2024 included a one-time favorable contract settlement of $25 million switching to expenses.\nOperating expense of $3.7 billion equaled last year as solid productivity gains and lower fuel costs offset volume-related costs, inflation, and depreciation. Digging deeper into a few of the operating expense lines, compensation and benefits expense improved 1% versus last year as reduced workforce levels were partially offset by wage inflation. Record quarterly workforce productivity enabled us to limit first quarter cost per employee to only a 2% increase. First quarter fuel expense declined 8% on an 11% decrease in fuel prices from $2.81-$2.51 per gallon. We also improved our fuel consumption rate 1% during the quarter as we continue to leverage optimization tools such as Energy Management Systems on our locomotive fleet, enhancing train handling while reducing consumption.\nPurchases, services, and materials expense increased 3% versus last year, driven by inflation, volume-related costs, and a favorable 2024 item, partially offset by lower costs at a subsidiary. Equipment and other rents increased 12%, driven by increased car hire for automotive racks, inflation, and demand in intermodal and other traffic that utilizes foreign freight cars. Finally, other expense increased 1% as higher costs associated with destroyed equipment were partially offset by lower bad debt expense and environmental remediation costs. First quarter operating income of $2.4 billion was consistent with last year. Below the line, interest expense declined 1% on lower average debt levels, partially offset by a slightly higher effective interest rate. First quarter 2025 net income totaled $1.6 billion, and earnings per share came in at $2.70, both essentially flat versus 2024 despite the $0.19 EPS impact from fuel and leap year.\nSimilarly, fuel and leap year had a 90 basis points unfavorable impact on our reported quarterly operating ratio of 60.7%. All in, the UP team produced a good quarterly performance and start to 2025. Before I go on, a couple housekeeping items I want to mention first is that we now estimate our other revenue will total about $325 million per quarter, reflecting our expectations for lower accessorial and subsidiary revenue. And a reminder that in Q2 2024 our results included a $46 million benefit in other expense from the sale of intermodal equipment, and we have now lapped that transaction. Turning to shareholder returns and the balance sheet on slide 6, Q1 cash from operations totaled $2.2 billion, up 4% versus last year.\nIn February, we initiated an accelerated share repurchase program for $1.5 billion, and through the quarter, we made open marketplace purchases of an additional $220 million as we more recently took advantage of very attractive share prices. That cash return plus our industry-leading dividend payout enabled us to return $2.5 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter. In the quarter, our net debt increased $1.7 billion as we issued $2 billion of long-term debt and paid maturities totaling $350 million, and this resulted in our adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.22.8 times at the end of the quarter as we continue to be A-rated by our three credit rating agencies. Turning to the remainder of 2025, on slide 7, as we look to the next three quarters, it is likely going to be a bumpy ride.\nIn preparation, we've worked through scenario planning and will remain agile. Importantly, we will continue executing our strategy and are maintaining the three-year target set at our investor day last September. In particular, 2025 EPS growth will be consistent with attaining our three-year EPS CAGR view of high single- to low double-digit growth. Similarly, our views on accretive pricing, industry-leading operating ratio, and ROIC, as well as capital deployment plans, still hold. Obviously, there's uncertainty in the marketplace, but the year is off to a good start and we are delivering value for our shareholders. In fact, April volumes and service metrics were quite strong heading into the Easter weekend. Our focus on safety, service, and operational excellence prepares us for whatever lies ahead and we're confident in our ability to perform.\nI'll now turn it over to Kenny to provide you an update on the business everyone.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nThank you, Jennifer, and good morning. Freight revenues totaled $5.7 billion for the quarter, which was up 4% excluding fuel surcharges due to increased volume. Despite unfavorable mix, we saw strong core pricing gains, which, as Jennifer mentioned, was the highest absolute quarterly level over the past 10 years. This is a testament to our deliberate focus on maximizing price. Let's jump right in and talk about the key drivers for each of these business groups, starting with our bulk segment. Revenue for the quarter was up 1% compared to last year on a 2% increase in volume and a 1% decrease in average revenue per car, as business mix and lower fuel surcharge revenue was more than offset by core pricing gains and volume. Coal saw strong customer demand due to favorable natural gas pricing.\nGrain products volume was up for the quarter driven by increased demand for feedstock.\nLocating new customers on our railroad ensures long-term ratable demand, and the newest facilities located in Nebraska and Kansas are now running at full capacity. Lastly, food and beverage volume declined in the quarter, primarily driven by consumer preference. Turning to industrial, revenue was down 1% for the quarter on a 1% decrease and volume. Strong core pricing gains were offset by business mix, lower fuel surcharges, and volume. Petroleum shipments decreased during the quarter due to business shifts, while soda ash was impacted by weaker global demand. This was partially offset by increased rock shipments driven by strong customer demand coupled with favorable weather conditions. Compared to last year.\nPremium revenue for the quarter was up 5% on a 13% increase in volume and a 7% decrease in average revenue per car, reflecting the mix impact of increased intermodal shipments, and lower fuel surcharges. Intermodal volumes remain strong based on international West Coast import demand. Additional positive domestic intermodal growth was further supported by business development efforts. Automotive volumes experienced a decline due to reduced OEM production.\nTurning to slide 10, here is our 2025 outlook as we see it today for the key markets we serve. We've had a solid start to the second quarter with AAR car loadings currently up just over 7% compared to last year. Now, starting with bulk, continued challenges for food and beverage are expected primarily based on weakness in the US beer market. We anticipate coal volumes to remain strong in the near term. However, there is always volatility in natural gas prices, so we'll remain agile as we move into the second half of the year. Lastly, we expect grain exports into Mexico to remain strong for grain products. Our intense focus on business development results is expected to mitigate market uncertainty in renewable fuels and associated feedstocks.\nMoving to industrial, we anticipate petroleum volume to remain challenged due to business shifts and our commitment to balance the volume at the right margin. Our industrial chemicals and plastics markets will remain favorable based on customer plant expansion and our ability to win incremental volume in the marketplace. For example, we are excited to support Dow's expansion later this year at their Poly 7 facility in Freeport, Texas, and wrapping up with premium. While tariff uncertainty remains a concern for automotive, we are closely aligned with our customers, providing guidance and solutions every step of the way. On the intermodal side, we anticipate a slowdown in international intermodal as we move through Q2, and we expect decreased volume in H2 due to the higher comparisons as customers diversify back to East Coast and Canadian ports.\nHowever, we remain optimistic about growth in domestic intermodal driven by our over-the-road conversions. Because of our strong service product and multiple channels to win, we are keeping a watchful eye on the market and potential tariff changes that could further impact overall consumer spending. While we navigate the trade policies and face difficult comparisons in the latter half of the year, our team is proactively taking action and hustling to overcome these obstacles. Specifically, earlier this month we began moving volumes with Lower Colorado River Authority and will continue to ramp up throughout the month. The team's focus on business development is yielding positive results as we see incremental volume from new and expanding facilities across multiple segments like grain products, and petrochemicals. In fact, we actively maintain an open pipeline of 200 construction projects, so business development through growth and expansion is always a priority.\nThe team is also setting the stage for future growth. Hyundai Steel Corporation recently joined the Union Pacific rail network, announcing their first-ever US steel mill in Louisiana. Construction won't be complete for a few years, but this is a positive result of our current business development efforts. With our strong service product, I am confident that we will continue to win new business and take trucks off the road. And as I stated last quarter, our commercial team is crystal clear on acceptable pricing levels based on the service we sold, which is driving strong core pricing gains. I'm proud of the team's ability to deliver a 4% increase in freight revenue excluding fuel. The team is focused, and I'm very comfortable with our current position, and with that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational.\n\nEric Gehringer\n\nEVP of Operations, Union Pacific\n\nPerformance. Thank you, Kenny, and good morning. Moving to Slide 12, in the first quarter, we continued to see meaningful improvements across nearly all of our metrics. This is a testament to our strategy and our steadfast focus on providing industry-leading safety, service, and operational excellence. Starting with safety, which is the foundation of everything we do. Both personal injury and derailment rates continue to improve versus their three-year rolling average. In fact, we achieved a first quarter personal injury rate that tied a quarterly record dating back to 2016. Our number one priority remains returning all employees home safely each and every day. Freight car velocity, the best measure of fluidity on the railroad, improved 6% to 215mi per day, a first quarter record.\nThe primary driver was further reductions in terminal dwell which improved 6% year over year and also set a new first quarter record. We are turning our customers' assets faster, a win-win as we support their growth initiatives while simultaneously generating future growth capacity within our terminals. On the service front, Manifest SPI was 93%, a six-point improvement, while Intermodal SPI at 94% was essentially flat. Our buffer of resources, coupled with improved fluidity I mentioned earlier, continues to translate into a very high level of service for our customers, and customers are seeing the benefit, rewarding Union Pacific with new business. As Kenny mentioned, we successfully onboarded our new coal customer while also adding incremental growth coal sets beyond what we had originally planned coming into the year.\nOn the intermodal front, we continue to handle historically high international intermodal volumes, all while delivering a service we sold our customers. Now let's review our key efficiency metrics on Slide 13. Throughout the quarter, the team was effective in our approach to asset management, leveraging our buffer of resources to inject assets only as we needed them. That approach paid off as you see improved efficiency metrics across the board. Locomotive productivity improved 1% compared to Q1 2024. Notably, our active locomotive fleet only increased 3% against the backdrop of a 7% volume growth and normal winter weather challenges we historically experience this time of the year. While the increased fluidity of our network enabled the performance, we also see the continued benefits from our work on locomotive dwell. Workforce productivity, which includes all employees, improved 9%.\nMore specifically, our active train, engine, and yard workforce decreased 1%, demonstrating excellent operating leverage against the 7% volume growth. We will continue to support our training pipeline and provide the capacity buffer necessary to navigate an ever-changing environment. Train length in the quarter grew 2% compared to Q1 2024. Further, we delivered improved train length sequentially despite lower intermodal volumes, which generally provide greater density to drive gains in train length. We will continue to leverage proprietary technologies like Precision Train Builder to safely grow train length while generating mainline capacity for current and future growth. Wrapping up, I'm very proud of the team and the results we delivered. We efficiently leveraged our resources to handle volume growth in a service-focused manner.\nAs we progress throughout the year, we will remain agile and in constant communication with our customers as they analyze their supply chain options. I'm very confident in our ability to control what we can control, whether it be our service, service, product, buffer of resources, asset utilization, et cetera. We are prepared and as we move forward, I'm certain you will see our resiliency on display. Jim.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nJust caught me having a sip of coffee. You were way too fast closing that off, Eric. I thought you still had a couple of lines. Listen, thank you very much, and why don't we turn to slide 15? Before we get to your questions, I'd like to quickly summarize what you've heard from our team. First, as you heard from Jennifer and Kenny, there are still a lot of unknowns related to volumes and the economy. But what I do know is that we are driving efficiency throughout our network and pricing for the strong value we provide our customers. Eric walked you through the records we're setting across safety, service, and operational excellence. The network is fluid, and we are meeting the demands of all our customers. We are in a good position, and we will be agile and responsive as we move forward.\nWe remain committed to the long-term guidance that we laid out at our investor day last September. We are confident we will be the industry leader as we drive value for our shareholders. We have the right strategy, right team, and the right focus on the fundamentals, all supporting our ability to unlock the great value of the UP franchise. With that, we're now ready to take your questions Rob?\nThank you, Mr. Vena. We'll now be conducting our question and answer session. If you'd like to ask a question at this time, please press star 1 on your telephone keypad, and a confirmation tone to indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star 2 if you'd like to withdraw your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. Due to the number of analysts joining us on the call today, we'll be limiting everyone to one question to accommodate as many participants as possible. Thank you. Our first question will be coming from the line of Chris Wetherbee, Wells Fargo. Lucius, you with your question.\n\nChris Wetherbee\n\nSenior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGood.\nMorning. Hey.\nThanks. Good morning, guys.\nMorning. You know, I guess I wanted.\nTo talk a little bit about 2025 guidance. So, you know, obviously uncertainty is building here with concerns about maybe some slowing activity, particularly on the West Coast. You guys have talked about sort of growth this year consistent with the long term targets. And I think that can kind of take a couple of different meanings. So I was kind of curious if you wanted to maybe put a little bit of a finer point, kind of think about what the potential outcomes could be either from an earnings perspective, maybe from an operating ratio. Just wanted to see if you can put some framework around what you think 25 might look like, just given the uncertainty that's out there.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nWell, Chris, that's a great question and a great way to start off. So at this point, there's a lot of things, tariffs, economy, what the consumer does, what interest rates, what's going to happen with interest rates, what's going to happen with the tax package or the packages that the Congress is looking at doing. So all those things are up in the air. What we look at at this point in time, we're very comfortable that we're standing by our guidance that we provided last year. Now, is it a little muddier at this point than it was when we gave it last year? Absolutely. But at this point, what we're seeing, and that's why Jennifer mentioned our carloads are pretty strong so far in April and the mix is pretty strong.\nSo, we like what we see, and we just don't want to get, because everything is so fluid. We'd be remiss to start talking about what's going to happen as we move through the rest of the year. For us though, what we look at, and it's very key.\nFoundationally, fundamentally, we have a railroad that's operating, and we're able to be able to take a look at how we spend money on the railroad and what we're doing in a very efficient manner. Eric took you through the details of how we're doing and how we're looking at things, and I think we've shown over the last few quarters and especially the first quarter what's possible with this railroad. If you come in with a fundamental railroad that's operating in a very good manner, what happens is you can build from that. The reaction is what happens with all these items, these vectors that I've talked about coming in at us. End of the day, I'm comfortable. If we need to react, we will react. But at this point, I think it's so fluid.\nI woke up this morning to see when I woke up when I normally do, went to bed last night at midnight after watching that bad hockey game that my team lost real bad, and woke up this morning to see what the news was, the latest. At this point it's a day-to-day, week-to-week reaction of what's happening out in the marketplace. So that's why, Chris, we're sticking to our three-year guidance. We think if everything comes to a normal, much more normal situation, I think we will deliver that and we're very comfortable that we have the opportunity to do that. Jennifer, anything you want to\nadd?\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nEVP and CFO, Union Pacific\n\nNo. I mean, I think you hit all the right points, Jim. You know, we are looking at it a number of different ways, both in terms of what we think is going to happen on the demand side. But obviously Eric and his team has to be prepared in terms of if demand does fall, what are the levers that we can pull. So when we look at that in totality, we feel comfortable that we've got the right strategy. We're well positioned, and obviously we want to take advantage of carloads when they're there. I think we're doing a really good job of that.\ntoday.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you very.\nMuch appreciate it. Thank.\nYou.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please receive your.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nQuestion.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nYeah, good morning. Yeah, good morning. I guess this is a question along the same theme, which you'll probably get even more after mine. But when we think about your framework for this year and kind of, you know, volumes are strong in April but you know, there are a number of segments that might be pre shipping or fall off. So I guess if you say in that kind of three year guide and call it high single digits earnings growth at the low end, is there like a revenue growth or a volume growth assumption that you say, hey, we kind of need to be in this range in order to achieve that.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nI guess I don't know if that's the low single digits revenue growth, and then I guess if just from a year over year perspective, if you're flat in earnings in Q1 but you do full year high single digits, what's the lever that accelerates? Is it just easier comps? Is it kind of volume accelerate? Just I guess a couple more things of how we understand the frame. Thank.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nWell, Tom, you know what, it's an interesting question, as you know, there's a lot of puts and takes. If you take a look at our Q1, the headline, you would say.\nIt was a flat year. But if you look at it underneath with the impact of fuel and what we had, we had a pretty good first quarter, especially for a first quarter for Union Pacific that is one of our highest expense side with a lot of things that come in. Fundamentally we're good. We like the business mix that we have. We like the way the quarter has started off. I am absolutely not sure what's going to happen. And if anybody tells you at any point that they know what's going to happen over the next few weeks, let alone for the rest of the year completely. And I think we'd be remiss to start changing our guidance.\nYou know, the easy thing would have been to come in this morning and just say, listen, there's so much noise, we're pulling our guidance, but we have a job to do, and our job is to react to whatever's thrown at us at Union Pacific. We've been doing that for a long time. And you know, I do have, nobody sees it, but I do have a few gray hairs. So I've been around for a while, and I've seen the ups and downs. I think I never bet against the United States economy or the, or the United States in general. So at the end of the day, I think we end up in a good place whether that's in a few weeks or whether that's in six months.\nBut fundamentally, if we can operate the way we are, Kenny and the team are building long term partnerships with customers, and we have the franchise that we have that handles so many products that Americans use every day. I'm very comfortable, Tom. We are not going to come off of our how we do it. How do we deliver that high, single digit, low, double digit? Absolutely. It's how we price, volume, how efficient we are. Everything that's in the mix that we can control. I think we've shown over the last few quarters how, whether we're doing a good job or not. I rate the team because I'm a hard marker. I'm like Walter a little bit. We're average, and I think there's more left for us to do. But I'm very comfortable of where we are right.\nNow.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nI guess. Any thoughts on like threshold revenue growth or volume to get there or?\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nNo, Tom, first few weeks in April we're saying, listen, we see a little bit of impact with everything that's going on, but at the end of the day it's been pretty strong for us. You know, our industrial, our bulk, even the intermodal is pretty strong, but. I like to see the bulk and industrial where it is because as you know, it's a different margin business. But I really can't tell you. Tom, maybe you have a better idea. Fill me in if you can because I can't tell what's going to happen here in the next couple of weeks, but I think at the end of it we'll see a reasonable position for the United States of America when it comes and will not impact.\nThe worst thing that can happen is it starts to impact what consumers are doing and their thought process and how they spend money. We haven't seen that at this point, but that would be a worry. But at this point we haven't seen it.\nThanks.\nTom.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThanks for the.\n\nOperator\n\nTime.\nOur next question is from the line of Fadi Chamoun with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nQuestion.\n\nFadi Chamoun\n\nTransportation Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nYes, good.\nMorning. Morning.\nFadi. I have a quick question. Yeah, good morning, Jim. So a quick question on the pricing you mentioned the strongest in 10 years for a Q1. How much of that is reflecting maybe the lag impact from the inflation we saw in the last couple of years and how much is driven by the better service performance of the network in the last year? If you can give some color about kind of what's underlying the strong pricing and how sustainable that.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nEVP and CFO, Union Pacific\n\nYes, Fadi, thanks for that question. I'll start it off and then kick it over to Kenny. I do think it's important to recall back at our Investor Day where we laid out our vision that we were going to have accretive pricing going forward. And in that we talked about the fact that, you know, we had some catch up to do, that we had the opportunity to touch more of our long-term contracts and that that was part of what gave us the confidence that we were able to stand before you all in September and say that the pricing was going to be accretive. Certainly Eric's service product helps support that when the team is going in and having those conversations. But this is consistent with what we were seeing and what we were experiencing, expecting to see back in September.\nWe just believe there's more of that coming forward. That's where you're seeing that.\nConfidence.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nYeah. So you look at it. As Jennifer mentioned, last year we were price accretive. We're starting off price accretive today. It's really the mindset that we have as a commercial team. You know, Eric and his team is providing us with a strong service product. We also have quite a few investments that we're making into the network that gives us all the ability to really price to the service that we sold. We're pretty dogged on that. So that's what you're seeing, you're seeing the results of that play.\nOut.\n\nFadi Chamoun\n\nTransportation Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nThank.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nYou. Thanks.\nFabi.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBrandon Oglenski\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning. Morning. Thanks for taking the question, Kenny. I know everything's volatile right now, but obviously we have pretty sizable tariffs on Chinese goods here. I mean, I think our Treasury Secretary is calling it a de facto embargo on trade with China. And we can see that there are going to be some higher blank sailings into like Louisiana, Long Beach, which has been a pretty big source of volume for you guys. So I guess maybe a two-part question. A, have you heard from your international customers or any of your customers about plans for dealing with these very large tariffs? And then maybe just quickly for Eric, how would you deal with potentially a big air pocket in demand on certain parts of your network, even if you're seeing growth domestically. Thank.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, Brandon, thanks for the question. So, first of all, it starts with staying close to the customers. I've been talking to customers this week. It stays staying close with Eric. And it's all about the agility we've shown. Improved that in the quarter. We were able to handle that business. You're asking a specific question about China, and yeah, we do see, and Jim used the word normal patterns. We expect as we move throughout the quarter to see a little bit more softness, and then we have some tougher comps. The best thing we can do during that time is just have all the products that we have with the ramp, the matchback, and the service product and stay close to our customers because we've been seeing these supply chain patterns change at the drop of a.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah. And Brandon, related to how we continue to maintain volume variable plus, for us, we're very proud of being able to do that. When we think about what are we physically doing, what does it look like on the railroad? It's really your five critical resources, with emphasis mostly on three of them. You adjust the amount of locomotives you have, the amount of cars you have, and you adjust the amount of crews that you have. Now you do that inside of our transportation plan, which over the last year, we've got a big plus that we've added to that with a tool that we have that's called adaptive planning. That's taken our playbooks and made us even faster at how we're able to make those decisions.\nWhat used to take multiple days or weeks, now we can do in a matter of hours or even up to maybe at most a couple days. So we have the ability to adjust. You've seen us demonstrate that many times over our history, and that's exactly what we'll.\nDo.\nThank.\nYou.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nQuestion. Morning.\n\nScott Group\n\nSenior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nScott. Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. So if I take a step back and we have the best pricing in 10 years and volumes up 7% and headcounts down 3%.\nI would have thought it could have been like the perfect storm of record margin improvement, when you just think about those three things and margins are flat. Is this just mix and fuel, and so what does this look like going forward? Maybe the volume slows, but maybe now the mix turns positive. Hopefully the fuel headwind isn't the same magnitude. Should we start to see a lot more margin improvement just given this price as we get through maybe some.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nOf this mix headwind, you know, it's an interesting way to look at it: if we have, you're saying, if we have less revenue but the mix is better, we end up with better margins. I look at it a little bit different. Yeah, that's a win. But I'd rather have more revenue and drive to make sure that the margin's in the right place. We like all the business that we have, and the reason we are Union Pacific is because of the top 100 customers that we have that we move everything that people use every day in either the manufacturing or at the end. So, Scott? Yeah, you know, you could say that if Intermodal came down because of what's happening at the West Coast or the imports, that would help us margin-wise.\nBut for me, I'd rather remember, we don't give out specifics on purpose. You know, if somebody would tell me that I could be a 55 operating ratio railroad and our revenue went down by X, I would rather be a 57 operating ratio railroad with our revenue going up by X. So that's the way I look at it. Jennifer, anything else you want to.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nEVP and CFO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, I just, you know, on the mix part, I mean, you know, obviously mix price together and mix with core price together being down, you know, 250 basis points that gives you an indication of the impact of mix to the quarter. We also gave you what the impact was to the OR and EPS from fuel. So to your point, as we look ahead, you know, mix should moderate. I don't know when it will turn positive, but probably should turn positive. As we move into the back half of the year, we'll see how Q2 plays out. As Jim talked earlier, there's just a lot of wildcards on how that's going to play, but should improve nevertheless. You look at fuel; we see that as something that moderates through the year as well.\nWhen we get to the end of the year, fuel prices stay kind of where they're at. I think you look back and you say fuel was kind of a non-event for us overall for the year. So I think you're looking at it right. The only thing I would say is don't underestimate the mix impact to our margins in the first.\nQuarter. Thanks.\nScott.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nQuestion. Morning.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nKen. Hey, great. Good morning. So Jen, maybe just taking that to another step, and I know you don't give specific guidance, but you know if I think about maybe just historical averages. Right. So Q1 to Q2. Maybe you could talk about what kind of level improvement you've historically seen. I think it's been about 100 basis points. So I just want to understand, just to get to the EPS target that you're talking about, do we have to see outsized seasonal performance given I don't know whether it's the leap day and fuel impact you were talking about?\nMaybe I'll start with.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThat. Thanks, Ken. I love the question, you know, that you were, you asked me because you thought for sure Jennifer would say I don't give any guidance. But yes, we're historically, we're going to historically see that improvement at this point. You know, we see it already with three weeks in the book that we look like we'll have that historical change that happens normally Q1 to Q2 and maybe even a little bit better because of how well we're operating. But still too early in the quarter to say anything specific about what it looks like.\nJennifer?\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nEVP and CFO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, no, I mean the first quarter is where you typically have your worst margins for the year. Then it typically improves second and third quarter because you're, you've got kind of your beginning of the year costs out of the way. You see your volume improve and you're away from the winter weather, and so you've got that kind of mud behind you, if you will, in the first quarter that helps propel you in the second and third quarter as you see volume growth. Obviously as we're talking today, volume is going to be the wild card, but we're not going to use that as an excuse to not improve. In fact, we believe we will improve. So. And that's the task that the team has and we're absolutely committed to.\nIt.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nWonderful. Jim, you mentioned team lost bad. Was that the Oilers, Canadiens, or are you really an Ottawa?\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nFan? Well, listen, I'm an Edmonton Oilers fan. I was ugly. My dad's a Montreal Canadiens fan. He didn't like that. So there wasn't a lot of positive. I went to bed last night after midnight going what the heck is this? Okay, now I normally go to bed at midnight anyways, and I had to laugh. I know this is a serious call, not a call about the NHL or NBA, but I think Kenny goes to bed at 9:00 o'clock and Eric goes at 8:30. So when I told him I was staying up till midnight to watch the game like I normally do, I think that just threw them right off. Jennifer said, that's Vena. Okay. He only needs five hours sleep, so he's good. But yeah, rough day, Ken. Rough day, let me tell.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nYou. Sorry to divert. Thank you.\nGuys. Yeah.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your.\n\nBrian Ossenbeck\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nQuestion. Morning.\nBrian. Hey, good morning. Thanks. I'll get us back on track with something much more boring in this question.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, I don't know if you appreciate.\n\nBrian Ossenbeck\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nLet me ask it first. But so maybe for Kenny. I know there's a lot of volatility with policies, but it does seem like there will be something on the Section 301 related to China shipbuilding. And now they're talking about removing the Harbor Maintenance Tax benefit from the Canadian port. So I wanted to see what your initial thoughts are on that since we've been through two iterations of that with USTR and then, you know, the past trade war, we saw a big impact in general for the US export grain, particularly soybeans. So wanted to see if that's something that we should also be considering here.\nThanks.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nYes, thanks for that, Brian. So, first of all, we've talked with quite a few customers, and I'll tell you that they need a little bit more clarity and certainty. Candidly, we've seen the tariffs come on. We've seen them come off. We need a little bit more certainty. They need a little bit more certainty before they are going to commit to making any significant changes in ports or traffic flows. I'd be remiss to say our commercial team is pretty intense or having pretty intense conversations about coming to the US. Especially with our network that we have, especially with the service. So that's a focus for us. But bottom line, we got to make sure that these stick.\nThe second part of your question on the grain piece, you know, when you look back, the first time Trump was in, we did see some of the traffic flows change, and we're seeing that as a positive today. Eric and the team have really done a great job of moving grain to areas like the Gulf and areas like Mexico. So, yeah, the traffic flows may change, but we still are able to have an agile network. The last part of that is just what I'll call, you know, fundamental growth in terms of the fuel side. So the biofuels, the renewable fuels, we still see that as a positive. We've been very aggressive, hyper aggressive about landing new customers, landing new origins, landing new destinations. We still think that that's a good emerging market that's going to be in.\nPlace.\n\nBrian Ossenbeck\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you very much.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nBrian, thank you.\nKenny.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question is from the line of Jonathan Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please receive your.\nQuestion. Morning.\nJonathan.\n\nJonathan Chappell\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nGood morning, Jim. Eric, question for you. We covered it a little bit, but I don't think we know exactly what the outcome is going to be. But I think with the blank sailings and some of the other comments around exports leaving China and what's going to come to the West Coast. Kenny already mentioned international intermodal probably has some challenges in the back half of the year, but domestic seems to be set up pretty well. So how do you kind of manage resources for that volatility kind of within the intermodal segment? Do you keep a level of resiliency in case things are kind of short lived and kind of just focus on service and making sure you're prepared for the upturn or do you have to become a little bit more, I guess, drastic with some of the resource decisions that you make in the short?\nTerm?\n\nEric Gehringer\n\nEVP of Operations, Union Pacific\n\nThat's a great question, Jonathan, and a timely one. Let's make sure we're really clear about something. We always keep our buffer of resources. We always maintain the rail cars, the locomotives, and the crews that we need to operate to deliver the service product that we sold our customers. Now let's talk a little bit more lower in the weeds about how we do that on the road railroad and we can just start with really practical things, but they're really important things. So with the increase in international intermodal, we've obviously made changes to our transportation plan. Now you might think that that's just what we just add trains to the system. That's not what we do. We first look at how do we fill any latent capacity we have on existing trains.\nThen we look to say how do we combo certain trains to be able to generate more capacity. And, as the last resort, we add new symbols, that being new trains that we run. So when you're thinking about any type of reduction that may occur, you just work that in reverse. You first look at whether there any trains that we added to the entire system that the volume just doesn't support running anymore. Then from there you look and say can I still combo with other trains so that we can continue to be productive and be volume variable plus. That's, it's literally how we do it every single month when we look through our transportation plan and make adjustments to it. It's sounding like I'm oversimplifying.\nIt's a complex thing, and that's why we use so much technology to inform our decision making so that we can still deliver our service product but do it in the most efficient.\nManner.\nThank you very.\n\nJonathan Chappell\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nMuch. Great, very insightful. Thanks.\nEric.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please proceed with your.\nQuestion. Morning.\n\nJoe Hafling\n\nVP of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nStephanie. Hi, good morning everyone. This is Joe Hafling on for Stephanie. Eric, thanks for walking through there. That was very helpful, and I think helped answer a lot of those questions. I guess I maybe wanted to talk about something a little bit different under the surface. All the productivity initiatives you guys have been embarking on as we think about 2025, what major projects do you guys have kind of under your belt that you're working on that we should be looking forward to, and maybe just an obligatory how we should think about headcount throughout the year.\nThanks.\nSure. So taking on your productivity question first, as we think about projects, right? You kind of naturally want to trend towards talking about technology. Let's never forget though, the biggest driver of our productivity is the fundamentals and how we operate this railroad day in and day out. You saw that in the first quarter, right? 7% higher volume handled. And our operating expenses were actually down 2% excluding fuel. You saw that in the record train length, record workforce productivity, et cetera. So you always want to stay most focused on your fundamentals. Now from a project initiative place, now you really are getting into the technology. That's technology. As Jennifer mentioned on the fuel conservation side with Energy Management System, it's how we think about Mobile NX inside of our terminals as we work to automate portions of the terminals.\nIt's even the work that our engineering team is doing on how do you automate the distribution of materials. In total, we have dozens and dozens of these initiatives in different phases. So we're in a great position to continue to build on that. Now as far as the hiring side, as we've discussed before, every single month we go through our hiring plan and when we do that, we're looking to consider all of the different variables that we have to take into account. Right. So those are things like attrition, then to your question, the positive impact we get from productivity changes in markets, and the list goes on and on. We've already made adjustments this year to our hiring plan based on the changes in different markets. Markets. We'll continue to do that. Joe.\nWe're committed to make sure that as we look at our asset base, we continue to be volume variable.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific",
    "content2": "Plus, Eric, the only thing I could add is, and I think you did a great job of describing, you make it sound easy, but it's very complex. At the end of the day, the way we look at it and the nice part about where we are right now is with us implementing NetControl, a new dispatch system that allows us to dispatch at the highest level and react to things as they're moving on. Our new NetControl will allow us to actually react in a real fast manner. It's all about touch points for the railroad. The cars, if we can touch the rail cars less to get them from origin to destination. We're not a linear railroad. We're very complex.\nWhen you come out of the LA basin, we have intermodal containers, both domestic and international, going across this network of ours, plus going east into the eastern part with our partners east of the Mississippi. So the way we look at it is how can we use the technology that we've developed and the fundamental technology to be able to make decisions so we remove touch points. If we can remove touch points, then we end up with a more efficient railroad and quicker and react to whatever is thrown at us. The nice part is we're hiring. We still have to hire. Eric and the team did a great job.\nWhen he talked about the headcount that we have in operations versus with the business that was increased, we were actually down, and we want to continue to be able to be as neutral as we can. The first action we take always is we stop hiring or we slow down hiring if we need to. If we see there's something changing and we take full realization that when we make a decision to hire, this is not a one day they show up and they're on the railroad as a conductor or as an engineer or as a mechanic or whatever. You know, listen, at headquarters, if we miss somebody one day, it's not that big of a deal. Somebody else will work an extra hour and we'll fill that in. But when it comes out in the field, you need those locomotive engineers, conductors.\nSo we make sure that we're very careful. But because we were hiring, we adjust that and we'll adjust that down if we see things happen over the next few weeks on what we're going to do. But we're hiring now for three months down the road. Three, four months down the road. So we've already started to slow that down just because we've become more efficient, and then we'll take a look at it as we go ahead. Sorry for the long answer, but you know, I love operations, so I had to get in the middle of that. Sorry.\nEric.\n\nJoe Hafling\n\nVP of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nIt was all very thoughtful. Thank.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThank you, thanks for the.\nQuestion.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nQuestion. Morning.\n\n[Analyst] (Goldman Sachs)\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nJordan. Morning everyone. Thanks for taking the time today. This is Andre on for Jordan. My question is somewhat conceptual, trying to frame the downside risk to freight markets that might be left out there in the respect that most of transportation has already been in a freight recession for three years now. How much additional absolute downside risk is there left to volumes or yields? If in the worst case we fall into a consumer-led GDP recession, would a downturn be less pronounced in freight versus historical GDP slowdowns given the already extended slowdown in freight that occurred post Covid, or would that be fair to say for some of your nonconsumer-facing.\nBusinesses?\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nEVP and CFO, Union Pacific\n\nYes, so I'll take a stab at that one. I mean, I do think you're making some good points in terms of, particularly when you think about the truck-competitive part of our business, which we've all been talking about. The fact that it's been.\nIn a down mode, maybe it's recessionary mode the last couple of years, and we've just been bouncing along the bottom there. Over that time we've made tremendous strides to improve our service. We've filled out our stable of IMC partners, and so we do think we're extremely well positioned to be able to capture business that's out there. And you know, when I think about the UP franchise, one of the best things about our franchise is the diversity. And so we, you know, with that broad diversity, that broad scope, our reach across a number of markets, you know, we have historically felt that that insulates us a little bit from what happens in one market versus the other. And you've seen that. I mean, you've got things. Last year, our volumes were up 3% when our coal was down 20%.\nNow this year we have coal up and you've got other markets that are down. So we'll deal with whatever the markets'll give us whether it's a softer landing maybe for us just because of what's happened in the transportation space, the truck space the last few years or not. I think that still remains to be seen. I think the good news is we're agile, we're ready, and we'll respond. And with the work that Kenny and team have been doing in business development, the service product that Eric's team is providing them, I think we'll capture our share and more and will perform very.\nWell.\n\n[Analyst] (Goldman Sachs)\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks. Appreciate the thoughts.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Daniel Imbro with Stephens. Please proceed with your.\nQuestion. Good.\n\nDaniel Imbro\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Stephens\n\nMorning. Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question, Kenny. I want to follow up on the Intermodal maybe volume and kind of revenue per carload outlook. I think you mentioned there's some international headwinds coming, but the potential for more domestic strength from truckload conversions, I guess. How did those domestic conversions trend through Q1 as the truck market began to soften, and then, related to that, I guess, with the favorable mix of more domestic versus international, but maybe a softer truck pricing environment, how are you expecting to see intermodal revenue per carload through the back half of the year? Just as weigh those puts and.\nTakes.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nYeah. So I'll just start off by just updating you on where we are through bid season and call it a little bit more than 1/3. Going through the bid season, we're encouraged on where we are from a bid perspective. We are encouraged by the wins that are out there. Again, you hear me talk about the channels, the stable of private asset customers along with our own private box, we've seen wins in those sections. The over the road section part of our business is the one that we're most focused on. A strong service product will help you with that. We talked about, you know, 6,000 loads with Uber that we won. That's all over the road. So that's how we're approaching that from a price perspective. You know, we have mechanisms in place to go out there and price with all of our customers.\nAgain, with our rail asset, we're also able to compete in that marketplace. We've been in a lull, as Jennifer mentioned on our previous question, for a while. That has allowed us to go out there and win and compete business during a challenging environment. As the market or if the market does improve, we expect to move in a more positive direction. On the revenue per car.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nEVP and CFO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah. And the only thing I'll add there is if you think about which we talk about mix within mix. So within intermodal, there are different mixes. We talked back in September that international intermodal is our lowest average revenue per car. And so if you see less international intermodal, more domestic, that can be positive within that mix on mix space. So another thing to take into.\nConsideration.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nGreat, thank you for the.\nQuestion.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Ari Rosa with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nQuestion. Good morning. Yeah, hey, good.\n\nAri Rosa\n\nSenior Analyst, Citigroup\n\nMorning. So I just wanted to ask a clarifying question. When you talk about EPS growth consistent with attaining the 3-year CAGR on EPS. Just help me understand that is not specifically a target for 2025 to be up high single digits, high single digits to low double digits. Just wanted to clarify that point. And then we've seen some strength in coal in Q2 to date. Just wanted to help understand what's underlying that strength and the extent to which you think it's.\nSustainable.\nThanks.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nI wish I could come here and tell you that what we see is a high single digit, low double digit for sure this year. There's just too many variables that we can't control going on right now. But we're very comfortable with the way the railroad is operating and that if we continue, we're standing by our guidance. That's the way I look at.\nIt.\nNatural gas is really the driver there when you look at our coal business. But the other part of that is being able to capture that business. And Eric and the team have done a great job of being agile, getting the resources in place. We actually saw double digit strength inside the quarter. So sequentially from February to March we were able to capture that business year over year. You're talking sets that were added over 25%. So great job there. I'm excited because you look at, you know, the natural gas part of it, but you also look at the business win that we have and we've added those sets in and we're seeing those up and running. Natural gas is volatile. We've seen it move around in the month. But the ability to be agile is what we look.\nAt.\nGreat. Thanks for the.\nQuestion.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please receive your.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nManaging Director and Senior, Bernstein\n\nQuestion. David, hey, good morning. Thanks for fitting me in here. I wanted to ask maybe Kenny or Jennifer, you know, when we're talking about the best pricing we've had in about 10 years, can you help us sort of understand kind of how much it has improved kind of either sequentially or relative to where we were sort of last year? What specifically has changed to drive it? Are we starting to see the benefits of a better service product like? Or is this just, you know, you guys are being more effective on capturing price in coal, for example. And then what are you thinking about, you know, the ability to sustain that best level of pricing in 10 years as we go through the rest of this year? Thank.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nI'll start and if you want to jump in, Jennifer, so. I'm going to be a broken record here, but look, when you have a strong service product for what you sold to the customers, you can lead with that. When you have a strong service product plus the investments that you have, you can lead with that. We sit down with our customers, share the Service Performance Index with them, and we know what acceptable levels of pricing are. And so we lead with that. Now, I'll tell you, I think there was a question about. I think it was about mindset or will it sustain? We will always have a mindset to go out there and price to the service that's sold, that won't change. The team is crystal clear on that.\nSo there you have.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nEVP and CFO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, Kenny, I really don't know that I can add to that. But when you walk through the drivers of our price, you hit on all of them. The only part of the market right now that's not supportive to our pricing is that truck piece which we've been talking about. So, you know, if we can get a little bit of help from that, that could be further good news for.\nUs.\nGo.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nSorry about that. If you just give me a second here, and appreciate it. At the end of the day, what we've also done is we've invested in being able to give more markets for our customers. Whether it's what we did at the east end of the LA Basin at Colton with the new facility there, what we've done in Phoenix, what we're doing in Kansas City, but not just in Minneapolis, I could keep on going on that side of the business. We've invested with our customers in the industrial base, and in the bulk base. We've opened up new facilities. So pricing comes by being able to provide baseline service, service at a high level, and consistent, not just customers. No one likes it if it's one week or a month. It has to be consistent.\nAnd I think we've been able to show that for the last few quarters that we're very consistent and we have a good handle of how to operate this railroad. We went through. We didn't even talk about winter. Some people like to talk about winter. We had winter, we had storms, we had floods. But at the end of the day, the resiliency and the way we operate the railroad and the buffer is real important to us. And the last thing is on the carload business, which is real important to us, especially when it comes to pricing and margin in the markets that they serve, is we've expanded our fluidity.\nWe spent a lot of money in that Houston area to be able to improve our hump yard, and we just about doubled the capacity of the place that removes touch points and that allows you to give better service and allows you to, to open more markets for our customers. So it's a complicated decision making in what we've done. So just to add on to what was already said by Kenny and Jennifer, that's the way we look at.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nManaging Director and Senior, Bernstein\n\nAll right, thanks for that. Then maybe if I could just tack one more on here. Have you guys seen any sort of change in cross-border Mexico volumes? Either Laredo or Eagle Pass, as we've been dealing with some of these, the tariff imposition. I'm just wondering if there's been any, any noticeable sort of shift in that north-south.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nVolume. Wes, why don't you talk about what we've seen the last sort of year or so and what we've seen, sort of a balance against our competitor, and then what we've seen more.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nRecently. Yeah. So if you look at it, you know, and it does start with the fundamentals, it does start with the fact that, you know, we've got seven day a week service, that we've got the best route, we've got short amount, we've got a fast, you know, faster route. But if you look at Mexico, when we talk to our customers, and we've been there over 30 years, when we talk to our customers. Yes, because I just mentioned all those attributes, we know we can win and compete, but we're also selling the entire network. So it's not just one part of Texas or one lane that we're going in. We're moving and utilizing the entire network. You look at the last quarter. Yeah, there were stops and starts, especially when you look at our automotive segment. You heard me saying my words.\nWe really sat closely with our customers and focused on the fundamentals, which for us in Mexico is the service product, the interchange, making sure we have enough equipment. Where we see ourselves today, we certainly don't try to manage our business to a market share, but we feel good about where we are and we know we're up a few points as we look at our market share so far this.\nYear.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThanks for the second question. Appreciate.\nIt.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Richa Herman with Deutsche Bank. Please receive your.\nQuestion. Good.\n\nRichard Herman\n\nGlobal Head of Fixed Income and Currencies, Deutsche Bank\n\nMorning. Good morning. So, you know, your execution this quarter was strong, all things considered. But clearly, just from the tone of some of these questions, there is a lot of fear out there, and you know, a lot of that related to your exposure. So maybe you can help quell those by sizing up your exposures a little bit. I was hoping, like, for instance, with grain exports. Appreciate, Kenny, you saying that it was very strong given Mexico and speaking to the agility of your network. But can you tell us how much of that business is Mexico exports versus China? And just on international intermodal, you said that that's about 40% of total premium for 2024. Can you tell us how much is West Coast or China oriented? Thank.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah. So we talked about the grain. I certainly, unfortunately, won't be able to give you any specifics and break out our grain network. What I'll tell you though is that I mentioned the strength in grain we've been growing there. I mentioned the rail and physical infrastructure that we have on the origin side to grow that market. We're focused on expanding in the Pacific, even if it means. And that's why I wanted to emphasize that, you know, we are moving into different markets like the Gulf and in Mexico. There was a question on international intermodal, I think where you wanted me to break out those numbers and I'll stay away from doing that and just let you know that a strong service product along with the new products that we have, we inserted a new product.\nJim talked about it in the 20 cities, and last year we were able to get a good win. That will still continue into this year. We're seeing a little bit more growth into the new market. New ramp that we have in Arizona, in the Phoenix area. We've introduced new products going from the Gulf to other parts of our network. We're going to be pretty aggressive about building out that network and not being dependent on one.\nArea.\n\nRichard Herman\n\nGlobal Head of Fixed Income and Currencies, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay, I appreciate it. Thank.\nYou.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your.\n\nJeff Kauffman\n\nPartner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nThank you. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in, Jim. I liked your opening comment about how if you just look from 10,000ft, revenues were flat, margins were flat, outlook's the same, you know, no changes. The reality was anything but. I'm just kind of curious if we look at your forward outlook today for, you know, whether it's volumes or pricing, as you were talking about core pricing, things like that. What's different today than it was say three months ago when you gave us guidance? That's kind of been a legitimate.\nSurprise.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nWell, the biggest surprise is the whole discussion of imports, exports, tariffs, and the effect on the business. Like I said, to start off with our biggest worry in what we look at and it's not a worry, it's just I don't worry. Okay, so that was a mistake by me. I don't worry. You have to react and be able to run the business and operate it in a smart manner is what the consumer is going to do. So far we haven't seen a huge impact and if anything, we really haven't seen it. Our carloads are up across the board in most places still from where we were last year. But that's the thing that we have to keep an eye on and it's a daily exercise.\nEvery day we look at what's happening to the US consumer in the market because that's who the final customer is for.\nUs.\n\nJeff Kauffman\n\nPartner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nIf I take out the intermodal uncertainty part of it or the international trade uncertainty and you just look more at the bulk or industrial groups, what was the legitimate surprise there, positive or?\nNegative?\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nWell, I think, I think, I don't like to think about it as a surprise. The things that we can not be a surprise, we have done, we've done a great job this quarter. I give Eric and the entire team a pat on the back. They've done a great job. Jennifer's done a great job to set us up to handle financially anything that we need. You can see where our rating is 2.8 debt to EBITDA. You can see where our cash is. We're in a great position there, and Kenny and team have done a great job of pricing for the value of what we provide. The things that we can't control are the things that we have to look at very carefully, and just at this point.\nI think at the end of the day we come to the right place as a country. But I think there's going to be some noise and we'll react to whatever noise is thrown at.\nUS. Okay, thank.\nYou. You're.\nWelcome.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Oliver Holmes with Redburn Atlantic. Please proceed with your question.\nQuestion. Good.\n\nOliver Holmes\n\nGlobal Industrial Transportation Analyst, Redburn Atlantic\n\nMorning. Hi. Morning. Thanks for having me on. Just a quick one. Is there a scenario, perhaps maybe you're already seeing it, where Asia ex China and Mexico pick up share if the trade war with China continues, in essence reducing the impact of Chinese tariffs? And maybe just a follow-up on that. Is this something you saw during 2018-19 when tariffs were levied on.\nChina?\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nEVP and CFO, Union Pacific\n\nThanks. Yeah, thanks for that question. I think Kenny, the question he's asking is, are you seeing more in terms of shifts away from China to Vietnam.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nKorea? Yeah. Okay, good. So there's some good public data out there, and you can see, Oliver, over the last few quarters, a little bit of a change. We look at the IANA data, and you can see a little bit of a change from China going into the Southeast Asia piece. It's held strong. Those volumes have held strong. We can see them coming up to us. We like the fact that there is diversity in that, and we're going to continue to take advantage of.\nMaturity is a moving target, though, and pressures of what's happening in the marketplace right now and what's happening to trade will have an effect. It just takes a while for some of those things to settle down.\nThanks for the.\nQuestion.\n\nOliver Holmes\n\nGlobal Industrial Transportation Analyst, Redburn Atlantic\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Please receive your.\n\nJason Seidl\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nQuestion. Thanks.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nOperator.\nMorning. And Jim, I feel your pain on being down to nothing here. Jennifer, I think the question, the question goes to you. You guys did a pretty good job of managing sort of salaries, wages, and benefits per employee in Q1. Wondering how we should think about that line item going forward. And then just to clarify, I believe you talked about that $46 million gain in last year's Q2. Was that in other.\nIncome?\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nEVP and CFO, Union Pacific\n\nOkay. So for the first part of your question, we laid out in January that we expected for the full year our comp per employee cost per employee to be up 4%. You're right. Did a great job in Q1, only up 2% at this point. We would stick with the 4% just because as we're looking ahead, we know that 1 July is another wage increase. We're obviously still negotiating with our unions, but as you know, we accrue regardless of if we started paying those wage increases or not. And then we also have, we think this will be towards the back part of the year. But we also are working towards an agreement with our SMART-TD, our conductors union in terms of work rest for them.\nSo that's why we're holding with that 4% in terms of the cost per employee in terms of the outlook on a full year basis. In terms of your other question that was in the other expense line in terms of the $46 million where that flowed through as a good guy last.\nYear. Perfect. Thank you very much. Appreciate the.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nTime. Okay. Thank.\nYou.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question is from the line of Jairam Nathan with Daiwa. Please proceed with your.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nQuestion. Good.\nMorning.\n\nJairam Nathan\n\nExecutive Director, Daiwa\n\nHi. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just we talked a lot about what you can do on the cost side and stuff. But I just wanted to understand on the balance sheet, in terms of share repurchases, if things get long drawn or you see bigger and bigger impact, how should we think of your capital return plan between share repurchase conserving?\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nEVP and CFO, Union Pacific\n\nCash? Yes. So thanks for that question. So off to a really strong start here in 2025. Our guide for the year in terms of share repurchases was $4 to 4.5 billion. At this point, I think we're at a little over $1.7 billion in terms of what we've returned so far. $1.5 billion through the accelerated share repurchase program and another $200 million in open market purchases. So in one quarter, almost halfway there, I'd say. We feel very good about that range. Obviously, we'll watch it. If the situation changes, we can scale back. That is the flexible lever. We've got $1.4 billion on the balance sheet today. So again, we were reiterating the guide to the $4 to 4.5 billion, and that's our view for the full year and feel confident in that. But if the world changes dramatically for us, we can flex.\nThat.\nThank.\n\nJairam Nathan\n\nExecutive Director, Daiwa\n\nYou. That's all.\n\nOperator\n\nRight.\nThank you. This concludes the question and answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Vena for closing with.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nComments. Well, listen.\nI think the questions were spot on. They were questions that we ask ourselves every day. I think we've shown as Union Pacific what we can do and how we can react. I think that's real important. At the end of the day, truly, it would be a boring job. I probably wouldn't be here if you woke up every morning and everything was perfect. You see the quality of a company and you see the quality of the management when you see how they react to things. I think the team did a great job Q1. Very excited with what we have going on fundamentally and in the long term. I like where Union Pacific is. With that, let's sign off. I know we have our annual general meeting happening in May and we'll be talking to our owners then.\nThank you very much, everyone taking the time to join us this morning. Have a good.\nOne.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day."

Welcome to Union Pacific's Q4 2024 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants will be in listen-only mode. A brief question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. If anyone today should require operator assistance during the conference, please press zero from your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. At this time, it is my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jim Vena, Chief Executive Officer for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Vena. You may now begin.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThank you very much, Rob. Good morning everyone. Pleased to have you with us this morning. A little bit of winter in some parts of our company, even lots of snow in the southeast part. But love the way the operating team has worked through it and we are in way better shape already. Great recovery by everybody, but lots of hard work by the men and women of Union Pacific. Why don't we get started? I'm joined here this morning in Omaha by Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Hamann, our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales, Kenny Rocker, and our Executive Vice President of Operations Eric Gehringer. Let's dig into 2024. It was a very successful year for the Union Pacific team and we really finished the year on a high note. In Q4 to put up an adjusted 58% operating ratio.\nRemoving the impact of a new regional brakeperson agreement is really excellent work. It shows that the team is executing our strategy to lead the industry in safety, service, and operational excellence. Now why don't we move over to discuss the fourth quarter results starting on slide three this morning. Union Pacific reported 2024 fourth quarter net income of $1.8 billion and earnings per share of $2.91, both 7% improvements. Fourth quarter revenue excluding the impact of fuel surcharge grew 4%. Our ability to generate strong volume growth and core pricing gains more than offset an unfavorable business mix. Reported expenses year over year improved 4% while lower fuel prices led the way. The team demonstrated strong productivity utilizing 3% fewer employees to move 5% more volume. This led to operating income growth of 5% and the operating ratio outcome that I mentioned earlier.\nThis is the result of the team's commitment to build a safer, more durable, and more efficient network. Just a fantastic way to end 2024. Throughout the year we built momentum behind our strategy and you see that in the financial results we delivered. While internally we've already turned the page to work on further improvements in 2025, we need to pause and celebrate the team's success in 2024. We set a goal to achieve industry-leading results and when the dust settles, I'm confident that's where we'll be. So with that, I'll let the team walk you through the quarter and the year in more detail and then come back for a wrap up before we go to Q&A. We'll start with the fourth quarter and full year financials. Jennifer, it's all yours.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nAll right, thank you Jim, and good morning everyone. Let's begin with our fourth quarter income statement on slide five. Operating revenue of $6.1 billion decreased 1% versus 2023 against strong volume growth, while our fourth quarter freight revenue finished flat at $5.8 billion. Breaking down the drivers of freight revenue. Increased volume in the quarter added 525 bps. Fuel surcharge revenue of $588 million declined $207 million as lower year over year fuel prices reduced freight revenue 450 bps. Similar to our third quarter results, strong core pricing gains were more than offset by business mix, reducing freight revenue 100 bps. With our 16% intermodal growth driving that mix dynamic of significance, our price dollars met the long term commitment of exceeding inflation dollars while also being accretive to fourth quarter operating ratio.\nWrapping up the top line, other revenue decreased 7% as a result of lower accessorial revenue from the second quarter intermodal equipment sale and reduced revenue from the ongoing transfer of Metra operations. As a reminder, we see offsets against this revenue decline in operating expense. Switching to expenses, our appendix slides provide more detail, but let me share some highlights of our strong cost control as total operating expense declined 4% to $3.6 billion against a 5% increase in quarterly volume. Looking closer at the expense line, compensation and benefits expense increased 8% compared to fourth quarter 2023, driven by the $40 million brakeperson buyout agreement, which Jim mentioned, and wage inflation. This is the second brakeperson agreement that we have reached in the last couple of years, both of which have enabled more efficient car handling. Quarterly workforce levels decreased 3%.\nOur train service employee workforce was flat against the 5% volume growth as we effectively handled the additional volume. All other workforce areas decreased 4%. These efforts resulted in record workforce productivity demonstrating our strategic focus on delivering operational excellence for 2025. We expect our all-in cost per employee to be around 4% as we continue to find ways to be more productive with our workforce through process improvements, technology, and investment. Fuel expense decreased 23% on a 24% year-over-year falloff in fuel prices from $3.16 to $2.41 per gallon. Our fuel consumption rate improved 1% in the quarter as we more than offset the impact of moving a less fuel-efficient business mix, equipment, and other rents. Expense increased 8% due to inflation and volume-related growth in our intermodal business.\nFinally, other expense declined 22% as you'll recall, in the fourth quarter of 2023 we highlighted elevated casualty costs due to the catch up of case backlogs. In the fourth quarter of 2024 we benefited from lower casualty expenses as well as a reduction in bad debt expense. Operating income improved 5% to $2.5 billion and was a fourth quarter record below the line. Other income decreased $40 million on lower real estate gains while interest expense declined 6% or $19 million as a result of lower average debt levels. Altogether these results total a record fourth quarter net income of $1.8 billion and earnings per share of $2.91, both up 7% versus 2023. Our fourth quarter operating ratio of 58.7% improved 220 bps year over year, and as Jim noted when you adjust for the brakeperson agreement, our quarterly OR came in at 58%.\nA great outcome reflecting very strong quarterly performance by the UP team as we work to safely and efficiently serve our customers. Moving to slide six, let me quickly recap. Full year 2024 operating revenue of $24.3 billion grew 1% on a 3% volume increase. Core pricing gains partially offset by lower fuel surcharge revenue and business mix. Excluding fuel surcharge, our freight revenue grew 4% versus 2023. Operating income totaled $9.7 billion, a 7% increase, and our full year operating ratio at 59.9% improved 240 bps, both great indicators of how good railroading produces solid operating leverage and cost control. Earnings per share of $11.09 increased 6% versus 2023 while our return on invested capital improved 30 bps to 15.8%. Let's turn then to shareholder returns in the balance sheet on slide 7.\nFull-year 2024 cash from operations totaled $9.3 billion, up almost $1 billion from 2023. Our cash flow conversion rate improved to 87%, and free cash flow increased from $1.5 billion to $2.8 billion. These year-over-year improvements reflect the change in year-over-year labor agreement payments as well as the growth in our operating income. We rewarded our shareholders, returning $4.7 billion in 2024 through dividends and share repurchases. Our adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio finished the year at 2.7 times as we maintain a strong balance sheet and continue to be rated by our three credit agencies. 2024 proves that our strategy of safety, service, and operational excellence leading to growth also generate strong cash returns for our shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Kenny.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nThank you, Jennifer, and good morning. As Jennifer mentioned, we had a strong fourth quarter. Freight revenues totaled $5.8 billion for the quarter, which was up 4% excluding fuel surcharges due to increased volume. This also reflected strong core pricing gains as a result of our deliberate focus on maximizing price. Let's jump right in and talk about the key drivers for each of our business groups. Starting with our bulk segment. Revenue for the quarter was down 4% compared to last year on a 4% decrease in volume, while average revenue per car remained flat even with decreased fuel surcharges. Coal continued to experience the same challenges seen throughout the year as demand remained soft due to high inventory levels and the competition from low natural gas prices.\nGrain volumes increased for the quarter as there was strength in export grain to Mexico coupled with strong UP service during the harvest. Lastly, grain products grew in the fourth quarter as our work to locate renewable diesel plants on our railroad is paying dividends in the form of increased demand for feedstocks, and we expect that growth to continue with the startup of two new facilities, one in Nebraska and one in Kansas, that came online in the fourth quarter, bringing the current count of UP accessible plants to 15, with more expected this year. Turning to industrial, revenue was up 1% for the quarter as volume remained flat. Strong core pricing gains were mostly offset by lower fuel surcharges and a negative mix in volume. Business development in our petrochemical and petroleum commodity segments drove growth.\nDemand improved for plastics for our plastics business in both export and domestic markets. However, these gains were offset by softer demand for metals, sand, and rock. Premium revenue for the quarter was up 3% on a 13% increase in volume and a 9% decrease in average revenue per car, reflecting increased intermodal shipments and lower fuel surcharges. Intermodal volumes remain strong due to international West Coast import demand and positive domestic growth driven by business development efforts. International volumes were up 26% in the quarter, outpacing the growth rate of the West Coast imports. By utilizing our buffer resources, which includes people, locomotives, and railcars, our operating team efficiently move the traffic and maintain fluidity in the supply chain. Automotive volumes were flat due to unplanned downtime, partially offset by business development wins with Volkswagen and General Motors.\nNow let's focus on 2025. Here are some of the key macroeconomic indicators that we're watching this year on slide 10. These are S&P Global's forecast from their January report, and you'll notice that it shows a mixed picture for 2025, which is not materially different than what we shared back in September at our Investor Day in Dallas. The forecast for industrial production shows a slight increase while GDP growth slows from 2024. Housing starts are expected to remain challenged, but with December sharp uptick, we are closely watching the situation now. Turning to Slide 11, here is Union Pacific's 2025 outlook as we see it today for the key markets we serve. Starting with bulk, we anticipate coal to continue to decline, though not to the levels we've seen in 2024. We expect coal demand will be met from existing high inventory levels.\nHowever, a new contract win with the Lower Colorado River Authority, also known as LCRA, will help offset losses from 2025 coal retirement. While it's premature to predict grain export demand, domestic grain demand is expected to remain steady through H1 2025, driven by strong grain yields from a good harvest in 2024 as well as our efforts to serve both new and expanding facilities.\nLastly, we expect continued strength in grain products driven by intense business development and the expanding markets for renewable fuels and the associated feedstocks. We will continue to monitor potential changes in renewable diesel incentives and tax credits. Moving on to industrial. While the forecast for industrial production in 2025 remains muted. Our diverse business mix, strong service, and robust franchise will help us grow in some markets. The metals market is expected to remain soft. However, our industrial chemicals and plastics markets will remain favorable based on planned expansions with multiple strategic customers and our strong focus on business development. This strong focus is all about unleashing what's possible. By empowering the commercial team, they are leveraging our Gulf Coast franchise and strong service to win. And wrapping up with premium on the intermodal side. We expect growth in domestic intermodal with over the road conversions.\nStrong international intermodal volume expansion experienced in 2024 creates tough year-over-year comparisons for us, and the mix issue continues as international volumes remain strong at the start of the year. Additionally, we're keeping a watchful eye on potential tariff changes that could further impact volumes. Even though we are early in the year, we are seeing automotive OEMs curtail production to better manage high inventories. However, consistent with S&P Global's outlook and our conversations with customers, we expect a positive trend with output increasing as the year progresses. Overall, we anticipate a soft economic environment and face difficult comps in 2025. But I'm excited about onboarding LCRA, the new coal customer mentioned earlier, and I'm encouraged by the incremental volume we will gain from new and expanding facilities across multiple business segments.\nIn fact, we currently have over 200 track construction projects in progress with a potential revenue of $1.5 billion, and our business development pipeline is just as strong as it was this time last year. We continue to invest in intermodal, which Eric will touch on. You heard me discuss new unit train facilities added to our network, and we are bullish on industrial development projects in the Gulf Coast with a mix of large and small customers. I'm proud of the commercial team. They continue to hustle and we will maintain our strong pricing posture in 2025. And with that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance.\n\nEric Gehringer\n\nEVP Operations, Union Pacific\n\nThank you Kenny and good morning. Moving to slide 13 before diving into our results, I want to express my appreciation to the team for their hard work. Historically, vast surges in volumes such as those we witnessed in 2024 significantly disrupt rail operations. However, the team bucked that trend and was able to improve our service product while also driving growth and network efficiency. It's proof our relentless focus on operational excellence is working and I'm excited we are carrying that momentum into 2025. Safety also improved in 2024 and continues to be at the forefront of everything we do. For the year, both our derailment and personal injury rates improved significantly, a strong step towards becoming the safest railroad. We remain committed as well to enhancing safety as we strive to send every employee home safe each day.\nMoving to our results this quarter, Freight Car Velocity improved 1% versus last year. A favorable business mix coupled with continued improvements in Terminal Dwell drove the performance. Notably, 2024 marked an all-time record for Terminal Dwell, a meaningful improvement in our service which reduces customers' fleet cost through improved cycle times. Exceptional work by the team as they continue our focus on the fundamentals to drive terminal fluidity and capacity for future growth. On the service front, our Intermodal Service Performance Index declined seven points year over year while Manifest improved five points. Intermodal SPI specifically improved month by month through the quarter as December ended with our second highest level of the year at 97%. The team continued to deploy buffer resources and adjust trip plans to minimize the impact of the quarter's 26% surge in International Intermodal shipments.\nNow let's review our key efficiency metrics on slide 14. Our full year locomotive productivity metric improved 5% versus 2023, while the deployment of buffer resources to handle higher volume levels drove a 3% decline in our fourth quarter result. Workforce productivity, which includes all employees, improved 6% in both the fourth quarter and full year versus 2023. Further, 2024 marked a fourth quarter and full year record for workforce productivity. We continue to remove unneeded work and automate operations while improving the safety of how we work. Train length improved 1% versus 2023, marking our sixth consecutive quarter year-over-year improvement. All in 2024 set an all-time record for train length. We have made great strides in this area. However, there are still opportunities to adjust the transportation plan and leverage targeted investments as we push to generate mainline capacity in the pursuit of growth.\nTo wrap up, let's review our capital outlook for 2025 on slide 15. In 2024 we invested approximately $3.4 billion across the railroad as we continue to reduce capital intensity while still delivering value to our shareholders. In 2025, we are targeting capital spending of roughly $3.4 billion flat versus last year. As always, our first capital dollars will support safe and productive operations as we invest in our infrastructure and renew older assets. This includes modernizing our locomotive fleet and acquiring freight cars to support replacement and growth opportunities. Also, we will continue to invest in capacity projects that support our growth initiatives while enhancing productivity. This includes siting, construction, and extension projects such as those in the Pacific Northwest and the Southwest along our Sunset Route.\nFurthermore, terminal investments supporting our manifest network, such as those in and around our Houston Gulf Coast region, aim to improve fluidity and increase capacity. On the intermodal side, we will continue to invest for growth in areas like Kansas City, Inland Empire, and Lathrop, to name a few. At the end of the day, it's about ensuring we have the right resources in the right place to support growth and drive efficiencies. Wrapping up, I'm encouraged by the progress we made in 2024, but our work is not yet done. Continuing to focus on the fundamentals of railroading and leveraging new innovative technologies, we will further improve our service product and build a more resilient, efficient network in 2025 and beyond. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Jennifer to lay out our initial financial thoughts for 2025.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nThanks, Eric. If you turn to slide 17, I do want to start by pointing out that in the appendix we have a modeling slide that contains several 2025 assumptions that should be helpful in framing our current expectations. As we talk about the year, all of our guidance is within the context of the three year targets we provided at our Investor Day in September. Our team understands those commitments, we are focused on achieving them, and our 2025 performance is the first step. As you heard from Kenny, economic indicators for this year are a bit muted and mixed. Some growth, some contraction. Add to that outlook questions around possible tariffs, interest rates, regulatory changes, et cetera, and our ability to forecast all only gets more challenging as we see the year ahead. There are positives on the volume front.\nFirst, we're starting the year with a bang. Volume is growing, and the network is running well. Mother Nature has certainly taken a couple early shots and will likely fire a couple more. But our resiliency is strong as we focus on meeting our customer commitments. And you heard Kenny talk about how that service product has helped us secure new business for 2025 as well as the continuing pipeline of opportunities that span our entire portfolio. We also acknowledge there are some tough spots, namely from reduced coal demand and the year-over-year international intermodal comparison we'll face in the second half of 2025 as today's mix impact turns into a volume challenge. So while there are puts and takes on the volume side, we are confident that we will continue to drive our operational and financial improvement in 2025.\nWe will achieve that goal by continuing to control the controllables by generating pricing dollars that are accretive to our operating ratio, gaining further technology productivity through technology, and by empowering every UP employee to drive asset efficiency. We expect the combination of our activities to drive volume, price, and productivity will deliver earnings per share growth for the full year. That is consistent with attaining our three-year Investor Day CAGR of high single- to low double-digit growth. Finally, with the capital allocation, as you heard from Eric, this year we plan to invest $3.4 billion back into the railroad. We remain committed to our industry-leading dividend payout ratio of around 45% of earnings, and we plan to return excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases of $4 to 4.5 billion during the year.\nThe team has done an excellent job to position ourselves for whatever environment we face. This year we are on target to achieve our long-term goals while maintaining our industry-leading position. We are excited for this new year and we're ready to deliver. With that, I'll turn it back to Jim.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThanks Jennifer. Before we get to your questions, and I'm looking forward to the questions, I'd like to summarize what you've heard. First, you heard from Jennifer. In Q4 we leveraged the network to handle volume growth and drive strong quarterly results. Similar to Q3, our business mix profile presented a margin headwind, so it was imperative that we generated strong productivity and pricing to offset that impact. That's exactly what we did. Kenny gave an overview of Q4 volumes and laid out initial thoughts for 2025. Look, there are a lot of unknowns, but in my 48 years of railroading, I've never entered a year without some economic question mark. It is what it is. As you heard from Kenny, our team will focus on outperforming our markets and generating strong pricing for the value we provide.\nImportantly, I believe our 2024 performance demonstrates that our strategy to operate with a buffer and connect more closely to our customers is paying dividends both in terms of meeting our customer commitments and, as a direct result, winning new business. Eric provided an update on our progress to improve safety, service, and operational excellence. From a safety perspective, we made great strides, but we still have work to do on the service front. We're showing our customers what's possible while at the same time driving productivity. What's exciting for me is that I know we're not done. There are more opportunities ahead, and we have clear line of sight of how we drive further improvements in 2025. Lastly, you heard from Jennifer our expense expectations for the upcoming year.\nKey for me is that we're on target to achieve the long-term guidance that we laid out at the Investor Day in September. We operate the largest, most complex rail network in North America, and with it comes challenges and opportunities. The team understands our goal is to deliver what's possible from this franchise. We intend to do that as an industry leader that keeps raising the bar as we drive value for our shareholders. Let me finish with one of my favorite quotes from a mentor. It's the fundamentals, stupid. Do what you say and commit to it and deliver. And that's who we are at Union Pacific. And with that, I'll turn it back over to you, Rob, and let's start the questions.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nThank you. We'll now be conducting a question and answer session. If you'd like to ask a question at this time, please press star one on your telephone keypad, and a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you'd like to withdraw your question from the queue. For participants that are using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. Due to the number of analysts joining us on the call today, we'll be limiting everyone to one question to accommodate as many participants as possible. Thank you. Our first question today is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nGood morning, Scott.\n\nScott Group\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning. I just want to start on the guidance, the comment consistent with attaining the long-term CAGR. That seems carefully chosen language just so we're all on the same page. Like, does that just mean you expect to be in that high single digit to low double digit range on earnings this year? And then I just want to understand also, Jennifer, the pricing starting to become accretive to margin, does that start right away in Q1? I don't know if there's any sort of Q1 color you want to give us. Thank you.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nSo let me start, Scott, with the question of where we are. We were clear that we had a three-year and when we commit, just like I said from my favorite quote from a mentor early, we committed and you never know exactly what's going to happen this year. You know, what are tariffs going to do, what are the regulatory changes that the administration is going to put in. But our goal is just as we showed in 2024, with the 7% increase that we think that that's where we're going to be. We are going to be high single digit, low double digit. Now if there's things outside of our control, then we're going to have to work harder, but this is not a change from what we said before. And I would expect that every year we deliver high single digit to low double digits.\nThat's the win for us. So that's what we committed to and that's what we look forward to delivering. Jennifer on the accretive piece.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, Scott. So just going back for a second. So Q4 we were accretive. So we actually, I would say outperformed ourselves a little bit there because we did not think we would achieve that here in 2024, but we did in Q4. And so, you know, I'm not going to parse out the quarters in 2025, but I don't see us taking a step back and we're going to be accretive throughout 2025.\n\nScott Group\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nThanks, Scott.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nOur next question is from the line of John Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJonathan Chappell\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you.\nGood morning, Eric. In Jennifer's comments at the start, she.\nNoted the record workforce productivity, also said.\nAll-in cost per employee up 4% in 2025. As you continue to find ways to be more productive, you've done a lot of volume with a lot less resources. Is this still a labor productivity or.\nWhat are some of the other initiatives?\nYou're looking at 25 to kind.\nto maintain or manage that cost inflation?\n\nEric Gehringer\n\nEVP Operations, Union Pacific\n\nYeah. Thank you for the question, John. Let me be clear, there is more opportunity and we're working to capitalize on that. Let's go back to our Investor Day and kind of level set from that perspective. First thing I said at Investor Day was that we focus on productivity because it puts Kenny and the team in the best position to grow in the markets. That's still and will always be true. The second thing that we focused on was our culture, our mindset here at Union Pacific, which is to be perpetually dissatisfied with ourselves when it comes to productivity, to keep pushing to find additional opportunities. Specifically to your question about what are those opportunities, it's going to be some of the same things you've heard in the past and a lot of new things that I'm excited about.\nThe fundamentals, they always stay true. Those are the things in the past that we continue to focus on. The improvements we made in the fourth quarter regarding our recrew rate, you know, even moving that just a single point has a significant productivity driver for us. The work that we did to reduce our pool starts in our yards and locals approximately 2% to 4% respectively in the fourth quarter. That's about the technology. We're putting in the yards and being able to be even more productive with it. On the technology front, the work that we do and have continued to do and will continue to do on the automation of our terminals and pushing to reduce dwell.\nThen when you get outside of the terminals and the transportation side, you mentioned a couple of them, and the engineering team as they work to continue to automate inspections, maintenance tasks, and distribution of maintenance materials, and then of course, you have the whole bucket of purchased services. And I see great opportunities in that, and we capitalized on those in 2024. But there's more. When you start to think about the technology, we have to automate some of our vans across the system. And you know, when you're using hundreds of thousands of van starts per year, you know, a 10% improvement in that is really meaningful for us. So here's the bottom line. There's more than 75 initiatives up against how we think about driving productivity across this company. And I really do mean across the company. It's not just operating.\nI'm very confident about our plan in 2025, and I'm encouraged that we'll be telling you about those results as we go through 2025.\n\nJonathan Chappell\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks, Eric.\n\nEric Gehringer\n\nEVP Operations, Union Pacific\n\nThank you very much.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nOur next question is from the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nMorning, Stephanie.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nStephanie, perhaps you're on mute. Your line is live for a question.\n\nJoe Hafling\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nSorry, I was on mute. This is Joe Hafling on for Stephanie Moore. Thanks for taking her questions and congrats on the good results. I wanted to talk about, you know, one of the things you mentioned over the last couple of months has been, you know, maybe a reduction in regulatory burden and maybe consistent with what you talked about on the second question here. What are some sort of specific areas, maybe that you've seen, you know, additional red tape or what areas do you think, you know, you guys could particularly benefit if there's reduced regulatory burden on you guys in particular? I know you guys had mentioned a lot of things on the Investor Day. So, you know, if there's any specific examples, that would be very helpful. Thank you.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nWell, I think the largest thing is that we've applied for a lot of waivers that would help with the technology that we've implemented to make the railroad more efficient, provide better service to our customers. Those are the things that are out there that we hope with the turning of the page and how regulations are being talked about at the federal level that we get those improvements will allow us to be able to provide better service and, of course, be more productive, so those are just to name a few. There's a lot of waivers that we've applied for that are being outstanding for years now that we're looking forward to it. I could go on here for about 45 minutes on things that regulation-wise I think would help the industry make us safer, provide better service, and be more productive.\nThat's a good way to look at it, is those waivers that we've applied for over the last number of years.\n\nJoe Hafling\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nYou're welcome.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nThanks. Questions from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with J.P. Morgan. Please receive your question.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nMorning, Brian. How are you this morning?\n\nBrian Ossenbeck\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGood morning, Jim. Morning, team. Thanks for taking the question. Doing well. Thanks. Hope you're as well. I wanted to come back to the, I guess there's a second brakeperson rule, so wanted to hear a little bit more about that because you mentioned there was one earlier. So thanks for pointing that out. And then also Jennifer, on the comp per employee for the full year, you're still rolling out, last we heard, sorting out some of the predictable work schedules for the engineers. So I understand there's still some negotiation going on with the conductors for something similar. So maybe you can just give us a little context in terms of the other brakeperson agreement, how it's different than the first one and how you see those other two factors or.\nAgreements, I guess for the engineers and conductors rolling out for the rest of this year and what you expect in the numbers there. Thank you.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nI'll let Eric talk about the brakeperson agreement and what that really does. But just as a reminder, we did one in Q2 2023 and now this one here in Q4. And we actually have one more region that we're working on there in terms of the rollout of Work/Rest. We continue to roll out on the engineer side, and we continue to work with our conductors, SMART TD, in terms of coming to an agreement. And that's all really part of the mix as we think about.\nThe statement that I made about the all in 4% comp per employee in 2025.\n\nEric Gehringer\n\nEVP Operations, Union Pacific\n\nYeah. And Brian, I'll just add to that. If you think about on the engineer side, there's 28 hubs across Union Pacific, and 20 of the 28 are already cut over. So we're nearly 75% cut over now, thinking about the brakeperson. The way to really think about it is you can kind of going to go back in time a little bit. So go back in the days when you had five people on every single train. And that's the context you got to think about this brakeperson deal. As the technology has improved over the last 40 years, including the technology that we're still implementing to this day, you just have less demand for some of those five people. And we've demonstrated that at most a crew today has three. That third person is the brakeperson.\nWe have that in some parts of our railroad. In Jennifer's prepared comments, she referred to it as a regional brakeperson agreement. That's because not every single area of the Union Pacific has it. This is very similar to the first agreement that we reached in almost every single regard. The goal is still the exact same. It's to utilize who was in those brakeperson positions as conductors and our normal crew base to be able to provide the service that we selected our customers.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThe only thing I'd like to add is the whole discussion about where we are on implementing with SMART TD and with the BLET. And Eric just said that 20 out of the 28 hubs we've implemented. What you always, Brian, when you do those things, is you make sure that you still end up with the same number of starts per week per employee. And that's real important. And I sat down very first few weeks I was here, came back to work, what, 16, 17 months ago with the union leaders. And they committed that it made sense that that goal had to be there. And what we wanted to do was provide that time off and that scheduling. But they also understand, because they want us to succeed also, is that we have a workforce that works what we expected them to work on a weekly basis.\nAnd what we found results so far is we have to work hard to find ways to make sure that the schedules are set up. And we've had a little degradation, but nowhere near as much as some people write about. I'm always surprised when people write about those things without the detail. But at the end of the day, I'm very comfortable that we have figured out a way to move ahead and do this right so that we don't add incremental cost to the company when we provide. And the unions have agreed that it is going to be cost neutral for us or start neutral. You know, wages still went up 4.5%. So the wages are the wages that we've agreed to.\nBut that's the way to look at it, is that we're very comfortable, and with SMART TD, we'll get to the right place that's good for our employees. We want our employees to have regular shifts. I'm one of the guys who's a CEO in this industry that's actually worked on the ground as a locomotive engineer and conductor. And to have schedules that help you plan your life so that you can balance the demands of working and also everything else, your family, and everything else is real important to me. So we'll come to the right place. But we're also being smart about how we get to it. You can't have a deal that's all one-sided. So I'm looking forward to working with SMART TD to finalize the deal and working with the BLET to implement the last eight terminals that we have.\nBut I think it's a real positive for both of us, and it will help us to become even more efficient in the long run because people with schedules will not take as much time off as they did before once they get used to what their work schedule is. So sorry for the long answer, but I just needed to sort of clarify because I know there's some noise out there about what the effect is for us. Okay.\n\nBrian Ossenbeck\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nUnderstood. Thank you, Jim.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThanks Brian.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nOur next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJason Seidl\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you, operator.\nJim Vena and team, and nice job on the first quarter.\nYou know, you briefly touched about some of the unknowns that are out there. There's obviously been a lot of talk about potential tariffs with two of our largest trading partners, Canada and Mexico. Clearly you guys have a big position in Mexico with your access to the Mexican interchanges as well as a partial ownership of Ferromex. I guess if we do get that tariff on 1 February, sort of what are the expectations on, on volume and then I guess what potentially could have an impact if cross border business with you guys would decline because of that.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nLet me start, and then I'm going to pass it over to Kenny who knows our markets and what the different business mix would be. You know, something happens south of the border, does it give us more business out of origination in the U.S.? I'll leave that to Kenny. But let me talk in general. The way I think about this is I have never, for all the years I've been railroading, and I just about hate to say that number because I think it's. I've been railroading longer than most people on this call have been alive. But at the end of the day, there's always something, and this is the way I see it. We have the capability at Union Pacific to react to anything that's thrown at us. Good, strong balance sheet, real good focused marketing team, operations team that's looking to be more efficient.\nAnd I look at the entire package if we get tariffs, but we also get the regulatory changes, and we get the tax changes that were talked about by the president with how depreciation is going to work on capital and how our corporate tax rate works, that could be a lot of positive. Now, I don't expect any of that. That's not what we plan. We plan for the worst. If something really bad happens, make sure that we are in a good position to handle that. So I think that with the puts and takes of where our business is, we'll deal with it, and we're waiting to see what actually happens.\nI'm hoping that it's a negotiating position by the President because I don't think anybody, the consumers in the U.S., would love to have increase in prices because of dispute, unless there's some strategic reason that the President needs to do that for security of the country. But overall, I'm very comfortable that we're going to be in a good position as we move forward and we'll just react on how we see things happening. Kenny?\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nJim, I tell you, you covered a lot. So all I'll say is, and we've seen this before, it's really about being prepared. And what generally happens is maybe the origin location shifts from Asia to Mexico or Canada, and that commodity is priced in, that tariff is priced in. But being prepared is a critical thing. Eric and his team have demonstrated that, especially in the second half of this year when we saw it happen on the West Coast. Same is true with exports. We saw that on the grain side where it may shift from PNW or go to the Gulf or go to Mexico. Regardless, it's all about preparedness. And I'm telling you as we're humming along here, from an operating and service perspective, I feel good about our posture going in regardless of what happens.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThank you very much. Good question.\n\nJason Seidl\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nAppreciate the time.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nOur next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nMorning, Chris.\n\nChris Wetherbee\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nMorning.\nThanks for taking the question. I guess I wanted to maybe pick up on the West Coast and get some perspective about how you think about sort of the shifts. I know International Intermodal has got some pretty challenging comps, particularly as you move into the second half of the year. But you know, Kenny, any sort of perspective you can give, what you're seeing from your customers, maybe how real time any of those shifts may occur. I know we kind of have a tentative agreement on the East Coast. So potentially there could be some business moving around a little bit. And then just maybe in terms of the pricing piece, I know we're getting back into sort of accretive pricing.\nHow do we sort of think about the opportunity in pricing as we move forward over the course of the next year or maybe longer in terms of the service recovery in the network, ultimately, the inflation that we've seen across the sort of the broader market outside of transportation, and maybe what your opportunity is to try to tap into that? Just want to get a sense of maybe how that plays out.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nYeah. Chris, on the international intermodal side, we are seeing some pull ahead taking place. And, you know, whether it's the hangover from some of the strikes on the east coast or whether it's just the idea of the tariff, you can see our numbers, and they're pretty. They're pretty strong here as we are walking into January. We'll see how that plays out for the rest of the quarter. Before I can really tell you what will happen, we've got the tough comps, and I've talked about that. Those are in the second half. But sitting here on 23rd January 2024, I think it's premature to go out and make a strong forecast about what will happen there. Now, on this whole thing around pricing, I just want to reiterate what Jennifer said. We were price accretive in 2024, and we expect to be price accretive in 2025.\nEric and the team have really done a great job of providing a strong service product. Our commercial team sells it, and we're providing the service that we sold to our customers. I want to hit that hard. We're sharing the investments that we're laying out to support the growth. Our commercial team is crystal clear on what's acceptable going in from a pricing standpoint based on the service that we sold. With that, we're going to take some risks, but it's all about aligning the service we've sold with maximizing price.\n\nChris Wetherbee\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nGot it. That's helpful. Thank you.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThanks, Chris.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nOur next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRavi Shanker\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, great.\nThanks for taking. Good morning. This is Christine McGarvey. I'm for Ravi. Thanks for taking our question. Just wanted to circle back to some of the service comments. It sounds like you guys have a pretty good confidence going into 2025, but wanted to touch on kind of what's underpinning that and maybe particularly in the context of perhaps a better environment than you guys are currently thinking about if the volumes do snap back a little bit more aggressively, how you guys feel the kind of capacity is there to meet that without much service disruption for customers.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nWell, I love the question that says what happens if we have more business? I think I like that question. That would be a great outcome for all of us if the U.S. consumer stays strong and grows the demand for us. We operate a railroad and we keep on talking about buffer, and I think we showed it with the large increase in international, and that's the way we look at it. We want to have our assets in place, operating them efficiently, but we carry a buffer, especially the assets that we can't inbound into the company if we need them in a quick manner. So locomotives, rail cars, we do that capacity on the railroad. We operate our railroad with the capacity because we need to recover from events like we just had in the Southeast part of our network. We need to have a buffer.\nSo we run with a 20% to 25% buffer on our capacity rail capacity because our business goes up and down. Customers don't release cars seven days a week; there's a big drop on the weekends. So we have that buffer. That's the way we look at it. Listen, the best thing that could happen is a 10% increase in volume across the board. I think we're set up to handle that, and we'd onboard the people to be able to handle that in a very quick manner. So that would be the best problem I would have in 2025. Thank you very much for the question.\n\nRavi Shanker\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks. Appreciate the caller.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nOur next question is from the line of Ari Rosa with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nAri, good morning.\n\nAri Rosa\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nHey, good morning, Jim. Congrats on a nice result here in Q4. I wanted to ask about the operating ratio you mentioned, this expectation of industry-leading operating ratio. Just wanted to understand a little bit more what gives you confidence in that target. If you could talk about kind of how you perceive the structural advantages that you see relative to some of your competitors, especially given the context of BN maybe having some challenges in Q4 that maybe held up some of their intermodal partners. If you could just give a little more color on that outlook, both kind of short-term and longer-term, how we should think about that, the OR evolution.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific",
    "content2": "Ari, I don't, I'm not going to comment about any other railroad. We have a position that it's a complicated network that we have. It truly is. It's not linear, it's complicated. But I think we've fundamentally figured out a way to operate it and be as efficient as possible. We want to be the leaders when it comes to operating ratio. And that's what we're delivering. And I'm not sure what the other railroads are going to, because we're first up. I'm assuming that we will have the best operating ratio. That's an outcome of everything we do. That's the important piece is what do we do with. Do we provide good service so we can maximize price so our customers can win and grow in the marketplace? That's real important for us, that triangle.\nIs it operationally? Do we look at our assets, how we operate, the number of people, and do we use technology? We're excited about NetControl and how we are going to be able to quickly change our operating plan faster than we've ever been able to do before to operate the railroad more efficiently. So with all those things, I personally, and I've said this publicly, and I'll say it again, all the railroads should be very close when it comes to operating ratio. There's no reason for the Class Is not to be. And I know some. I'll probably get some notes from some of the other CEOs, and I'd appreciate the call or the text. But at the end of the day, we want to be in the best position. And you can see what happens when we have a little bit of volume.\nWe price smart, we operate the railroad efficiently, we end up with a 58.0. Are we always going to be at a 58.0? No. We might go up a little bit depending on what the market conditions are. But we're going to drive that to be the best and stay tuned. Okay. I don't think anybody thought we were going to be able to deliver a 58 and hang on and watch us go. That's the win for us. Anybody else want to comment anything further? No. Nobody else wants to say anything after that. Thanks for the question.\n\nAri Rosa\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nAll right, thank you, Jim.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nYou're welcome.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nOur next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nMorning, Bascome.\n\nBascome Majors\n\nAnalyst, Susquehanna\n\nGood morning, Jim. In one of the earlier questions, you talked about some opportunity with the FRA waiver backlog potentially beginning to clear and opening up some efficiency. But this week we also had Patrick Fuchs take over as STB chairman. Can you talk about that side of the regulatory fence? What have you learned from working with him as a board member over the last six years and over the next several years? What opportunities does UP or the industry have that might not have been on the table under Primus or Oberman's leadership? Thank you.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nListen, there's always changes in who leads. And I've had a number of meetings with Mr. Fuchs. Okay. Very smart individual. And the rest of the board is very strong. So at the end of the day, the way I look at it is we have the same goal. We want to provide good service to our customers. And if we can provide good service to our customers, they win in the marketplace, and we both win. And the STB deals with those things. Now, at the end of the day, there's a lot of other things that the STB does. They look at mergers, they look at acquisitions. And I'm absolutely sure that everybody, the STB, and the railroads would like quick decisions, quicker movement on what's happening. And I'm hoping that that's how we move ahead.\nBut I'm very comfortable that the relationship will be strong and we'll continue to have a strong relationship with all the regulators. There is a position to have regulators there. There is a need. And I'm very comfortable that we'll work with them and be very transparent. Transparent about what we're doing at Union Pacific. Anybody else have any comments on that? Any further? Because you've all met with the STB. Kenny.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nNo. I mean, we're looking forward to it. As the commercial leader, we want quicker outcomes so that we can service the marketplace. So it's encouraging.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nEric, anything from you? Deal with them? Lots.\n\nEric Gehringer\n\nEVP Operations, Union Pacific\n\nI think that's the exact same comment. I mean, even in the engagements that we've had with them on uneven service things.\nRight.\nContinuing to move. I know Patrick in the past has had really good perspective on how we think about service, so looking forward to working with him.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nI know, Jennifer, you don't meet with them as often, but maybe we should get you there more often because you've got a better personality for it than me. Maybe, but. Anything to add?\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nNo. I think your point about our goals being aligned is the important one. They want a strong rail franchise. It's the best thing for the nation. Our national security, our economy. And we want to grow with our customers. And I think working together to fulfill that purpose is what everybody wants.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nPerfect. Great question. Thank you very much.\n\nBascome Majors\n\nAnalyst, Susquehanna\n\nThank you all.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nMorning, Ken.\n\nKenneth Hoexter\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nHey.\nGreat.\nGood morning, Jim and team. Congrats on the solid OR and results. But maybe digging in a little bit on that Jen, you got it in the appendix. The other expense to $325 to 350 maybe. Can you delve into what happened in the fourth quarter? I think you mentioned the bad debt expense. Can you talk about a scale of the one-timer or the scale of casualty expense that we should see bounce back? And I guess maybe I'm just ultimately getting at trying to think about the cadence to first quarter. Can you talk about seasonality and what we should. I know you don't delve into quarterly specifics, but maybe just normal historical seasonality, how we should think about the move given the improved performance here in the fourth quarter?\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nYes. I mean, when we look at other expense for the fourth quarter, I mean casualty was really the driver there. I did call out the bad debt expense, but the bigger piece was the casualty both in terms of looking at it year over year, because we did have a pretty big step up in fourth quarter of 2023, as well as the fact that we're starting to see some better performance here in 2024. That's a little slower to come through on the expense side. But you heard Eric and Jim both talk about the fact that we're continuing to drive better safety performance. So that's really where I'd focus in terms of the driver for fourth quarter. In terms of looking out into 2025, within that category, it's probably one of the least seasonal categories we have, quite frankly.\nYou know, state and local taxes is the biggest component of that. And then you do have some of the other things, things like the casualty, like bad debt, travel, you know, all those fun things. So, you know, I wouldn't think about that in terms of a lot of seasonality on that expense line.\n\nKenneth Hoexter\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nWell, I didn't mean just on the expense line. I meant the cadence into first quarter. Or you know, do you normally see 150 bps deterioration? Would you see that given all the backdrop that you're talking about in a big picture way?\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nYes. I mean, obviously I'm not going to give you a guide, Ken, for the quarter, but I think in terms of seasonality, you understand it. There is a difference. When you start out the year, you have some beginning of year costs. If you think about some of the payroll taxes that kick back in for us, our business is a railroad. You generally see some of the lowest volumes of the year in Q1 and then you tend to have some more weather expenses. I mean, I'm not used to paying for some snow removal in New Orleans, but I think I'm going to this year a little bit. So you have some of those things happening. So, you know, pleased to see the way the railroad started in terms of the volume demand and the fluidity.\nFrom a seasonality perspective, I wouldn't look for anything unusual there.\n\nKenneth Hoexter\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nAppreciate the clarification. Thanks for the time.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nOur next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nHey, good morning and thanks for the time. So Kenny, I got a couple questions for you. First is, you know, in the intermodal business, can you give us a sense for where utilization is and the box pool fleet for you guys right now? Obviously there's a lot of channel inventory that's been built up by, you know, the intermodal marketing companies through the pandemic, taking too many boxes. I'm just wondering where your utilization is kind of running right now on railroad-owned equipment. And then the second question would be whether this recent uptick in natural gas prices that we're seeing may have some benefit for you on the pricing side with some of your utility coal contracts.\nThanks.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nYeah. So the first question. Thanks. We certainly did deploy our rail fleet in the second half. We saw it grow and really do really well in our portfolio of fleet. When I say portfolio, I'm talking about the private asset folks, IMCs. So we saw growth there. It wasn't fully deployed. So there's upside there. And so we'll see what happens as we move throughout the year switching to natural gas. I tell you, it's one of the most volatile things to do. And I've been in this role now seven years and I've gotten out of that game of trying to forecast what's going to happen with natural gas. But bottom line, you asked a direct question.\nWe should see some benefit if natural gas prices increase. Absolutely.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nIs there any way to quantify how many more boxes kind of are stacked today versus maybe you would have had normally pre-COVID?\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nNo, I would just say that if you look at the overall market again, I mean the overall market is still not where it should be. There's still upside, and so we still feel good about deploying those boxes as the market comes back.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThanks for the question.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nAll right, thanks. Good time.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nThe next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nMorning Jordan.\n\nJordan Alliger\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nMorning. Just coming back to intermodal. You know, if the trends hold up, that international [is] facing those tough comps, maybe volumes be tough to grow in the back half of the year. Does the domestic intermodal offset? Can that provide, even if volumes are perhaps down, a favorable net positive in terms of mix margin, EBITDA, et cetera? Thanks.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, I mean, everything depends on magnitude, right Jordan? So I think it's unfair to really kind of focus in on one commodity line like international intermodal. You're right. The comps are going to be extremely tough in the back half, but there's a lot of other businesses that we move, and that's really what's going to ultimately play into what our financial results will be. So maybe domestic intermodal offset some of that. But you know, we've got a lot of other business lines that we're going to move, and we're going to try to maximize those. So I don't know that we want to get into the game of trying to make a prediction about how the back half actually looks. There's a lot to happen between now.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nAnd then, but the bottom line is, we feel confident, and we're bullish on the domestic intermodal market going into 2025. That's the key.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nWe've had some great franchise wins there that we still haven't seen the full benefit from.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThanks for the question, Jordan.\n\nJordan Alliger\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nOur next question is from the line of Daniel Imbro with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.\n\nDaniel Imbro\n\nAnalyst, Stephens, Inc.\n\nHey, good morning everybody. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe to follow up on the volume outlook, if we look on the outlook on slide 11 on a headline, there's more pluses than minuses. But how should we think about the mix impact on revenue per carload? You just talked about Intermodal in the previous question, but I guess any visibility into changes of mix within mix within these categories that we should be aware of when we think about the market share wins. And Jennifer, understanding you don't want to guide each quarter, but how should we think about volume growth through the year? Given the more difficult back half comparisons, can we grow volume each quarter? Would that be kind of a base case expectation? Just any color there would be helpful. Thanks.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, Daniel, thanks for the question. So I mean we specifically aren't giving volume guidance either for full year or on a quarterly basis. I think you, you've laid out as we laid out kind of what some of the puts and takes are through the year. I think the important thing is that we're very well positioned. The service product is good. Kenny and his team are out there winning new business, and so we're going to do all we can to push that curve upward. But there's also market forces out there that we're going to be playing against. And we'll just see how that all plays out from a mix perspective. And I did say this in, in my comments.\nYou know, when I look to the back half of the year with what we expect to happen from International Intermodal, that will, you know, alleviate that mix pressure that we had in the back half of 2024. How that ultimately shapes out, kind of similar to my answer to Jordan, you know, will depend on what the rest of the business is doing at that point in time. But I think you're thinking about the different components correctly. It's just a matter of what else layers in along with those as we go ahead. Certainly mix will continue to be a challenge here, at least in the first part of the year as International Intermodal stay strong. I don't know, Ken, if you want.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nTo add anything else, you hit it all again. The credo here for the management team is we're going to have volume outpace the markets and we expect the revenue to outpace volume.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nI guess the only thing I would say is this. Our business mix actually is we've got a broad range of customers and a broad range of markets that we play in. So of course we want to maximize all of them in a smart way that fits our network, makes our customers win, and it's service that we can provide at a high level. So puts and takes international. We don't see it being able to stay at that. Nobody, if I go back to the early part of 2024, nobody thought the International Intermodal for the Western railroads was going to grow and for Union Pacific as much as it did, but it did. But we also have products across, whether it's industrial products, whether it's sand for fracking, you name it.\nThat's the nice part about our franchise, is the different types of customers that we handle. We move everyday products that America needs for finished products, consumer goods, and inputs to the economy. So I'm very happy. It's great to have this franchise that was built by a lot of people before I came to Union Pacific. So that's the way we look at it. And of course, Kenny's job is to maximize it. Otherwise, why do you have a marketing department? Right. So I'm looking forward to another great year. Kenny, thank you very much for the question.\n\nDaniel Imbro\n\nAnalyst, Stephens, Inc.\n\nThanks for all the color.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nOur next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nHow is it in Canada?\n\nWalter Spracklin\n\nCo-Head Global Industrials Research, RBC Capital Markets\n\nIt's pretty cold, but my backyard rink is in good shape. Jim, that mentor quote, it sounds like it was a quote from Hunter, am I right?\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nWell, it was a little earlier, but I think Hunter would have. Might have said it in a different way. He might have not called me stupid.\n\nWalter Spracklin\n\nCo-Head Global Industrials Research, RBC Capital Markets\n\nFew more expletive.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nBut at the end of the day, yeah, he would have said something very similar. Don't worry about all these things that you can't control. It's the fundamentals. If you operate a strong railroad, if you look at your costs, you make sure you're very efficient. Don't lose sight of what's important. You end up on the winning side of the game, you know, you end up on the winning side of the hockey game. You know, Walter, good strong defense, right? In hockey, always wins the Stanley Cup. Not that flashy person in the front. It's that strong four core defensemen that make a difference and a strong goalie. So that's what we're all about.\n\nWalter Spracklin\n\nCo-Head Global Industrials Research, RBC Capital Markets\n\nWell, my son will be happy to hear that comment for sure. Speaking of those fundamentals, Jim, you talked a bit about guidance, and it's predicated on a mixed economic outlook. And I know you like that kind of scenario analysis where we look at the upside. And I know a few of your trucking peers have spoken pretty constructively here today about that potential for an improvement in the economy. So if we do see that, where do you see the most opportunity for leverage if we get a better macro? And more importantly, is this type of operating leverage that you're engineering here, Jim?\nIs this setting you up for potentially coming in above the high end of that low double digit band, or is the low double digit capture? If the economy gets better, then we will do low double digit. Just curious to hear how that sensitivity works out for you.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nWell, Walter, if I didn't have a few hundred people on the call, maybe I would say something different. But bottom line is, you know what we talk about, but you know, what you always hear from me. But I've got a strong team with me. And Eric does a fantastic job about how we operate every day. And Kenny does a fantastic job. I rib him every so often about, you know, why do we need a marketing department? So why don't I let them talk about what they see and what we have: operating leverage and what we see, customer leverage as we move ahead, and what that would mean. So Kenny or Eric?\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nI'll kick off Eric and then you take over. I mean, look, we laid out the slide, but I'm very bullish on what we're seeing in our green products area with renewable diesel. And I'm bullish from a number of reasons. One is structural. We've talked about these facilities that are on our line. Eric's service product has given us flexibility on the grain side to move anywhere in the world, whether it's going out of the Gulf, whether it's going to Mexico, whether it's going to the PNW.\nWe'll see where coal ends up. I got a coal/corn question a little bit earlier. It started off pretty solid here, and we've got a win that's coming on. On the industrial side, our petrochem business has been strong. We've had some wins. We've been investing in that area to help us grow. We'll see that in terms of expansions coming on this year. Then we got to look at some of these other macro indicators. What's going to happen with housing starts? That has a really, I'll call it, a step function impact on us from a lot of different commodities. Then on the premium side, we should see automotive market improve as we move throughout the year. Domestic intermodal I mentioned I'm high on and should be positive.\nOn the international side, I'd be remiss if I didn't say we've gone out and tried to minimize over comps by winning some business last year and trying to retain portions of it. Not all of it, obviously. We'll see how that plays out.\n\nEric Gehringer\n\nEVP Operations, Union Pacific\n\nAnd then, Walter, if you pick it up from there, then the question becomes, are there proof statements in Union Pacific's recent history that demonstrate that we can do exactly what Kenny just said, that we can support him as he's out there in the market. And there are a number of them. We talked about international intermodal, and I think we've talked about that one enough. A massive accomplishment for the team. But think about if we were sitting here a year ago. Nobody would have expected the shift on the grain side away from the Pacific Northwest as much into Mexico. But you didn't hear any noise about that. Instead, you saw us pivot, use some of those buffer resources. We leveraged our strong relationship with FXE to be able to grow that market share.\nYou also see it in the example I mentioned in my prepared comments about the Houston Gulf Coast projects. You know, sometimes when people think about capital investments and we say projects, they think, well, it's one location and we must be building just a siding. That project collectively is a massive undertaking, and it's a very strategic undertaking. To say where do we have to make just small adjustments, small investments in many different terminals to make sure that we can support exactly what Kenny said. And then finally, one of the most exciting ones for me and certainly for all of us. I tell you, every single expansion we do at Empire, Kenny's team just keeps filling it up. And so we have many proof statements that say we can support exactly what Kenny's setting out to do in 2025.\n\nWalter Spracklin\n\nCo-Head Global Industrials Research, RBC Capital Markets\n\nAppreciate the color, Eric. Kenny, thanks very much.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nWalter, thank you very much. And listen, it's time for one of the Canadian teams to win the Stanley Cup, okay?\nIt's been a long time.\nI think the Edmonton Oilers are going to do it. I've been following them for a long time, and I've been suffering for many years. Walter, not as bad as you in Toronto, but that's okay. Don't worry about it.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nWe'll get it done.\nOur next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJeff Kauffman\n\nPartner of Transportation and Logistics Equity Research, Vertical Research Partners\n\nThank you very much and congratulations on just a terrific execution quarter. Kenny, I want to come back to you if I can. I liked your answer to Jason Seidl's question, be prepared in terms of dealing with these known unknowns. But I want to dive a little bit deeper. You know, when I think about what could be at risk on the tariff side, I'm not talking about the tax change or regulatory benefit. You know, you would think obviously export grain south, you would think beer imports north, you would think auto parts. What elements of your traffic mix either have maybe a Canadian end to it that we might not see as obviously, or a Mexican import export end that might not be as obvious to us on the outside.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nWell, first of all, I just want to say it's all fluid. I'm not aware when I look across our commodity groups where, you know, maybe there is one specific commodity I can think about. Most of these commodities have different entry points, different origin points, and different destinations. That's why I talk about preparedness, because we have just a great franchise to be able to capture that. So whether it's finished vehicles that have to come in through the Gulf, whether it's finished vehicles that have to come in through Mexico, whether it's finished vehicles that we move out of the PNW, we have different entry points and destination points, points to move in and out. That's why I harp so much on, you know, preparedness. The end consumer is going to consume these products.\nIt may be a few pennies more, they're going to consume the product. It's just how it's going to get there. And our commercial team is all over this to make sure it moves. Union Pacific.\n\nJeff Kauffman\n\nPartner of Transportation and Logistics Equity Research, Vertical Research Partners\n\nSo maybe to your point, I guess maybe the thing we should be thinking about is maybe the way it gets to where it's going changes. But your feeling is that the team will find a solution if that has to be.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nWell, I hit that point. I thought I hit it hard earlier. That's exactly what I'm thinking. Our job, our commercial team needs, and we are, and we're dialed in on where these changes will be and then coming up with solutions with Eric's team to make sure we can deliver them.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, good morning. I forgot to say that. And thanks for the question. I think you summarized it well.\n\nJeff Kauffman\n\nPartner of Transportation and Logistics Equity Research, Vertical Research Partners\n\nThank you.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nOur next question is from the line of Thomas Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nThomas Wadewitz\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nYeah, good morning.\nI think you had some pretty positive and convicted views on pricing and focused on price, which is great. How do you think about the truck, you know, your assumptions on truckload market and you know, do you just think, well, we'll get a little help from some, you know, modest contract increases in truck and that helps us and. Or how do you think about that? And also just on intermodal revenue per unit, is that something that's been pretty meaningful drag for a while. I know some of that can be fuel surcharge and mix and everything, but that's been a pretty big drag. How do you think about revenue per unit in intermodal in 2025 as well?\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nSo the last couple years, you know, I have resisted from going out and forecasting and seeing back half. Back half, back half. We want to look at the data points, and the market data points will tell you whether you're looking at DAT, whether you're looking at FTR, that it should improve as we move throughout the year. Customer sentiment is the same as we're talking to a number of our IMCs and private asset folks. We'll let that market play out, the timing of it. We'll see where that goes, the extent of it. We'll see where that goes. And yes, if that improves, we should see, you know, some uptick there based on how we position things in terms of that revenue per box.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah. And Tom, I think you really nailed it in terms of what, what you see as the drivers there. I mean, it's one of those categories where we have mix within mix. We talked at our analyst day about how our international intermodal has, you know, our lowest revenue per unit of any commodity that we haul. And so when that's growing strong within that group, you see that impact. And of course fuel coming down is another thing. So both of those are really what you see happening there as well as the tougher competitive environment.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThe only thing I can add, Tom, is on the productivity side of the way we've been able to change the way we operate our lowest revenue movements. No ifs, ands, or buts, there's a big difference between some products that we move because we don't price the same for every commodity. At the end of the day we've done a lot of work on terminal dwell, car speed, car velocity.\nHow many boxes we can put on a train to be able to make it more efficient for us so that we handle the difference in the revenue that we make? And Eric's team works every day, every minute on that commodity to see how do we optimize the railroad and the cost structure that we have against the revenue that we make on it. So a challenge. But at the end of the day, I think we've done a pretty good job of it, and we still love that business. It's good for us, and it moves through our whole network, and the more efficient we can get, the better we are on being able to handle more of it in an efficient manner and maybe put a little less pressure on Kenny. Well, I guess not to price it up. So thanks for the question, Tom.\n\nThomas Wadewitz\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nOkay, great, thank you.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nThe next question is from the line of Walter Holmes with Redburn Atlantic. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nMorning, Walter.\n\nOliver Holms\n\nAnalyst, Redburn Atlantic\n\nGood morning. Thanks for having me on. Just a question on CapEx if I may. Looks like your locomotives and equipment CapEx is forecasting this line from. I was just wondering if that's a reflection of the withdrawal.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nYou're breaking up. I can't understand it. I don't know if anybody else around the table can understand it.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nI heard something about CapEx.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah. Can you maybe just get into a little better spot or something and see if you can get through to us please?\n\nOliver Holmes\n\nAnalyst, Redburn Atlantic\n\nAny bets now?\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nNah, still breaking up. Walter, can we go to the next question and then see if we can get Walter in a different spot because I know we're down to the last couple.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nSure. Yes. The next question is from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\n\nBrandon Oglenski\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nHey, good morning all. Thanks for getting my question in here. I know it's been a long call, and I was off for the front part of it, so apologies if I'm replicating something here. But I guess Jim or Kenny, we've heard about better service, and I think what investors are looking for at Union Pacific and other railroads is to finally see real volume growth. So on the back of those service gains that you guys have made in the network, Kenny, within the context of your comments about volume outpacing the market this year, I mean, is this incremental wins? Is it business development efforts that are driving this and finally leveraging that service product?\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, absolutely. I mean, if you look at our network minus the business development wins, especially in markets like the automotive that I highlighted, in markets that are challenged where we have, you know, structural decline like coal, and markets that are emerging and we're ahead of it in renewable diesel, in a market that we expect to grow from an export perspective on the petrochemical side and the industrial chemical side. Absolutely. The business development wins matter, and it does help us outpace the market. So, you know, no other way to really say that than to just hit that one head on.\n\nBrandon Oglenski\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nThank you all.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nBrandon, thank you very much. Operator, did we get Walter back on or not?\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nNo, it did not, Mr. Vena. I'll turn it over to you for closing comments.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nOkay, well, listen, Walter, you know, call in. Brad and team are always willing to answer the question, so apologize. That didn't work out. But listen, I'm very proud of the team. I'm very proud of the focus. I'm proud of everybody today. Right now we have 15,000 people out there moving, touching, and working to move the products that we sell. And you know, the rest of us are in a nice warm office and they're out there working. I can't be more appreciative. Great quarter for all of them, great quarter for us, and looking forward to speaking to all of you, if not at some conference or at some other time at the end of the first quarter. So thank you very much. Have a great day and let's enjoy the day as we go forward. Thank you.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nThank you, Mr. Vena, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. We thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day."

Welcome to the Union Pacific Second Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jim Vena, Chief Executive Officer for Union Pacific. Thank you. Mr. Vena, you may now begin.\n\nVincenzo James Vena\n\nCOO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nThanks, Rob, and good morning and nice to come to you all from a beautiful morning here in Omaha, and thanks for joining us today to discuss Union Pacific's second quarter results. I'm joined by our Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Hamann; our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales, Kenny Rocker; and our Executive Vice President of Operations, Eric Gehringer.\nAs we dive into the discussion of the second quarter, you'll hear that operating outdoors these past few months has not been easy, but I'm pleased with how we manage those challenges to drive strong financial results. It provides another proof point that our strategy is the right room to drive success.\nAnd let's discuss second quarter results, starting on Slide 3. This morning, Union Pacific reported 2024 second quarter net income of $1.7 billion or $2.74 per share. This compares to 2023 second quarter net income of $1.6 billion or $2.57 per share. Second quarter operating revenue was up 1%, as solid core pricing gains and slightly increased volume were reduced by a negative business mix and lower fuel surcharge revenue. And if you're normalizing for the yearly change in fuel, freight revenue was up 2% versus 2023.\nReported expenses year-over-year were down 4%. This is very impressive work by the team to offset the high inflationary pressure we've experienced in a flattish volume environment, even when you adjust for onetime items and fuel. Our second quarter operating ratio of 60.0% improved 300 basis points versus last year and despite some challenges, we still showed sequential improvement.\nOverall, this quarter was another solid step towards our goal of leading the industry in safety, service and operational excellence. I'll let the team walk you through the quarter in more detail, and then come back for a wrap up before we go to Q&A.\nSo we'll start with Jennifer and the second quarter financials. Jennifer?\n\nJennifer L. Hamann\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Union Pacific Corp.\n\nThanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 5 with the walk down of our second quarter income statement, where operating revenue of $6 billion increased 1% versus last year on slightly positive volumes.\nAs Kenny will highlight, this strong top line performance was supported by solid pricing gains and business wins against the backdrop of weak coal demand. Second quarter freight revenue totaled $5.6 billion, a 1% gain. Digging into the revenue components, strong core pricing gains, partially offset by an unfavorable business mix, added 150 basis points to freight revenue.\nDouble-digit growth in international intermodal volume was the primary contributor to the negative mix dynamic and further compounded by an overall decline in our higher average revenue per car industrial business. Slightly positive volumes in the quarter added 50 basis points to freight revenue. And lastly, fuel surcharge revenue of $669 million declined 5%, as lower fuel prices impacted freight revenue 75 basis points. Excluding fuel surcharge, freight revenue grew 2%, as the team continues to pace revenue growth faster than volume. Wrapping up the top line, other revenue declined 6% as a result of lower intermodal accessorials and less demand for auto parts shipments at our Loop subsidiary.\nSwitching to expenses. Second quarter operating expense of $3.6 billion decreased $152 million versus 2023, as we drove productivity across most cost categories. We have more details in the appendix, but let me highlight some of the performance drivers.\nCompensation and benefits expense declined 6% versus last year as we reduced headcount 5% and generated positive productivity. Although our training pipeline is significantly reduced compared to 2023, train service employees increased 1% as we continue to carry more train service employees as a buffer for our operations and to offset the impact of new labor agreements. The remainder of the workforce decreased 9% as we continue to focus on delayering and pushing work down in the organization. And as you'll recall, last year's expenses included a $67 million onetime ratification payment.\nFollowing up on an item we highlighted at our first quarter report, last month, we completed the transfer of around 350 mechanical employees to Metro in Chicago. Going forward, this transfer will lower both other revenue and our expenses by roughly $15 million a quarter.\nExcluding last year's onetime labor payment, cost per employee in the second quarter increased 4%, as we continue to drive for better overall efficiency. Fuel expense in the quarter declined 6% on a 5% decrease in fuel prices from $2.86 per gallon to $2.73 per gallon. We overcame a challenging operating environment and less fuel-efficient freight mix to improve our fuel consumption rate 1%, largely by locomotive productivity. Equipment and other rents declined 12%, reflecting improved cycle times and lower lease expense, partially offset by business mix. Finally, other expense decreased 4%, as we recorded a couple of onetime items in the quarter.\nOn the positive side, we added a $46 million gain from an intermodal equipment sale. Conversely, we recognized $23 million of additional environmental expense at a legacy California remediation site. Second quarter operating income of $2.4 billion increased 9% versus last year.\nBelow the line, other income increased 11%, as a result of interest received on tax refund claims, while interest expense declined 6% on lower average debt levels. Second quarter net income of $1.7 billion and earnings per share of $2.74 both improved 7% versus 2023. Our quarterly operating ratio of 60% improved 300 basis points year-over-year.\nAs I just discussed, there were several puts and takes in the quarter. Key here is that our core operations drove 160 basis points of OR improvement and $0.21 of EPS growth year-over-year. This is a great continuation of the momentum we've created these past 3 quarters.\nTurning to shareholder returns on the balance sheet on Slide 6. Second quarter cash from operations totaled $4 billion, up $175 million versus last year. Growth in operating income and 2023 labor agreement payments, partially offset by higher income tax payments, resulted in increasing cash from operations and our free cash flow improvement, up 43% to $853 million. As stated back in April, we restarted share repurchases late in the second quarter. Although we plan to ramp up repurchases through the year, we started slowly with just over $100 million repurchased in June. Combined with our dividend payments, we've returned $1.7 billion to shareholders year-to-date. Finally, our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio finished the quarter at 2.8x, and we continue to be A rated by our 3 credit rating agencies.\nWrapping up on Slide 7, as we've reached the midway point of 2024, there remains some uncertainty about the second half recovery that many were forecasting. As Kenny will detail, there are definitely markets where we're seeing growth, and much of that growth is being driven by our business development efforts.\nThere also are some challenged markets, particularly coal. Operationally, the team is making great progress towards our long-term goals to be the best in safety, service and operational excellence. This is reflected in the progress in our safety and performance metrics, including our margins.\nImportantly, we believe the trend is indicative of where we can get to long term, and each successive quarter is a step on our way to winning. We are highly confident in our ability to generate price dollars in excess of inflation dollars, and still expect freight revenue to pace ahead of volume in 2024.\nWe also remain committed to our long-term capital allocation strategy. This includes last week's announcement of a 3% increase in our dividend as we drive higher returns to our owners. This increase represents the 18th year in a row of annual dividend increases. With share repurchases, we expect to repurchase around $1.5 billion in 2024 as we maintain our current leverage.\nBefore I turn it over to Kenny, I'd summarize our second quarter financial performance as strong and our confidence in the future stronger as we continue to unlock the potential of our great franchise. We're excited to execute on our strategy in the second half and lay out more of our long-term thoughts at our Investor Day in September. Kenny?\n\nKenyatta G. Rocker\n\nExecutive Vice President-Marketing & Sales, Union Pacific Corp.\n\nThank you, Jennifer, and good morning. As Jennifer mentioned, we had a solid second quarter, especially if you put aside the lower volume from coal. Great revenue totaled $5.6 billion for the quarter, which was up 2% excluding fuel surcharges due to strong core pricing and a slight increase in volume.\nLet's jump right in and talk about the key drivers in each of our business groups. Starting with our bulk segment. Revenue for the quarter was down 2% compared to last year on a 5% decrease in volume and a 3% increase in average revenue per car, driven by solid core pricing gains and a positive mix in traffic. However, if you exclude coal, bulk revenue for the quarter was up 4% year-over-year and volume grew by 6%.\nCoal volume was down 23% in the quarter due to ongoing secular decline of the market, along with continued challenges from lower natural gas prices and higher inventory levels. Fertilizer volumes increased for the quarter due to strong export demand for Canpotex potash and easier comps from a 2023 customer outage. In addition, grain products business was favorable due to increased demand for renewable diesel, strong demand for ethanol and new business wins.\nMoving to Industrial. Revenue was up 2% for the quarter on a 3% decrease in volume and a 5% increase in average revenue per car. Strong core pricing gains and a positive mix in traffic were partially offset by lower fuel surcharges. Our strong business development efforts in petroleum allowed us to capitalize on opportunities. Petrochemicals volume continued to grow due to improved domestic demand in plastics and strong business development wins in our industrial chemicals markets from customers located along the Gulf Coast. However, challenges with high inventories and rainy weather in the South negatively impacted our rock volume.\nPremium revenue for the quarter was up 4% on a 6% increase in volume and a 2% decrease in average revenue per car will reflect a negative mix, lower fuel surcharges and truck market pressure. Automotive volumes were positive due to business development wins with Volkswagen and General Motors, but offset by unplanned decreases in production impacting auto part shipments. Intermodal volumes continue to remain strong due to West Coast import demand and positive domestic growth despite market conditions, especially within our Parcels segment.\nNow turning to Slide 10. Here is our outlook for the balance of 2024 for the key markets we serve. Starting with bulk. Coal is expected to remain challenged as inventories remain high and natural gas futures stay at levels that make coal less competitive. For grain, as we sit here today, the markets look stable and healthy, although global export sales are off to a slow start. Crop conditions look good, and we'll have a better read over the next several weeks. In addition, we expect grain products to remain positive as we see incremental renewable diesel production coming online in California and continue to capture new business.\nTurning to Industrial. Our outlook remains the same as we laid out during our last earnings call. We expect our rock market will not match last year's record volume. However, both petroleum and petrochemical markets will remain favorable due to our focus on business development, supported by our investments in the Gulf Coast.\nAnd wrapping up with premium, on the intermodal side, we expect to see continued strength for imports in the near term. And while we have seen imports drive pockets of increased demand, on the domestic side, the overall market remains soft. But our improved service product, along with our diversified set of private asset owners and IMCs, provide Union Pacific more at back when opportunities present themselves. And for automotive, we're still expecting year-over-year growth due to business development wins, despite some softening in the market.\nIn summary, I'm proud of the commercial team and their focus to fill the volume gap we're seeing from coal. On the price side, we're achieving solid price results to overcome inflation and delivering the consistent and efficient service that we sold to our customers.\nAs we head into the second half of the year, I am confident that our great franchise, along with the diverse product offerings we provide, gives our customers the ability to compete and win in the marketplace. Our commercial leaders are actively working with customers and the operating team to convert more over-the-roll business to rail that allows us both to win and grow.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance.\n\nEric J. Gehringer\n\nSVP of Transportation, Union Pacific Railroad Company Inc.\n\nThank you, Kenny, and good morning. Moving to Slide 12. As you heard from Jim, Mother Nature delivered many powerful weather events throughout the quarter, as we experienced impactful flooding across both our Northern and Southern regions. But we're not here to make excuses. Leveraging our intense focus on operational excellence and detailed contingency plans, the team quickly acted to mitigate the impact by adjusting trip plans and deploying temporary buffer resources to safely restore operations.\nI'm very proud of our frontline employees who worked tirelessly to repair our infrastructure to minimize the customer impact. There are countless examples highlighting their efforts as they repaired miles of damage track, restored bridges and cleared countless trees and debris. That being said, versus 2023, service levels and network performance for the second quarter remains strong, demonstrating our recoverability in the wake of major weather disruptions.\nStarting with our foundation of safety. We continue to drive improvements, building on the momentum of the first quarter. For the second quarter, both derailment and personal injury rates improved year-over-year. While I am proud of the team for making this progress, we will not rest until every employee goes home safe to their loved ones every day.\nFreight car velocity was flat in the second quarter compared to 2023, as improvements in terminal dwell were offset by weather-impacted train speeds. The opportunity here is to drive even stronger terminal dwell performance by removing unnecessary car touches across the network.\nOn the service front, Intermodal SBI improved 4 points as manifest and auto SPI remained flat. Although we worked hard to minimize impact on weather on our service product, we know customers felt the impact, particularly those located in the affected areas.\nNow let's review our key efficiency metrics on Slide 13. The team remains highly focused on cost control, leveraging technology and other investments to drive productivity throughout our operation. As I mentioned last quarter, it is imperative to our strategy as it enables Kenny and the team to compete in the marketplace.\nSimilar to the first quarter, we saw year-over-year improvements across all of our metrics. Locomotive productivity improved 6% compared to second quarter 2023, driven by improved network fluidity and asset utilization. Throughout the year, we have been able to efficiently flex our locomotive fleet with units readily available to adjust to varying volume levels.\nWorkforce productivity, which does include all employees, improved 5% versus 2023. While overall employee levels decreased, our active train engine and yard employees increased as we implement new labor agreements. Train length improved 2% compared to second quarter 2023 and 3% sequentially due to increased intermodal volume, combined with the usage of safety technologies like precision train builder. In fact, our second quarter result was a quarterly record, and June marked the first month ever with train length over 9,600 feet. This is a remarkable achievement by the team as they continue to generate mainline capacity for future growth.\nWrapping up. It's important to note, as we continue to implement new technology throughout our operation, we are also building new processes. These processes, powered by automation and real-time analytics, open new capabilities for Union Pacific and our customers. I'm looking forward to sharing such examples at our Investor Day in September.\nSo with that, I'll turn it back to Jim.\n\nVincenzo James Vena\n\nCOO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nThank you, Eric. Turning to Slide 15.\nBefore we get to your questions, I'd like to quickly summarize what you've heard from our team. First, as you heard from Jennifer, despite a challenging environment, we achieved strong financial results in the quarter. We continue to drive efficiency into the network, and the commercial team has done a good job generating price for the value we provide our customers.\nKenny provided you with an overview of the second quarter volumes and laid out some updated thoughts for the remainder of the year. I think it's worth stating that when you remove coal, our total volume was up 3% in the second quarter. This demonstrates that even in a tough freight environment, we are winning with our customers to bring new business to the railroad.\nLastly, Eric walked you through the progress we're making across safety, service and operational excellence. In the first half of the year, our safety metrics improved, but we still have a way to go. Our service was challenged in the quarter, but I'm pleased with our ability to recover, and we're continuing to do things more efficiently, making good improvements in operational excellence. Look, the quarter presented its challenges, but I'm very pleased with the results we achieved.\nFrom the beginning, I said improvement wasn't going to be a straight line. There are just too many variables when you operate an outdoor factory. But I expect the trend line will be in the right direction, and we demonstrated that again this quarter. Over the past 12 months, we've put this company on the right path to redefining what's possible for Union Pacific, a theme will build on at our Investor Day in mid-September.\nWith that, now we're ready to take your questions.

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jim Vena, Chief Executive Officer for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Vena. You may now.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nBegin. Okay. Thanks, Rob. Good morning to everyone. Beautiful day in Omaha. 60 degrees, a little bit of rain. It is absolutely perfect for railroading. Why don't we get started, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Union Pacific's Q1 results. I'm joined in Omaha by our Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Hamann, our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales, Kenny Rocker, and our Executive Vice President of Operations Eric Gehringer.\nAs you'll hear from the team, we continue to execute our multi-year strategy to establish Union Pacific as the industry leader in safety, service, and operational excellence. We again took positive steps steps towards that goal in the Q1. While challenges outside our control persist, we are establishing a foundation for long-term success. Now let's discuss Q1 results starting on slide three.\nThis morning, Union Pacific reported 2024 Q1 net income of $1.6 billion or $2.69 per share. This compares to 2023 Q1 net income of $1.6 billion or $2.67 per share. We're pleased to be able to report earnings growth in a tough environment, especially since last year's results included a $0.14 per share real estate gain. Q1 operating revenue was flat as solid core pricing gains and a positive business mix were offset by lower fuel surcharge revenue and reduced volumes.\nNormalizing for the impact from fuel surcharge, freight revenue was up 4% versus last year. Expenses year-over-year were down 3% driven by lower fuel prices and productivity gains. This was partially offset by inflation, increased transportation workforce levels to compensate for new labor agreements, and higher depreciation. Our Q1 operating ratio of 60.7% improved 140 basis points versus last year.\nThis also represents a 20 basis points improvement sequentially from the Q4, which further demonstrates the strong work by the team. Look, it's a great start to the year. I'm pleased with how the Union Pacific team is coming together to unlock what's possible for our company. There's a lot of work to do. I'll let the team walk you through the quarter in more detail, and I'll come back and wrap it up before we go to question-and -nswer. With that, Jennifer, why don't you go through the Q1 financials?\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nAll right, thanks Jim, and good morning. I'll begin with a walkdown of our Q1 income statement on slide five where operating revenue of $6 billion was flat versus last year on a 1% volume decline that was significantly driven by a 20% reduction in coal shipments. In fact, excluding coal volumes would have been up close to 2% year-over-year even in this tough freight environment.\nLooking then at the revenue components further, total freight revenue of $5.6 billion declined 1%. The single largest driver of the year-over-year decrease was a 25% reduction in fuel surcharge revenue to $665 million as lower fuel prices negatively impacted freight revenue 375 basis points. Solid core pricing gains, and a favorable business mix combined to add 350 basis points to freight revenue.\nReduced coal and rock shipments, as well as increased soda ash and petroleum carloads, drove the positive mix dynamic. Excluding fuel surcharge, freight revenue grew 4%. A solid start to the year and a demonstration of the great diversity of the UP franchise. Wrapping up the top line, other revenue increased 4% driven by increased accessorial revenue that included a one-time contract settlement of $25 million. Switching to expenses.\nOperating expense of $3.7 billion decreased 3% as we generated solid productivity against lower demand. Digging deeper into a few of the expense lines. Compensation and Benefits expense was up 4% versus last year. Q1 workforce levels decreased 2% as reductions in non-transportation employees more than offset a 4% increase in our active TE&Y workforce.\nAlthough our training pipeline is significantly reduced, we continue to carry additional training services employees as a buffer for our operations and to offset the impact of newly available sick pay, benefits, and work rest agreements. While talking about workforce levels, I do want to mention one quick housekeeping item. As some of you might be aware, we are in the process of transferring operating responsibility for certain passenger lines in Chicago to Metra.\nAs part of that, in June, we will be transferring around 350 mechanical employees to Metra on a quarterly basis. This will lower both revenue and expense by roughly $15 million. Cost per employee in Q1 increased 5% reflecting wage inflation and additional costs associated with new labor agreements. Fuel expense in the quarter declined 14% on a 13% decrease in fuel prices from $3.22 per gallon to $2.81 per gallon.\nWe also improved our fuel consumption rate by 1% as locomotive productivity more than offset a less fuel efficient business mix. Given the decline in coal shipments, purchased services and materials expense decreased 6% versus last year as we maintained a smaller active locomotive fleet and our logistics subsidiary incurred less drainage expense. In addition, a little less than half of the year-over-year variance related to resolution of a contract dispute.\nFinally, equipment and other rents declined 8% reflecting a more fluid network seen through improved cycle times and lower lease expenses. By controlling the controllables in our cost structure, Q1 operating income of $2.4 billion increased 3% versus last year. Below the line, Jim noted last year's real estate transaction and other income, and our interest expense declined 4% on lower average debt levels.\nQ1 net income of $1.6 billion and earnings per share of $2.69 both improved 1% versus 2023, and our quarterly operating ratio of 60.7% improved 140 basis points year-over-year, which includes a 60 basis points headwind from lower fuel prices. Turning to shareholder returns in the balance sheet on slide six, Q1 cash from operations totaled $2.1 billion, up roughly $280 million versus last year.\nGrowth in operating income as well as the impact from 2023 Labor Agreement payments are reflected in that increase. In addition, free cash flow and our cash flow conversion rate both showed nice improvement. As planned, we paid down $1.3 billion of debt maturities in March. That resulted in our adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio declining to 2.9x at the end of the quarter, and we continue to be A-rated by our three credit rating agencies.\nAlso during the quarter, we paid dividends totaling $795 million. Wrapping things up on slide seven, as you'll hear from Kenny, our overall outlook on the freight environment hasn't changed a lot since January. Yes, there have been some pluses and minuses from our original outlook, but in totality we still see the same economic uncertainty. What I am certain of, however, is that our service product is meeting and will continue to meet the demand in the marketplace, and when volumes strengthen, we will be ready to provide our customers with the service they need to grow with us.\nIn addition, as evidenced by our Q1 results, we will continue to generate productivity that improves our network efficiency. Also demonstrated by those Q1 results is our commitment to generating pricing dollars in excess of inflation dollars if you set fuel aside.\nOur price commitment as well as expectations for positive mix in 2024 should allow us to pace freight revenue ahead of volume. Finally, with capital allocation, we plan to restart share repurchases in Q2, a further demonstration of the confidence we have in our strategy and the momentum that is building. The actions we're taking to improve safety, service, and operational excellence are reflected in our financials, and continuing on with this strategy will drive shareholder value in 2024 and well into the future. Let me turn it over to Kenny now to provide an update on the business.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nThank you, Jennifer, and good morning. As Jennifer mentioned, freight revenues totaled $5.6 billion for the quarter, which was down 1% as core pricing was offset by lower fuel surcharges and a 1% drop in volume. Let's jump right in and talk about the key drivers in each of our business groups, starting with bulk. Revenue for the quarter was down 4% compared to last year on a 5% decrease in volume and a 1% increase in average revenue per car.\nSolid core pricing gains across most bulk segments were largely offset by low natural gas prices that unfavorably impacted our coal index contracts and lower fuel surcharges. As stated, coal continued to face difficult market conditions in Q1 as warmer temperatures overall led to record low natural gas prices and caused significant declines in demand.\nGrain and grain products volume was up for the quarter with increased shipments of corn to Mexico as well as more shipments from Canadian origins. Lastly, despite strong truck competition, food and refrigerator shipments increased as a result of new business for dry goods, solid demand, and network service improvement. Moving to industrial revenue was up 4% for the quarter driven by a 1% increase in volume.\nStrong core pricing gains and a positive mix in traffic were partially offset by lower fuel surcharges. Our strong business development efforts in petroleum allowed us to capitalize on windows of opportunity along with new domestic contract wins. Demand improved for our petrochemicals business in both export and domestic markets. However, challenges with high inventories and weather negatively impacted our rock volumes.\nPremium revenue for the quarter was down 3% on a 1% increase in volume and a 4% decrease in average revenue per car, reflecting lower fuel surcharges and truck market pressures. Automotive volumes were positive due to business development wins with Volkswagen and General Motors, along with continued strength from dealer inventory replenishment. Intermodal volumes were positive in the quarter, driven by strong international West Coast demand, which was partially offset by the international contract loss I mentioned in January and soft market conditions in domestic intermodal.\nTurning to slide 10, here is our 2024 outlook as we see it today for the key markets we serve, starting with bulk. We anticipate continued challenges in coal as inventories are projected to be at record levels and natural gas futures remain depressed. We are closely watching grain, particularly as it relates to new crop conditions and Q4 export demand. We expect domestic grain demand to be stable.\nLastly, we are optimistic about grain products as we continue to see growth in biofuel feedstocks. Additionally, we recently won incremental grain products business out of Iowa that started moving earlier this year by demonstrating our consistent service product and developing competitive solutions to support our customer's business. Turning to industrial, the rock market will be challenged to exceed last year's record volume.\nHowever, we expect petroleum and petrochem markets to remain favorable due to our focus on business development supported by our investments in the Gulf Coast and operational excellence. Finally, for premium, on the intermodal side, we expect to see consistent, strong West Coast imports in the near term, but it's still too early to predict what will happen in the back half of the year.\nOn the domestic intermodal side, we continue to see market softness, but expect our strong service product and diversified set of IMC and private asset partners will set us up well when demand returns. For automotive, we will see continued strength due to our business development wins and improved OEM production.\nIn summary, coal and domestic intermodal will put pressure on our volumes this year, but the team has taken action. As you saw in the Q1, excluding fuel, we were able to grow revenue even as we faced lower volumes. Overall, I am confident that with our improved service products, we will continue to win new business and take trucks off the road.\nOn the price side, we are having deliberate conversations with customers on price increases to overcome inflationary pressures, and those conversations are backed up by an efficient service product that Eric's team has given to our customers so that they can compete and win. We have a great franchise along with being the premier cross border rail provider to and from Mexico that positions us well to serve markets in both the US and Mexico.\nOur legacy service and the new service offerings we've added allows us to win in the marketplace, and we see strong opportunities in front of us to grow with our customers. With that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational.\n\nEric Gehringer\n\nEVP Operations, Union Pacific\n\nPerformance. Thank you, Kenny, and good morning. Moving to slide 12, we exited 2023 with strong operational momentum across the board, and while weather quickly presented its challenges, the team rose to the task. The speed with which our service product recovered is a testament to our strategy and the resiliency of our network. We continue to see meaningful year-over-year improvements in our metrics.\nThis is a direct result of our steadfast focus on providing industry-leading safety, service, and operational excellence. Starting with freight car velocity, improvements in terminal dwell and overall network fluidity led to a 4% improvement compared to Q1 2023. Sequentially, freight car velocity declined 6%, primarily due to shifts in product mix between our bulk, manifest, and intermodal services. Particularly, we are seeing an impact from declines in intermodal and bulk shipments, which generally contribute higher average daily car miles.\nKey is that our service product remains consistent and we are delivering what we sold to our customers. We want our customers to win, and if they win, we win. To further deliver on the service we sold our customers, we recently introduced a new measure, Service Performance Index or SPI. As the name implies, it's a combined metric that reflects the actual service provided, and we believe is a better measure than Trip Plan Compliance alone.\nFor those customers with specific transit commitments, we measure against that. For the many customers who rely on our historical performance to inform their rail transportation planning decision, SPI provides a measure that aligns with this practice. For Q1, both intermodal, manifest, and auto SPI saw a sizable 14- and 7-point year-over-year improvement respectively.\nThe team also delivered safety performance in the quarter both on derailment and personal injury fronts. As we continue to emphasize the culture of safety, we're also investing in technology and process, ensuring our employees have the tools they need to operate safely and efficiently. Our goal is clear. We want to lead the industry and drive tangible change so everyone goes home safely each day.\nNow let's review our key efficiency metrics on slide 13. While maintaining focus on enhancing safety and service, it is equally crucial that we do so in a cost-effective manner, enabling Kenny and the team to keep competitive in a broader range of markets. In alignment with this objective, we saw year-over-year improvement across all of our Q1 metrics, indicating that the efficiency of our railroad is on the right track.\nLocomotive productivity improved 10% compared to Q1 2023 as the team continues to run an efficient operation and a transportation plan that requires fewer locomotives to satisfy the demands of the business. In fact, we have reduced our active fleet by about 500 locomotives compared to last year. Workforce productivity, which includes all employees, improved 1% as average daily car miles declined slightly and employees decreased 2% compared to 2023.\nWhile overall workforce counts declined, our train engine and yard employees increased 4% as we continue to support our training pipeline, scheduled work agreements, and provide the capacity buffer necessary to navigate an ever-changing environment. Train length improved 1% compared to Q1 2023 after a particularly challenging January due to winter weather, we quickly adjusted to set train length records in both February and March.\nNotably, manifest train length increased by around 300ft while train length increased for nearly all train categories year-over-year. Declines in intermodal shipments, which generally move on longer trains, moderated sequential performance.\nAlthough we are encouraged by these results, there are ample opportunities ahead for us to further improve asset utilization and the efficiency of our network. For instance, we are leveraging technology to automate terminal functions and engineering renewal activities, increasing energy management utilization to improve fuel consumption, and developing car plan optimizers to reduce car touches.\nWhile these are just a few of the key initiatives, running a safe, reliable, and efficient railroad for all our stakeholders is vital. As we move forward, we will continue pushing the envelope in our pursuit of industry-leading safety, service, and operational excellence. With that, I'll turn it back to Jim.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThank you, Eric. Turning now to slide 15. Before we get to your questions, I'd like to quickly summarize what you've heard from our team. First, as you heard from Jennifer and Kenny, our volume outlook in some markets continues to be challenged. We are mitigating those challenges by driving efficiency in the network, which is driving stronger financial returns, and this provides confidence to start repurchasing shares in the Q2.\nKenny provided you with an overview of the Q1 volumes and laid out some updated thoughts for the year. Coal is going to be a headwind. It is what it is. We need to outperform what our markets give us naturally to offset that impact. If we provide the service we sold our customers, I'm confident they'll grow with us. It's also imperative that we generate pricing for the value we're providing our customers.\nLastly, Eric walked you through the progress we're making across safety, service, and operational excellence. When I look at how we're performing, I see improvement across the board. The network is operating fluidly and efficiently, allowing us to meet the demand in the market. That drove the financial success as you saw here in the Q1. There's certainly more to do, but we're on the right path.\nAt the end of the day, we're demonstrating continuous improvement, getting a little better each day. In the long run, our focus on being the best across the spectrum will generate sustainable long-term value for the years ahead. One final item for you all, a save the date. We are planning an Investor Day on 18 September and 19 September in Dallas, Texas. More details to follow, but we're excited to lay out more of our vision to demonstrate what's possible for this great company of ours. With that, Rob, we're ready to take on some of the questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you'd like to ask a question, please press star 1 on your telephone keypad, and the confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star 2 if you'd like to remove your question from the queue. For participants who are using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. In the interest of time, so we may accommodate as many analysts as possible. We would ask everyone to please limit themselves to one question. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nVP and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. It seems like the operations are working pretty well. Jim, I'd like you to maybe talk about kind of what you're doing with Kenny and his team to start focusing on growth that may be different or hasn't been done at UNP in the past. We know there's been a couple of the joint services with the CN and the Falcon and stuff like that. You know, internally in terms of, you know, focusing the team on. More business development efforts, can you just kind of talk to us a little bit about what kind of changes you're making or what kind of initiatives you're emphasizing to start driving a little bit more growth on the network?\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nYou bet. David, thanks for the question and good morning. I'll just summarize real quick what we're doing, and then Kenny, maybe you want to get into a little bit more of the specifics. If we look at what we're doing on the railroad side, and that's very important in how we're going to be able to grow and grow with our customers is our customers. Some customers we have expect speed and resiliency in the model, and others it is speed is less of a concern. It is consistency in the model. If you take a look at what we're doing, we are building the functionality fundamental blocks that we are able to provide a service like no one else. We're out there selling it.\nIn the high-speed market-to-market, we have a service that operates very high speed, 2,000 mi in less than two days, that makes us competitive against other modes of transportation. If we look at the consistency, we want our customers to win, and the best way for us to grow is with the customers that we have.\nWhether it's the automobile business that we handle, whether it's the export business that we handle, whether it's in the Gulf, whether it's our access into Mexico and our interchanges with the other railroads and how we can originate, and we all win together. We're doing all of that. I'm spending, Eric might say he wishes I would spend more time on some other things, so I still look at the operation; it's still there. I think there's a lot more that needs to be delivered.\nWhen you do an analysis, and the way I like to do a regression analysis on what the operation is like, I'm comfortable. There's more to do, and the pressure's on to be more consistent and faster and be able to deliver better service products. We do that, we win. I've also spent a lot of time with Kenny and his team and myself personally, meeting with customers, understanding what they need, to win our present customers and future customers. I think we continue down this path with consistent service.\nThe value that we can provide the customers for them to grow is such that they want a partner partner with UP, and we want to partner with them because we want our customers to win. I really like where we are. If we can keep this consistency, David, going, which I'm very confident we can, then I think, Kenny, I hate to tell you it should be pretty easy for you to grow the business and away you go all.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nRight. Look, David, you hit it on the head. You know, what are we doing differently? I just want to talk to you about some of the product development that Eric and I and our teams are doing together. You look at the Phoenix ramp; we're excited about it. We're seeing that volume come in there and grow sequentially. It just gives our customers and the BCOs more optionality.\nPort of Houston is one. You know, we put that service back on. We've been excited about the growth that we've seen come out of there, and we'll continue to add on to the destinations that are there. We started off with five; now we're at 11. You look at Inland Empire; we just added on a new product there.\nNow we're going to 20 cities east of Chicago with the CSX and the NS on the unit train side because we are seeing the cycle times improve. We're naturally getting more volume. We like that piece on the finished vehicle side. You talk about product development, business that's coming off of the water, that's getting land bridged, that we're moving back east. Look, this lower cost that we have really opens up new markets for us at great margins. We're on offense. I mean, we're pushing every lever we can to get business onto our network. We got a beautiful franchise as Jim mentioned, and we're taking advantage.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nDavid, thank you very much. Thanks for the question.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nVP and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nQuestion. All right, thank you. If I could maybe squeak one quick follow up. How's the FXE performing with the extra volume? I know south of the border there's been a lot of shift over under that. Then are you thinking about sort of expanding capacity over the Eagle Pass gateway to maybe accommodate future growth out of Mexico?\nDavid, real quick, I've spent a lot of time. I think I've made like eight or nine trips down to Mexico already in the eight months I've been here, working very closely with FXE. With our ownership position in them, we know where the points of concern are. FXE has done a good job of identifying what they have to do, and I think they run a good service product. They're going to continue with the same goal as we have to strive, and we're working together on it. In fact, a couple weeks, I'm going to ride a train head end of a freight train down on the FXE to take a look at their railroad. Even more, the border.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nWe have processes in place to make it easier for our crews to not stop right at the border and get trains across, which just makes sense just like between Canada and the US at International Falls. We are in the process of cleaning up those items that limit the speed and the efficiency for our customers, customers to get across the border. I'm very happy to see where we are and we're trying to work as one railroad.\nYou know, I don't like to give other railroads my excess locomotives and you can, you can understand why I don't have to explain it. We have provided FXE some locomotives to make sure that they can move the traffic that's out there and they've seen a large growth. Their number is, I'll let them give you the exact number, but we see growth in Mexico both northbound and southbound, and that's a market. We want to use those six touch points. We have to get into Mexico and optimize it for Union Pacific.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nVP and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nThank you\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your.\n\nJustin Long\n\nFinancial Analyst, Stephens\n\nQuestion. Thanks and good morning. It was good to see the OR improve a little bit sequentially, despite the typical seasonality that you see, and in the outlook. You talked about profitability gaining momentum, but can you help us translate that into how you're expecting the OR to trend over the balance of the year? It seems like we're tracking toward the sub 60 the rest of 2024, but is there anything on the horizon that could prevent that from happening?\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nExcuse me. Thanks. Justin, we are not providing any guidance, so I'm not going to comment on your number, but I think the way that you're describing it in terms of what we expect from ourselves is to continue to make improvement. You heard Jim talk about the fact that we made good gains, but there's more to do, and that's really our focus is to continue to do that quarter-over-quarter to make gains.\nObviously we're doing that in an environment that we can't control. We control a lot of things, especially about our service product and our cost structure and how we go into the market and how Kenny and his team are pricing. We are doing that against an economic backdrop that's a little uncertain. We don't know what's going to happen with interest rates yet. Those are the things that do have an impact on us, including fuel prices. Just stay tuned. We feel really good about the setup and are very confident about our ability to perform.\n\nJustin Long\n\nFinancial Analyst, Stephens\n\nOkay, great. Thanks.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Amit Malhotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your.\n\nAmit Malhotra\n\nBusiness Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nQuestion. Thanks, operator. Hi everybody. Congrats on the strong results. Eric, obviously you and the team have done a phenomenal job with the operations and the metrics. We've kind of been stuck in this 155,000-ish seven-day carload number. I'd be curious to get your confidence and perspective on how much more you can handle when Kenny gives you that to handle, how you feel comfortable about moving 5 to 10,000 more carloads per week.\nYou can talk about that, and then just Jennifer, related to that question that was just asked. The weather gets better from Q1 to Q2. You move more industrial core loads. It's a pretty meaningful advantage as you move from Q1 to Q2. If you can just talk about any. Fuel, I think fuel noise moderates a little bit. If you can just talk about, you know, anything that I'm missing there. As we think about from Q1 to Q2, that might be on the negative side of the ledger.\n\nEric Gehringer\n\nEVP Operations, Union Pacific\n\nGood. I'll start with Amit. Thank you very much for that question. Now I want to be really clear right off the bat. We have the capacity to be able to handle more than 155,000 carloads. What brings us tremendous confidence is when you think about the five critical resources that we have, we clearly have enough terminal capacity, we clearly have enough mainline capacity.\nMore specifically we've talked about in the past and continue to maintain a buffer in our crew base, we have a couple hundred extra crews spaced across the system that are available. As to your point, when that volume comes on we have the crews. Locomotives, in my prepared comments I said that over the last 12 months we been able to store 500 locomotives due largely because of the increased fluidity in the system. Those are available to us.\nAs Kenny brings more volume to the railroad, we don't have to wait a week, we don't have to wait 30 days. They're parked across the system available to us. Then of course on the car side we have cars not only spaced across the system that we call at the ready cars, but we actually have been working with customers in which we're storing cars right at their facilities.\nThe moment they're ready to give us that load, we're ready to pick it up. Now when you think about capacity, the final thing you have to think about is the work that we do on train length. We talk often about driving volume variable approach to how we operate the railroad. Train length is one of the ways we do it. A 300ft improvement in our manifest quarter versus same quarter last year.\nThat's a huge lift. That's a massive accomplishment by the team. Building train length in the manifest network is one of the hardest, hardest things we do. What that tells you is if we're really good at the hardest things we do, as the intermodal volume starts to come back, we don't have to add train starts on. We can take some of the latent capacity we have on our existing train starts and utilize it so we're.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nReady. Amit, the only thing I would add is, and you know, I've never given guidance on operating ratio because it's a result of how you operate the railroad, and that's real important, we'll do a 60.1%. Last quarter with where the volumes were, what we did with price, and what we did with efficiency on the railroad, that's a pretty good number. It's okay in the way I look at the world. Some people would say it's excellent. I go, it's pretty good. I see moving us forward.\nUnless we get surprised, Kenny does his job properly, and we are able to return the proper price because of the great service and the product that we're delivering, and we continue to operate the railroad efficiently, and numbers underneath and numbers that people don't see every day that I look at make me very comfortable that we have a clear view of how we become more productive down at the ground level in this railroad, driving decision making closer to the people that need to make the decision, and not trying to do it here in Omaha and the headquarters. Amit. I'm not going to give a number, but I'm comfortable with where we're headed in the long term for Union Pacific.\n\nAmit Malhotra\n\nBusiness Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay, very clear. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Jonathan Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please receive your question.\n\nJonathan Chappell\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank. You. Good morning, Jim. I was going to ask just kind of where you left off in January. You kind of admitted somewhat modestly that it would be difficult to improve the margin without a volume tailwind. Here you are with 200 basis points of core improvement with volumes down year-over-year. What was the, I guess, change in the last couple months? Eric touched on a lot of things, but how are you able to make such a huge improvement in such a short period of time? What's your comfort in the sustainability of that when you actually do get a volume tailwind in the network?\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nWell, let's start with the end of the question. I love volume and I love revenue. At the end of the day, that's really important to us to be able to drive it forward. What we've done is we worked hard, hard. It looks easy sometimes to operate a railroad and especially as complicated as the Union Pacific network is, because it is complicated. It's not a linear railroad. It's very, very spread out in the way it operates. I think we're focusing the people at the right level. We're doing the right things when it comes to the expense side and headcount and everything that's involved in it, making sure that we don't impact service. I think we did a great job of it and I can see us improve in every one of those.\nSo Kenny's going to deliver, Eric's going to deliver, and the rest of us are going to make sure that we do everything we can possible to make sure that this company moves ahead. Because if we can have better margins, it opens up markets to us, even more markets than what we have today. That is the end game, and you basically have asked me what our strategy is and I'm looking forward to delivering it in the next couple of years.\n\nJonathan Chappell\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks Jim.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nMorning. Hey, good morning, Jim. Congrats to the team on some great results in a tough volume environment. I wanted to dig into maybe flipping Amit's question a little bit on the other side. You know, you've been focused on these operations for eight months now. I want to understand if there's more room to run. Right. You're getting service to where you want, but maybe is there continued ability to pull out locomotives and cars as you continue to get more efficient?\nMaybe just give kind of some examples of. Eric talked about increasing train length. Isn't there ability to go further before the volumes come online? PSR typically is you focus on improving the service and then you get the ability to pull out the equipment and employees as you move forward. Maybe just talk about the opportunity to keep doing.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, listen, great question. I'm going to get Eric to talk about how he sees and what's moving forward in Canada, but let me just summarize. The way I like to look at things is, you always try to optimize the network operationally and look for ways to be able to drive efficiencies in the network. The base plan always is what did we sell the customers? What did we tell the customers we're going to deliver?\nMake sure that that's the base plan. From that you build it up so we see improvements not only in train length, we add a few more cars on every train. That's very efficient in the network. It allows us to have better capacity. We also look at how we handle the terminals, touch points in the cars, how can we forward the cars without touching them for a longer distance.\nThe next piece for us is how fast we can react our train plan so that it takes us way too long right now, Ken, to be able to adjust our train plan so that we still provide the service that we sold. We have tools in place and we're developing them even further that allow us to change our plan in a much shorter period of time, in a few days or a week versus weeks so that we can optimize the railroad even more. Very excited about that and I see that as being a positive step. Eric, Kenny, anything to.\n\nEric Gehringer\n\nEVP Operations, Union Pacific\n\nI'll start building off of that. Ken, to Jim's point, when you look at our quarterly performance from a dwell perspective and we have a 5% improvement in our car dwell during the quarter, that's a full half of one hour off of every car on the Union Pacific. That's how we are able to move the cars faster. Now when you think about that, going beyond that to Jim's point about being agile, we took out 4,000 touch points just in the Q1 as we looked for more and more ways to be able to modify the transportation plan to move the cars faster.\nNow you build off of that and you start to get to the fundamentals of the railroad. The improvements we've made in recrew rate, there's still opportunity there. Certainly our investments in the technology both with RCO as well as MobileNX, that's about getting more productive in the yards. Even when we think about the brake person deal that we signed last year that we spoke about working to ensure that we've capitalized on all those opportunities. We've talked about locomotives, 500 already out.\nWe see more opportunities. You hit on train length to start with your question but also sometimes things we don't talk about are purchased services. We made great progress as Jennifer reported in the quarter on purchased services. We did that from everything from maximizing the material movement using trains instead of trucks to how many vehicles we have on the railroad. You've seen what our headcount has done over the last year. We've aligned our fleet from a vehicle perspective to that to about 600 vehicles coming out.\nEverything's in play right now, Ken. We look at it every single day. We work through it every single day. The biggest thing that we're looking for is how do we ensure that we make meaningful changes that not only improve our service product, but also make us safe while we drive financial success.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nAnything to add?\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nWe talked about the efficiency. It shows up in the product development that we talked about. It shows up in all these small, discrete things like adding more cars right at the customer's plant and asking for more business by customer, by plant.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nPerfect. Thank you very much. Thanks for the question, Kenny.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks, Jim. Thanks guys. Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shankar with Morgan Stanley. Please receive your question.\n\nRavi Shankar\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks. Morning everyone. ,3.5% price mix number in Q1. How do you think about that over the course of the year? Obviously puts and takes on the macro, truck pricing, et cetera, and some movements in the mix side as well. How do you think that number evolves?\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nWe're probably not going to give you a number, Ravi, which isn't going to surprise you, but I'll let Kenny talk to the markets. Just from a mix perspective. With Intermodal probably staying weak through most of the year, that probably is going to give us the ability to have some positive mix within our business, as we think about that for the rest of the year. Kenny?\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nYeah. I've been very encouraged and proud of the commercial team and the conversations that they're having with customers on price, articulating the inflationary pressures that are there and working with those customers to price to the market, taking a little bit more risk to price that business. At the end of the day, our service product has improved, as you can see in the results. We're talking to our customers about that and aligning that with the capital investments we're making. It's not a coincidence or by luck. We are having very deliberate conversations with our customers.\n\nRavi Shankar\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nUnderstood. I guess a super quick follow up kind of , I think you said in other revenue there was a contract settlement, and there's a claim settlement, and other expenses as well, is that the same one or are there two different one? Thank you.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nThose are two different ones, Ravi, thanks\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThank you very much, Ravi.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your Question\n\nBrian Ossenbeck\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHey, good morning, Jim. Morning team. Just wanted to kind of follow on that last question from Ravi. In terms of just the mix, it sounds like it's getting better from here. Maybe Kenny, you can give us some color in terms of the pace of renewals as it was always going to take a bit of time to touch the rest of the business and services helping with that momentum. It'd be helpful to hear that. Then just secondarily, similarly on the labor agreements and coal, like, are both of those, is the coal network right sized, the biggest drop you've seen right now?\nThere's a little bit more to do. On the labor side, you obviously had some new agreements to adjust for as well.Just trying to figure out where those three things stand in terms of where they are now and sort of looking the rest of the year. Thanks very.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nMuch. Yeah, I'll start off. Thanks for the question. You know, I said this back in January. It's not like we woke up 1 January and started deciding that we needed to have these deliberate conversations with customers. These started well early last year, and we've shared this. We can touch close to half of our price annually. The other half is in multi-year deals. I touched on it a little bit about the deliberate conversations that we have and the risk that's out there. Then I'll talk about a couple markets.\nYou know, you look at domestic intermodal, those spot markets. If you look at it here where we stand today, they're the same that they were from a spot market perspective last year. This has been a long time. Same thing on the contracted rates. Those contract rates have been where they are for a long time, over eight months. The good thing, if you're an optimist like I am. You know, you're at the trough, but the thing you don't know is when things will improve or get better.\nWe're not in a position where we're going to forecast that they when that will happen. What I will tell you, and I talked about the product development already. We're prepared, we're ready, we're working with Eric's team, and we're bringing on more volume that comes on, and so we'll see what happens there. I can tell you that we're prepared and excited.\n\nEric Gehringer\n\nEVP Operations, Union Pacific\n\nBrian, to your question about crews on the coal lines. Every single week we review every board across the system and we're looking, just as you pointed out, for changes in the market that shows up on increased or reduced demand. We've made adjustments, we'll continue to make adjustments. It reminds me to make sure that we remind ourselves a year ago we were talking to all of you about 200, 250 borrow outs, couple across the system, for the third month in a row we have zero borrow outs across the entire system.\nNow that doesn't mean that with some seasonal adjustments to some business like grain harvest we might put some out there. It's a massive accomplishment I give the team credit for because they've been able to manage the crews in a way that we don't have any borrow so agility all day long.\n\nBrian Ossenbeck\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nThanks very much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nYes. Hi. Morning. You've alluded to this a few times this morning. You know, productivity and cost takeout certainly seem better than we would have had in our model, particularly in areas such as PT, which you have alluded to as well as the rents. Can you maybe talk some of the sustainability of the current trend line, because it was quite a bit of a delta versus what we've seen lately, as we move forward from here.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, Jordan, thanks for that question. I think you're right, you're hearing a lot of positivity by the team because we know that there are more opportunities, and first it's building the momentum, it's sustaining the momentum, and then keeping the costs out. If you think about equipment rents, that really is all about continuing to drive the car velocity, continuing to drive the cycle time, and the dwell that Eric referenced.\nThose are directly impacting that line, and then purchased services. Certainly the locomotive fleet is a big part of that. As we continue to use our locomotive fleet more productively and reduce those numbers, that's an opportunity to sustain and potentially improve there as well as across the rest of the contract services that we use as we're being smarter and looking deeper at every dollar that we're spending.\nThat's been one of Jim's messages to the team: you know, when you're looking at the resources, spend the dollars like your own and make sure that it's a wise dollar that's being spent and that you're getting the appropriate return for it. Feel good about continuing to make progress.\n\nJordan Alliger\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Question.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nMorning, Brandon.\n\nEric Morgan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, good morning. This is actually Eric Morgan on for Brandon. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask another one about mix. Appreciate the detail on the impact to yields, but was just curious if you could speak to any effects on margins just because with coal being down a big drag on volumes right now and international intermodal as well, should we be thinking these sort of mixed swings help to drive the strong or in the quarter or is it really just an RPU impact?\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, thanks for that question. You know, mix does help on the RPU. When we think about mix, there is some different mix in terms of the cost profile that's behind that. Our opportunity and our job is to improve the profitability of every line of business that we have.\nyou know, we are very proud of our manifest franchise. That's really, really our sweet spot for sure. As Eric talked, you know, intermodal, grain, coal, those are very profitable business for us as well. To the extent that we can drive greater train length. You know, I'm not going to say we're totally agnostic, but we want to grow, and we want to grow across all lines of business. I think if you see us do that, you're going to like the margins that come from that.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific",
    "content2": "You bet. You know, just to sort of summarize the way I look at the quarter and what we see moving forward. First of all, if you take a look at our results, our industrial, and that's what I love about Union Pacific is our industrial originations. The Mexico product that is non-intermodal, which gives us a different level of return and price capability, is strong, and that's what we want to see, and that's what helped us in Q1.\nI can't see that changing except I just don't know where the macro items are going to be in the short term in the US. I was hoping with all the products that we make that we ship and handle for people and consumers that I would have seen an interest rate cut in the next few months, and maybe it will happen later on this year. You know, an interest rate cut would help us in what people are spending on their homes from lumber and number of products.\nIf you take a look at where we are, and that's what I like, we leverage that franchise we have in the Gulf in originations in the middle of the heartland of United States. We always look for ways to improve our efficiency. We drive better return with whatever price we get out of the international and domestic business. You know, every time I see a train full of boxes, cars, and tank cars, it's music to my ears when those wheels roll by. Thank you very much.\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your Question.\n\nJeff Kauffman\n\nPartner and Transportation and Logistics Equity Research Analyst, Vertical Research Partners\n\nThank you very much, and congratulations this quarter, tremendous result. I wanted to take a step back. Question for Kenny. What are you seeing in terms of customer commitments to nearshoring or rebasing manufacturing and then in terms of coming back to the rail, your service metrics are up and clearly there's a flywheel effect there. What are your customers telling you they need to see? Those that maybe took business away before they would bring that business back.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, thanks for the question. On the nearshoring in Mexico, you've seen the announced investments that's there. We've got a strong commercial presence that's there. You look at the overall, you know, rail. I'm talking the rail industry, you know, market share, you know, into and out of Mexico is still relatively low. If you put it on the map, mid teens or so, our new service product that we have in place that's humming has been picking up steam and we've seen it grow. We've seen it grow in that north-south corridor. We've seen it grow in the traffic that we put on the new product that we put on going into the southeast. Tremendous growth there.\nThere's also more carload business that will come online and more plants that will come online, some of them for some of the autos that are going to come on and some just other, what I'll call, just industrial pieces. We're set up for that. We're engaging those customers. Our network strength and franchise gives us an opportunity to move a lot of that, both the feedstocks in Mexico and the finished product out of Mexico. Very strong place for us. The six gateways had a great quarter.\nComing into and out of Mexico and we want to build on that. As far as those customers coming back to us, you know, with every month that we are able to, you know, sustain and show a reliable product, we're able to capture a little bit more business. We're also able to sit down with them and talk to them about adding the one or two carloads, or talk to them about a truck lane piece, or talk to them about their rail versus truck by lane percentage. The strongest service product is certainly a positive for us. Our commercial team has been very aggressive out there hustling to get every car load.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThank you, Ken. Thanks for the question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Thomas Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nMorning, Tom.\n\nThomas Wadewitz\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nYeah, good morning. You know, nice performance on the OR and the network and everything, so congratulations on that. Wanted to just get a little more color. I think Jennifer or whoever else wants to jump in on the expense side. I know you've got a couple questions, but comp and benefits, how do we think about that going forward? Is headcount stable? Is, you know, is that go down a little bit?\nThen on the purchase services line, you know, kind of storing locomotives, cars, that's helpful, but is that, should we model that kind of flat looking forward or I guess you said there's a one-time where you didn't identify whether that's kind of small or meaningful.I think just from a modeling perspective and, you know, is there, is there kind of further improvement or how do we think about it sequentially on, you know, comp and benefits and purchase services? Thank you.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah. You bet, Tom. Let me start with the purchased services. I think I did say that the one-time item there accounted for about half of the year-over-year decrease. You should set that aside when you're thinking about rolling that forward. Again, as you heard me talk on another question, we still obviously think we have opportunities there if you switch to comp and benefits.\nThen back in January we said we, we thought that we would probably see about a 5% increase in that line for the year. We were at 4% here in Q1. Really kind of right on line there. I think, you know, the drivers, they're wage inflation, they're the sick pay benefits, you know, some higher guarantee pay offset by what we're doing to improve our overall productivity and how we're managing the headcount.\nWhen you think about those, you know, new contract benefits in terms of the sick pay, it's also, you know, when we're rolling out the work rest agreements, that is resulting in a little bit of an elevation in terms of our T and Y headcounts in anticipation of those benefits. Really the way to think about that is that we're paying a little bit more due to those agreements for the same unit of work. I think what's encouraging there is we're offsetting that with some of our productivity and that's our plan going forward.\n\nThomas Wadewitz\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThat kind of compound benefits line, probably stable, is the right way to look at.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, I mean, obviously if there's a significant change up or down from a volume perspective, that can have an impact. I think we feel like we're in a pretty good place right.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nNow, it's a great way to look at it, Tom, in the short term, see, in the next few quarters. The challenge, and one that we know that we have to tackle, is we have wage inflation. You deal with that. Absolutely. You have a great service product and you price properly. I think we're doing the right things there so that we don't impact our customers to the point where they can't win in the marketplace. Efficiency wise, if you look at how the number of cars we're switching per employee and everything that we're doing with technology.\nI'm very comfortable that we'll figure out a way to change that slope on that line on what it costs us and the number of people per car to be able to hand the business level that we're at. A little bit, it's a lot of hard work. I see over the next couple years for us to get back in line to where we were.\n\nThomas Wadewitz\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nOkay, great. Thanks for the time. Appreciate.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThank you. Thanks for the question\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is coming from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please receive your question.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nMorning, Bascome.\n\nBascome Majors\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Susquehanna\n\nGood morning. The owners of your Western competitor made some very public comments about really wanting more margin and profitability out of that business just a few months ago. Can you speak to if you've seen anything different in either how they approach the market or operate their business, and is or can that create opportunities for you to grow in the Midterm?\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nBascom, it's a great question. Did I like to hear that? Absolutely. Because I think we're in an industry where we provide for the price that we charge a very competitive and we beat most modes of transportation. I think you need to be smart on how you price, and I think you need to make sure that we provide the service for that price that we sold. We compete every day against our competitor, and we're here to win. Hopefully, they're prudent in the way they look at their markets, and I don't tell them what to do, they need to do theirs. We're very comfortable that we're doing the right things.\nI think head to head we'll put our complex and what we have, including the Mexico piece, and I think it gives us a great opportunity to compete, and you have to love it. Great competition against the great other railroad is a wonderful thing. I love it. Makes us better, makes the whole industry better. I love the comments, but we'll see what their actions are as we see them go down the road.\n\nBascome Majors\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Susquehanna\n\nThank you. Jim.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please receive your question.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nMorning, Scott.\n\nScott Group\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, thanks. Morning, guys. Jennifer, Kenny sounded a bit better on price. I know, last quarter you talked about price cost as a margin headwind for the year. I'm just wondering, are we getting any closer to that becoming a tailwind? Right. If we can combine some of the productivity stuff with price cost, the margins could get pretty good. I just don't know if we're getting closer to that inflection yet. Then can you just clarify if we've seen the full impact of the coal RPU headwind from lower natural gas or if there's another step down coming there? Thank.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, I'll let Kenny take that coal question. You're hearing it right. We're putting a lot of pressure on Kenny and the team to go out there and deliver the price. They're very much stepping up to that and are taking on that challenge and being aggressive in the marketplace. Obviously we improved our margins in the quarter., so the combination of our volume, which was down a little bit, but price, and productivity is what's driving the margin improvement. I can't say that we're accretive yet from just a pure price inflation standpoint, but that absolutely is the goal. We are though, except just the dollars are exceeding the inflation dollars. We're still very confident of that, Kenny\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nI just want to reiterate what Jennifer said. We'll exceed our inflationary dollars on this coal question that you have. You know, we're looking at the same things you're looking at in terms of the natural gas futures, and we're talking to our customers. Similar to my comments around domestic intermodal.\nYeah, I think we're at the trough level. You know, when they will come up is yet to be seen. They're still depressed. We'll see if we get some seasonal lift here going into the spring and the summer. I want a hot, muggy summer so we can move more business. If that doesn't happen, we'll see what Eric and the team to do for us to efficiently move the coal business. Thank you for the question.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nI'm telling you, and I have to jump in on this one here. Kenny and team and everybody, coal is what it is. I said it in my prepared comments on purpose. We have other markets that are going to take care of that coal business. It's tough to replace the number of trains that we originate. We used to originate a heck of a lot more than we do today, and we need to be able to grow it so we can hope. I'm not into hope. I mean, let's go out there, deliver, have the right processes, have the right things possible, and we go deliver and we win. I've spoken about our franchise a few times on this call. That's what allows us to win.\nWe provide good service and will more than offset anything that happens over the long term. With coal, it is what it is. I don't see it coming back to a large level that will change us. It might do it for a short-term, but that's the way I look at it and that's the way the team here at Union Pacific is. We're going to win regardless of what happens to one commodity that we ship.\n\nScott Group\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you, guys.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nYou're welcome. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nGood morning.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nHi. Good morning. Yes, thank you. You know, Jim, really nice progress here across safety and service. In terms of customer engagement, post these improvements, what are you hearing from customers? Are you seeing engagement accelerate at all? Kind of, what's the opportunity from here? Then maybe on the flip side, I'd love to hear, have you noticed any challenges to the network? Maybe revenue holes looking to fill that were maybe less apparent? Love to hear your thoughts. Thank you.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nYou know, it's a great question. I think it was when I came back to work. A lot of people thought that the only thing I'd concentrate on is operations. I have been spending some time there. I have spent a lot of time speaking to customers. I did it the first week I was on the job. I followed up with them. I've gone to meetings when we bring them in, our industrial, our bulk, and our premium business.\nThe feedback is they want us to win and they see themselves winning in the marketplace if Union Pacific can be successful in what our strategy is. The feedback has been positive. There's always some markets and some customers that we have to truly understand what their impacts are and where they are because we want them to survive and win. We're doing everything we can. Maybe Kenny, you can speak a little bit more about our engagement and what we're doing with.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nCustomers. Yeah, you know, if you look at it so far this year, our face-to-face meetings, strong customer engagement strategies, we have a lot more, significantly more contacts with customers, and we're touching them in different ways. One of the unique strategies that we have, as I'm looking at Eric, you know, 1/3 of our meetings have an operating leader or local operating person that's there, and we're doing that to see how we can grow more business specifically. Strong customer engagement strategy at all levels, and we're going to keep at it. Thanks for the question.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Elliott Alper with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question\n\nElliot Alper\n\nVP of Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nGreat, thank you. This is Elliott on for Jason Seidel. My question is on international intermodal. The outlook calls for pretty muted international intermodal for the year. I guess would appreciate some more context around that. I mean, understand there was a customer loss that you called out last quarter. We've seen some strong volumes coming out of the West Coast ports, I guess. Should we continue to think about that continued acceleration on the West Coast mostly offset, or could there be some upside if the strength on the West Coast Continues?\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nElliott, thanks for the question. A few things here. Let's set aside the, you know, contract loss you referenced. It's been strong. International intermodal has been strong for us. A little bit of a pleasant surprise for us that we've been able to capitalize on it. We're seeing more IPI business or business that's going into our network increase by a few points.\nWe are aware that there has been a small impact on the positive side because of some of the challenges with the Panama Canal. We'll see what happens if some of the BCOs are a little bit more concerned with any labor issues on the East Coast. As we go through Q2, I feel pretty good about those volumes staying where they are as we talk to our customers in their pipeline.\nI'd like to see as we move a few weeks out what happens in the second half of the year. I'm not ready today here in April to bet on what's going to happen the second half of the year. The last thing I'll end with, and I've said this quite a bit, I do like the fact that regardless of what happens at the West Coast, we're preparing for if it does get transloaded more products for it to get to the East Coast that I talked about, those 20 cities that will move with the NS and the CSX, our Phoenix product, and us being holistically and leveraging the entire franchise to go after more business out of the Port of Houston. Thanks for your question.\n\nElliot Alper\n\nVP of Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nYeah, thank you very much.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is in the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\n\nWalter Spracklin\n\nDirector of CDN Research and Co-Head Global Industrials Research, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThanks very much. Hey Jim, how are you doing? I want to take a little bit of a bigger picture on the competitive environment and how you interact with your competitors both east and west. When we were attending a recent session with the Norfolk Southern management, they called out the CPKC, CSX as an actual alliance. Just curious whether you see yourself as naturally being able to cooperate, coordinate operations to bring a more effective higher service. Product to your customers.\nYou know, is there one company in particular or that you could align a little bit closer with, given the network Interplay between the companies? Just curious what you're thinking about longer term. In the absence of acquisitions or mergers, could there be increased cooperation that allows you to bring a higher service to the Customer?\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nWalter, I appreciate the question and good morning. You have to think about it, that 40% of the traffic that we either originate or receive starts somewhere else, so when you put that number in perspective, we can't be choosy and say that we'd rather partner with one Eastern railroad or one Canadian. I guess I can't call CPKC or CN Canadian railroads anymore. I apologize to both of them.\nInternational railroads and what we need to do and all the short lines that we touch, the way I look at it is what is the best and the fastest and the quickest. If we're all efficient, we all have good service, we all are smart in running a very fluid railroad that has buffer to be able to handle the ups and downs that naturally occur. Walter, we all win.\nI don't have a preference. Now I love it that we get to compete with some of them, and we say, you know, we originate lots of many cars, and we say to them which one wants the business? Is it CSX or NS, or is it CN or CP? I think we compete on some, but when we work together, which we are, we have. We've had very detailed meetings with CPKC, with CN, with NS, and with CSX to talk about on that interline business.\nHow do we make those interchanges fluid so we don't spend 24 hours to interchange cars at some interchange when we go one way or the other. We can win and beat trucks, especially in that speed network that requires that kind of work. Walter, no preference. Best one wins.\nWe want to be able to tell people you want to interchange with us because then versus the other carrier in the West, the BNSF, because we have the best model, we're the fastest we can get the markets, and we move quick. Once we get there, because the customer looks at it end to end, how good are you at origination? Are you on time? How fast you get it over the road? That's why I look at the I don't look at train speed. It's an illogical measure on productivity on the railroad. I look at car velocity, and that's what's important. Hopefully I answered your question, Walter.\n\nWalter Spracklin\n\nDirector of CDN Research and Co-Head Global Industrials Research, RBC Capital Markets\n\nIt does. Thanks very much, Jim, and congrats on a great quarter.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nListen, Walter, thank you very much. Nice speaking with you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question is from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nBen, they left in good Morning.\n\nBen Nolan\n\nManaging Director of Research, Stifel\n\nWell, better late than never, As much as I know you guys don't want to talk about specific markets, one of the things that I've been hearing about lately a lot is more crude by rail. Kenny, I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on that. Is that something that you guys are seeing, and as you think about Sort of the outlook going forward, how needle-moving is that to the business?\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, thanks for the question. You heard my comments around our petroleum markets and business development wins there. It is a type of oil that we're moving that we're excited about and it's moving right now. Domestically, we've seen some strength. Eric's team has been able to help us grow a little bit of that business and get as much of it as we can. We don't see that, you know, kind of traditional crude by rail that we saw 10 years ago, but we're seeing another emerging commodity in the market that we're excited to be moving and it's going great for US.\n\nBen Nolan\n\nManaging Director of Research, Stifel\n\nAll right. I appreciate it. Thanks for fitting me in.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThank you very much. Rob, just let me know if that was the last question. Let me just summarize real quick because I think there's a few key points that I want to make sure that.\nWe highlight one: I think the last two quarters have shown what's possible for this railroad. That's real important to us, is what's possible. We will have headwinds. You know, we have a wage increase coming 1 July. That's a headwind. We have certain segments of our business that are down and can be up, and others that are up that are going to impact us.\nThe way we look at it, and I'm so proud of this entire team and the entire railroad, if you look at what we're doing is we're making ourselves more efficient. We're driving decision making to the right level. We're providing service that we sold our customers at a high level, and the franchise that we have and the network that we have gives us every possibility to win in the long-term.\nThat's the goal I'm looking forward to in September. Deep diving what we look like in the next two or three years, have a longer term plan for everybody. I'm sure I'm going to run into some of you before. Otherwise looking forward to the next quarter that closes. April is a great start with where our carloads are, and this is a great railroad, great franchise, and I'm looking forward to moving it forward. Thank you very much for joining us today.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

If anyone should require operator assistance during the conference, please press zero from your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jim Vena, Chief Executive Officer for Union Pacific. Mr. Vena, you may now begin.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThanks, Rob. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Union Pacific's Q4 and full year results. I'm joined in Omaha by our Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Hamann, our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales, Kenny Rocker, and our Executive Vice President of Operations Eric Gehringer. The Union Pacific team is executing our multi-year strategy to lead the industry in safety, service, and operational excellence. Our Q4 shows a lot of what's possible and demonstrate that we're on the right path to achieving those goals. We exited 2023 with strong momentum, which gives me great confidence that we have a\nwinning strategy. There's work to do, but we're building the foundation for future success. Now let's turn to slide three. This morning Union Pacific reported 2023 Q4 net income of $1.7 billion or $2.71 per share.\nThis compares to the 2022 Q4 net income of $1.6 billion, or $2.62, or $0.07 per share. Q4 operating revenue was flat as increased volumes and core pricing gains were offset by lower fuel surcharge revenue. Revenue and business mix expenses year-over-year were also flat as lower fuel expenses and productivity gains were offset by inflation, volume-related costs, and higher casualty expenses. Our Q4 operating ratio of 60.9% improved 10 basis points versus last year, and more importantly, we demonstrated strong sequential improvement of 250 basis points from the third quarter. We are taking the right\nactions to increase the efficiency of our railroad while also improving service for our customers. Key to our strategy is excelling in what we control. We made great progress in those areas this quarter.\nThat provides further proof that we're on the right path to future success. With that, let me hand it over to Jennifer to provide more details on the Q4 and full year financials.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nThanks Jim and good morning. Let's begin by walking through our Q4 income statement on Slide five. Starting with the top line, operating revenue.\nOf $6.2 billion was flat versus 2022.\nOn a 3% volume increase. Breaking it down further, freight revenue totaled $5.8 billion, up 1%. The biggest driver of freight revenue in the quarter was fuel. Lower year-over-year fuel prices reduced fuel surcharge revenue and impacted freight revenue 375 basis points, as fuel surcharges declined $180 million versus 2022 to $795 million. Volume growth in the quarter contributed positively, adding 350 basis points to freight revenue, and the combination of price and mix also was positive, increasing freight revenue 75 basis points, as solid core pricing gains were mostly offset by an unfavorable business mix. Intermodal shipments up 5% contributed\nheavily to the mix dynamic, wrapping up the top line. Other revenue decreased 13%, driven by lower accessorial and subsidiary revenue switching to expenses.\nWe provided expense details for Q4 and full year in our appendix slides, but let me hit some of the highlights against our 3% volume growth. Operating expense of $3.8 billion was flat. Digging deeper into a few of the expense lines, compensation and benefits expense was.\nFlat compared to 2022.\nQ4 workforce levels decreased 2% while our active TY workforce was flat against the 3% volume growth. This solid level of workforce productivity mostly offset wage inflation as cost per employee only increased 1% in Q4. Fuel expense in Q4 decreased 11% on a 15% decrease in fuel prices from $3.70 per gallon to $3.16. Our fuel consumption rate deteriorated 3% as we moved a less fuel efficient business.\nMix with increased intermodal shipments and fewer coal moves.\nFinally, other expense grew 20% as a result of higher casualty costs and the comparison to 2022, which included insurance recoveries. Coming out of COVID, we had a sizable case backlog that we largely worked.\nThrough the last couple of years.\nImportantly, we do not see these elevated expenses as a reflection of a long term trend, particularly with our intense focus on improving Q4, operating income was flat at $2.4 billion below the line. Other income increased $16 million due to higher real estate Q4 net income of $1.7 billion and earnings per share of $2.71 both.\nImproved 1% versus 2022.\nOur operating ratio of 60.9% improved 10 basis points year-over-year and 250 basis points sequentially, moving to slide six with a quick recap of full year 2023 results. Revenue of $24.1 billion declined 3%, driven by reduced fuel surcharges, business mix, and lower volumes partially offset by core pricing gains. Operating income totaled $9.1 billion, and our full year operating ratio of 62.3% deteriorated 220 basis points. Earnings per share of $10.45 decreased 7% versus 2022. Reflecting the impact of our overall financial results, return on invested capital declined 180 basis points to 15.5%. Turning to shareholder returns and the balance sheet on slide seven,\nfull year 2023 cash from operations totaled $8.4 billion, down roughly $1 billion from 2022. The combination of lower net income and nearly $450 million of labor agreement payments were the main drivers. Free cash flow and our cash flow.\nConversion rate also reflected those impacts.\nWe returned $3.9 billion to shareholders in 2023 through dividends and share repurchases. Our adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio finished the year at 3x as we continue to prioritize a strong balance sheet and be A-rated by our three credit agencies. While 2023 was a difficult year, I'm pleased with the progress we've made over the last several months to improve our service and productivity. We believe this performance marks an inflection point as efforts to improve the efficiency of our railroad through safety, service, and operational excellence is starting to be reflected in our financials. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Kenny to provide some comments on 2023\nand kick off our commentary on 2024.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nThank you, Jennifer, and good morning. You just heard from Jennifer that freight revenue was up 1% in the quarter as our volume gains of 3% were partially offset by lower fuel surcharges. So let's jump right into the business teams to recap the market drivers on the revenue side, starting with bulk revenue for the quarter, which was flat compared to 2022, driven by a 3% increase in volume offset by a 2% decrease in average revenue per car. Core pricing gains were more than offset by lower fuel surcharges and the unfavorable impact of low natural gas prices on our index-based coal contracts. Fertilizer shipments grew compared to 2022 as\ndemand for fall application was strong due to lower nitrogen prices.\nGrain product shipments were up for the quarter as our team secured new feedstock opportunities for renewable diesel production in Louisiana and California. Additionally, ethanol shipments increased with our improved service. Lastly, coal continued to be challenged in the Q4 due to mild weather and decreased coal competitiveness from low natural gas prices. Industrial revenue was up 4% in the quarter driven by a 3% increase in volume. Core pricing gains in the quarter were mostly offset by lower fuel surcharges and a negative mix in volume. Business development in our petroleum and LPG commodity segments contributed to\nthe growth. Demand improved for our plastics business in both export and domestic markets. However, sand volumes were negatively impacted by softer natural gas prices that reduced drilling in the Eagle Ford Basin and increased utilization of in-basin sand in the DJ Basin.\nPremium revenue for the quarter was down 3% on a 4% increase in volume and a 7% decrease in average revenue per car from lower fuel surcharges and truck market pressures. Automotive volumes were negatively impacted by the UAW strike, but those decreases were mostly offset by dealer inventory replenishment and business development wins that I mentioned on last quarter's call. Intermodal volumes were positive in the quarter driven by stronger West Coast imports, domestic business development wins, and strength in our Mexico volumes. Now let's start talking about 2024. Here are some key economic indicators that we're watching\nthis year on slide 10. These are S&P's forecast from their January report, and you'll notice that it shows a mixed picture for 2024. Industrial production looks to be flat, housing starts are expected to remain challenged, but demand for autos continues to be strong.\nTurning to Slide 11, here is our 2024 outlook as we see it today for the key markets we serve, starting with bulk. We anticipate continued challenges in coal as natural gas futures remain volatile and inventories are high. Domestic grain is relatively stable, but we are keeping a watchful eye on export demand. On a brighter note, we expect fertilizer to be strong as repairs at Canpotex Portland facility are now complete and commodity prices remain competitive moving into the spring season. Growth within biofuels continues to be driven by strong demand outlook combined with a heavy focus on capturing new business, including incremental volumes\nsecured from Minnesota and Iowa origins. Moving on to industrial, the construction market will be challenged to exceed last year's record volumes as we're seeing softness in parts of the market.\nHowever, we foresee the petroleum and petrochem market remaining favorable due to our focus on business development.\nAnd finally for premium on the international intermodal side, we expect the market to improve year-over-year, but a contract we lost earlier in 2023 will negatively impact our 2024 volumes. On the domestic side, we are staying close with our customers, customers who have indicated that they'll see a soft start to the year. Nonetheless, our strong service product sets us up to handle market demand, and for automotive we will see strength in this market with improved OEM production and business development wins. In summary, the economic environment continues to look muted in 2024, particularly in the first half. We're off to a slow start in\nJanuary based on severe winter storms and market challenges we're seeing in coal and intermodal, but I am encouraged that we expect to see growth in some markets.\nWith our strong focus on business development for the second half, we are well prepared to handle the demand if the market and economy improves. We continue to make significant capital investments on both the carload and intermodal front to capture more freight over the road. Those investments, along with our unmatched service offerings and improved service products from Eric's team, create a winning environment for our customers. I'm excited for the opportunities in front of us and our commercial team is ready to help our customers win in the marketplace. And with that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance.\n\nEric Gehringer\n\nEVP of Operations, Union Pacific\n\nThank you, Kenny, and good morning. Moving to slide 13 to start, I want to express my appreciation to the team for their relentless focus on improving our service product and driving network efficiency. It's thanks to their efforts that our network showed tremendous fluidity and reliability during the Q4. Freight car velocity improved 14% to 217mi per day compared to Q4 2022. Increased train velocity and a reduction in terminal dwell drove that performance. Service was strong during the quarter as we saw a significant 12-point improvement in both Intermodal, Manifest, and Auto trip plan compliance. In addition to trip plan compliance,\nwe have hundreds of customer-specific performance metrics that also showed great improvement throughout the quarter. Most importantly, we are delivering the service we sold our customers, which is critical to our long-term growth strategy.\nWhile winter is here and has certainly brought its challenges, the railroad overall is very healthy, and I'm confident the team will continue its positive momentum. Safety continues to be the foundation of everything we do. During the quarter, we delivered improved derailment performance through our investments in technology and process. We remain focused on the critical actions that drive real change so everyone goes home safely each day. Now let's review our key efficiency metrics for the quarter on slide 14. During the Q4, we saw year-over-year improvement across all of our efficiency metrics. Locomotive productivity improved 14%\nversus Q4 2022 and 9% sequentially as we continue to identify and execute on opportunities to utilize the fleet more efficiently. Throughout the second half of 2023, we stored nearly 500 units from our operable fleet. Workforce productivity improved 4% compared to Q4 2022.\nWith a strong crew base, we are focused on effectively managing workforce levels to the demands of the business. However, challenges do remain from scheduled work agreements that in the near term require additional employees. Train length improved 2% compared Q4 2022 as we continue to remove car touch points from the system. In total, throughout 2023, we were successful in extending train length as improvements in second half 2023 more than offset the declines in intermodal shipments. We remain persistent in our focus on train length to drive productivity while providing a better service product to our customers. As\nwe move into 2024, we will continue to transform our railroad through a variety of technology initiatives and targeted capital investments designed to further improve safety, improve our service product, enhance resource utilization, and ultimately lower our cost structure.\nSo to wrap up, let's review our capital outlook for 2024 on Slide 15. We are targeting capital spending of $3.4 billion in 2024. Similar to 2023, we will support safe and productive operations by investing in our infrastructure and renewing our older assets. This includes modernizing locomotives and acquiring freight cars to support replacement and growth opportunities. We are also investing in technology, terminal, and mainline capacity projects to improve productivity. Specific to our technology investments, we recently cut over Net Control, replacing our 50-year-old transportation management system. This cutover positions us to use real-time\nanalytics to open new capabilities for Union Pacific and our customers. Great work led by our technology team.\nOn the growth front, we will continue to invest in projects that expand our intermodal footprint and support business development in targeted high growth areas such as Inland Empire, Kansas City, and Phoenix to name a few. With that, I'll turn it back to Jennifer to lay out our initial financial thoughts for 2024.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nThanks, Eric. Turning to slide 17, let me start by pointing out that we added a new appendix slide that contains several of the 2024 modeling assumptions that should be helpful to everyone in framing our current expectations. As you heard from Kenny, it's a difficult market to forecast as economic indicators show a muted and uncertain economy. Throw in a couple other variables such as what the Fed might or might not do with interest rates and a presidential election, and we've got an interesting year ahead. On top of the macro pressures, lower coal demand and some loss to international intermodal business are expected to negatively\nimpact our volume, and as you've seen in the weekly carload data, January is off to a slow start as cold temperatures across our system impacted operations and volume.\nWith Q1 volume down 9% year-to-date.\nI am confident, however, that our strong and improving service product will allow us to capture available demand. We clearly demonstrated that Q4 as we took advantage of the unexpected but short-term surge in intermodal. More certain in the economy is our expectation to generate pricing dollars in excess of inflation dollars even with ongoing headwinds from certain intermodal contracts. With those pressures, we do not expect price to be accretive to margins in this year. Key for UP in 2024 is our ability to control the controllables by driving a strong safety culture, making ongoing service gains, and improving network efficiency. We're\nconfident that regardless of the demand environment, we will take the necessary actions to run a more efficient network. Finally, with capital allocation there is no change to our long-term strategy.\nWe are investing $3.4 billion back into the railroad as Eric detailed. Next, we prioritize our industry-leading dividend payout, and then excess cash will be returned to shareholders through share repurchases. However, Q1 debt maturities of $1.3 billion, we will not be repurchasing.\nShares in the Q1.\nIt's always difficult in late January to make predictions for the year ahead, and this year is no different. There are clearly ongoing challenges from a macro and inflationary perspective. What is very encouraging though as we start out 2024 is our momentum, which you've heard us mention several times today. We demonstrated with our Q4 performance what's possible, and we look forward to further improvement in the year ahead. With that, let me turn it back to Jim.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThank you, Jennifer. Let's turn to slide 19 before we get to your questions. I'd like to quickly summarize what you've heard from our team. Kenny outlined our view on the upcoming year. Our volume outlook today reflects headwinds from lost business, coal demand, and relatively soft economic forecasts. Much of that is out of our control. We are mitigating these impacts through business development and value creation by providing great service to our customers. Eric described the progress we've made to return our service levels to industry best. While there's work to do, the team made consistent improvement through the quarter to exit in a very fluid state.\nObviously winter is here, but that's part of railroading. I judge our success by how we minimize the impact on our customers and how quickly we recover the network. So far, we've grown. We've shown great resiliency.\nFinally, as Jennifer laid out, our productivity and pricing gains will be key to overcoming ongoing inflationary pressures in 2024, as well as a soft economy. While many unknowns remain, I'm confident we'll succeed in the areas we can control. We've got plenty of opportunities this year to improve safety, service, and operational excellence. As you heard me say in October, I came back to Union Pacific to win. My vision and the opportunity I see for this company has not changed. We have the right team and strategy in place to grow this railroad long term, and I'm very confident we'll see a better Union Pacific in the future. We're now ready to take your\nquestions. Rob.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Mr. Vena. We'll now be conducting the question and answer session. If you'd like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad, and a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For those using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. Due to the number of analysts joining us on the call, today we'll be limiting everyone to one question to accommodate as many as possible. Thank you. And our first question today is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup.\nPlease proceed with your question.\n\nChris Wetherbee\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Citigroup\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning. Maybe if I could ask just sort of the outlook for 2024 as you sit here, it sounds like a muted macro environment is keeping you cautious. But I guess when you think about the opportunities that you have, can volume be up this year? I know some of the macro indicators that you highlighted are muted, but they are still positive. So curious about volume growth and I guess in that context with pricing maybe not necessarily being accretive to margin, is there enough of that volume and some of the cost efficiencies that you guys are working on to get margin expansion?\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nSo, Chris, maybe let me start and.\nThen Kenny can give you some more color.\nI mean, we're just not going to.\nGive you a number in terms of what we think can happen with volumes because of what you yourself said.\nThere's just a lot of uncertainty and.\nWe just don't think it's prudent sitting here at the end of January to give you some sort of a forecast based on hopes for a second half recovery. Do we hope that that will happen?\nAre we going to work diligently?\nTo move every piece of business that's there. Absolutely.\nI think you really saw what.\nThe network can do with Q4 performance.\nBut we just need to see a little more certainty, and hopefully that plays.\nOut through the year and we can provide that. But sitting here today, we just don't see that.\nCan you maybe talk about your marketing?\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nI talked about, talked about it in my opening comments. It's a mixed bag of opportunities that are in front of us. We feel really good about the biofuels market. That market is growing, demand is growing. We're capturing business in those markets. On the industrial side, we've had some, you know, a record year on the construction side, still be a strong year. But as we are coming out of the gate with weather, that's going to be a little bit challenge for us. We feel really good about our petrochem business and wins that we've had from a business development perspective on the petroleum and LPG side, those are all positive for us. You know, on our\npremium business, again, those are really economic driven. And so we'll be looking to see what happens with demand overall. I talked about the international intermodal side and the loss there.\nWe feel really encouraged by our ability to win on the auto side. You heard us talk about the Volkswagen win in last quarter. So there's a lot of demand there in the forecast for growth there. We really feel good about that market.\n\nChris Wetherbee\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Citigroup\n\nAnything on the margins?\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nI'm sorry?\n\nChris Wetherbee\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Citigroup\n\nMargins.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nOh, on margins. Again, I'm not.\nYou know, this might become a broken record.\nI hope not.\nBut I mean, we are not going.\nTo give specific guidance. I mean, we're going to do everything.\nWe can, as much as we can.\nAnd again, you saw what we did in the Q4. But every kind of other guidance I would give is going to be predicated on what I think is going to happen with volumes. And we just don't have that clarity.\nI don't think it's prudent to.\nDo that sitting here today.\n\nChris Wetherbee\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Citigroup\n\nGot it.\nThanks for the time. I appreciate it.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nChris. Let me just maybe just try to put this all into a box of the way we're thinking. It's very difficult for us to look forward and say this is exactly the way the year is going to go. More important to me and the team is what have we done operationally and what are we doing to provide Kenny and the entire team the capability to go out there and maximize what's available for us and what we can bring onto this railroad. And for me, that that's the single most important thing I think what we've shown is the capability to flex up. We have the assets to be able to flex up. We have the capacity to be able to flex up.\nIf we continue to drive the efficiency of the railroad, which I expect we will, then what we do is we win in the marketplace. Whatever's out there, we're going to compete against everybody else, trucks and other railroads. We think we have a winning model. That's the challenge we have. It would be truly, it would be a mistake for us to come out and say, I can't tell what's going to happen, like Jennifer pointed out with the inputs and the effects from interest rates and everything else that's happening in the economy. But I'm very comfortable that we are going to maximize what's available for Union Pacific and win.\n\nChris Wetherbee\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Citigroup\n\nOkay, that's helpful. Thanks. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\n\nWalter Spracklin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst of Transportation and Industrial Sector, RBC Capital Markets\n\nYeah, thanks very much. Operator. Good morning, everyone. On the intermodal side, I know there was a business loss there, but looking at some of the statistics in LA, Long Beach, there seems to be a really good uptick in volumes into those regions or that region.\nRed Sea impact, perhaps East Coast is down. Kenny Rocker, are you seeing that there is new business coming that way, and could that be a nice offset to any business loss, or could it create an opportunity for business win or more business wins as more volume shifts to LA, Long Beach, and perhaps the fluidity of LA, Long Beach, is that keeping pace with the new volume that's coming its way?\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nYeah. So thank you, Walter. We spent a lot of time looking at the global supply chains and the canals and so forth. I'll tell you right now, in the near term, we haven't seen any significant shift. We've been talking to our, the vessel carrier owners. We know they put in tariffs, our customers have put in tariffs to go over the Panama Canal, for example. And so we've been working with them to move as much as we can with the network that we have, with the matchback opportunities that we have, with the reload opportunities that we have, with the new products that we have with the Houston lanes that Eric has given us to give our customers every reason to go to\nthe West Coast. So what we have seen is we are seeing more going IPI.\nWe have a very efficient service network to accomplish that. We're happy about the customers that we have that have been able to grow in that market. And then finally, we have a great network where the service, we're able to capture that and get all of that business that's out there.\n\nEric Gehringer\n\nEVP of Operations, Union Pacific\n\nAnd I'd add too, Kenny, as we.\nThink about that, because to your point, you can't predict the future with entire clarity. It's another reminder, Walter, of the fact that when we talk about having a buffer and you look at what we did in the Q4, we generated the ability to make sure we have that buffer, that buffer in locomotives, that buffer in railcars positioned in L.A. So in the event the volume is there, we've supported Kenny's team to be able to actually capture it.\n\nWalter Spracklin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst of Transportation and Industrial Sector, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThe fluidity in the terminals right now, how would you assess that?\n\nEric Gehringer\n\nEVP of Operations, Union Pacific\n\nVery, very fluid. As you saw Q4, 14% improvement in car velocity doesn't count unless you've got very fluid operations. Now, to Jim's point, are there opportunities? Of course there are.\nIn fact, I'll talk about those as.\nWe go through this. But overall, right now, yes, very fluid.\n\nWalter Spracklin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst of Transportation and Industrial Sector, RBC Capital Markets\n\nAppreciate it.\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nScott Group\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning, guys. So, you know, it seems like you're framing this as there's things we can control and things we can't control. It strikes me that over time.\nThe industry's been able to have some control over price. You're talking about inflation up 5%, and right now yield ex fuel is only up 1%. It just seems we need more price.\nCan we get more price? I don't know. How do we think about that then? Can you just clarify this? International intermodal contract, when did we lose that? Because it sounds like it happened sometime in 2023, but we just. We're seeing really good intermodal growth. So I'm a little confused with why we're flagging this as such a big issue right now.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nThank you, Scott. I got both of those. Thank you. So first of all, you're exactly right. Prices are controllable. Let me make this clear. It's not like we jumped up here and waited till 1 January to look at price. We been going down this path here for a few months. You've heard Jennifer and I say that we have a set amount, call it almost half that we can touch from a pricing standpoint. Our commercial team has really been very effective, sitting down with customers, talking to them about the improved service product, talking to them about our increased inflationary pressures that we saw from the labor side and how Eric is leveraging that to improve the service products that\nwe give them. They're seeing the same input, they're seeing the same increases. I've been meeting with customers and so they know that.\nSo, yes, we control a portion of that. And so we've been very focused on articulating that story. I think you had a question on the international side and yeah, you're correct. We lost some of that earlier in the year, last year. The bulk of that will still be working through in 2024.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nBut just to your question, Scott, I think what Kenny's talking about with that loss, that kind of goes to our discipline when it comes to price and making sure that the business that's on our railroad is running at acceptable margins. Sometimes that doesn't happen and we might, might lose a piece of business.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, I mean, with the service product, with the investments that you heard Eric talk about this morning, the margins have to be acceptable to be on the network.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nWell, I hate to always recap these and I won't, but let me recap, Scott, for you. So inflation, when I was on the first call that I had in October, I was pretty clear that we are going to deal with the inflationary pressure that is presented for us that we have to tackle. And we're doing it two ways. We are dealing with it on the pricing side, and we're also dealing with it on the efficiency side. And I think we have a clear view this is not a short-term, three months, you can fix it on the pricing side. And even on the efficiency side, we've seen improvements in efficiency, and you can see that from the number.\nI think there's more available for us on the efficiency side from how we operate, our trains, the fluidity in the terminals, how we use our people. We did a really good job. The team did a fantastic job Q4 and I expect it to get better as we go through the year. Those two things we're tackling head on, we're not being shy about it, we're being straight. I've met with a lot of customers in groups and in small, and I've been clear about what the pressures are and what we're going to do about it moving forward. At the end, we want our customers to win in the marketplace, we want them to win. We're being smart about how we price and what level, and it's different\nfor different marketplaces and that's how we're handling that. I'm excited.\nI think we overcome this this year. By the end of the year, we'll see ourselves in a different position.\n\nScott Group\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nYeah, good morning. So, Jim, you've seen, you know, you realized a very fast and positive response in terms of the rail network operations since you've been at UP.\nWhere do you think you're at in terms of kind of further improvement? So I don't know if you want to look at like, you know, locomotives, what the active fleet is and where it can go to. Maybe if you could comment a little bit on headcount. I think that the headcount was down pretty meaningfully sequentially. So I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of kind of, you know, are we at the stable level now after that really quick improvement, or, you know, are headcount and active locomotive fleet going to have further steps down as we go into 2024?\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nWell, listen, thanks for the question. So the way I see it is this. I think there's more on the railroad to become more efficient. And the concentration is a little different than the last time I was here and a little different than what we just were able to do in the Q4. I think there's opportunity in speed and car velocity that will help us be able to move the rail cars faster, use a few less locomotives, and be able to keep the network more fluid. But the real big piece for us and what we're going to concentrate on, and we think there's a capability to be much better, is how fast we operate our terminals and the fluidity through the terminals to be able to have the products. Now,\nit's just not in the transportation piece.\nWe are looking at ways on the engineering side, how we do maintenance, how we do capital work on the mechanical side, what it costs us to perform overhauls. Every piece of the network is still there. So I think there's still more left on that piece to be able to do.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nCan you offer a thought on how that translates to headcount? Do we think headcount goes down further or is it kind of stable at current level?\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nWell, you know, the challenge we have with headcount is we sign some collective agreements and you live with what was given to you. Some of those collective agreements put pressure on headcount. They put pressure on from both the time off, the sick benefit time off that we provided. You know, we had some weekends when the football game were on that we had an extra 15, 20%. People all got sick at the same time. We need to be able to figure out how to deal with that and we'll do that as we move ahead. Must have been a real bad weekend right at the time.\nSame.\nSame time as one of their playoff games was on. At the end of the day, those are stumbling, those are blocks that we have to get over this year. What we showed in the Q4 is with all that, all the pluses, and all the headwinds we had on headcount, we were able to keep the headcount and reduce it overall in the company. There is no reason for us not to continue to do that. We will look for every opportunity. Sorry, I can't give you a specific number because this is a moving target as we move ahead. We're implementing new agreements through this year. It'll be noisy, it won't be a straight tangent down the slope, won't be perfect, it'll be a little up\nand down.\nI'm very comfortable that we have the programs, the processes in place to be able to correct that and head the way, which is less people handling the same amount of business.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of John Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJohn Chappell\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you. Good morning. I was going to ask this anyway. I guess it's a perfect follow up, and maybe it's just reading between the lines. When Eric mentioned some of the challenges remaining from the work agreements that required additional employees, it was noticeable to me that you stressed near term. Is there a time where there's anniversaries where you could be a lot more flexible based on the volume environment, or was the stress on near term kind of related to what you were just mentioning? Jim, you're putting programs in place, you're trying to address it, and you hope at some point you can kind of reverse that trend.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, in 2024, we have dates of implementation for the agreements that we have not implemented completely. Those are pressures on the number of people that we would need to operate. That'll be through 2024. That's why I've always talked about this as a, I see this as a two-year adjustment to the railroad to be able to get there. We do have programs in place as we implement, we run into things. If we operate as efficiently as I think we can, we'll mitigate that. You mitigate it by running fewer trains, having more cars on the same trains. We grow. We put more cars on the same trains instead of starting more, we use the people and the facilities that we have more\nefficiently.\nIt's a 2024 headwind for us that we are going to overcome just like we did in the Q4.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nWell, just a reminder, John, we only have the work rest agreement in place with the BLET. We're still negotiating with SMART-TD.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nCorrect.\n\nJohn Chappell\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay, thank you, Jennifer. Thanks, Jim.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Good to see you with your question.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nGood morning.\n\nAmit Mehrotra\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nThanks.\nHey, guys. Hey. Morning. Congrats on the good results. Hey, Jennifer, I want to come back to the 5% inflation. You've got a $15 billion cost structure that basically translates to like $750 million of higher costs.\nIn 2024, I assume that's a gross number because you guys have done a phenomenal job actually lowering the cost structure as you move from Q3 to Q4. Is there any help you can give us in terms of how you think about that gross? 5% translates to kind of like a net cost number in the context of the revenue outlook?\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, no, I mean, you've got that exactly right, Amit.\nThe 5% is the gross number.\nThat's our challenge. Right.\nOpportunity is to offset that with productivity.\nYou know, that's where you know, you heard Jim talk, you heard Eric mention we have those opportunities in virtually every cost category. You know, I'll put depreciation aside. You know, that's kind of fixed for the year. We absolutely have opportunities to offset that in terms of how we run the railroad.\nI think just think about wage.\nInflation and think about Q4. We had wage inflation. First half of this year, our wages are going to be up 4%. For our union personnel, it's going to go to 4.5% in the second half. Our cost per employee was only up 1% in the Q4. That's productivity. That's enabling us to offset some of that. That's the task of this management team. That's those controllables that we talked about. That's where we're very much focused.\n\nAmit Mehrotra\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nIs there any help? Like, I mean, can you offset half of it? Can you offset 40% of it? Because that's obviously critical to understanding the EBIT and margin outlook, which I know is highly uncertain, but at least give us some sense of how much you can offset that gross number by, in your opinion.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nYou also know, Amit, that volumes play a role in that in terms of how we're able to leverage and build longer trains, and have more work to put up against some of those inflationary costs.\nThat's our challenge.\nI'm really not going to be able to give you any more than that.\n\nAmit Mehrotra\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay, I thought I'd try anyways. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nAppreciate it.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nGood question. Nice try.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Pleasure to see you with your question.\n\nAllison Poliniak\n\nDirector and Senior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi, good morning. Obviously, service is improving here just in terms of customer engagement. Any color on the pipeline of opportunities? Is it starting to accelerate? Are there unique opportunities? I guess along with that, are you seeing any improvement in some of the conversion of some opportunities out there? Just any thoughts? Thanks.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nAllison, let me start, then Kenny, please jump in. If we look at this railroad that we are blessed with, that we operate, I think you've seen some of the steps we've taken.\nYou have to provide level of service that we sold our customers, and that's our goal. We work real hard every day to do that. We operate the railroad very efficiently. Where's the opportunity? We have a mix of traffic that's available to us that originates on our railroad. When I go around the entire railroad, I'm very confident, comfortable that we offset, and we have the capability to offset. We are tackling whether it's that industrial complex all the way from New Orleans to Brownsville, Texas, whether it's the grain, whether it's the soda ash, or whether it's the intermodal at the West Coast. Our speed, we are able to provide speed for customers that\nrequire speed, and not all of them do. We can go from LA to Texas, a close to 2,000mi journey, and we do that in 48hours.\nThat's truck like. Our service that we put on from Mexico, going into Eastern Canada, partnering with CN and ourselves into the east, plus into Chicago, is unparalleled. We can do it as fast as anybody. There's lots of opportunity out there for us. What we have to do is with good service, the customers will see what's possible, and they will want to partner with Union Pacific and grow their business with us versus anybody else. Kenny?\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nYeah. First of all, we have a robust business development pipeline. It's a healthy one, it's an encouraging one. We're excited about the pipeline in front of us, so a lot of opportunities there. The main thing I want to start with is our service product is in a strong position. As we talk about the service that we sold to customers, you look at some of the markets just to get a little bit more detail here. Look at coming out of Mexico. That's the service product that Eric has given us daily. That's undisputed and unmatched. Coming out of Mexico, it's the fastest product. It's also a product that is on time. You look at the West Coast, and someone asked me a question\nearlier. We're blessed with a network where we can pitch and we can catch.\nWe can pitch coming out of the West Coast. We onboard and on dock. We've got a strong IPI we can catch in the Inland Empire. We built that up, we put investments there, and we've shared with you that we've got plans to really grow in that area. With the network and the service product we have, we're expecting to grow. If you look at the auto side, you've heard us talk about some of the wins in the auto side. I talked about the petrochem side. It's a great network down in the Gulf. Service product is improving. Our commercial leaders, commercial teams are sitting out there and talking to customers about taking a little bit more truck off the road. We're bullish on\ngetting out there and growing as the service product is there and we're investing in the network.\n\nAllison Poliniak\n\nDirector and Senior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBrandon Oglenski\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Eric, I wanted to come back to you because I think in response to an earlier question you spoke about there's still more to come on things like velocity and train length. I think Jim even alluded to some local service plan changes. Do you want to elaborate a little bit more on where you see productivity gains this year?\n\nEric Gehringer\n\nEVP of Operations, Union Pacific\n\nAbsolutely. You mentioned car velocity. Let's start there. As you're thinking about 2024 and what's in front of us, you saw what we did in the Q4: 14% improvement, 217mi per day. That becomes a floor—a floor that is. We work every single day. As was mentioned before, we're working to improve that. Now, if you peel that back and you say, okay, within that, where do you see the biggest opportunities? You mentioned train length. We can start there. Train length is an opportunity, always has been, and candidly, always will be because the railroad is dynamic. Train length comes in two forms. The first one, Kenny just gave a great example of Inland Empire,\nwhere we're bringing more volume onto the railroad. I already have an existing train, and we can just tack it onto the back of that.\nThe other way that it comes is in our actual transportation plan changes that we make. An example of that is the one that Kenny brought up with Mexico. When you think about that being two trains before and now we're consolidating that traffic into one, it allows us to drive productivity that way. After that, the fluidity drives our locomotive fleet. There are other factors, but at the very core of it, it is about fluidity. We took out 500 units out of the system in the second half of last year. A little bit because of volume, but the vast, vast majority of it because of fluidity. Continuing that work allows us to continue.\nTo right size the fleet.\nYou know, we don't talk a lot about purchase services on these calls, but purchase service is a big opportunity for us. Whether you're thinking about how many vehicles we have on this railroad to operate it, or whether you think about how much fuel that work is using, we also have opportunities on the casualty side. As Jennifer has mentioned many times before, it's an opportunity all the way from the safety side. That's why we're so focused on safety, as well as even as we think about our service product. We have teams that are dedicated to making sure that the freight that we haul is successfully hauled from origin to destination without being damaged, and\nhow do we drive down any claims that we have. It is a target-rich environment, and we are doing everything every day to capitalize on that.\n\nBrandon Oglenski\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Barclays\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBascome Majors\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst of Industrials, Susquehanna\n\nFollowing up on the locomotive piece earlier, you talked about storing 500 units and having a 9% sequential increase in productivity. Jim, as you look forward a bit further, can you talk about how you think about UP's fleet renewal strategy for locomotives over the next, call it, three to five years, and how at this point is some of the regulations that California is proposing impacting the way that you think strategically about that significant investment for the railroad?\nThank you.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nBascome, I think it's a great question. If you looked at the bottom line, we have enough locomotives that we would not have to look in the planning period of three years out that we would have to purchase any locomotives. We always look at the greenhouse gas emissions of our locomotives, what we need to do to be able to invest to make them more efficient, both on a fuel spend and greenhouse gas emissions. I think we will target certain capital expenditures. It's not in the plan this year, and we'll look at it again to see where we are. We're testing new innovative ways to have propulsion. We'll continue to do that and invest in locomotives that\ncan be hybrid, that are able to work out there for us. In certain situations, we can implement it.\nI don't see the requirement is that we do not have to spend money. Bottom line is we know that we will invest in our fleet, and we don't want to have the oldest fleet in the network. We will continue to invest in renewing the fleet as we move ahead, but it will not happen in 2024.\n\nBascome Majors\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst of Industrials, Susquehanna\n\nThank you.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nYou're welcome, Bascome.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America",
    "content2": "Hey, good morning, and congrats on solid and rapid results here. Just want to check, I guess you changing that you do not need volume gains to get margin improvement. Is that right? Am I hearing that right? Your thoughts on outpacing normal sequential shifts into the Q1. Should we still expect that like you did in the Q4, given the weather or accelerating gains? Just a side one, Kenny, I just want to understand, can you talk about the scale of the intermodal loss in 2024? Did we see it in the Q4, or is that all coming? Can you talk scale? I guess that was a surprise, I think, to everybody so far.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nOkay, three questions, Ken. That was very good. I like. Why don't we start.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nWhere are we going to start?\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nWhy don't we start with the contract? Real simple, the contract was lost early in 2023, and the business is actually lost starting 1 January 2023. Correct, Ken,\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nthat's true.\nWe'll still see the bulk of it still showing up in 2024.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThat's the challenge. It's a 2024 issue, and it was early in 2023 that we lost that business.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah. Ken, in terms of your.\nMargin questions, again, not going to give you any specifics there. You know, we have three levers, as you know, that we use to attack and generate profitability. It's volume, price, and productivity. You've heard us talk about the fact in my prepared comments, the price, while positive, in excess of inflation dollars, is not going to be accretive to margins here in 2024. We are unsure about the volume picture. There's a lot of puts and takes, as you heard. We know we've got some headwinds from a contract loss in coal, so the lever that we are most confident about and have ultimate control over is the productivity side. You're right.\nWe have shown in periods of declining.\nVolume in the past that we can, through productivity and price, generate margin improvement. We're not giving the guidance on what any kind of magnitude of volume change is. I don't want to try to get into that game of linking X amount of volume with X amount of productivity and margin. The thing that you will see from us in our results, regardless of what happens with volume, is that we're performing better, we're running better, we're running more efficiently, and driving productivity. Whether that results in positive or negative in the financial picture is going to be a function of some of that volume and how that plays out through the quarter and through\nthe year.\nQ1 in particular is going to be a bit of a challenge for us. Volume, yes.\nThe weather, you heard us talk about that. A couple other things just to remind everyone of. In terms of a year-over-year comparison, last year we had about $100 million, a little over $100 million.\nReal estate transaction that was in our earnings.\nWe also had a very strong fuel benefit in the Q1 of last year. It helped our margins by, I think, almost 2 points and about $0.25. I just want to remind everybody of those kind of year-over-year comparison pressures.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nAppreciate the multiple part answers to my one question. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJustin Long\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research of Transportation, Stephens\n\nThanks. Maybe taking a shot at asking that question a little bit differently. Jim, you've now been at the company for roughly a couple of quarters. Do you have any updated thoughts on the size of the total productivity opportunity going forward, and roughly how much of that is dependent on volume growth? You know, if we want to make our own assumption that volumes are flattish this year, hypothetically, is that a scenario where you can still see meaningful margin expansion year-over-year?\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nListen, I think it was a well-framed question. I like it because it gets to the crux of who we are at Union Pacific and what the vision is, and what our goals and objectives are. I'm very clear on it. I think we are going to have quarters just like the Q1 that maybe we don't see as much of a sequential improvement as we would like because of the pressures of what we had in January so far with weather. I'm not sure what's going to happen. I've been around for way too long to forecast what's going to happen when winter is on and when we come through spring and everything that can happen then. Fundamentally, I see us as having the best operating\nratio in the industry, and that's what we're driving towards, and we'll get there.\nI see it in the future. The future is not so far that it's cloudy. I see it clearly in what we have to do. For me, that's real important. I don't care whether the business and the business in the marketplace gives us business or not. I'll tell you, I'm pretty clear, okay? We have a great railroad. We operate very efficiently. We should win with the customers. I expect Kenny and his team to deliver. This is not, you know, people want to talk about, we lost the business. We need to go replace that, and we need to bring it on. We need to do that in the short term, not the long term, without going after making an adjustment on price to go get the business.\nWe have that capability and we can deliver value to the customer. That's how I think. I did not come back here. You know, I could have sat at home in Scottsdale or been somewhere doing some exciting hiking or mountaineering, but I decided to come back because I think we could win. We have the railroad and the network to do that. The pressure is on this team. The pressure is on Eric to make sure, and his entire team, to deliver, recover fast like we did with this last winter impact that we had. I expect Kenny to deliver, and I expect Jennifer and the entire team to look for every opportunity, how we monetize what we have as a railroad and win.\nI love the question. Perfect. Hopefully I answered it for you.\n\nJustin Long\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research of Transportation, Stephens\n\nYou did. Thanks, Jim.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBen Nolan\n\nManaging Director of Research, Stifel\n\nYeah, thanks. Good quarter. By the way, Jennifer, I do like that last slide. It's helpful.\nMy question relates to Mexico. Obviously, that's an initiative that you guys really tried to accelerate last year. Around the end of the year, there were the border closures. Just thinking through how you expect that business to trend moving forward, and if you're seeing a lot of these reshoring things or are some of these interruptions.\nCausing any second guessing of that at all?\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nCan you talk about the business and how we see it? If you don't mind, I'm going to answer the piece on the border. Okay?\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nSure.\nYeah. I mean, you know, Ben, the nearshoring in Israel, we've seen the billions that have gone in all of 2023. These, a number of them, are highly industrial and rail centric, which we find encouraging. I talked about the service product that we have, and we're not waiting around for the nearshoring to happen. We've seen some wins with us having the fastest product coming out of Mexico, especially in time sensitive products like auto parts. Again, it's daily service. We're reaching into the Midwest, we're reaching into different parts of Canada, so we're encouraged by that. We're bullish about that. We are talking to customers about that. We're putting as\nmuch as we can on the network. You also saw us create a service product into the Southeast, which we gained some traction on.\nAgain, coming out of Mexico, it's a great franchise for us. We've got six borders that we can get in and out of Mexico. Great product and great franchise, you bet.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nOn the border, you know, I'm disappointed that the border was shut down and I do not think that's the way to move forward. I think there is a problem. There's a humanitarian issue. I personally went down with some members of the team to go visit and it's very difficult. When you see people crossing the river and a mother with a child coming and then falling into some razor wire, that is not something that anybody should see. At the end of the day for us, I think it's more important that the border crossings are fluid. We are doing everything, investing in systems to make sure we protect the railway crossings, that we do not have people crossing on the\ntrains. We've done a really good job of that.\nPeople are not crossing coming across from Mexico into the US or vice versa on the trains. That is what we will continue to do. We will work close with customs, and we have. Customs understands they have a problem, and we've worked very closely with them. We will continue to have meetings and discussions so that we'll do everything we can to make sure that the rail operation is not impacted as we move forward.\n\nBen Nolan\n\nManaging Director of Research, Stifel\n\nAll right, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Ravi Shankar with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRavi Shankar\n\nSenior Manager, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks, Morgan.\nEveryone, you guys said that you're looking to push on rail length, which is train length, is understandable. Just wanted to see how much room you have to get more leverage there. Kind of given your efforts already, how much more physical space is there. Also, I think given some of the regulatory scrutiny around train length, is this something that you guys can do by yourself, or do you need to get the STB or Congress sign off on it?\n\nEric Gehringer\n\nEVP of Operations, Union Pacific\n\nThank you for that question. Core to your question is how do we think about train length and how do we execute that? Let's put volume to the side just for a second. Do our trains have capacity for more train length? Absolutely, yes, 100%. The work that we have in front of us, that we've been executing now for years and will continue to, is to make sure that all of our systems behind the scenes continue to first identify those opportunities, and as we've always been, to be exceptionally prudent about actually working through our physics engines and to understand exactly how to build our trains. That's the, that's science.\nLike all science, it evolves. Every quarter, every year, we see new opportunities to be able to keep capitalizing on that. I'm not going to guide you to a specific number, but I am going to tell you we see opportunity there. You'll see us capitalize it in 2024, and I'm excited and appreciative of what the team's doing to make that happen.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThank you, Ravi.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nMorning, Brian.\n\nBrian Ossenbeck\n\nSenior Analyst of Airfreight and Surface Transportation, JPMorgan\n\nHey, good morning. Good morning, Jim. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick follow-up first on the work rest rules. Is there anything in your guidance where you're assuming that SMART-TD actually does come on board or so far, are you just assuming that it's the BLET and then maybe for Kenny. Obviously, mix is probably harder to forecast in volume, but the two are related too. So maybe you can just give us a sense in terms of some of these market pricing adjustments for coal and intermodal that have been more of a headwind than not the last couple quarters. Is that something that we should anticipate also being a potential headwind into next\nyear?\nJust curious how much visibility you have on that, knowing that it's probably truck and natural gas dependent, but I guess, is that directionally worse than 2024 than perhaps it was in 2023? Thank you.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nJennifer, why don't you handle?\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nYes.\nIn terms of the work rest piece, we do have an assumption that we'll come to an agreement probably sometime later in the year. So that's part of our overall thinking.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nSo you asked the question about intermodal, domestic intermodal. You know, first of all, if you look at where the rates have been, I'll differentiate the spot rate to the last four months sequentially shown. I'll call it very slow gradual increase, which is encouraging. The same is true on the contractual side. Very slow gradual improvement sequentially the last four months. So I can't get into saying whether I think over the next three months that's going to continue.\nWe've got a lot of mixed feedback from customers, but incredibly encouraged by what we've seen in the past. I've said this before, that we have mechanisms in our contracts for our suite of customers to keep them competitive in real time in times like this, and as the market improves, I would just mention some of those indices; it will help us some of those mechanisms that we have to secure a bit more price and better margin.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah. Brian, I think you also asked.\nA broader mix question in terms of next year, and obviously with a lot of unknowns about volume, it's hard to answer that. But you know the big drivers there really are in the intermodal front, and largely so goes intermodal, so goes the broader mix for UP. We obviously have mix within mix, as I know you're also aware. And so when you think about just the premium category with automotive being very bullish on that as we think about some of the contract wins and what's happening in that market, that may help your overall premium mix, particularly if you've got some down, and then we'll see how the rest of the categories play out. But that's the big swing factor for us\nin 2024.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThanks for the question, Brian.\n\nBrian Ossenbeck\n\nSenior Analyst of Airfreight and Surface Transportation, JPMorgan\n\nAppreciate the thoughts. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Proceed with your question.\n\nJordan Alliger\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst of Transportation and Logistics, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, a couple just real quick follow-ups or clarifications. One, I don't know if I caught the order of magnitude impact of the international intermodal loss, whether it be revenue or.\nVolume. Secondly, what does it mean.\nPrice not being accretive to margin, does that mean overall yields? Would it best be flat?\nThanks.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nYes, for the second part of your question, Jordan. It really just means mathematically when you look at how the price impacts and is added to the revenue, it does not help your overall operating ratio calculation. Even though it's going to be higher than the inflation.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nExactly. When you do the math, you know that math, right.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nWe're not going to frame up the magnitude. I can tell you we are focused on growing the international intermodal network. We've been blessed with a new intermodal terminal there in Phoenix. It's going to open up 1 February. I talked about some of the other products that we have coming out of Houston. We've talked about Mexico. We're bullish, and we want to make sure that we, that we're moving that product at the appropriate margin, acceptable margin.\n\nJordan Alliger\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst of Transportation and Logistics, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJason Seidl\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nThanks Robert.\nGood morning, everybody. Tacking on to Jordan's question there.\nIf we were to look at pricing.\nExclude sort of intermodal and sort.\nOf the natural gas impacts in some of the linked coal contracts, would pricing.\nBe accretive to margin in the remainder of the business? Also, as I look in.\nThat nearshoring commentary, how should we think about sort of post 2024 and nearshoring?\nWhere is that going to show up?\nFor you guys, and is there any extra CapEx that might be needed? Thank you.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nJason, I, thanks for the question.\nYou know, we're just not going to.\nGet into that final level of detail, but certainly those are substantial headwinds for us that have been impacting our yields through much of 2023, and the intermodal piece for sure is going to linger into 2024.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nYeah. You know, post 2024, as you look at it, I mentioned a lot of industrial-based markets that are going there. Think in terms of autos, think in terms of metals and minerals, think in terms of petrochemical markets.\n\nJason Seidl\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nPerfect.\nAppreciate the time as always, everyone.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nOh, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Jeff Kaufman with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJeff Kaufman\n\nPartner of Transportation and Logistics Equity Research, Vertical Research Partners\n\nThank you very much. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a follow up on the nearshoring for Kenny. You know, a lot of the companies we talk to say really all that's been done at this point is concrete's been poured in the ground, and some of these facilities have been announced, and really you're not going to see a lot of this potential until kind of 2025, 2026, 2027. Looking at your industrial development plan and kind of what's out there, do you think? I'm going to ask you to guess here, you know, could this be 100 basis points in magnitude to volume on a basis over three to five years? Could it be larger than that? How should we think about scoping this longer term\nindustrial development opportunity for Union Pacific?\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nCertainly not going to guide on your basis point question. Here's what I will say though. I've repeated this, and I want to make sure I hit this pretty hard. We've got a service product coming out of Mexico that is unmatched. It's a daily product. It's the fastest product getting in and out of the heart of Mexico. We also have six gateways, which gives us optionality, which gives our customers optionality, which gives us an opportunity to hit different parts of Mexico. Yes, we feel very bullish about Mexico and the growth, and we've been working from an industrial development perspective with all the stakeholders, with all the customers, to help bring that on.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThe other thing I would add is this is with the ownership position we have in the FXE. I think that ties us even to be able to optimize what's available to us as nearshoring happens, and as we work collaboratively and make it the view as one railroad operationally, it'll help us on the efficiency of being able to move the traffic. I think we're able to offer the customers the best product, and we think it gives us a chance to win a bigger majority of any business that's added to those lanes.\n\nJeff Kaufman\n\nPartner of Transportation and Logistics Equity Research, Vertical Research Partners\n\nThank you very much.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Jairam Nathan with Daiwa. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJairam Nathan\n\nExecutive Director, Daiwa\n\nHi, thanks for taking my question.\nJust on the casualty and I.\nGuess on the other expense on the last slide you have flat to down.\nIt looks like casualty.\nWould be favorable here. Can you talk about some things.\nThat could kind of offset that?\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, Jairam, you know, on the call I mentioned the fact that we've had.\nSome higher casualty expenses certainly over the last couple of years, and we have.\nBeen playing some catch up.\nThat's really a large part of what's driven the increase in those lines or in that line and the other line. We don't expect that to continue because it's not indicative of our safety performance. In fact, you've heard us talk about being very focused on improving that overall performance. It really is some cleanup and some maybe outsized verdicts too, just with some of what's going on in the courts. We think we have some of those big things behind us. Looking forward to a better footing in 2024.\n\nJairam Nathan\n\nExecutive Director, Daiwa\n\nOkay. Finally, just on the CapEx question, Jim, we talked about FXE in terms of capital additions. Would FXE be on the same page as you guys in terms of investing in the business?\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, they have the same capability. They do a real good job. I'm on the board, and so is Jennifer, and they have a great plan for 2024, and they invest in their railroad same as we do. Bottom up, build the plan up to see what you need. I'm very comfortable that they will invest and have the capability to invest what they need to move forward.\n\nJairam Nathan\n\nExecutive Director, Daiwa\n\nOkay, thank you for.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHey guys.\nThanks. Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nSorry?\nI said they put you last, David.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nIt's been happening since the second grade. The last name is V. You should feel familiar with that process.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nYou and I were always called last. I hear you.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nExactly, exactly. A couple questions for you here. First, the CapEx moderation. Kenny, are you a little bit worried about how that's going to impact you for growth? Second, given your exposure to the situation down in Mexico, Jim, I'd love to hear your thoughts on what you think the introduction of passenger rail might do down in Mexico in terms of freight flows coming across border. Any perspective or insight you can share in terms of the response that FXE, I think, had to give to the Mexican government the last couple weeks. Thanks.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nKenny, let me ask the question. When we plan our capital, do we ever limit the capital, so you have a problem for growth?\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nNot at all. Perfect.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThat's the way we look at it. It's that simple. Never. Let me clear up this whole David, because it's a great question and you know the answer. You're asking me and you've heard it before and I'm very clear on this. We build our capital plan from the bottom up to look at what we need to reinvest in the railroad. Every year is a little bit different, you know, ties, rail, equipment. We look at growth and what we've identified of where we need to invest. We're opening 1 February 2024 a new intermodal terminal in Phoenix. We've invested in that. We're quick turnaround, we don't fool around anymore. That would have been like a six month, one year discussion.\nWe turned around in November, said there's a market there, and 1 February we're opening up a place, so we're able to invest quick, and that's the way I look at it. When we built it up, we came up with $3.4 billion. That is not a hard number. If there's an opportunity for us to invest to grow this company or invest that we need to on the replacement and what we do every day to operate the railroad, we'll invest and we'll. We never ever skimp on safety, maintenance of the railroad, the capital costs we need, and the growth. We are there. I have no issue. On the passenger service, listen, I give both the FXE and CPKC, they're saying the right things, and I agree with\nthem. There's an interaction when you have passenger service that affects you.\nThere's nothing that I'm worried about. They can't figure out how to mitigate that and still operate a freight and passenger railroad efficiently. I'm very comfortable that that will not have a significant effect or really any effect as they move ahead. I'm sure that they will just move ahead, and they'll be operating some passenger service on the railroad. Hopefully we answered your questions, David.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nYou did. Thanks very much.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThanks, operator. Rob, maybe if I can just as soon as we're done with the questions, I wouldn't mind just recapping. If there's a few people on, that's great, and if everybody else has got off, then I'm talking to my team here and they love to hear this story. Bottom line is this is we have a great railroad. We have a franchise that allows us, with the business mix, to go up and down with because not one area ever, and you know, you wish one year that every segment that we had, industrial, premium, and the bulk, would all grow at one time. That's not the way the world is. I've never seen it in my career. We need to be able to have the resiliency and the\ncapability to react in what's happening.\nWe don't know what's going to happen this year, but I'm telling you, fundamentally we are on the right track to deliver. The team is engaged, we're excited, and we're looking forward to winning this year. We have goals to grow revenue with our service, and we also have goals to be the most efficient operationally railroad in the industry. I'm looking forward to 2024. I'm excited, the team's excited, and I'm looking forward to talking to all of you in three months to see how the Q1 went and see how we're growing on what we've done up to this point. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day."

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jim Vena, Chief Executive Officer for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Vena. You may now begin.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nRob, thank you very much and good morning. Good morning to everyone that's joined us. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Union Pacific's third quarter results. I'm joined in Omaha by our Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Hamann, our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales, Kenny Rocker, and our Executive Vice President of Operations, Eric Gehringer. It's been a busy couple of months since we joined in Union Pacific. I'm very excited to be back. I come back to work with over 40 years of railroading experience, including two years here at UP. I know this railroad and I understand the opportunity. To win you need a strong management team, the right culture, and a great franchise. That's the goal. Win and be the best in the industry.\nSince I started, I've spoken with employees, customers, regulators, community officials, and investors, and my message has been consistent. It starts with safety. Our goal is to be the safest railroad in North America. That's the standard we should set for ourselves. We also expect to be the best in service and operational excellence. Service is delivering what we sold to our customers. Operational excellence is using our resources and assets as efficiently as possible. It's being mindful of our costs and developing our people. A key early initiative of mine is to drive decision making lower in the organization. This means reducing layers and simplifying how we work. We need to deliver value with speed. This is a cultural change to empower our people. We recognize that our business volumes fluctuate and weather presents its challenges. So we will always keep a buffer of resources to manage those situations.\nThis commitment to safety, service, and operational excellence will lead to growth and for you, our owners, that generates industry-leading returns. There's work to be done, but the entire team understands our strategy for success. Now let's discuss third quarter results starting on slide three. This morning Union Pacific reported 2023 third quarter net income of $1.5 billion or $2.51 per share. This compares to 2022 third quarter net income of $1.9 billion or $3.05 per share. Our third quarter operating revenue declined 10% reflecting lower fuel surcharge revenue, reduced volumes, and decreased other revenue. Expenses also were lower year-over-year driven by fuel expense and last year's one-time charge for labor agreements. But there's an ongoing mismatch in our cost structure resulting in an operating ratio of 63.4 as we continue to be challenged by inflation, including pressure from new labor agreements and higher casualty costs.\nAdditionally, the lag on our fuel surcharge program negatively impacted our results as fuel prices rose during the quarter. No doubt about it, it was a tough quarter, but I'm pleased with the positive productivity we're quickly gaining. Our service performance also is strengthening as we're positioning ourselves to meet customer demand while at the same time storing assets. I'll let Eric and Kenny discuss both in more detail. Ultimately, we're taking the right actions to build from here. So with that, let me hand it to Jennifer to provide more details on the third quarter financials.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nThanks, Jim, and good morning. I'm going to discuss our third quarter results by walking through the income statement on slide five. Starting with operating revenue of $5.9 billion, down 10% versus last year on a 3% year-over-year volume decline. Breaking it down further, as illustrated in the appendix slides, freight revenue totaled $5.5 billion, down 9% versus 2022. Total fuel surcharge revenue of $637 million declined $515 million from last year. The impact of lower year-over-year fuel prices, as well as the lag in our surcharge programs, reduced freight revenue 8%. The combination of price and mix increased freight revenue 150 basis points, as solid core pricing gains were partially offset by an unfavorable business mix, increased short-haul rock moves, and fewer lumber carloads, outweighed the impact of moving fewer low average revenue per car intermodal shipments.\nIn addition, our pricing gains continue to include the impact of certain coal and intermodal contracts that are more reflective of current market conditions. Wrapping up the top line, other revenue decreased 13% versus last year, driven by a $70 million year-over-year reduction in accessorials. Switching to expenses, where again more detailed information can be found in the appendix, operating expense of $3.8 billion declined 4%, driven by lower fuel prices, last year's one-time charge for labor agreements, and volume-related costs. Digging deeper into a few of the expense lines, compensation and benefits expense decreased $77 million versus 2022, which does include last year's $114 million one-time labor charge. Third quarter workforce levels increased 3%, and our active TE&Y workforce is up 2% as we graduated new train crew personnel during the quarter.\nAt this point, with our train crews more appropriately staffed, our training pipeline is shrinking. Today we have just over 500 employees in training, down more than 50% from last quarter's pipeline of roughly 1,200. Excluding the impact of last year's labor charge, cost per employee was essentially flat in the third quarter as we are starting to generate better overall productivity. As a result, we now expect full year cost per employee to be up closer to 3%. Both third quarter and full year cost per employee reflect elevated workforce levels, and better crew efficiency, partially offset by wage inflation which includes $20 million in the third quarter from paid sick leave. Fuel expense in the quarter decreased 25% on a 21% decrease in fuel prices from $3.96 a gallon to $3.12.\nOur fuel consumption rate was flat but showed positive momentum through the quarter as we stored locomotives and improved freight car velocity. Finally, other expense grew 18% primarily related to continued pressure and casualty costs. It also reflects the impact of one-time write-offs as highlighted in the financial walkdown slide 22 in the appendix. The resulting outcome is third quarter operating income of $2.2 billion, down 17% versus last year. Below the line, other income decreased $18 million driven by last year's $35 million gain from a real estate transaction. Interest expense increased 6%, reflecting higher average debt levels. Income taxes are lower in the quarter on reduced income and lower tax rates that resulted in a $41 million deferred tax expense reduction. Similar to last year's $40 million tax reduction, we again had three states cut corporate income tax rates in the third quarter.\nNet income of $1.5 billion declined 19% versus 2022, which when combined with a lower average share count resulted in an 18% decrease in earnings per share to $2.51. Third quarter operating ratio increased 3.5 points to 63.4%. Core results, which include the impact of inflation, lower volumes, and cost inefficiencies, accounted for the majority of the year-over-year change. Turning now to slide six and cash flows. Year to date, cash from operations totaled $6 billion, a decrease of roughly $1 billion from 2022. The combination of lower net income and nearly $450 million of labor payments were the main drivers. Free cash flow and our cash flow conversion rate also were impacted. Year to date we've returned a little more than half of the cash generated or $3.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nWe finished the third quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio up slightly from 2022 levels at 3x as we continue to be A-rated by our three credit agencies. Wrapping up now on slide seven, the overall financial story and outlook for the remainder of 2023 is largely unchanged. We're facing a demand environment where we don't expect full year volumes to exceed industrial production. We do however still expect to generate pricing dollars in excess of inflation dollars, although as we've discussed through the year not to the level that offsets the negative impact of elevated costs on our operating ratio. Fuel also remains a headwind on earnings per share, although moderating from the $0.34 negative EPS impact in the third quarter to approximately $0.10 of negative year-over-year impact in the fourth quarter.\nThat assumes fuel prices in the fourth quarter are around $3.30 a gallon, and significant inflation headwinds remain primarily in the form of the new labor agreements. We expect similar levels for fourth quarter paid sick leave expense to third quarter, and the impact of the BLET work rest agreements will primarily be seen through elevated force levels. Finally, our capital plan is coming in a little bit higher at $3.7 billion. All that said, the important takeaway from today's results and our view of tomorrow is that we're making gains from maximizing growth opportunities and repricing our business to improving service and generating productivity. We're striving to build on the current momentum as we end 2023 and enter 2024 on a path to further financial improvement. With that, I'll turn it over to Kenny to give us a view of the business environment.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nThank you, Jennifer, and good morning. You just heard from Jennifer that freight revenue declined 9% with a 3% decrease in volume for the third quarter. Let's jump right into the business team to recap the market drivers on the revenue side. Starting with bulk revenue for the quarter was down 10% compared to last year, driven by a 6% decrease in average revenue per car due to lower fuel surcharges and a 4% decline in volume. Grain exports were softer than last year due to tight supplies.\nCoal volume was down 5% for the quarter due to continued decline in the use of coal in electricity generation combined with competitive pressures from lower natural gas prices. Lastly, we saw a reduction in import beer carloads due to the increased utilization of larger rail cars, which creates value for both the customer and Union Pacific. Industrial revenue was down for the quarter driven by a 6% decrease in average revenue per car. Core pricing gains in the quarter were offset by lower fuel surcharges and a negative mix in volume. Softer decline for lumber and corrugated boxes continues to be a challenge, but our relentless focus on business development is driving excellent growth in our rock network that supports construction of new emerging LNG facilities along the Texas Gulf and growth in petroleum products for both domestic and Mexico energy reform.\nPremium revenue for the quarter was down 12% on a 4% decrease in volume and a 9% decrease in average revenue per car from fuel surcharges in a challenging truck market.\nAutomotive volumes were positive with continued strength in OEM production and dealer inventory replenishment for finished vehicles and auto parts. In addition, a robust business development pipeline like winning Volkswagen shipments from the Texas Gulf enabled us to outperform the market in the quarter. Intermodal volumes were down in the quarter, primarily driven by softness in parcel segment and weak imports on the West Coast. However, domestic truckload volume was slightly up, driven by business development wins and strength in our Mexico shipments. Turning to Slide 10, here is our outlook for the fourth quarter as we see it today. Starting with bulk, we anticipate continued challenges in coal as natural gas futures remain volatile. We are watching grain closely as we enter the export season. Crops are being harvested right now, and increased supplies will be available to move.\nUS soybean export sales have started out slower than forecasted. However, we have an improved service product this year to capture more available demand.\nLastly, our forecast for renewable biofuel feedstocks continues to remain strong. We see solid demand in this market and continue to capture new business. We recently landed opportunities with projects coming online soon in Iowa, Louisiana, and Nevada. Moving on to industrial, the economic forecast for industrial production looks to stay depressed in the fourth quarter. However, we expect petroleum and construction markets to remain favorable due to our focus on business development. Finally, for premium, we are staying close with our intermodal customers in this challenging demand environment. We've seen a seasonal uptick at the beginning of the quarter, and we believe our improved service product positions us well to handle market demand. In addition, we expect automotive growth to continue driven by strong OEM production and elevated shippable ground counts.\nHowever, we are watching closely the ongoing UAW negotiations and the negative impact they are having on fourth quarter volumes as the strikes persist. In summary, we are fortunate to have a diverse portfolio that allows us to see positive momentum in some of our commodities. The team remains focused on what we can control and I'm proud of the progress we've made in such a challenging market. We have a strong pipeline of opportunities that we're actively pursuing. By leveraging our great franchise and extending our reach with transloads, interline, and shortline partners, we are winning new business and I am confident that with our improved service product we can open up more doors to new, profitable growth opportunities. With that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance.\n\nEric Gehringer\n\nEVP of Operations, Union Pacific\n\nThank you, Kenny, and good morning. Starting on slide 12. As Jim mentioned, safety is the foundation of everything we do, and our goal is to lead the industry. Union Pacific can be the best because we've been there before, we have exceptional people, and the entire team is focused on returning every employee home safely every day. While our progress has been encouraging, we must continue to improve technology and strive to provide best practices to the industry and the communities that we serve. Safety impacts every facet of our business, our employees, customers, communities, and shareholders, and we are committed to world-class safety performance. Closely aligned with our goal of industry-leading safety. We are confident in our ability to lead the industry in both service and operational excellence.\nIn late August, the southwestern portion of our network was challenged by a series of intense weather events that caused widespread flash flooding and washouts. However, through the bold and relentless efforts of our team, we were able to quickly respond and rapidly restore operations. Despite the weather headwinds, our performance metrics improved year-over-year. We look to maintain that positive momentum as the vast majority of our metrics in the month of September represented our best performance year to date. Freight car velocity improved 5% this quarter versus last year. Throughout the last several weeks, we have maintained a freight car velocity of around 210 miles per day. The impact of increased freight car velocity can be felt by our customers through the benefit of improved trip plan compliance.\nBoth intermodal, manifest, and auto TPC saw a sizable 13 and six point year-over-year improvement, respectively. We will continue our work to deliver the service we sold to our customers. Now let's review our key efficiency metrics for the quarter on slide 13. The team is continuing to take actions to right size, reduce resources to align with current volumes, and run an even more efficient network. This incorporates Jim's strategy of empowering our people closest to the work and removing layers to increase the speed of decision making. Locomotive productivity improved 4% versus last year. As we continue to identify opportunities to utilize the fleet more efficiently. The third quarter marked both our lowest active high horsepower fleet size and the highest quarterly locomotive productivity number since the first quarter of 2022.\nWorkforce productivity, which includes all employees, was down 6% versus last year, reflecting the impact of volume declines coupled with increased workforce levels. Leveraging a larger workforce, we have reduced borrow-outs to the lowest total of the year and slowed hiring. We remain firmly focused on effectively managing our workforce levels and recognize the importance of balancing our resources as we plan for the future. Train length improved 1% compared to third quarter 2022, despite lower volumes in our intermodal business. By putting more product on fewer trains, we have increased train length across our system by over 500ft or 6% since January of this year. Our focus on train length is paying dividends, and we are continuing our work to further improve this measure.\nWhile our service product demonstrated noticeable improvement, there are more opportunities to improve the efficiency of our locomotive fleet, increase workforce productivity, and maximize train length. We must sustain momentum across all of our operating metrics as we exit the year. So with that, I'll turn it back to Jim.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThank you, Eric. Turning to slide 15. Before we get to your questions, I'd like to quickly summarize what you've heard from our team. Jennifer walked you through the inflationary pressure we continue to face broadly throughout our cost structure, but more specifically from new labor agreements. These are real hurdles that will require price generation and productivity to overcome. Kenny outlined a challenging volume environment, one with bright spots like construction and biofuels, but ultimately is being overwhelmed by soft consumer markets. Despite this environment, the team is leveraging our business development pipeline to bring new business to the railroad. And finally from Eric, you heard that we're improving safety, service, and efficiency. We exited the quarter with great momentum. September was a very strong month across all of our operating metrics, and the momentum continues today. But we're still nowhere near what I believe we can deliver.\nThere's still plenty of room to improve. I came back to win, and I could see the opportunity at Union Pacific. In a short period, we've increased the urgency across all facets of our strategy. The ultimate outcome is better service for our customers, which drives growth to the railroad. By aligning the team with a strategy of safety, service, and operational excellence, we will win. We're now ready to take your questions. Rob?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you'd like to ask a question today, please press star one on your telephone keypad, and a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you'd like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. Due to the number of analysts joining us on the call today, we'll be limiting everyone to one question to accommodate as many as possible. Thank you. Our first question will be from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGood morning, and congrats on the new role, Jim. Jim, maybe just starting there on operations.\nAnd Eric, what is changing here or what needs to change? Is it the plan? Is it you have too much equipment? Maybe talk a little bit about what metrics you focus on as you get started or productivity you threw out there. There were too many locomotives. Maybe provide some numbers, targets, and thoughts on how you get there. Thanks.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nKen, nice to be back and nice to hear your voice again. And I'll let Eric jump in a minute. But because he's the operating person, he's responsible, he's the person I want to keep accountable for to make sure we drive it. But what metrics do I look at? I haven't changed. A successful railroad is always fluid. Make sure that you operate in a manner where you don't impact the network because of decisions you made with the kind of service that you've sold and the way you use your assets and people and whether you have the capacity on the railroad. So when I look at Union Pacific, what do I look at at a high level?\nI look at, do we have the physical plant to be able to handle the traffic and be able to handle the ups and downs that every railroader knows happens with weather? Like, who thought we were ever going to get a hurricane in the West Coast? Okay. That's always an Eastern Seaboard issue more and a Gulf issue, but not a Western. But I think we did as a team. We did a great job of recovering. So you need a strong network and we have the capacity there. We'll continue to invest to make sure. So that's important to me. And we have to make sure that we have a buffer of people and assets so that we're ready for the ups and downs of the business that happens. Because I wish it was flatline, Ken, and you know it as well as I do.\nYou've been following railroads for a long time. So let me go on because this is an important question, is what do I look at? I look at, in the morning, first thing when I get up, I probably get about 100 different touch points on the railroad all in one spreadsheet. But what I actually look at is I look at revenue first. Where are we financially? What was our volume like, and where the revenue is. And if it's not good, the next call's to Kenny. Okay.\nThen the next thing I look at is car velocity. It's an end-to-end measure, tells me how well the railroad's doing, you know, and 210 is a good number but nowhere near what's possible. So Eric's got done a great job so far but we need to push more. Then you continue to look at the fluidity numbers, how well we are at crew changes, how the intermodal terminals, how fast we're getting to pad, how fast we're allowing the truckers to go through. So there's a lot of metrics that we look at that most people probably haven't heard me talk about. But I thought I'd give you a little broader view of what I look at. And then after you do that, there's the asset issue. How many cars per carload? The locomotives?\nSo we've got over 500 locomotives parked, and those 500 are ready-to-go locomotives. So we can turn them on in a short period of time. We've got some placed in strategic locations if we need them on the network to keep the service level that we sold. On top of that, we have more locomotives that are stored for longer term. So we're in good shape on assets. We spool up this railroad to operate at the level that is possible with the type of business that we have. And I think it's a win-win for us, Ken. And that's what I look at every morning. Eric, you want to?\n\nEric Gehringer\n\nEVP of Operations, Union Pacific\n\nWhen we think about recapping the quarter, Ken, you start thinking about we did make great progress in the quarter from a fluidity perspective to Jim's point. And when you think about what did we do with that. We were able to store approximately 300 locomotives during the quarter. We were able to reduce our recrew rate. We took down our borrow-outs to the lowest level we've had all year. Now we continue to face the headwind from the workforce productivity of some of our agreements. So clearly the challenge that we've given ourselves and we continue to challenge ourselves with is how do you work to overcome that productivity headwind.\nSo when you think about things like some of the agreements that we've signed that actually allow us to remove certain people off of certain jobs across the system, we work to continue to reduce the fleet even more as we grow train length. I'm super proud of the team for the train length they've grown since January. There's still more opportunity there. When I think about remote control locomotives and being able to reduce some of our gain productivity and some of that, that's an opportunity for us. And the list goes on and on. We probably could talk about it for an hour. So I'm very excited about it. I think this is just the beginning.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nKen, thanks for the question. Appreciate it.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thanks for the time.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question from the line of Fadi Chamoun with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\n\nFadi Chamoun\n\nTransportation Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nYeah, good morning and welcome back, Jim. I mean, quick question. I think, you know, we've heard this in the past, you know, many times. Maybe from you, Jim, it's, you know, first you have to fix kind of the engine, and you know, ultimately energize the commercial momentum. And I think the success story around the industry really are in that vein where collaboration between operation and commercial have been big catalyst for that. So my question is, in terms of fixing the engine and you talked about car velocity, where do you think you are for the network that you have in that process?\nAnd what is ultimately the right kind of goal from a car velocity perspective, from an asset velocity perspective for UP, where are you in that process? And as we go into 2024, can you kind of make progress? Can you improve operating ratio even if volume are flat or the economy is muted and there is no momentum on that front?\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nSo, Fadi, I like the question because it frames exactly, when I came back to work, the challenges that I could see.\nThe first challenge we had was inflation, both input costs plus labor costs and some of the collective agreements we signed. You know, every CEO that comes in always wants to blame people beforehand. That's not the way I look at it. That's the challenge. I knew what I was getting myself into. So, how do we fix that piece? Is we drive and look for efficiency and there's efficiency there. And you know that, Fadi, I don't forecast numbers. But I'll tell you, I'll be disappointed if that car velocity doesn't return to where it was before that we had in 2020. There's no reason for us to not be, you know, low 220s. So that's about as far as I'm going to get on that number.\nIf I look at the other piece that we have to do and Kenny's all over it and his team is, we know that we can't, through efficiency and productivity, recover everything in the long term. But what we can do is we can price properly for what the service that we're providing our customers. And Kenny's all over that. And that's going to take a little bit of time. And I'll let Kenny, later on talk about this. So, the way I look at it is those two things, if we do them right and let's leverage this railroad that we have, okay, we're a 70-mile-an-hour railroad. There's only one other railroad in North America that runs their freight trains at 70-miles-an-hour, okay? So let's leverage that.\nAnd you could see that when we change the service out of Mexico because we want to leverage Mexico to grow our business in and out. And by doing that and providing customers a service that from the border nobody can beat us to Chicago, we have the fastest service of anybody, especially with the new train service that we have on. So we should leverage that. Now, not everybody wants speed, so we have to make sure whether we're consistent. We also have to leverage our network. I love the places we serve and where we can take our customers to.\nI love the way our origination customers are and the number we have and the variety crossing all market segments. And if we do that, Fadi, we become the most efficient railroad operationally. I've always said this, and I will continue to say it. We will have the best margin railroad in North America. Best operating ratio, best margin, whichever way you want to look at it, I'm comfortable with that. And we give a chance for the customers that are with us to win. And we look to move customers that are using other modes, including trucks, that look at the railroad as their way that they want to win. So I'm happy I didn't come back to work to lose. I came back to win. I was more than comfortable. You know, most people my age are thinking about doing other things. In fact, I had a trip to K2 planned.\nWhen the opportunity came up and we agreed with the board on what the strategy was and what we wanted to do moving forward, I said, listen, I'm all in, let's go. I've been working hard with the team and I'm pushing them hard. At the end of the day, we need to make decisions quicker. We need to react quicker. We need to quit having so many layers and that slow down the decision making. With that we end up winning, Fadi. Hopefully I answered your question. I know it was a long answer and maybe there won't be any other questions after this.\n\nFadi Chamoun\n\nTransportation Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nAppreciate it, thanks.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nOkay.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJason Seidl\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, Jim. Welcome back. Jennifer, Kenny and Eric. Wanted to focus a little bit on sort of the inflation and pricing dynamic that we have going on here currently.\nYou know, is this just a case for waiting til we can get to repricing some more of the contracts as we move through and seeing, you know, sort of better fluidity in the railroad? Are we just sort of in for a few tough quarters here in terms of the comps?\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nKenny, go ahead.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, thanks for that question. No, we're not waiting. We're repricing these contracts right now, real time. We're having some very clear and direct conversations with customers. The commercial team is doing an excellent job of really articulating what took place from a labor standpoint, and these costs, and specifically how what we're doing and what Eric is doing on his side, how it will benefit our customers. Now I'll tell you, our customers are seeing some of the same pressures, and it's playing out in their markets that way too. The other thing, and Jennifer talked about this a little bit, you know, we're investing a lot of money here. We're investing $3.7 billion. We don't lose an opportunity to share that with customers and talk about the value that they get from those investments.\nAnd so you look at that, you look at the improved service product that Eric is delivering us, we have no problem looking our customers in the eye, talking to them about pricing the value that's there.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nAnd Kenny, just to remind Jason and others though, we can't access all of our contracts immediately from a price standpoint. So we do have, call it half of our book of businesses in multi-year contracts. So to your question, Jason, it does take us a bit to work through and reprice those contracts. But Kenny and team are very focused at every opportunity they get. They're having that conversation, and they're winning in the marketplace with higher prices.\n\nJason Seidl\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nJennifer, could you remind us how they renew through the course of 2024, what percent?\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nWe've not talked about 2024, but in general, call it half of our book is multi-year contracts, 25% is tariff, and the other 25% or so are contracts that are a year or less in duration.\n\nJason Seidl\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nOkay, fair enough. I appreciate the time. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\n\nAmit Mehrotra\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nThanks very much. Hi Jim. Hi, Jennifer, everyone. Jennifer, can you talk about, I guess, OR expectations as we move from 3Q to 4Q?\nObviously, the fuel headwind I think gets even better sequentially. You talked about year-over-year, but I think it actually gets a little bit better sequentially. You're moving 8,000 or more carloads per week. It's only two weeks into the quarter, so I don't want to get ahead of myself. But we're seeing some decent sequential volume growth. So can you talk about that? And then, Jim and Eric, you talked about getting car velocity up to 220mi per day. You've already had great improvement on that in recent months, and that has corresponded nicely to kind of this improvement in volume.\nShould we think that increase to 220 allows you to essentially move more volume that's waiting to be moved and we can see kind of a corresponding increase in kind of the seven-day carloads. How do you get us comfortable that, you know, the added volume doesn't drive service challenges which historically has been the case for all railroads. So, if you can just talk about that as well. Thank you.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nI'll maybe start off for a minute and address your question, at least the question about sequential OR improvement. As I've said in my prepared remarks, we're looking to build off the momentum that we have here as we ended out the third quarter and take that into the fourth quarter. Without making any guide relatives to what fourth quarter volumes are going to do, to your point, we're off to a good start. Very pleased by that. But we're going to operate as efficiently as we can, and we do think we have an opportunity to have sequential gains going from third quarter to fourth quarter on the OR basis. It's going to take hard work by the team. It's going to take continued gains in terms of how we're operating the railroad and driving efficiency. But that's absolutely the goal that we're looking at.\nJim, you want to maybe hit the rest of this question about freight car velocity.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nSo the reason I use freight car velocity is. It truly is that end-to-end number that gives you a great indication. And it's not the only indicator. But it gives you an indicator. So I like the question. You said, can you handle an increase in business and are you leaving business behind? I wish we were leaving business behind, I really do. And we are not. And we will look for everything we can to get more business. The railroad and railroads get themselves in trouble when they lose sight of what the fundamentals are for an increase in business. Increase in business can come in a lot of different ways. One is it can be bulk, which adds people, adds locomotives, and puts more pressure on the capacity. And we built this railroad that has the capacity.\nWhat you always have to concentrate on, and usually is the limiting factor when you increase, especially on the carload business, is how well your terminals and what the capacity is on the terminals. When I was here last time, we worked in the Houston area and invested a lot of money to make sure that that terminal had the capacity to grow with the products that we handle in the industrial landscape. It's important for us, and we are going through a process to make sure that every car has the least amount of touch points; fluidity is king. We can handle the most cars per employee within all those terminals. We have the gap that allows us to be able to react when the business comes up.\nYou know, if you add an extra intermodal train or you add an extra thousand feet on one of our locomotive trains, that's an easier fix. Again, as long as the terminals, whether it's Jeep or in Chicago or it's Dallas, terminals have the capability to handle it in an expeditious manner the same way. I think we have it. With all the business that Kenny's promised me, okay, is we have the capacity, but we will invest and make sure we try to stay ahead of the curve on the fluidity on our terminals, and if we drive the terminals properly, because that's usually your limiting factor, more so than what the physical plant is out in the railroad. We keep that buffer of people so that we have the people to react. I'm not real worried about if we go up another 10,000 carloads.\nIn fact, what a challenge to have. So, Kenny, your job to bring it on. So thank you very much for the question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nJordan Alliger\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi. Thanks. I think intermodal is often viewed as critical or key long-term growth engine for the industry.\nAre you now in a position, do you think, to start taking more share from trucks with Trip Plan Compliance moving higher? And if not, what still needs to happen to get Intermodal to grow? Obviously other than the macro, is it more service from you? Do truck rates have to move up? Can you give some thoughts around that? Thank you.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nKenny, if I can just start real quick and then I'll pass it over to you. Price is important. You have to have the right price that allows you. But service has to be consistent, and a few weeks is not good enough for any customer to say how's the railroad doing? If I was a customer, I'd be looking at are you consistent in your service and when you get impacted? Because our car velocity will drop with some weather events through the winter. This is not a game where you can forecast it to be at a 220 level all the time. We're going to have some impact. Sometimes it'll be higher, sometimes lower. It's how fast we recover.\nIf we can do that and we can show shippers that we have the capability to deliver their products in a consistent manner, recover fast, then I think we have the opportunity. But it takes time. No one's going to believe you the first time you show up and say wow, we had a great September. Well, how about January? How was that? And how was 2022? I think they have memories of that. Kenny?\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nJust to build on what Jim mentioned, let me just level set. You know, first we've got a really strong stable of customers, private assets, customers that are on our network along with our own railroad assets, EMP, UMAX. And so what that does is that provides optionality for the BCO. So that's the first thing that we are appreciative of. Next, you look at all the product development that we're investing, investing in a little bit more expansion in Kansas City, the new product development with Twin Cities, Inland Empire. You look at the discussion around Eric's really improved product around coming into and out of Mexico. That's been great for us. But setting aside this macro thing as our service improves, really the North Star is going over the road.\nYou've heard us say, by our estimation, that we've got a pretty low market share in terms of overall rail coming into and out of Mexico, and that's ripe for more penetration and we're inserting more products out there. We announced that we've got a product to the Southeast that we're taking advantage of, and so very bullish. We're on offense and we're clear-eyed about growing there.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThanks for the question, Jordan.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBrian Ossenbeck\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks. Good morning. Welcome back, Jim. Just wanted to ask more about visibility to the cost inflation on labor side specifically into 2024. Obviously it's been a challenge but it'll be a little bit more challenging next year. I think of the 4.5% increase, bonus, and maybe some work rest rules around SMART-TD. Maybe Jennifer, you can give us some sense as to how much visibility you have to the cost inflation side when it comes to labor.\nAnd then, Jim would just love to get your thoughts on, perhaps, just the broader regulatory picture. Obviously, UP had some challenges with regulator on embargoes last year. There was the FRA letter about some of the inspections. So UP has been under the microscope a little bit. Just wanted to see how you perceive that, as you're new to the seat. Thank you.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nTalking about inflation, I mean, we're still in the process of putting together our 2024 plan, but you hit some of the key ones there, Brian, in terms of, you know, July 1 is the last of the scheduled wage increases for the craft professionals from the PEB, and that's 4.5%. Obviously, there will be, you know, wage increases on the non-agreement side as well. So there will be labor inflation pressures. You mentioned the work rest, and so those are all, while they're pressures, there are opportunities, right, for us to look at how we can be more productive in how we do every part of our business. And so that's one of the things we always challenge the team with, is how can we, you know, chip away at inflation. It's not just Kenny's job from a price standpoint.\nIt's all of our jobs as we look to drive productivity and work more efficiently. You know, purchase services and materials, that's an area that also has seen some pretty heavy inflation over the last couple of years. The labor piece of that probably will continue as the labor market stays tight. Probably we'll continue to see more pressure as well. You know, beyond that, if I think about fuel, obviously driven by energy markets, we have opportunities there to be more efficient. On the equipment rent side, you know, that's where car velocity certainly can play a role for us as we speed up the network, turn the assets more efficiently. And then the last one I'll mention is the other expense line, which, as you know, has been pressured the last year or so on the casualty side.\nThat's, you know, some higher verdicts, higher awards, and you know, that's probably something that's going to be around for a bit. That's why, you know, that's the corollary benefit to us running a safer railroad is taking those incidents off the table. We want everybody to go home safe. We want our customers' freight to arrive undamaged. But then it flows through from a cost standpoint as well. So those are kind of the big buckets I'll outline for you and obviously we'll talk in more specifics when we put the plan together and talk to you in January.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nYou bet. Brian, listen. Good article on the cars per employee. I think it was a great comparison, and it shows where the opportunity is. Well done on that. I enjoyed reading that last night, one of the last things I did before I went to bed.\nYou asked about the regulatory agencies and how the relationship is. I think it's best to describe it like this. With the FRA, we're aligned. We have the exact same goal, and I like that the FRA wants to come out and look at the railroad to see if our safety management system is proper. We're using the railroad in the proper manner, and that we're safe. So I love that. I have no issue with it, and I have a good relationship. I've reached out. Good relationship with the FRA, but it's not my relationship that's the most important. It's how we deal with things out in the field.\nWe're professional, we look for ways to improve, and we work with the FRA because they get to look at other railroads, and when they give us some feedback, we need to take it to see how we improve. I think that's the way the relationship is. And on the STB there's lots going on. I won't discuss the specifics, but I grew up in Canada working on a railroad that had interswitching for a distance, and I know what the pluses and minuses are there. I don't see anything as we're moving forward, and we'll give our feedback because I think we want to make sure that we don't impact our customers and what we serve, and slow down the railroads because of a regulatory framework.\nSo we have to be careful because our customers compete with people with other, of course within the US other modes, but they also compete in the world. There's products that we move for customers that go around the world that if we wreck the efficiency of the railroads it's a mistake. And I know the STB does not want that. What they want is they want to make sure that we have good service, and that's the best way for us to make sure that the regulatory environment doesn't affect us is we provide good service. If we provide the service that we sold to our customers, then we win. So I'm very comfortable with the relationship. I think we need to continue to communicate, and we both, we have the same end goal with the STB and the FRA. So Brian, I think the relationship is good.\nWe'll take the feedback and we'll see where we can improve.\n\nBrian Ossenbeck\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you, Jim.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nScott Group\n\nSenior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, thanks, morning, and welcome back, Jim. It sounds like we want to get more price, more productivity, but we still have inflation.\nYou said you want to get to best-in-class margin. I guess we got to get improvement first. When do you think you can start improving margins again? Separately, Jennifer, the buyback has just been a big part of the earnings growth for a long time. Is this a temporary pause, more of a prolonged change? How you're thinking about the buyback. Any thoughts there? Thank you.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nJeniffer, why don't you answer the first piece of Scott's question.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nSure. No, this is not a change in our philosophy around capital allocation, Scott, as we talked back in July. This is just looking at cash flows, looking at the balance sheet, and taking a temporary pause. You heard me mention that our debt-to-EBITDA levels are around 3x here at the end of the quarter, a little bit elevated from where they have been historically. Our job is to hit on the things you mentioned earlier with the price, productivity, grow the business, and generate more EBITDA, generate more cash flow, and resume our share repurchase program.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nScott, on the second piece is the last time I showed up on January 14th of 2019 versus August 14th of this year, the railroad is more efficient. It did not back up to the place where it was before. It was very easy pickings to go park 1,000 locomotives. We don't have that. What we do have is we still have productivity. I see productivity across everything that we do, from how management works, how many people we need to operate the railroad, to how well we use our assets. It won't be quite as large. It won't be the $1.3 billion that we did last time. There is productivity gained that we can do. With that, it's going to take a little bit longer. Some of these changes that I see will not be as quick.\nI won't be able to go to North Platte and park 90 locomotives because we had them parked outside the diesel shop first day. There is ways for us to speed it up, and there are still locomotives that we can park and make sure that they are used efficiently. It will take us a little bit longer. Stay tuned with us, and you'll see, hopefully, incremental changes to our numbers that will tell you that we're headed the right way, and there'll be ups and downs. There is no if, ands, or buts that some things we can't control. I really don't know what's going to happen to the economy next year. Are we going to have a recession? Are we not going to have a recession? I'm hoping the country does not have a recession, and that would help us.\nHopefully I answered your question, Scott.\n\nScott Group\n\nSenior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you, guys.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your question.\n\nWalter Spracklin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, RBC",
    "content2": "Thanks very much, operator, and welcome back, Jim. I know when you first came back, and you just mentioned locomotive storage, employee productivity improvement were really a key focus for you and you were very successful on that. They had some pretty quick turnarounds.\nJust wondering now you're in the seat, you probably have multi-year views here, and whether you can grab some longer-term kind of structural efficiency objectives. I'm referring here to things like hump yards and things that take a little longer time to address that perhaps you didn't look at immediately when you first were in the role, that you may be looking at here now. I'm just wondering if, when you look at the hump yards that Union Pacific has on its network, do you think they're right aligned, or do you see some opportunity to reduce some of those or any other infrastructure assets that are on the network.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nWalter, nice talking to you again and good question. The railroad, the way I look at it is there's nothing wrong with hump yards, but they have to fit into the fluidity and the touch points of how many times we touch cars and how many cars we actually have to handle. Hump yards are okay. At this point, with the way the network is, as far as getting into that detail is good. What I don't like that I've seen is our put through is not as fast. Our dwell needs to drop, our dwell in the amount of time that we have. Railcars in yards at the intermodal terminals at intermediate points will drive productivity gains so that we are able to have more fluidity, and that's real important to me.\nWhen I came back last time, I came with one goal. I came to work to drive operational efficiency. I didn't look at the rest of the company very much. The rest of the company needs to be looked at, and that's what we're doing now. Everything that we did operationally, we are going to look at what we've done. One example is this delayering exercise. You can't have nine levels from the CEO to the people who actually do the work and expect that the message is clear, the decisions are made clear, and there isn't some hiccup in the decision stops. I want to drive it so that we have way less layers. That means with less layers, the people out in the field are empowered to make the right decision.\nWhich train to hump, which train to switch, how we move the cars, what are we doing to customers, what are we doing for scheduling, how are we loading, is our loading pattern right? There are so many things that we can do, and if we do that, they're better at it than us, Walter. There's no way that Jim Vena, even though I think I'm a decent operator, I could go operate the hump yard. Maybe when I retire next time, I'll become just a hump yard operator in one place and see how well, because I think a few people would love me to go out there and see if I'm as good as I say sometimes, okay. At the end of the day, that's what's important. That's one of the things that's a big change, this delaying exercise that we're going through. Stay tuned.\nWe'll announce what the findings are as we move ahead.\n\nWalter Spracklin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, RBC\n\nAwesome. Looking forward to hearing about it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nYeah, good morning. Jim, also wanted to say welcome back. I think, you know, this is a bit of a high-level question. I'm guessing the answer is kind of both. But wanted to see if you could give some color on how we should look at the opportunity in terms of being a volume story or a cost story, you know, I mean, you clearly did a lot with cost last time in, you know, 2019, 2020.\nYou are talking a lot about productivity. What's really the more important leverage for operating income growth the next couple years is this a little bit of productivity and a lot of volume. I guess to the extent that there's the productivity side, is that driven by headcount reduction? Is that really more other cost buckets like locomotive costs, car costs, that type of thing. Thank you.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nGood question. Why don't we start with Kenny? Why don't you talk about the opportunity on the growth side, the pricing side, and what what we're looking forward to.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, we talked a little bit about it in terms of markets like our biofuels, very bullish on our construction and autos. I mean, just set aside the strike that's going on now, I talked about the business development win, but it's still holding up from a demand environment. We need the strike to come back. We have talked about international intermodal. Now, we've had a little bit of what I'll call a seasonal bump, we'll call it peak season. You've heard me say we haven't had one in a few years, so it's nice to see one.\nOn the domestic side also, there's just still a tremendous amount of over-the-road share that's there. You know, we think it's in the low teens that's in between out of Mexico and into Mexico in terms of over-the-road share that we should be gathering. Eric is out there getting us a more improved product. We've got a lot of optionality out of Mexico. We see that as a growth engine, as some of these consumer facing products improve. We've always said that we felt good about our petrochem business. Industrial chem is also included in that. If you look across the line, there's a lot of upside, and we're very bullish on the volume growth that's there.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nEric, why don't you talk about it? The question is great. There's no ifs, ands or buts, we have to grow business. We have to price and take care of what's happened to us inflation wise, and leverage our network. Productivity, what do you see on your piece of it?\n\nEric Gehringer\n\nEVP of Operations, Union Pacific\n\nAbsolutely.\nWhen we talk about productivity, we really differentiate into two buckets. To some of our commentary already this morning, there's no easy productivity. The most straightforward productivity is when you get that volume, how do you leverage it on the existing network that we have, the existing trains we have, the whole idea of being volume variable plus. The other bucket of productivity is how we actually do the work. When we think about our locomotive shops, our mechanical shop, or engineering gangs, for example, on the non ops side, it's a real challenge to them to say, hey, you still need to do the important work. How do you do it more efficiently?\nWhen we think about going into a locomotive facility and making sure that we balance the headcount to the exact number of locomotives they have to the forecasted number, to being really thoughtful about how do we use that material in there, to being thoughtful about how do we think about redoing cores, I mean, there's infinite areas of opportunity within each one of our departments to be able to look deep into the business, deep into the work, and really find those opportunities. To Jim's point, it's a little bit harder work than it was a few years ago, but it's still work that we know how to do and work that we'll be successful doing.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nI know neither one of them wanted to touch it. They always leave those things for me. People is going to be one. You know, we look for cost savings on what our input costs are, and of course it's much more difficult in the inflationary place that we find ourselves in this country. We're going to look for every opportunity to use less so that we can save costs that way. On headcount, absolutely. We're going to use attrition to right size the company as much as we can to what we know now we've identified of where we want to get to. It'll be through attrition mostly, and we'll move ahead from there. Thanks for the question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bersntein\n\nHey, good morning, guys. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about, you know, the earnings leverage we should have from some of the intermodal agreements you guys are signing. Obviously the Falcon Service, the partnership with NS.\nHow should we be thinking about thinking about the profile from a margin perspective of that traffic coming on, particularly early here, as truck rates remain low, and it seems like intermodal companies are out there discounting the service to take some share, and then maybe bigger picture, Jim, could you talk a little bit about how you see the competitive dynamics for UP changing post the CPKC acquisition. We've heard a lot from Lance in the past on this, but I don't think we've had a chance to hear you talk about how that acquisition creates risks or opportunities for Union Pacific from your perspective. Thank you.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nOkay, Jennifer?\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nSo, thanks, David, for that question. You know, you've heard us talk about margins before in terms of the, when we look at it, where you see some of the greatest margin pressure relative to our book of business is in that business that's truck-competitive, and we certainly are in a truck-competitive market today. But that's also our opportunity that you've heard us talk about in terms of tremendous growth. And we know that there's leverage in margins from volume growth that can help drive greater productivity. And as we are building a better service product, certainly as we provide better service, there's a price for that service, and we look to price to that to be able to meet that customer demand. I don't know, Kenny, if you want to add anything to that?\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nNo, the only thing I'd say is that as we're looking in the current environment, we're certainly keeping our customers competitive with mechanisms that we have in our contract, and we are clear-eyed about as the markets change. They're stable now. As they get a little bit more tighter, demand strengthens, we'll see upside from a price perspective, which should show up in margin.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nOn the competitive dynamic in the specific example of CPKC. So I think they're a great railroad. I think they have a great network. I think their leader, Keith, he's a friend, I've known him for a long time and he's smart, knows how to railroad. So he knows how to balance safety, service, asset utilization, cost control, and developing his people, same thing as we do. So the competition is, and I like it. There's nothing wrong with a little competition. So I want to win, he wants to win. There's no ifs, ands, or buts that the CPKC if it's origination to destination on their railroad. You know, we have a competitive disadvantage but the advantage we have is we've got this great network. We go through 23 states, we serve the population in the US, we have fast access, we have a 70-mile-an-hour railroad.\nWe're fast, and if we have to be, if that's what we sold was fast. We can do that. You can see it when we move our parcel business, as we're doing, and getting up to their peak period coming up towards Christmas. So all those things plus we have access into Mexico, broader access than one or two places. We go into Mexico from the West Coast all the way east. So in a number of locations. And we have a strong partner in FXC, and as you know, we own 26% of them, and that helps us. So I'm excited. CPKC is going to make it difficult, and we're going to make it difficult. Now I don't chase price. This is not a price discussion. It's about a service, access to markets, and how we do it.\nI'll walk away from business if somebody wants to lower their price. Go ahead, take the business. I'll bring in business that fits our network, that makes sense.\nThat's how I think of the competitive. I could have that discussion about all the other railroads. I want us all to be really good and strong.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bersntein\n\nSo, are you seeing a potential volume risk from a diversion standpoint?\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nKenny?\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nNo, we're going out there. We feel good about the service product. We're going head on. We're ready to compete again. The North Star and I said this earlier, it's over-the-road. So, you know, we're on offense and we're starting off well.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bersntein\n\nAll right, thank you, guys.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, due to the number of analysts joining us on the call today, we ask you, please, limit yourself to one question to accommodate as many participants as possible. The next question will be coming from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\n\nAllison Poliniak\n\nDirector and Senior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi, good morning. Hey, Kenny, can you expand a little bit on that over the road opportunity? Is it something that you're seeing build a lot more in the pipeline today? I know you had talked about some of your customers wanting to see maybe more reliable service before that sort of conversion happens in terms of those opportunities. But any color on how we should think of that progression in terms of today versus the multi-year out? Thanks.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, so again, I mentioned roughly mid teens, let's call it 15%. That's our estimation.\nThat's moving rail out of there. We see that as a ripe opportunity to go after that over the road product. We've got to provide, you know, more competitive, faster service product that Eric is delivering on in the, you know, high 90s percentile for what we schedule that to. And we have seen some wins, we have seen some over the road wins come early. We've added extra products that I talked about going into the Southeast. Remember, we're moving all of our products seven days a week. It's in a few days a week and customers like that. And we see it as a right spot to go after and grow.\n\nAllison Poliniak\n\nDirector and Senior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Wetherbee\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Citigroup\n\nSo we noticed that headcount was down sequentially for the first time in a while. Jim, you noted using attrition here. So maybe thinking about the next couple of quarters. Should we expect headcount to stay relatively flat? Maybe come down a little bit as you use attrition, and then maybe ask a different way. How much volume do you think you can manage with current headcount? So as we hopefully see a recovery in freight as we move forward, is there an opportunity to leverage this existing workforce to drive more productivity without adding heads?\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nChris, nice to hear your voice again. There's so many pluses and minuses, additions or subtractions. We still haven't fully implemented the 11 and 4 deal on scheduling with BLET, and we haven't concluded negotiations with SMART-TD on what that does. So we have to see how that goes. The general way I see it though is that we do want to see a more productive workforce in the company as we move ahead. But I would be remiss to tell you without those collective agreements in place of exactly what the timeline is. But you know me by now that I always look at what do we need of the railroad and is at the right level to be productive with it. So I'll do everything I can. But with those outstanding items, I just can't give you a black and white answer of what the timeline is and how fast those changes go to where I want to take it.\nIt might take a little bit longer than when if we didn't have those deals in place.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah. But Jim, I do think it's safe to say once we have those deals implemented and we're working to drive the product productivity, our long-term view is that we can grow volumes faster than we grow headcount.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nChris Wetherbee\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Citigroup\n\nOkay, thanks for the time. Appreciate it.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThanks, Chris.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBrandon Oglenski\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, good morning and congrats, Jim.\nSo, Jim, I guess, I think if we looked back over the last number of CEOs at Union Pacific, the disappointment that I think probably all of them would share would be lack of relative volume growth. As I'm looking at my model here, I think RTMs this year are probably going to end up being down more than like 25% from where this company peaked way back in 2006. So as much as we're talking about service and the ability to grow and the pipeline looks strong, we've heard that before. So what is different looking forward with you as CEO at Union Pacific that you think you can really capture some of that market opportunity?\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nWell, you know, I'm going to repeat myself, but it truly is. You have to have the fundamentals, you have to provide the service. You have to see what's happening. And I think we can, we can grow faster than what the economy gives us. And that's our goal, and that's where we're going to drive it. Judge me in a year, okay? I want the board to judge me. I want the shareholders to judge me and the team. And I think we're there. I think we can do that. Do we have some headwinds? Absolutely. You know the industry as well as I do.\nYou know, coal is always an issue that we have to deal with, but the rest of the products that we have, we're going to go after it, we're going to go get it, we're going to bring it on in the right place. And if we grow not as fast as we want, we're going to price properly for the service we're providing. So I think it's a win-win. And let's talk next year. I'll put it on my calendar. You can ask me the question of how we're doing, okay?\n\nBrandon Oglenski\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Barclays\n\nWill do, Jim. Thanks.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Jonathan Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJonathan Chappell\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you. Good morning. Kenny, we've talked about a lot of things as it relates to intermodal new services.\nYou've had some wins. Conceptually, there should be some share shift back to the West Coast, hopefully after a couple years of losses there. But the truckload market on the over-the-road market opportunity continues to bounce along this bottom. So, how competitive is the pricing dynamic within intermodal? Whether it's your new services relative to other rail options or relative to truck, and how do you manage then the capacity you're willing to commit to these new kind of growth alternatives when you do have maybe a competitive pricing landscape that's more difficult at this point in the cycle.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nYeah. First of all, it's great that we put the investments in for our intermodal network. You've heard me mention them. I won't go over them again. But it does start there. Obviously the service matters. We've been deliberate about making sure we can insert optionality on that domestic intermodal product, and we've done that. You've heard us talk about the strong stable we have as you look at Hub, Schneider, Swift, and STG, that's there. Our rail product with EMP, UMAX, and we've invested in that fleet from a GPS perspective, invested in the ramps, so we're prepared from that standpoint. I think your question is a little bit about how we keep them competitive, and I've talked about that in terms of again, we have mechanisms to make sure that our customers, regardless IMCs, private assets, are competitive.\nWhat we want to be is just nimble and quick and change with the market so that we can get that margin and price improvement as we move along.\n\nJonathan Chappell\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks, Kenny.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBascome Majors\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Susquehanna\n\nJim, you said you had about 500 locomotives parked? Just curious, just high level. How do you think about the locomotive strategy at UP versus what you inherited?\nI know you've got a big order for refurbishment that will go out several years, but just strategically, longer term, how are refurbished locomotives performing? Where do you see your CapEx going over the next three, five, seven years to satisfy both the service needs you have and the emissions targets you put out there? Thank you.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nOkay, so we'll continue to invest in our locomotives. And, Bascome, we'll always make sure that we have the right locomotive and make them as fuel efficient as possible so that we can save fuel when we're operating. No ifs, ands, or buts. That's what we'll continue to do. As far as where the CapEx, you know, we're not ready now, but I'm pretty sure that you'll see our CapEx being at a different starting point next year than where we were this year. That's how I view it. Stay tuned. When we get into January, we'll give you the numbers of what our plan is for next year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJeff Kauffman\n\nPartner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nThank you very much, Jim. Welcome back and congratulations. You know, you've answered this a couple different ways, but let me come at this in terms of what's different from 2019 since you came back. I think you talked a little bit about what's different at the railroad, but maybe talk about in terms of the customer expectations in the market or kind of where volume is, where business is and how the railroad, in your view, needs to adapt?\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nWell, I think railroading, the basic foundation of railroading, hasn't changed from 2019. How we look at the business at Union Pacific, how fast we are making decisions, needs to change. You know, when I showed up, I asked Kenny to give me a number of customers that I could talk to at a high level and talk about what our service is, what our plan was. And one of them said to me that they wanted to invest a lot of money to be able to build out because there was expansions going on in the soda ash patch. So at the end of it, it was taking us over a year to give them a decision on whether we could do that. We need to change that.\nIf we change that and we were able to make the decision in four days, I got it. We can't make decisions in four days all the time, but we sure can make them in a few weeks instead of months. That's real important. That's a change in the way we want to do business. The customers, the feedback was there's opportunity for them to win in their marketplace, the customers that we have. So we need to build on that and that's real important. The foundation is the same. We're going to operate a very efficient railroad, having a buffer. The fundamentals, the five key fundamentals of how you operate a railroad, I'm not changing from. It's true, it's tested, it wins, it puts us in the right place. I'm not changing.\nBut we need to be consistent with our customers, work better for them to grow, and we win. So I'm looking forward to the challenge. One big difference between 2019 and now. My wife is still mad at me that I went back to work, okay? But other than that, everything else is good.\n\nJeff Kauffman\n\nPartner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nAwesome. Well, best of luck to you. Thank you.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRavi Shanker\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks. Hello, everybody. Just a follow up on the Mexico and Falcon Service commentary. Jim or Kenny, when you talk to customers who are looking to potentially convert from truck or convert from another railroad, how important is speed in their equation relative to overall value proposition? I mean, you said that you're at a bit of a structural disadvantage kind of given the interchange versus your peer.\nWhat can you do from an overall value prop to kind of be competitive and kind of work against that structural disadvantage, if you will.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, listen, I probably wasn't clear. I don't think structurally we have any issue with any competitor. I just wanted to give you the CPKC. If you're the origination railroad just like us, if we originate in Salt Lake and we're going to Boise, Idaho, it's pretty hard for somebody to compete against us, another railroad. That's all I was saying. At the end of the day, I think we compete against anybody because of the network we have, the speed we have, and what we're capable to open up for markets. Kenny?\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nSo, first of all, we know our customers. We know that automotive OEM with auto parts for production is different than, say, an FAK business of, you know, container pillars, they are different. What differentiates us in that sense? I talked about the revised service product that is going to help us with customers that are speed sensitive. The fact that we have every day per week service that's going to help us because that matters also. The fact that we have a group of private asset owners and we also have our own containers to go into Mexico; that makes a difference. So again, we know our customers and those are the things that we talk to our customers about as we're winning business over the road.\n\nRavi Shanker\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nThanks for the question. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nJustin Long\n\nManaging Director, Stephens\n\nThanks. Good morning, Jennifer. You talked about comp per employee being up about 3% this year, but I wasn't sure if that included the impact of the abnormal labor costs from last year. So how do you expect comp per employee to trend sequentially into the fourth quarter? And as we move into 2024, do you think this is an area where the productivity opportunity has potential to fully offset the inflation headwinds we're seeing?\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nSo thanks for the question. Justin, in terms of your first question, when we talk about comp per employee, we do try to make it apples to apples so we take out any of the one-timers. In terms of looking at it sequentially, you know, as we go into the fourth quarter, there's probably a couple things going on there to think about and consider. One is as we're continuing to take people out of training classes, put them into full-time positions on the railroad, there's a little bit higher cost associated with that. And then just some of the OE capital mix that you get in the fourth qaurter as you wind down some of the capital programs that can put a little pressure on there as well.\nLooking long term, you know, again, productivity and being able to offset cost inflation with productivity is always one of our objectives. It certainly is hard, a very high inflation environment. But that's our opportunity as well. That gives us the opportunity to really look critically at the work that's being done and make sure that we're being as efficient as we possibly can be. I think you've heard on the call today, we see opportunities across the board. Whether you're talking about how we're maintaining our locomotive fleet, how we're looking at our back office functions, how we're managing the transportation employees, we have opportunities to be more efficient there.\n\nJim Vena\n\nCEO, Union Pacific\n\nWell, listen, thanks everyone and let me tie this up and I really appreciate everybody taking the time this morning to join us and talk about Union Pacific. I think the team that's with me here has done a great job of explaining what we do. But let me summarize it real quick. Our goals are clear. It's about safety, service, and operate in excellence. That's how we win. And we're going to be really good at operations. We're going to provide consistent service to what we sold. Every customer has a different level of service they required. Some of them is fast, some of them is sustainable, some of it is making sure you're consistent.\nWe're going to leverage the railroad. We're going to do everything we can to leverage the physical plant that we have. We're going to be efficient in how we do it. We are going to deal with stakeholders at all levels in a professional manner, listen to their inputs, and see what we can do. I think we can win. This is not going to be a short-term fix that you'll see it. But what you should notice is, as we go through the next quarters, you will see us improve and we will get to the right place with the inputs that we have in this railroad. I'm excited, the team's excited. We're moving fast. And again, thank you very much, everyone, for joining us and we'll talk to you all in the next quarter, if not some time before. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen. Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day."

I'll connect you now.\n\nOperator\n\nGreetings and welcome to the Union Pacific second quarter earnings call. At this time, all participants will be in listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. If anyone should require operator assistance during the conference, please press Star zero from your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website at this time. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President, and CEO for Union Pacific. Mr. Fritz, you may begin.\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nThank you, Rob, and good morning and welcome to Union Pacific's Q2 earnings conference call. With me today in Omaha are Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales, Eric Gehringer, Executive Vice President of Operations, and Jennifer Hamann, our Chief Financial Officer. We're also joined by our newly elected independent Chair of the Board of Directors, Mike McCarthy, who will take a couple of minutes to address the announcements we made this morning regarding my successor and our board. Mike, the floor is yours.\n\nMichael McCarthy\n\nIndependent Chair of the Board, Union Pacific\n\nThanks, Lance. This morning, the Board of Directors announced that Jim Vena will be appointed the next Chief Executive Officer of Union Pacific. The board has also appointed Jim to the Board of Directors. Jim brings a strong rail operations background to Union Pacific with over 40 years of experience. This includes two successful years as our Chief Operating Officer from 2019 to 2020. After a comprehensive search process, it was clear Jim's track record of operating excellence was unparalleled and he was the right candidate for the job. Jim will start as CEO on August 14th and we look forward to welcoming him back to Union Pacific.\nThe board also announced that Beth Whited will be appointed President of Union Pacific. Beth has over 35 years of experience at our company and has held leadership roles across multiple departments. Recently she has led our strategy, sustainability, and workforce resource teams with great success. Going forward, the Operations, Finance, Marketing and Sales, Supply Chain, and Technology functions will report directly to Vena. Whited will report to Vena and her responsibilities will include the Strategy, Workforce Resources, Sustainability, Law, Corporate Relations, and Government Affairs functions.\nIn addition to these management changes, the board is appointing two new board members. Doyle Simons, former President and Chief Executive Officer of Weyerhaeuser, and John Wiehoff, former chairman, president and CEO of C.H. Robinson. Both bring to our board a wealth of skill sets including operational expertise from leading large industrial public companies. As Lance indicated, as part of these changes, we are adopting a corporate governance best practice by splitting the role of company CEO and Board Chair. With my election to independent chair, Director Sheri Edison will take over leadership of the Corporate Governance, Nominating and Sustainability Committee.\nIn addition, the Board has created a new committee, Safety and Service Quality, which will have responsibility to review, evaluate, and monitor compliance with safety programs and provide oversight of the company's service performance. Director Jane Lute will lead this committee. The Board is very pleased to make these announcements today, which represent a continued commitment to board refreshment to ensure that we have the right mix of skills and experience to oversee the company. We are confident that these new appointments set Union Pacific up for long-term value creation.\nBefore I turn it back over to Lance, I would like to thank him for his leadership these past eight years. His accomplishments are many, and over the next few weeks we will properly celebrate them. Most importantly though, his leadership has set our company up for great success for the years to come. Thank you, Lance, and I'll turn it back over to yo1u.\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nThanks, Mike. We appreciate your leadership throughout the process, and I'm pleased to welcome back Jim to Union Pacific, and I'm confident that the company has the right leaders to advance the hard work that's underway. Now let's turn to the business of the call and Q2 results. This morning Union Pacific reported 2023 Q2 net income of $1.6 billion, or $2.57 per share. This compares to 2022 Q2 net income of $1.8 billion, or $2.93 per share. Our Q2 operating ratio of 63% was up 280 basis points versus 2022, primarily driven by lower revenue, inflationary pressures, and the previously disclosed one-time ratification bonus payment.\nThroughout the quarter, we provided our customers with a more consistent and reliable service product while generally meeting the demand that was available to us. Eric will discuss in more detail the progress we've made. But the bottom line is that the actions we've taken to strengthen our crew resources are improving the railroad. We also acted during the quarter to increase the efficiency of our network by rightsizing our locomotive fleet, using crews more efficiently, and making sequential improvements in train length. We finished the quarter with our resources better aligned with current volumes.\nAs you'll hear from Kenny, while several of our markets showed growth, consumer-facing markets remained soft and drove the volume decline. However, the strength of our business development efforts enabled us to mitigate the macro impact of and outperform our peers. So let me turn it over to Kenny to provide more color on the business environment.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nThank you, Lance, and good morning. For Q2, volume was down 2% driven by weak market conditions in our premium and bulk business groups. Freight revenue declined 5% driven by lower fuel surcharges and a 2% decrease in volume. However, we generated solid core pricing gains in the quarter to help offset some of those challenges. Let's take a closer look at each of these business groups. Starting with bulk, revenue for the quarter was down 3% compared to last year, driven by a 2% decrease in average revenue per car due to lower fuel surcharges and a 1% decline in volume.\nGrain and grain products volume was up 1% due to increased demand and business wins for renewable diesel feedstocks coupled with strong shipments of domestic grain. A soft US export grain market partially offset these gains. Fertilizer carloads decreased by 9% in the quarter due to an outage at a customer facility that reduced export potash shipments. Food and refrigerated volume was down 8% due to reduced beer imports early in the quarter, but those shipments eventually improved by June.\nIn addition, drought conditions from the prior growing season negatively impacted both fresh and canned shipments, and lastly, coal and renewables volume was flat year over year. Low natural gas prices and reduced electricity demand from mild weather negatively impacted shipments, but that was offset by a favorable comparison of 2022 with our service improvements and additional resources. We are currently meeting available demand. Moving on to industrial. Industrial revenue was flat for the quarter, driven by a 1% improvement in volume, offset by a 1% decline in average revenue per car.\nCore pricing gains in the quarter were offset by lower fuel surcharges and a negative mix in volume. Industrial chemicals and plastics volume was up 2% year-over-year, driven by increased plastic shipments, partially offset by lower industrial chemical shipments due to challenged industrial production levels and reduced housing demand. Metals and minerals volumes continued to deliver year-over-year. Growth volume was up 2% compared to last year, primarily driven by growth in construction materials, increased frac sand shipments, and new business development wins.\nForest products volume declined 13% year-over-year driven by challenging market conditions in housing and repair and remodel coupled with lower corrugated box demand. However, energy and specialized shipments were up 2% versus last year, driven by strong business development and increased demand for LPG petroleum products. Turning to premium revenue for the quarter was down 11% on a 4% decrease in volume compared to last year. Average revenue per car decreased by 8% reflecting lower fuel surcharge revenue.\nAutomotive volumes were positively driven by continued strength in OEM production and inventory replenishment for finished product, vehicles, and auto parts. Domestic intermodal wins were offset by a weak freight and parcel market driven by higher inventory and the shift in consumer behavior as people spend more towards services than goods. International shipments were down due to decreased imports on the West Coast. So turning to Slide 7, here's our outlook for the rest of 2023 as we see it today.\nStarting with our bulk commodities, there is uncertainty in our second half coal outlook as inventories have been restocked, but extreme heat is driving up near-term demand and starting to push up natural gas prices. We expect near-term grain shipment to be challenged with tighter US grain supply impacting volumes. However, with improved operations and recent rain improving new crop supply forecasts, we remain optimistic about our opportunity to move incremental grain carloads in Q4. In addition, we expect our forecast for biofuel shipments of renewable diesel and their associated feedstocks to remain strong.\nWe see solid market demand and continue to capture new business as production expands. Moving on to industrials, the forecast for industrial production is down in the back half of 2023. Demand for forest products will also remain below 2022 levels despite some good business development wins. On the metals side, it is being offset by a weaker-than-expected market. However, we expect to see continued strength in metals and construction with new business wins. And finally for premium, we expect challenges in the intermodal market from continued inventory destocking, inflationary pressures, and ongoing shift in consumer spending from goods to services.\nHowever, on the international side we continue to outpace US West Coast import market as customers shift more business to IPI. For automotive, we expect growth to continue driven by strong OEM production and high shippable ground count. So to wrap up, it's hard to say when the economy will begin to recover in certain sectors, but our diverse portfolio allows us to see positive momentum in many of our commodities. The team remains focused on winning new business and has a strong pipeline of opportunities with a great track record for closing deals. With that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance.\n\nEric Gehringer\n\nEVP of Operations, Union Pacific\n\nThank you, Kenny, and good morning. Starting on slide nine, as always, safety remains job number one at Union Pacific, and we are committed to ensuring the safety of our employees, our customers, and the communities that we serve. Freight rail is the safest way to transport goods overland, and Union Pacific is doing its part to be even safer through ongoing investments in our network, employees, technology, and communities. That is evidenced by our safety performance, which continues to show improvement through the first half of the year.\nOur reportable derailment rate and personal injury rate both improved, a direct result of our enhanced training programs and strong safety culture of ownership and personal accountability. Now let's review our key performance metrics from Q2 for the quarter starting on Slide 10. This quarter, through the team's hard work, we made improvements both year over year and sequentially across key metrics that drive the customer experience. Freight car velocity improved 8% to 202 miles per day compared to Q2 2022. This improved fluidity and resiliency was on display as we exceeded 200 daily car miles for 10 consecutive weeks during the quarter.\nWhile the current business mix is a headwind, there remain opportunities for continued improvement. Trip plan compliance saw a sizable 17- and 8-point year over year improvement in intermodal, manifest, and auto TPC respectively. Improved network fluidity as evidenced by faster freight car velocity, train velocity, and lower terminal dwell drove those improvements. Turning to Slide 11 to review our network efficiency metrics, with the demand picture weaker, the team is taking action to right size resources to align with current volumes.\nFor example, beginning in April, we took actions to remove locomotives from our active fleet, storing around 200 units through the quarter. While there is still room for progress, locomotive productivity improved 2% both sequentially and year over year even as our gross ton miles declined 1%. Although greater crew availability is supporting solid service metrics, the impact of our hiring can be seen in our workforce productivity. To date, we have graduated approximately 1,200 TE&Y employees and have a strong pipeline of nearly 775 in training. These higher workforce levels coupled with weaker volumes resulted in a 5% decline in workforce productivity.\nHowever, with more crew resources we were able to lower recrew rates and reduce our borrow outs by roughly half during the quarter. We continue to drive productivity with train length as evidenced by our sequential improvement of 2% while down 1% year over year. This is good progress when you consider the headwinds soft intermodal volumes presented to our train length initiatives. There are many more opportunities ahead for improved efficiency of our railroad, from redeploying brake persons to improving fuel efficiency, including growing train length and right sizing our locomotive fleet.\nThere is productivity to be captured. Wrapping up on slide 12, the well-being and quality of life for our employees remains a top priority, and we continuously collect feedback, collaborate, and look for solutions with our workforce. The historic agreements listed on slide 12 represent the results of our work together. Let's talk through each one of them in detail. Starting with Paid Sick Leave, we now have ratified or tentative agreements with all 13 of our labor unions on this important quality of life initiative. The employee benefit is evident as they receive more paid time off to take care of themselves and their families for the company.\nThis definitely improves the attractiveness of our jobs, but is additional labor expense that will need to be offset. Next, our Crew Consist agreement with SMART-TD provides greater scheduling flexibility and the ability to redeploy brake, or switch persons to work either in or outside the yard. More specifically for our employees, it provides an expedited path for brake persons to become conductors and ultimately engineers if they so desire for the company. It allows us to now reduce brake persons where the work does not require the third person, allowing us to partially offset short-term hiring demands. It also sets the stage to establish ground-based enhanced utility positions with fixed days off and greater certainty about their weekly assignments through scheduled shift work.\nFinally, TE&Y Work Rest provides engineers and conductors with a more predictable work schedule which enhances the quality of life for our employees and their families. Currently, we have a ratified agreement with our engineers that provides an 11 days on, 4 days off work schedule, and we are currently negotiating work rest with our conductors for the company. This enables the railroad to better manage staffing levels as we receive a more predictable available workforce that reduces labor and failure cost, which combines supply, more consistent, and reliable service, enabling long-term growth. We also believe it will improve our retention rate, reducing hiring expenses and lost productivity.\nNow, these agreements come with the cost, which Jennifer will detail more later as we implement them. We expect a larger training pipeline in the near term, as well as elevated workforce levels in the future. When fully implemented, our current forecast is an additional 400 to 600 employees. Ultimately, the long-term benefit of these agreements is the positive impact on our employees and the service we provide for our customers. That enhanced service product will allow us to win in the marketplace.\nTo close, I would like to express my appreciation to both our customers for their support, and the marketing and sales team for their continuous work to capture available demand and win new business. With that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nThanks, Eric, and good morning. Let me start with a look at the walkdown of our second quarter operating ratio and earnings per share on Slide 14, where we've outlined the major drivers. In a 13 June 2023 8-K, we disclosed a one-time ratification payment related to our SMART-TD Brake Person agreement. That $67 million bonus increased our operating ratio 110 basis points and reduced our EPS $0.09. Falling fuel prices during the quarter and the lag on our fuel surcharge recovery programs positively impacted our operating ratio 200 basis points and added $0.04 to EPS.\nWhile improved operations generally allowed us to meet demand during the quarter, that demand was softer, and the combination of an elevated training pipeline, inflation, and negative mix all impacted our core results. Below the line we net to a $0.07 EPS reduction from lower Nebraska state tax rates in 2023, as was noted in that same June 8-K, and a large 2022 real estate sale. Looking now at our second quarter income statement on slide 15, operating revenue totaled $6 billion, down 5% versus last year on a 2% year-over-year volume decline. Included in that is a $34 million reduction in accessorials related to lower intermodal volume and faster equipment turns.\nOperating expense of $3.8 billion was flat, resulting in second quarter operating income of $2.2 billion, which is down 12% versus last year. Other income decreased $70 million, driven by the 2022 real estate sale I mentioned earlier. Interest expense increased 7%, reflecting higher debt levels. Net income of $1.6 billion declined 14% versus 2022, which, when combined with share repurchases, resulted in a 12% decrease in earnings per share to $2.57. Now, looking more closely at our second quarter revenue, slide 16 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue, which totaled $5.6 billion, down 5% versus 2022.\nLower year over year volume reduced revenue 175 basis points. Total fuel surcharge revenue of $707 million was $269 million less versus last year. The impact of falling fuel prices, as well as the lag in our surcharge programs, reduced freight revenues 425 basis points. The combination of price and mix in the quarter increased freight revenue 1,050 basis points. This gain reflects the strong pricing we secured while also recognizing some headwinds from certain coal and intermodal contracts where the pricing is more reflective of current market conditions.\nMix in the quarter remained negative as fewer lumber shipments and more short haul rock shipments outweighed the positive impact of lower intermodal. Turning now to Slide 17, a look at second quarter operating expenses, which total $3.8 billion. Compensation and benefits expense increased $177 million versus 2022, with nearly 40% of that amount reflecting the brake person agreement. Second quarter workforce levels increased 4%, although total transportation employees were up 7%. The active TE&Y workforce is only up 1%, which is a result of our robust hiring and elevated training pipeline.\nExcluding the impact of the one-time bonus payment, cost per employee increased 5% in the second quarter, and we expect it to be up 3% to 4% for the full year. Both second quarter and full year cost per employee reflect the impact of that larger training pipeline, as well as better crew efficiency, which are partially offsetting wage inflation. I'll provide more details on the impact of our new agreements here in just a bit. Fuel expense in the quarter increased 29% on a 29% decrease in fuel prices.\nPurchased services and materials expense increased 5%, driven by inflation, partially offset by decreased subsidiary drayage expense and more moderate locomotive repair expenses. As we stored locomotives in the quarter, equipment and other rents was up 8%, reflecting higher lease expense for new freight cars secured to support business volumes and lower equity income, slightly offset by lower car hire as we improved cycle times and moved less volume. Other expense grew 6%, primarily related to increased environmental remediation accruals, as well as persistently elevated casualty costs.\nTurning to Slide 18 and our cash flows, cash from operations in the first half of 2023 decreased to $3.9 billion from $4.2 billion in 2022. The primary driver was $445 million of payments related to labor union agreements. These payments also impacted free cash flow and our cash flow conversion rate year to date. We returned $2.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and we finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio to 2022 levels at 2.9x as we continue to be A rated by our three credit agencies.\nWrapping up on Slide 19, as you've heard from the team, we're pleased that the service product is enabling us to meet available demand. Unfortunately, as you heard from Kenny, consumer-facing markets like intermodal and lumber remain soft. Additionally, the outlook for coal has weakened since the start of the year, with some near-term opportunities given the extreme heat. Although we still expect to outpace industrial production in certain markets, weak demand for consumer goods has pushed our full-year volume outlook below current industrial production estimates, which are slightly positive.\nUnchanged is our expectation to generate pricing dollars in excess of inflation dollars. To date, we've made great progress repricing our business to reflect the impact of higher inflation, and that momentum will continue as it relates to fuel prices. I should point out that the tailwind we've experienced these past 24 months is now expected to shift to a headwind, both on the operating ratio and EPS front. Assuming fuel prices remain relatively stable, this will likely represent a negative second-half impact of around $0.50 per share.\nEric provided some great context on our labor agreement, and although they clearly come with some upfront costs, we see opportunities as well, starting with the sick leave agreements. Our current forecast is that they will add roughly $50 million to labor expense in the second half of 2023, which is reflected in the cost per crew numbers I quoted earlier. We view these costs as added inflationary pressures that we will reflect in our pricing for the brake person agreement. We've already seen the impact of that upfront payment.\nOur expected payback period is roughly two years as it allows us to redeploy crew personnel, save on costly borrow out positions, as well as reduce our current hiring needs. Implementation of the BLET Work Rest agreement will start over the next month or so, with completion likely in 2024. For this year, we estimate the work rest implementation will cost upwards of $20 million. The challenge in putting a finer point on that estimate is both timing and forecasting employee behavior. We don't yet have an agreement with SMART-TD, and we are still working through some technology and logistics before we start the rollout.\nWhile we certainly expect better availability, better service, and more flexibility with our crew boards providing more access to time off or likely adds employees and expense, the exact math depends on how employees utilize this greater flexibility as well as how we translate better predictability into increased levels of productivity and service that ultimately drive profitable growth on our railroads. Looking at our 2023 capital allocation, our capital plan remains $3.6 billion. We also plan to maintain our current dividend of a $1.30 per quarter, as reflected in our dividend announcement this morning.\nHowever, we have paused share repurchases and don't expect to be back in the market for the remainder of 2023. While there's no change to our long-term capital allocation strategy, which is first dollar into the business, industry-leading dividend payment, and excess cash to shares, we recognize our cash flows are impacted in the current environment. With volumes and cost wrapping up, we are well positioned to operate a better railroad in the second half of 2023 and for the long term. Our strong fundamentals are unchanged and will allow us to generate significant value for our owners as Team UP drives service growth and improved profitability. I'll turn it back to Lance.\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nThank you, Jennifer. As you've heard from the team, the first half of this year has been about laying a foundation for future success. Key to that foundation is safety and the quality of life of our employees. I'm pleased with the progress we've been making on both those fronts. As you heard from Eric, we continue to make the railroad safer. While improvements in our safety metrics are critical, more encouraging are the positive strides we're making in our safety culture. The team has great momentum across our safety programs, which gives me great pride as I step away. I'm also encouraged by the progress we've made to address quality of life issues with our craft professionals.\nReaching historic labor agreements around paid sick leave, crew redeployment, and scheduled work. These agreements drive employee engagement and productivity to produce a better service product for our customers. As I wrap up time as CEO of Union Pacific, I'd like to express my deep appreciation to the board and shareholders of UP for giving me the privilege of leading the company for the past eight years. I'm proud of how the team has positioned Union Pacific to thrive for the years ahead. I'm pleased to say that we provided great value all along the way.\nUnion Pacific is truly a special place. It's full of hardworking, dedicated railroaders who embrace the daily task of building America. It's been my greatest honor to lead this team. Their commitment to be the best for our communities, our customers, our investors, and for each other is remarkable. 160 plus years of success began and continues with our exceptional employees. I can't wait to see what they accomplish next.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nThank you, Lance. On behalf of the employees of Union Pacific, let me offer our gratitude and appreciation for your leadership. We wish nothing but the best for you and your family as you embark on the next chapter. Before we begin Q and A, I'd like to lay out a couple guidelines for the call. In the interest of time and to accommodate everyone, please limit yourself to one question and one question only. We understand that there's great interest in the leadership changes that were announced this morning, and we look forward to those discussions. However, today's call is to discuss our quarterly results, so please focus your questions on the business of the earnings call. With that, Rob, we are ready for your first question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you'd like to ask a question at this time, please press star one from your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants that are using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. Our first question today will come from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Pleased to see you with your question.\n\nAllison Poliniak\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi, good morning. Just want to talk through Intermodal. I know there's obviously consumer weakness there, but is that, I guess, the pace of the decline moderating for you some? I guess with sort of the improved service that you're starting to see and that interest back on the West Coast port, should we start to see or expect to see some of those business wins start to accelerate for you? Just any color. Just thinking that maybe Intermodal starts to perform better for you in the face of even the consumer declines. Thanks.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nYeah. Good morning, Allison. You know, you look at it, I'll let you know. We're really staring down at, you know, consumer spending, and it's been flat the last few months, maybe several months, but it's differentiated as you look at goods versus services. We're clearly seeing, and I talked about it in my opening remarks, less on the goods and more on the services. The other thing that we're watching is just what's happening with demand. We're looking at that in terms of some of the contract rates that are flattened out, and the spot rates that have inched up a little bit. The fact that we have a really strong intermodal service product is a benefit, for we're encouraged as a company.\nI'm encouraged as the commercial leader that even though the imports have been down 23% year to date, we're only down a couple percentage points in talking to our customers. We also believe that they'll be shifting a little bit more back to the West Coast port. That is going to be a gradual shift. That will be a little bit more throughout 2023 and probably into 2024. Clearly, we're positioned here for the upside.\n\nAllison Poliniak\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nPerfect. Thank you.\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nThank you, Allison.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of John Chappell with Evercore ISI.\n\nJohn Chappell\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you. Good morning. I'm not sure if this is for Jennifer or Kenny, but Jennifer, you mentioned in your comments you're making great progress in repricing business to some of these inflationary headwinds that you're facing. Can you give us an idea as to one, kind of where you stand in repricing the book of business to a lot of these new labor deals, and kind of two, just in the softer macro backdrop, how these conversations are going and your confidence in your ability to fully offset the costs.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, John, thanks for that question. I'll start and then pitch it to Kenny. Just as a reminder, when you think about our book of business, call it 25% or so is spot rates, you've got another, call it 30%, 35% or so that is one year or less in duration, types of contracts or arrangement, and the rest then are multi-year deals. There is a cadence to which we're able to touch actively all of our business. Kenny, you want to maybe talk about the market?\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nHey John, the commercial team has done an excellent job articulating the needs for some of the inflationary pressures, even if you want to call it the labor pressures that are there, and really inserting our service product along with those discussions. Now, candidly, in a very pragmatic way, our customers empathize with that. They're taking the same price increases in their markets, so they understand what we need to accomplish. There's a tremendous amount of resources that we're committed to on the CapEx side, which will help out with a consistent and reliable service. We feel very good. There's full confidence in pricing above inflation and making sure we cover those costs.\n\nJohn Chappell\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nGreat. Thank you both.\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nThanks, John.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Chris Wetherbee with Citi.\n\nChris Wetherbee\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nThanks. Good morning, and congrats, Lance, on the next stage of your career here. I guess wanted to take a minute and talk a little bit about. Sort of resources and where you think you are. I know Eric, you talked about pulling some cost levers that were around locomotives and other assets. Jennifer, what should we expect with headcount as we move forward, and sort of when are you appropriately staffed or what you think the volume outlook may be, not just for this quarter, but maybe the next several quarters?\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nYes. I'll maybe let Eric talk about how he feels about crew staffing levels. Just overall in terms of our headcount, you know, we think as you look to the back half of the year, it's probably going to be, I'll call it, flattish or so from where we're at right now, you know, continuing to hire, train, and make sure that we've got a good, robust pipeline so that we're able to serve our customers appropriately. Just from an absolute FTE basis, that's kind of how we see things in the back half.\n\nEric Gehringer\n\nEVP of Operations, Union Pacific\n\nYep. Just picking up from there, Chris, clearly what you've seen in our performance is that we have reduced the amount of hiring that we've been doing right now. We stay very connected with Kenny in his outlook, both for the fourth quarter as well as 2024, and we're going to continue to adjust as we have to what that demand is. It's the same way I view the locomotive work that was accomplished during the quarter. The team stored 200 locomotives, and if you actually look for now and this month, we're actually above 200. We're treating it the exact same way. See the demand that's out there, plan your resource base accordingly.\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nWe should be crystal clear as well. Jennifer and Eric. Chris, there's still work to be done when we look into the third and fourth quarter. Eric outlined some of it in his prepared comments, but we are not yet volume variable with what we're seeing in the marketplace. We took a step towards that in the second quarter. We got to keep taking steps in the third and fourth.\n\nChris Wetherbee\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nOkay, that's helpful. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens.\n\nJustin Long\n\nAnalyst, Stephens\n\nThanks and good morning. Lance, congrats from my end as well. I wanted to ask a question about the outlook for the second half. You mentioned fuel being a headwind, and in addition to that, the labor cost. Do you think EPS in the second half will be lower than the first half? Maybe, Jennifer, you could comment on the run rate for these labor related costs as we move into 2024. I'm just curious if we can take this $50 to $70 million and annualize it or if that is expected to change.\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nJennifer, why don't I start? We're not going to provide some incremental or new guidance as regards earnings into the back half. Jennifer, you did a good job of outlining what the headwinds are, and why don't we unpack that a little bit?\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, I mean certainly the one headwind we did size for you is the $0.50 impact, the negative year-over-year impact we expect to see on EPS from fuel in the third and fourth quarters in terms of moving into 2024. If you think about that $50 million from the sick leave agreements that I mentioned, most of those agreements were really effective in the second half. We had our non ops that started a little bit in the first half. I think you can think about that as being something that will carry over and repeat itself in the first half of 2024.\nBeyond that, in terms of the implementation of the work rest, we're really reluctant to, and really it would be difficult for us to size that more precisely because it is going to depend on the timing of how we roll that out, as well as the employee behavior that we see with that. That is something that we'll just keep you updated on, but want to make sure you do understand that will be a bit of a headwind. As we get greater clarity of that as we go through our rollout and start that rollout, and obviously we still need to get SMART-TD done as well, you know, we'll be in conversation about that.\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nJustin, I think as we look into the back half of this year, improving productivity, the hiring pipeline tones down a little bit. We are still hiring as it probably looks like year over year. About equal, I think, is what Jennifer was saying. Not sure what's going on in the marketplace. We got to, you know, do everything we can to capture all of the business that's available to us. Fuel is going to be a real headwind in the back half. Offsetting that, we get a tailwind from implementing the brake person agreement. As we implement the work rest schedule, I am confident that generates both productivity and service product improvement. The issue is timing and magnitude.\n\nJustin Long\n\nAnalyst, Stephens\n\nGot it. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBrandon Oglenski\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nGood morning and thanks for taking my question. Lance, congrats on a career here. I know you guys want to ask about the quarter, but just looking back, Lance, over your course of being at Union Pacific, what do you think went really right? What do you think maybe could have been done better to keep track, maybe with potentially more volume growth? Looking back and maybe looking forward, what do you think are the biggest challenges or opportunities for the industry? Maybe not even just UNP. Is it technology, regulation, or M and A? Would love to get your thoughts.\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, Brandon, thank you for that question. We'll try to keep this to be the only question on that. I'll try to make the answer fulsome in terms of what am I proud of, what did I think we got right as a team. One is I love the team that we've assembled. It's world class. I love the work that we've done on sustainability. I love the fact that we are an inclusive workforce. You can see it in our board, you can see it on our management team. I like the progress that we've made on safety. We've got more to do there.\nI love the fact that we transitioned from our previous transportation model and way of running the railroad to a PSR model that's a better service product for our customers in terms of what we needed to do better. We were not consistent and reliable through my eight and a half years of serving as the chairman, president, coo. That needs to be remedied as we look into the future. That's exactly what we need to continue to do. We've got a strategy, serve, grow, win together, that's built off the foundation of consistent and reliable service. I am confident we're oriented, organized, and capable of doing that.\nWe've got to prove it to our customers. Because, Brandon, our customers tell us as we demonstrate reliability, there's more of their order book available to us, plus there's more market participants that'll start doing business with us. That's the unlock for growth, and growth is the unlock for significant value creation in the future for everybody. For all of our stakeholders.\n\nBrandon Oglenski\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nThank you, Lance.\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nYep, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRavi Shanker\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks, everyone. Again from me as well. Congrats, Lance, on a great career. Just on the volume guide itself, can you confirm just how much that kind of volume outlook did move? Because you did, you're now going to kind of below a raised benchmark. Just trying to get a sense of how much that did move. Is industrial production the right benchmark for your kind of volume growth in the long term, just given the consumer exposure here, or do we have to look at some combination of IP plus GDP?\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nJennifer, you want to start that?\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, I can start it. You raise a good point, Ravi. I mean, we do think, looking backwards, certainly that industrial production has been a better gauge. You're right, we have great franchise diversity, which we've talked to and Kenny mentioned too. With the growing intermodal portfolio, there are certainly components of that, but it's really driven by consumer spending. A lot of that consumer spending comes from industrial production, so it's hard to really separate from that.\nIn terms of what's changed from where we started the year, certainly coal is something that, with natural gas prices falling as it did late January, early February, that certainly took a big chunk of that demand away from us. Now, you've heard us talk about the heat, and you're seeing that, and you're seeing maybe a little bit of inflection in natural gas prices. We're watching that. You know, the other piece, though, is on that consumer side. You know, onboarding a new intermodal customer coming into the year, we expected that to be a big tailwind to our volumes. Just the way that consumer spending and consumer goods purchases has dropped, that's just, just had a really outsized impact.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nAll I'll say is that we're looking at consumer spending by the week. I feel very encouraged that we have onboarded over the last couple of years a couple transformative. Customers onto our domestic intermodal network. As we see that movement move up, we're going to be in a great position, and that's encouraging for us as a company.\n\nRavi Shanker\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nVery good. Thank you.\nThank you, Ravi.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBrian Ossenbeck\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question first. Just wanted to follow up on pricing to the labor inflation. Do you think getting rate is enough to offset those costs, or do you need to get some productivity benefits from the work rest, the brakeman, and then possibly even the utility role? Just for Kenny, can you comment more about price mix? You mentioned specifically that coal and intermodal pricing were resetting lower in the quarter. Does that continue throughout the rest of the year? You can give some parameters in terms of how to think about that plus mix in the back half. Thank you.\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nKenny. Why don't I start with what about the agreements and getting price and productivity out of them? The short answer, Brian, is we are confident that we can continue to price above inflation. We've just seen a few agreements like paid sick leave add to the inflation in our comp and benefits. Kenny's team is tasked now to get out there and make sure that we recoup that in terms of productivity. The brake person agreement is just a clear path on productivity. We can reduce three people to two people on crews where we don't need three people, and we can either. Redeploy them or lower our hiring demands.\nClearly, just in that one example, there are other examples like in work rest, Brian, we'll be able to get productivity out of that. Today, there's a percentage of our workforce when they're called to take a train, they are not available to us and we don't know that before we call them. That creates failure cost and disruption in the network. I'm going to presume, and I think the experience where work rest schedules are in place, that unpredictability drops dramatically. When that happens, we get better utilization of our assets, and we lower failure costs in the network. The only question for us is order of magnitude and when as we implement.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, a couple things here. Let's just take coal for first up. Yeah. You've heard us talk about this. We do have a couple mechanisms that are in place that allow us and our customers to be competitive with natural gas prices. You know, one of the things that we have seen out there is the fact that there has been a little slight uptick in terms of demand based on the extreme heat that we've seen. We've seen that also impact, again, in the near term, you know, natural gas prices out there. We're seeing more demand out there. We're working closely with Eric and his team as we speak to add more sets and add more inventory into the network.\nWe're looking at the forward curves, just see how long that will last. We're always looking at that, and we're looking at that by the week. Switching to domestic intermodal, on the pricing side, we like the fact that we have our customers that are competitive in the marketplace and that we're competitive against Truck. Some of those mechanisms will go up as things tighten, and some, during a loose market like where we are now, might move down a little bit. The key is to make sure that we can capture the volume against Truck and make sure that we're competitive.\n\nBrian Ossenbeck\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nAll right, thanks, Kenny. Congratulations, Lance.\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nYep, thank you, Brian.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Fadi Chamoun with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\n\nFadi Chamoun\n\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nYes, good morning. Thank you. Congratulations, Lance. Question on the opportunity for volume. If you think about a zero GDP environment over the next, say, 12 months, what can service improvement deliver in terms of growth? Where are maybe some of the verticals? You think that you can make a difference in the service level and ultimately start to see. More idiosyncratic opportunities to grow the business?\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, Fadi, thanks for the question. Let's just walk through. You know, if you look at our outlook slide, and I'll supplement that with a few more specifics. You know, on our biodiesel, the renewable diesel market, you know, we've got seven different facilities on us. We're going to land another facility here by the end of the year. We're very encouraged by that. That's a key part of our growth strategy. We mentioned that a couple years ago during investor days. Very proud of our commercial team for securing that construction. You know, our rock business, for example, those are areas where Eric's team is just delivering great service, and that's showing up.\nIn terms of carloads, we're adding a few more that's there. We're seeing more carloads that are coming on because of that. Some of that is market related. There's just more infrastructure that's out there. You talk about the service product. We look at auto parts. You know, coming out of Mexico, we've seen a pretty fast and upcoming grower, growing EV producer that we're growing with on the auto parts side that we're excited about. We've secured a new automotive OEM on our line back in the spring that has brought business to us. That same OEM will be bringing on business in the first quarter.\nBoy, we're pretty excited there. Last but not least, I'll just say that overall, the team has been engaged on bringing new business in different ways. We have a new industrial park that's going to be landing in the Buckeye, Arizona area. That's great, and we've got a customer that will be doing reusable plastics. You think about the ESG connection, so we can create our own business development with the service that I mentioned with Eric. We're excited about it.\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nIt's proving, Kenny, your BD pipeline is up What?\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific",
    "content2": "It's up around 20% to 25%. The team is just doing a fabulous job going out there and expanding the market.\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nThat's in a down,\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nThat's in a down market. Hey, we're pumped up about it.\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nThat's good.\n\nFadi Chamoun\n\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nI'm surprised you didn't mention intermodal being one of the opportunities that service get better. Is this because the truck market competitiveness right now, you need a little bit of support there, or is there more to it than not?\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nOkay, well, you're going to get me riled up today. First of all, we talked about a couple transformative wins that we feel good about. I'll tell you as a management team, bringing on Inland Empire, which is a new product, bringing on a new Port Houston service product that Eric has given us with five new lanes, bringing on Twin Cities. Absolutely, we feel good about domestic intermodal. At some point, you need the demand to be there. What you're hearing me say is that we're prepared as that demand comes on, and we're adding new products, we're adding new services, we're adding new customers. We're excited.\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nKenny, at the risk of making this drag on too long, you should mention Falcon Premium too.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nOh. Let me back up and just say, you know, there's been a lot of debate out there, Lance, in the marketplace. We feel very good about the service products that we have with Falcon Premium. In a broader sense, there are other Class I's associated with that. It's not just one Class I, it's the other Class I's that we're interacting with too that we feel good about. We've got a shorter route, short structure, we've got a better schedule, we've got the relationships with the customers. Eric and his team are continuously improving that service product. We're encouraged how that looks in the future.\n\nFadi Chamoun\n\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nThank you.\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nThanks Fadi.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\n\nAmit Mehrotra\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThanks. Hi everyone. Lance, congrats all your success. Wish you the best, I guess. Eric and Jennifer, I know borrow outs have been pretty expensive, and I think last time we checked you had like 250 borrow outs in the network. Can you just give us an update on that?\nIt feels like maybe that's an opportunity over the next six to nine months. Just generally in terms of non-fuel costs, it feels like the network is running a little bit heavy on non fuel costs, I know there's obviously cost inflation and labor inflation, some idiosyncratic things, but as maybe the volume comes back and you can become much more volume variable, is there an opportunity to kind of hold the line on the non-fuel cost structure given some of the positive things that you can do on the outs and kind of other cost items that are proving more stubborn right now?\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah. Thank you for the question. Let's back up in time. As we came into the year, think about our Q1 earnings report. We were talking about borrow outs in the context of, while we were making great progress in our hiring, we still had pockets of the system, specifically about seven locations where we were utilizing borrow outs because of the difficulty to hire. Now in any given year, there's some level of borrow outs used even in just dealing with seasonality. For example, the grain harvest that comes in the fall. If you look at the quarter, what we've reported is that we've taken our borrow out count down by 50% approximately.\nNow that is a process that continues as we look for volume to continue to grow. We have those as options. But as we're looking every week, to your point, to control our cost, those are ones that we adjust literally on a weekly basis. There may be a place as we fast forward three months, four months, six months where you may use them in very small numbers. But our goal is to reduce our borrow outs as quickly as we possibly can. As far as the non-fuel cost, it follows the same recipe that we've shared before. One, we just finished talking about it, which is how we think about our labor cost and ensuring that we're being conscious of that.\nTwo, you go to your next expensive cost. Well, at least outside of fuel, is you're going to look at your locomotive fleet. The reduction that we've made in the quarter is a strong move in the right direction. The reduction we've even made in July is another strong move on top of that. And we'll look forward to reporting to that in future quarters. So all eyes on we want to grow the business and we need to be volume variable until we see more of that growth coming.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah. I mean, just to build on one, Eric's saying there is, you know, if you look across all of our cost categories, setting depreciation aside, we know we have opportunities within all of those to be more efficient. You know, as we continue to improve cycle times, that has a very direct flow through in terms of our car hire expenses on the purchase services and materials side. You know, Eric mentioned the locomotives. But there's other opportunities we have in there to work on our costs, and even comp and benefits with some of the headwinds that we know we have; there's opportunities to be more productive and use that crew base more efficiently.\nYou know, to your point, volume can certainly be a friend when it comes to the cost structure. But I think the fact that you've seen us make some progress as volumes are going down, and you saw us build train length even as volumes came down, and in particular intermodal volume, those are the things that we're going to keep working on on here. Well, always, but certainly in the back half of the year to continue to drive better efficiency and get better alignment between the resources and the cost structure and the volumes that we're moving.\n\nAmit Mehrotra\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah. Okay, makes sense. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBascome Majors\n\nAnalyst, Susquehanna\n\nLance, as you wrap up your eight years as UP's chairman, president, and CEO, how do you expect the push and pull of the senior decision making process between marketing, operations, and HR change with those roles split between three people and Beth elevated from just leading the HR and sustainability efforts into that newly standalone president position? Thanks.\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, Bascome, thanks for the question. First you gotta note Jim Vena is our CEO. He runs the company. Beth reports to Jim. So I don't anticipate any meaningful dislocations or push-pull created by org structure. Having said that, there are some natural creative tension in the business all the time. There's creative tension between the operating team and the commercial team. There can be creative tension between the team that is controlling versus the team that's spending. You know, just, you can name any number. The most important thing is, is we've got a fabulous operating executive joining us as our CEO.\nHe's got a great track record and he's going to be laser focused on making sure that we're providing the best service product to our customers so that we can translate it into growth. He's going to do a very good job of making sure the team works together. We're working well together today. I anticipate we'll be working well together a month forward from now. And Beth's role is going to be making sure that she's supporting all of that effort effectively through workforce resources, through the work we do with communities, through the work we do in DC, so I anticipate better, not worse, as we move forward.\n\nBascome Majors\n\nAnalyst, Susquehanna\n\nThank you.\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nYep. Thank you, Bascome.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nHey Greg, good morning. Congrats, Lance, team, and the board on the next steps and on naming Jim as CEO. So many moving parts with the labor agreements. Obviously Jen ran through some of the cost side from the pay increase last year to what you're now adding on after the main contracts. Maybe can you take a minute, walk us through some of the benefits that you see. And I presume these are all Union Pacific add-ons, you know, maybe differentiate what is UP add-on versus the industry and then just thoughts on your outlook. I think you removed the operating ratio from your target. Is there a thought on the scale that you want to put together on costs or are we just leaving that off altogether? Thanks.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah. So I'll start off, Ken. So when we did our 8-K in June, we took the operating ratio improvement off the table for the year and that isn't changed. Certainly you heard us talk about some of the headwinds that we have. So we are not, you know, with the addition of the labor expenses volumes, you know, moving away from us and then obviously some fuel headwinds relative to OR in the back half of the year. We don't expect year over year improvement. You know, our task and kind of touched on this a little bit with the question from Amit is to get better, you know, from where we sit today.\nAnd I'm not going to forecast, you know, what our OR is going to be in the back half of the year. But we're going to work really hard to improve each and every day. And that's both in terms of being more productive with that cost structure as well as going out and selling in the marketplace and doing all we can to drive profitability on that side. I don't know. Eric, you want to?\n\nEric Gehringer\n\nEVP of Operations, Union Pacific\n\nYep. On the agreement side. So if we start with sick days, you know, the opportunity that Lance mentioned I'll just reinforce is we see the opportunity to improve the attractiveness of our jobs, and as a result of that, it can have a positive impact on how we do our hiring. If you go to the brake person deal, clearly the biggest opportunity there is to reduce brake person labor in line with where the jobs are no longer needed. It also allows us to partially offset some of our hiring in the short term. And of course we get the benefit of establishing a ground-based enhanced utility position.\nAnd as Jennifer pointed out, the payback period on that is approximately two years. And if you look right now, we're about 60% the way through that implementation. Certainly on the 11 and 4 scheduled work, it really boils down to improved availability, as Lance pointed out, and more efficiently managing our staff levels with more latitude on how we do that under this new agreement.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nThank you.\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nYep. Thank you, Ken.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nScott Group\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning and best of luck to you Lance. Jennifer, just wanted to make sure I understood the answer to that last question. Do relative to, like, the 62 adjusted OR in Q2, are you not, you're just not giving any color or are you saying it's probably going to get worse, the OR second half versus that 62? I'm just not sure what you're trying to message there and then just Kenny. CN last night was just talked about raising their expectations for the upcoming US grain harvest just with some better rain recently. Just your thoughts on how you think about the grain harvest in your territory going forward? Thank you.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, so going back to. You're really asking a sequential question, and again we had a 63 reported, or if you're stripping out the brake person agreement, you know, that was 1.1 points in the quarter. You know, if you look at what we have done historically as a company, you tend to see some of your better margins in the third quarter tends to go up a little bit. Then, in the fourth quarter, when you're just thinking about kind of that normal seasonality, we are going to work to make sequential improvement. I'm not telling you that we're making sequential improvement, but that is the task that has to be ahead of us.\nWe have to work to improve the cost structure, and we've already made some progress. I think you certainly saw that. I know it's a little bit of a messy quarter with all that was going on in it, but when you strip some of the noise out, there was, you know, particularly when you're comparing. Q1 to Q2. We did make margin gains, not year over year, but sequentially we did make some gains there. So I think that's the way to think about it into the back half of this year.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nScott, I tell you we look at the weekly crop report and call it five, maybe six weeks ago, wasn't looking great. Since then we've had rain in areas that we serve and participate in. It's looking much better. You heard in my comments that, you know, we think there's an opportunity for incremental grain in Q4, and so we're staring that down and working with Eric's team to make sure we can capture it.\n\nScott Group\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you guys. Yep.\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nThank you Scott.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your question.\n\nWalter Spracklin\n\nAnalyst, RBC\n\nBest of luck there, Lance. On the future. Just a question here. Wrap up here on coal, I know you'd indicated that that was an area of discrepancy from where you were looking at before. Really on the revenue per carload, revenue per RTM, that's taken a notable step down. I know your peers have talked a lot about CSX, talked about a 15% decline in their rates on coal. Now a lot of that is tied to export met, which is not in your mix. But you did see a similar type of step down $0.01 per RTM. Just wondering if that's something that you expect to continue. For the foreseeable future. What's driving it? What could make it change up or down from this point going forward?\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nYes. So Walter, we did mention that in my prepared remarks, that that was a bit of a headwind, and you've heard us talk before that we do have a portion of our coal contracts that have some mechanisms that link that pricing to natural gas pricing, and what's happened with natural gas pricing that certainly is flowing through in terms of some of the rates. We did that similar to intermodal in terms of keeping competitiveness for those plants that are dispatching into the grid, keeping them competitive. And we're continuing to ship coal, still profitable for us, but there is some pricing differentials there.\nSo it really depends on how you see the rest of the year playing out in terms of how that's going to look. But if you just compare last year's natural gas prices to where it's at this year, that tells you there's going to be some ongoing pressure there.\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, I think the differentiation there is sequential versus year over year, and year over year is going to continue to see some pressure. Sequential, we've seen as much pressure as we're going to see.\n\nWalter Spracklin\n\nAnalyst, RBC\n\nSo kind of flat from this point. Going forward.\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nYou know, should be, I mean, obviously watch natural gas prices.\n\nWalter Spracklin\n\nAnalyst, RBC\n\nSure. Yep. Okay. Thank you. Thanks very much.\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nYep. Thank you, Walter.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJason Seidl\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nHey, thanks, operator. First off, Lance, good luck in the future and congrats to both Jim and Beth if they're listening in, some quick things. One, wanted to look a little bit at regulation. You know, we've seen the FRA now is looking for a public comment period on train weights and lengths. Wanted to know if you guys think this is sort of a precursor for more regulation from them. And two, maybe if you could talk a little bit about anything anticipated on reciprocal switching. And lastly, squeezing in here, Jennifer, when was the last time you guys didn't repurchase shares in a quarter?\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nJennifer, you want to go first, then I'll take the others.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah. So, you know, I would go back to Q2 and Q3 of 2020 when the pandemic hit and there was such a drop in volumes. We paused our share repurchases then for at least a couple. I'm pretty sure for the full Q2. Part of Q3 or part of Q3, I think, is when we restarted that. So, you know, we manage the share repurchase piece with our excess cash, and that's always been the flexible part of our shareholder return, and that's how we're managing it today.\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah. And Jennifer, we've been crystal clear that we turbocharged our excess cash by using the capacity of our balance sheet. That capacity now has been largely used. It's all about growing cash from operations and operating income at this point.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nExactly, Lance. Obviously with some of the earnings pressures we're facing this year, that's not giving us that incremental capacity we've seen.\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nSo, Jason, talking about what's going on in Congress and at the STB in Congress, the Rail Safety Act, we've been crystal clear about things in there that we think are appropriate. Like there should be some additional regulation and laws regarding. The preparedness of emergency responders, the information that's at their disposal. We believe the same is true on tank car standards. There's an opportunity to pull forward tank car standard improvements. We also think there's room for. Regulation to step into wayside detection. We've done a ton of things in wayside detection voluntarily. It is not regulated. If it were to be regulated appropriately, that makes some sense.\nThere's some things in the Rail Safety Act that don't make sense, like coupling train size with safety on our railroad. Mainline and siding derailments are down 25% plus while train size is up 20% over the last, call it, four years. There's just no correlation in our experience between safety and train size. Likewise, there's no correlation anywhere in the world between train crew size and safety that should be left to collective bargaining and what technology enables. As we look at Congress, that's what we're thinking about. As we look at the STB, as we've said before, we help them understand how the railroad industry works, how our reinvestment works.\nWhen it comes to reciprocal switching or forced open access, we help them understand that that would have a real negative impact on investment. It would not improve service product. They should be very, very careful as they think about whether or not that should be implemented and how to implement it.\n\nJason Seidl\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nLance, Jennifer, appreciate the thoughts.\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nThanks, Jason.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nYeah, good morning. You know, Lance wanted to wish you well, in the next thing you do retirement, whatever it is. Let's see. I guess one just clarification, I think. Kenny, you commented earlier on intermodal yields. Our Q3 Are we expecting more sequential pressure on revenue per car in intermodal in Q3? So, that's just clarification. And then the broader question, really, when we look at the industry, I think historically there was opportunity from productivity and price to improve margin. Certainly UP did that in a massive way over, I don't know, 15 years, right? But it just seems like there's this inflation in the cost base and pricing is good but not enough.\nSo do you think it's fair to look forward and say, look, margin improvement is really about volume, and without volume you may have a tough time to improve the margin. I think that seemed to be true, maybe for industry, not just for Up, but I don't know if you have thoughts on that and then maybe the clarification on intermodal. Thank you.\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah. Tom, let me start with your essential question about the three legs of the stool we forever talked about. We drive margin improvement through productivity, price, and the benefit of volume. And to your point, we've leaned heavily on productivity and price historically. And we said we're in a transition where we're going to have to lean more heavily on volume. But that's not going to be the only leg of that three-legged stool. Tom, when you. It's still true. While inflation got on us quick, the way our. Contracts and our business relationships are set. It takes us a while to recoup that inflation through price.\nKenny's team has been crystal clear that they own the requirement to do that and they're following through. But it's going to take a little while. On productivity, like we just demonstrated this quarter, we created a new agreement. Makes all the sense in the world. It came with a roughly $70 million price tag. Immediately implementing it is going to get the payback and will be paid back in about two years. So, Tom, the opportunity for productivity, price, and volume to still drive margin improvement exists. We're in kind of a unique environment right now regarding timing, and we are for sure going to have to rely on volume more heavily going forward.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, just a short answer. No, we're not expecting increased pricing pressures on that intermodal side of the house.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nOkay, so you think stable revenue per car, Q3 versus Q2.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nThat's how you should be thinking about it.\nOkay, great. Thank you.\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nThank you, Tom.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBen Nolan\n\nAnalyst, Stifel\n\nYeah, thanks. So, Kenny, you mentioned the Falcon Express a little bit ago. I'm curious if you have. Early takes, how are things thus far developing the way that they thought you would, or that you thought they would or any early indications of how you're expecting it to play out over the back half of the year?\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nI think you're asking, have we seen any success stories? And yes, we've had some early wins. Of course, the focus is over the road. I mean, the size of the prize rail is a very small part of that traffic that's moving out of Mexico or into Mexico. As I also said, as we continue to improve the speed and consistency there, we expect to make more inroads.\n\nBen Nolan\n\nAnalyst, Stifel\n\nOkay. So far, as expected.\n\nKenny Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing and Sales, Union Pacific\n\nYeah. I mean, we're getting more reception from customers that are open to opening their books and giving us a shot for sure.\n\nBen Nolan\n\nAnalyst, Stifel\n\nAll right, I appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nThank you, Ben.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please receive your question.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nHey, good morning guys. Lance, congratulations and good luck. So, Eric, with the 400 to 600 heads that we need to add in for the part time off or paid time off agreements, how many of those people are going to be on property by the end of this year?And then how should we think about reconciling that with the flat headcount number from Q2?Are we making reductions in operations or is it coming out of other areas? Thanks.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, so I'll actually jump in on that one. So it is when you think about the 400, 600 incremental that we talked about from the labor agreements, that's incremental from what we would have otherwise been staffing at a given volume level. So that is completely consistent with and taken into account with when we also say as we look at headcount levels now to the end of the year, we think, you know, not a whole lot of change.\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nSo, Jennifer, it's for all agreements.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nIt's for all agreements which again we're going to be implementing over not just the back half of the year this year, but well into 2024.\n\nEric Gehringer\n\nEVP of Operations, Union Pacific\n\nWe also pointed out in our commentary that that number is going to be highly impacted by the behavior that comes from these agreements. And we're not ready today to say exactly what that will look like. We'll continue to work to it though.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nEric Gehringer\n\nEVP of Operations, Union Pacific\n\nBut he had the back half of his question there, which was about offsets. Yeah, the offsets really haven't changed from the ones that I answered a few moments ago. They really focus on the availability on the 11 and 4, and they focus on the brake person about actually removing brake persons off of positions that are no longer needed.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nSo if you were to say like how much of the 4 to 600 is in this year versus coming into next year? Is it a quarter? Is it half? Is there a way to directionally sort of indicate how much is going to be in this year?\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nYou know, again, it does depend on what the behavior is, but there will be some amount, you know, maybe a quarter to a half. That's probably not a bad estimate. You know, sick leave, obviously that part we have fully done now. So any heads that we think that we need to add for that, that's done. Obviously we get offsets this year too with the brake person agreement. So there's a bit of a netting effect, and then it really is pace and timing of the BLET work rest getting SMART-TD, and of course we will because it's really the training piece of it, right?\nSo we're going to need to, for BLET, we need to put more engineers in the training pipeline, and with that you need to continue to hire some conductors. So there'll be some portion, you know, 50% might be at the max side, I would say, but probably some, and there is a safe bet.\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nJennifer, I think you'd said this, but your total guidance sequentially for the back half labor being flattish includes all that.\n\nJennifer Hamann\n\nCFO, Union Pacific\n\nYes, it absolutely includes all of that.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nAll right, thank you.\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question is from the line of Jordan Allinger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJordan Alliger\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah. Hi. Morning. More of an operational question. Curious Trip Plan Compliance, where do you think that needs to go? Both at the manifest and intermodal level, but specifically on intermodal, is the way to think about modal conversion accelerating tied to a certain level of Trip Plan Compliance for that, and if so, you know, where do customers really take note and you start to see an acceleration of market share gains. Thanks.\n\nEric Gehringer\n\nEVP of Operations, Union Pacific\n\nYeah, thank you for the question, Jordan. So we've been very consistent. When you think about the intermodal TPC, you're talking about a number that starts with an eight, and when you're thinking about manifest and autos, it starts with a seven. Now that's highly informed and continues to be evolving. We went through a very large engagement with our customer base through Kenny's team towards the back end of last year that has informed this year and how we think about that more specifically to segments within those customers.\nNow that work continues because go to Old Dominion. As we've reinforced before, we know that our customers are sensitive, in fact very sensitive to our service. That's why we're encouraged by the progress we made. In no way are we saying that our service is where it needs to be now. It was a great step in the right direction. We've got more work to do.\n\nJordan Alliger\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nLance Fritz\n\nChairman, President and CEO, Union Pacific\n\nThank you, Jordan. Thank you all for your questions and thank you for joining us on the call today. We appreciate your interest and your ownership in Union Pacific, and I hope you have a great rest of your day. Take care.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions]\nAs a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Fritz. You may begin.\n\nLance M. Fritz\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Union Pacific Corp.\n\nThank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to Union Pacific's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me today in Omaha are Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Eric Gehringer, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Jennifer Hamann, our Chief Financial Officer.\nThe story of the past quarter for Union Pacific is one of resiliency, battling heavy snow, arctic temperatures, flooding and tornadoes, the team maintained service levels and exited the quarter positive trajectory, persevering through those harsh conditions our employees delivered for our customers, which demonstrates again that our people are the foundation for the great things that lie ahead.\nTurning to the first quarter results. This morning, Union Pacific is reporting 2023 first quarter net income of $1.6 billion or $2.67 per share. This compares to first quarter 2022 results of $1.6 billion or $2.57 per share. Our first quarter operating ratio of 62.1% deteriorated 270 basis points versus 2022 driven by excess costs, inflation and lower volumes.\nA series of weather events throughout the quarter had a real impact on our ability to capture demand, especially within our coal business as well as added cost to the network. Through those events, our service products showed greater and greater resiliency, quickly rebounding each time as we were better positioned with crew resources to support our customers. And with April month-to-date, freight car velocity is about 200 miles per day.\nWe are operating a network that is positioned for consistent and reliable service. While a more difficult start to the year than expected, it doesn't reduce our expectations for 2023. As you'll hear from the team, all of our goals are still in front of us.\nLet me turn it over to Kenny for an update on the business environment.\n\nKenyatta G. Rocker\n\nExecutive Vice President-Marketing & Sales, Union Pacific Corp.\n\nThank you, Lance, and good morning. Freight revenue for the first quarter increased 4% driven by higher fuel surcharges and solid pricing gains partially offset by a 1% decline in volume. Bulk volumes were muted in the quarter as weather and service-related challenges impacted shipments. Additionally, weaker market conditions for premium also drove lower volume for the first quarter. However, our strong focus on business development and new business wins partially offset by some of that decline.\nLet's take a closer look at each of these business groups. Starting with bulk. Revenue for the quarter was up 4% compared to last year driven by a 7% increase in average revenue per car reflecting higher fuel surcharges and solid core pricing gains. Volume was down 3% year-over-year.\nGrain and grain products volume was down 1%, driven by weaker export grain shipments as world demand for U.S. grain has softened, coupled with drought impacts affecting supply in UP's SAAR region. Fertilizer carloads were flat in the quarter.\nStrong export potash was offset by a decline in phosphate volume from weather conditions delaying shipments. Food and refrigerated volume was down 6% due to reduced beer imports and weather conditions negatively impacting both fresh and can shipments. And lastly, coal and renewable volumes was down 4% compared to last year driven by weather interruptions and associated service challenges that impacted our locomotive and crew resources.\nMoving on to industrial. industrial revenue was up 5% for the quarter driven by a 5% improvement in average revenue per car due to higher fuel surcharges and core pricing gains. Volume for the quarter was flat. Industrial chemicals and plastics volume was down 2% year-over-year driven by lower industrial chemical shipments due to challenged industrial production and reduced housing demand.\nMetals and minerals volumes continued to deliver year-over-year growth. Volume was up 3% compared to last year primarily driven by growth in construction materials and increased flat sand shipments, along with new business development wins.\nForest products volume declined 19% year-over-year driven by soft housing starts and lower corrugated box demand for nondurable goods shipments. However, energy and specialized shipments were up 6% versus last year driven by strength in demand for LPG and petroleum products. These gains were partially offset by fewer soda ash shipments due to weather and service-related challenges.\nTurning to premium. Revenue for the quarter was up 3% on a 1% decrease in volume compared to last year. Average revenue per car increased by 5%, reflecting higher fuel surcharge revenue and core pricing gains. Automotive volumes were positively driven by strengthening OEM production and dealer inventory replenishment for finished vehicles.\nDomestic intermodal business wins were offset by a weak freight and parcel market driven by high inventory, increased truck capacity and inflationary pressures. On the international side, despite weakened imports, more container ship inland versus the first quarter of last year, resulting in year-over-year growth.\nSo now moving on to Slide 7. Here is our outlook for the rest of 2023 as we see it today. Starting with our bulk commodities, we expect grain to be challenged near term as export demand softens and supply tightens throughout this crop year. However, as we look ahead towards the next crop season in late fall, we're encouraged by the initial forecast.\nFor coal, low natural gas prices and a milder winter allow utilities to build more inventory. We are experiencing normal softness through the shoulder months. Looking further out in the year, demand will largely be dependent on natural gas prices and summer weather.\nLastly, we expect biofuel shipments of renewable diesel and their associated feedstocks to grow due to solid market demand, new production coming online and business development wins.\nMoving on to industrial. The forecast for industrial production is to shrink in 2023, and the demand is getting weaker in forest products. However, we expect to see continued strength in construction and metal with new business wins.\nAnd finally, for premium, we expect near-term challenges in the intermodal market from high inventory levels, inflationary pressures and weak consumer spending as people shift back to spend more towards services than goods. We will be closely watching for a potential market uptick in the latter part of the year. In addition, we expect automotive growth to continue, driven by strong OEM production and dealer inventory replenishment.\nSo to wrap up, we are facing economic uncertainty and a tough price environment in a few of our markets, but we expect to see strength in some other commodity areas. Our diverse portfolio allows us to maintain our pricing guidance.\nTo capture more demand, we are working closely with Eric and his team to be agile and have resources available in locations where we need them. I am confident that the team's relentless focus on business development will drive volumes to exceed industrial production this year.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance.\n\nEric J. Gehringer\n\nSVP of Transportation, Union Pacific Railroad Company Inc.\n\nThank you, Kenny, and good morning. Starting on Slide 9. We continue to make great strides on safety, as evidenced by our 10% improvement in derailment performance for the first quarter. While encouraging progress on safety, our goal remains a future with zero incidents and zero injuries. .\nWe've made progress on derailments by implementing state-of-the-art technology, like precision train builder and our geometry inspection fleet. This is on top of our network of more than 7,000 wayside detection devices and our 24/7 operating practices command center.\nFurther supporting our efforts, in March, the industry announced a set of key safety actions. These include the installation of additional wayside detectors and enhanced standards for how we proactively use and share critical data. In addition, the industry is expanding efforts in first responder training and deploying technology to provide real-time railcar condition monitoring.\nThe railroad industry remains one of the safest transportation modes in the nation. And through our capital renewal program, Union Pacific invests almost $2 billion annually back into its network to further improve safety.\nNow moving to Slide 10 for a look at our current operational performance. As Lance mentioned, Mother Nature made her presence felt across the Union Pacific -- season, bringing extreme weather in many forms. UP crews in California battled flash flooding, persistent mudslides and heavy snow. The Central Sierras, for example, recorded over 700 inches of snow this season.\nThat's 222% above historical averages. Employees across our central corridor in upper Midwest portions of our system also worked through prolonged blizzards, ice and arctic temperatures. These events challenged our ability to maintain a fluid operating state on specific portions of the system.\nHowever, thanks to the dedication and proactive efforts of our employees, the network quickly recovered after each event. And as the chart on Slide 10 demonstrates, we're exiting the quarter on a positive trajectory versus the congested state we were entering this time last year.\nOur April month-to-date metrics show a network in a healthier state with freight car velocity at 200 miles per day, intermodal TPC in the high 70s and manifest TPC on the rise as well. That result also reflects our hiring efforts as we focus on backfilling attrition and targeting locations where crude challenges persist.\nWe currently have around 1,000 employees in training, which is an increase of approximately 500 versus last year. In addition, we have utilized borrowed out employees to address hard to hire locations and get crews where needed.\nNow let's review our key performance metrics for the quarter, starting on Slide 11. Sequentially, we held our ground through the obstacles of the quarter. Both freight car velocity and manifest and auto trip plan compliance made slight improvements from last quarter's results.\nIntermodal trip plan compliance remained effectively flat as we battled resource imbalances driven by weather interruptions. With our current traffic mix, freight car velocity consistently running around 200 to 205 miles per day will strengthen our entire service product, including bulk, manifest and intermodal performance.\nTurning to Slide 12 to review our network efficiency metrics. Locomotive productivity dropped 5% versus first quarter 2022. However, it remained flat sequentially from last quarter's results as we continue to operate a larger locomotive fleet in an effort to support the recovery of the network.\nIn the second quarter, the team is focused on moving more freight and rightsizing the fleet. To that point, we are in the process of storing over 100 units to at the ready status.\nFirst quarter workforce productivity declined 6% to 991 daily miles per FTE driven by an increased number of trainees and lower volumes. Our strong training pipeline supports our ability to capture available demand and future growth while managing attrition and reducing borrowed out employees. As employees graduate from training, we expect productivity to improve.\nTrain length is effectively flat compared to last quarter's results. Lower intermodal traffic, coupled with extreme cold temperatures across the northern tier of our network presented a headwind to our train length initiatives for the quarter. The team remains committed to strengthening the network while we're covering loss productivity.\nWrapping up on Slide 13. The success drivers for 2023 remain unchanged. And the entire team is dedicated to building on the momentum gained as we exited the quarter. We remain committed to addressing employees' quality of life feedback and are pleased with the recent agreements regarding paid sick leave. We will continue to work diligently in finding win-win solutions that enable a strong service product and provide our employees with more consistent work schedules.\nIn addition, as you heard from Kenny, we continue to aggressively look for opportunities to strengthen volumes. With the service product demonstrating resiliency, we have added back train sets and targeted freight cars to the network to capture available demand. I am confident that the foundation we're laying will provide a safer, more consistent and reliable service product to meet the growth needs of our customers.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance.\n\nJennifer L. Hamann\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Union Pacific Corp.\n\nThanks, Eric, and good morning. We'll start on Slide 15 with a look at our first quarter income statement. Operating revenue totaled $6.1 billion, up 3% versus 2022 despite a 1% year-over-year volume decline. Other revenue decreased 5%, driven by $30 million of increased subsidiary revenue, which was more than offset by a $50 million reduction in accessorials.\nLower intermodal volume and greater supply chain fluidity drove the accessorial decline. Operating expense increased 8% to $3.8 billion, resulting in first quarter operating income of $2.3 billion, down 3% versus last year. Below the line, other income increased $137 million year-over-year, largely driven by a $107 million one-time real estate transaction that contributed $0.14 to earnings per share. Interest expense increased 9%, reflecting higher debt levels.\nNet income of $1.6 billion was flat versus 2022 and but when combined with share repurchases, resulted in a 4% increase in earnings per share to $2.67. Our first quarter operating ratio increased 2.7 points to 62.1%. Following fuel prices during the quarter and the lag on our fuel surcharge programs positively impacted our operating ratio by 190 basis points.\nCore results offset the fuel benefit and were a 460 basis point drag to operating ratio. Included in that is the impact of weather, which is difficult to quantify, but between both lost revenue and additional expense, we estimate to be in excess of $50 million.\nNow looking more closely at first quarter revenue. Slide 16 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue, which totaled $5.7 billion (sic) million, up 4% versus last year. Lower year-over-year volume reduced revenue, 150 basis points. Total fuel surcharge revenue of $883 million added 475 basis points to freight revenue, reflecting the lag in our programs.\nThe combination of price and mix increased freight revenue 75 basis points as ongoing pricing actions were mostly offset by our business mix. Fewer lumber shipments and more short-haul rock shipments were the primary drivers of the negative mix.\nTurning now to Slide 17 and a summary of our first quarter operating expenses, which totaled $3.8 billion (sic) [ million ]. Compensation and benefits expense increased 7% versus 2022. First quarter workforce levels increased 4% with transportation employees up 5%, the result of our dedicated hiring efforts over the last 12 to 15 months.\nCost per employee only increased 3% in the quarter as wage inflation was partially offset by a larger training pipeline.\nDuring the first quarter, we signed agreements with the majority of our labor unions to provide paid sick leave to our employees. These agreements became effective April 1 and represent just under half of our craft professionals. Assuming we are able to reach agreements across the board, we would expect cost per employee to be up mid-single digits for the year, consistent with what we discussed in January.\nFuel expense grew 7% on a 9% increase in fuel prices as we moved less freight. Our fuel consumption rate deteriorated 1% as the impact of our fuel conservation efforts was more than offset by reduced network fluidity. Purchased services and materials expense increased 16% driven by maintenance of a 3% larger active locomotive fleet and inflation.\nEquipment and other rents was up 9% as a result of increased car hire expense related to elevated cycle times, and the other expense line grew 6% related primarily to higher environmental remediation costs.\nTurning to Slide 18 and our cash flows. Cash from operations in the first quarter decreased to $1.8 billion from $2.2 billion in 2022. The primary driver was Presidential Emergency Board back pay settlements paid in January which totaled $383 million. That payment also impacted our quarterly cash flow conversion rate and free cash flow, with both roughly in line with last year's performance when you exclude that payment.\nIn the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And we finished the first quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.9x as we continue to be A-rated by our 3 credit agencies.\nWrapping up on Slide 19, we are maintaining our 2023 full year guidance to achieve volumes above industrial production, price gains in excess of inflation and operating ratio improvement. Our plans for capital allocation also are unchanged.\nAs with every year, there are puts and takes to how the year plays out. While 2023 started a bit slower than expected, I need to remind everyone, it is only April 20. We have 8.5 months in front of us and many opportunities with volume, service and productivity.\nBefore I turn it back to Lance, I'd like to express my thanks to the UP team. We are skilled in running the outdoor factory that is our railroad. But Mother Nature seemed very focused on testing those skills this year given the extremes we faced, and yet the team forged ahead, keeping the network fluid and our customers served. Fantastic work by everyone.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Lance.\n\nLance M. Fritz\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Union Pacific Corp.\n\nAnd thank you, Jennifer. As Eric discussed, we continue to make great strides on safety. Derailments have been in the spotlight recently. The entire industry understands the critical role we play in support of the communities we serve. In fact, since 2000, Union Pacific's mainline derailments are down almost 30%, helping make this past decade the safest for the rail industry. Working collaboratively and proactively, the industry can further improve on that safety record.\nLooking forward, as you heard from Kenny, consumer-facing markets are in rough shape right now. Importantly, though, there remain opportunities to capture additional demand in a number of markets. The entire team is executing a plan to capture those additional carloads supported by an improved service product.\nFinally, with Earth Day approaching, I'd like to highlight the actions Union Pacific is taking to protect our planet. At the end of 2022, we released our second annual climate action plan, highlighting updates to achieve our greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.\nThis includes our goal of net zero emissions by 2050. Over the past year, we've turbocharged our locomotive modernization program. We've committed to both battery and hybrid electric locomotive, and we've increased our biodiesel blend to over 5%. And we're being recognized for that work.\nThis past year, Union Pacific was selected as a member of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the first time. And we were the highest ranked railroad in the transportation category on Fortune's most admired companies. Union Pacific is committed to being a sustainability leader, driving long-term value for all of our stakeholders.\nBefore turning to Q&A, as it relates to the CEO search process, the Board is fully engaged in executing its duty to identify the next leader. And I can say from personal experience what a wonderful job it is to be at the helm of a company like Union Pacific.\nI'll continue to lead the team until the new CEO is identified, and I'm energized by what we can accomplish in the coming months. as well as the great potential this company has for years into the future.\nWith that, let's open up the line for your questions.",

Welcome to the Union Pacific Fourth Quarter 2022 Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Mr. Fritz, you may now begin.\n\nLance M. Fritz\n\nCEO, Chairman, and President, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nThank you, Rob, and good evening, and welcome to Union Pacific's fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me today in Omaha are Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Eric Gehringer, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Jennifer Hamann, our Chief Financial Officer.\nThe fourth quarter and 2022 overall were challenging for Union Pacific and our employees. The lengthy labor negotiations tested our workforce while customers felt the impact of our service issues. Two things are critically important as we turn the page to 2023. First is the trend line of improving freight car velocity since late summer, although acknowledging there were bumps along the way. And second is how we move forward, establishing consistent service for our customers day in and day out and demonstrating to all stakeholders our commitment to excellence.\nNow turning to our fourth quarter results. This morning, Union Pacific is reporting 2022 fourth quarter net income of $1.6 billion or $2.67 per share. This compares to fourth quarter 2021 results of $1.7 billion or $2.66 per share.\nOur fourth quarter operating ratio of 61% deteriorated 360 basis points versus 2021, driven by continued service challenges and the impact from winter weather. For the full year, reported operating ratio finished at 60.1%, deteriorating 290 basis points, driven by operational inefficiency, inflation and higher fuel prices.\nThe entire Union Pacific team recognizes that 2022 did not beat expectations. Crew constraints in critical locations impacted by shifting demand had a real impact on our performance. As you'll hear from Eric, we are building resiliency into the network through hiring efforts, shifting critical resources and better operations to address that shortfall. And you're seeing those benefits manifested in how the network has responded since Thanksgiving through the ups and downs of extreme winter weather.\nThese challenges aside, we achieved volume growth for the year. We demonstrated our commitment to meet customer needs with business development wins that are critical to long-term financial success. The recent onboarding of Schneider is a great proof statement of delivering on that commitment.\nWe also made significant progress towards our climate goals. In 2022, we increased our biofuel blend to over 4.5% on pace to achieve our 2030 target of 20%. This is a key initiative in achieving our 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. In addition, for a fourth consecutive year, we improved our fuel consumption rate on a year-over-year basis, lowering at 1% to an all-time record. This helped our customers avoid 23.4 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions by using rail versus truck. Union Pacific will continue to be a rail leader in sustainability.\nNow let's start with Kenny for an update on the business environment.\n\nKenyatta G. Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing & Sales - Union Pacific Railroad Company, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nThank you, Lance, and good morning. Fourth quarter volume was up 1% compared to 2021. Gains in our premium business group were partially offset by a decline in our bulk area. However, freight revenue was up 9%, driven by higher fuel surcharges and strong price.\nLet's take a closer look at each of these business groups. Starting with bulk. Revenue for the quarter was up 7% compared to 2021, driven by a 10% increase in average revenue per car, reflecting higher fuel surcharges and solid core pricing gains. Volume was down 3% year-over-year. Grain and grain products volume was down 2%, driven by a decrease in export grain shipments. Despite strong market demand, we faced service and weather challenges that slow shuttle cycle times as well as having a tough 2021 comparable.\nFertilizer carloads were down 15% year-over-year driven by reduced shipments of potash due to market softness along with another tough comp the 2021 fourth quarter. Food and refrigerated volume was down 8% due to reduced shipments of finished beverage product and their associated raw materials.\nAnd lastly, coal and renewable carloads remained flat in the quarter as our ability to capture demand from favorable natural gas prices was impacted by weather and service challenges, particularly in late December.\nMoving on to Industrial. Industrial revenue was up 5% for the quarter, driven by a 5% improvement in average revenue per car due to higher fuel surcharges and core pricing gains, somewhat offset by a negative business mix. Volume for the quarter was flat. Industrial chemicals and plastic shipments were down 4% year-over-year driven by lower industrial chemicals demand.\nMetals & Minerals volumes continued to deliver robust year-over-year growth, driven in part by our business development efforts. Volume was up 8% compared to 2021, primarily driven by an increase in frac sand shipments and growth in construction materials. Forest products volume declined 17% year-over-year, driven by weak corrugated box demand and softness in the housing market.\nEnergy and specialized shipments were up 2% compared to 2021, driven by an increased waste and soda ash demand, partially offset by pure petroleum shipments from regulatory changes in Mexico markets.\nTurning to premium. Revenue for the quarter was up 15% on a 3% increase in volume. Average revenue per car increased 12% due primarily to higher fuel surcharge revenue and core pricing gains. Automotive volume was up 9%, driven by strengthening production and inventory replenishment for finished vehicles.\nIntermodal volume was up 2%, driven by increased international shipments, mainly due to an easier comp in 2021. Although domestic volumes decreased due to soft market demand, declining truck rates and increased over the roll capacity, the aforementioned negative impact was partially offset with the Schneider conversion in December.\nNow as we look ahead to 2023, you can see the macro indicators that we are watching along with inflation and interest rates. And you'll notice that we have some challenges with industrial production, imports and housing starts. However, we remain optimistic that we will be industrial production with our strong focus on business development.\nSo now moving on to Slide 8. Here is our market outlook for 2023 as we sit here today. Starting with our bulk commodities, we expect a challenging year were grain based on drought conditions, which will affect crop availability in [UP-serve] origin. However, we expect to see growth in coal, even though natural gas prices have come off their highs, low inventories will continue -- will support continued demand. We are keeping a close eye on natural gas prices, given the price impact of our index-based contracts.\nIn addition, we expect biofuel shipments for renewable diesel to continue to grow due to solid market demand, new production facilities coming online and business development wins.\nMoving on to Industrial. The forecast for industrial production is to shrink slightly in 2023 and the demand is softening in forest products. However, we expect to see continued strength in metal with new business wins.\nAnd lastly, for premium, we expect the entire intermodal market to be challenged, both international and domestic by high inventory levels, lower truck rates and temper consumer spending. We expect to outperform that market, however, through our new business with Schneider as well as opportunities to grow with other private asset owners and our strong IMC partners. We expect automotive growth to be another bright spot in this segment driven by production strength and inventory replenishment.\nAs I wrap up my comments, I want to take a moment to express my gratitude to our customers and the operating team. Over the past month, extreme weather events impacted large portions of our network, and I want to thank our employees who safely worked around-the-clock in harsh conditions to keep the railroad running for our customers.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance.\n\nEric J. Gehringer\n\nEVP of Operations, Union Pacific Railroad Company Inc.\n\nThanks, Kenny, and good morning. Starting on Slide 10. Safety is at the foundation of everything we do. We have enhanced our training programs and are working to solidify our safety culture through ownership and personal accountability. These efforts drove an 18% improvement in our 2022 full year personal injury safety results, which is at the lowest level in 5 years. We look to leverage these gains to improve derailment performance in 2023. While good progress overall, our goal remains returning each employee home safely at the end of the day.\nMoving now to Slide 11 for a look at our current operational performance. Our attention throughout 2022 was focused on onboarding the necessary crew resources to operate a fluid network and meet customer demand. I would like to thank our partners and workforce resources and the operating team for their great work in recruiting and onboarding new team members. We currently have around 600 employees in training as our pipeline is significantly stronger than it was a year ago.\nThat being said, our hiring efforts will continue in 2023 as we backfill for attrition and target locations across the northern region, where crude challenges persist. In the near term, we will continue to utilize borrow outs to supplement crew shortfalls.\nAnother key element in increasing fluidity is the reduction of excess inventory, which builds the foundation for a strong and resilient service product. I am proud of the progress we made, which would have not been accomplished without the dedication and tireless work of the commercial and operating teams. Mother Nature threatened to derail some of that progress in the last weeks of December with blizzard conditions and extreme cool temperatures across much of the network. However, our team responded, and we quickly rebounded demonstrating greater resiliency that we can build on in 2023. With current freight car velocity around 210 miles per day and trip plan compliance measures demonstrating sequential improvement, we look to maintain that progress as volumes strengthen into 2023.\nNow let's review our key performance metrics for the quarter, starting on Slide 12, which continue to trail 2021's results. Both freight car velocity and manifest and auto trip plan compliance were flat sequentially from last quarter's results. Importantly, however, intermodal trip plan compliance did improve 11 points sequentially as supply chain congestion alleviated, resulting in less stack containers at the inland ramps. Near the end of the quarter, we successfully onboarded the Schneider Intermodal business and remain actively engaged to manage that transition.\nTurning to Slide 13 to review our network efficiency metrics, which also like 2021's fourth quarter measures. Locomotive productivity, workforce productivity and train length all declined sequentially driven by lower volumes in the back half of the quarter and winter weather challenges. Entering 2023, the team remains focused on strengthening the network while recovering lost productivity.\nMoving to Slide 14. We continue to exercise discipline in our capital spending while delivering value to our shareholders. We are targeting 2023 capital spending of $3.6 billion, pending final approval by our Board of Directors. While the projected increase from last year, we expect capital spending to remain in line with our long-term guidance of less than 15% of revenue. As always, our first capital dollars will support our existing infrastructure. This spending will harden our infrastructure, renew older assets and support safe operations.\nFor 2023, in addition to a higher inflationary environment, the elevated capital spending will be driven by increased locomotive spending of $175 million. With 430 modernized locomotives currently in the fleet, we will bring the total modernized to over 1,000 by the end of 2025. These modernizations not only help build resiliency into the network through enhanced reliability and productivity, but also further the progress towards our carbon emission reduction goals.\nWe continue to invest capital for growth. On the intermodal front, we are investing in additional capacity at the Inland Empire terminal, and we will be expanding our footprint in Kansas City. And on the capacity side, we will continue to invest in projects like sidings that drive productivity, allow us to handle more car loadings and improve our network efficiency.\nWrapping up on Slide 15. We are dedicated to improving our service product in 2023. Slide 15 provides a road map of the key activities to achieve that goal. We demonstrated meaningful improvement in our safety results in 2022 through an enhancement to our safety management systems and continue towards the goal of world-class safety. Additionally, we recognize the importance of quality of life concerns that our agreement professionals voiced. We continue to work closely with union leadership to find win-win solutions that enable a strong service product and provide our employees with more consistent work schedules.\nAs we sustain improved operational performance, use our resources more efficiently and reduce variability, we will generate productivity. At the same time, technology enhancements will drive further productivity and support a consistent and reliable service product for our customers.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance.\n\nJennifer L. Hamann\n\nEVP and CFO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nThanks, Eric, and good morning. Let's start with fourth quarter income statement on Slide 17. Operating revenue in the quarter totaled $6.2 billion, up 8% versus 2021 on a 1% increase in volume. These gains were more than offset by a 14% increase in operating expense, which totaled $3.8 billion. Excluding the impact of higher fuel prices, expenses were up 7% in the quarter.\nOperating income of $2.4 billion declined 1% versus 2021. Other income remained strong, up 11% to $92 million, driven by higher real estate income and pension benefit which offset 2021's $36 million gain on the sale of a technology investment. Interest expense increased 13% as average debt levels increased more than $3 billion year-over-year. Net income of $1.6 billion declined 4%. But when combined with share repurchases, resulted in essentially flat earnings per share at $2.67.\nFourth quarter operating ratio of 61% increased 360 basis points, driven by higher inflation and operating costs. Falling fuel prices during the quarter had a favorable 20 basis point impact.\nLooking more closely at fourth quarter revenue, Slide 18 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue, which totaled $5.8 billion in the fourth quarter, up 9% compared to 2021. Volume contributed 75 basis points. As fuel prices stayed high year-over-year, fourth quarter fuel surcharge revenue also remained elevated, totaling $975 million and increased freight revenue 850 basis points. Strong core pricing gains that exceeded inflation dollars were more than offset by a negative business mix, resulting in a 25 basis point decline in freight revenue. Fewer forest product shipments combined with higher international intermodal and rock shipments drove the negative mix.\nTurning to Slide 19 for a summary of our fourth quarter operating expenses. The largest driver of the overall expense increase was again fuel, up 43% as fuel prices rose 46%. Combating these higher prices, we continue to drive productivity, improving our fuel consumption rate 2 points to produce a fourth quarter record. Our compensation and benefits expense was up 10% versus 2021. Total fourth quarter workforce levels increased 4%, reflecting our hiring efforts throughout 2022. Cost per employee grew 6%, primarily driven by wage inflation.\nIn addition, cost pressures from network inefficiencies in the form of higher overtime and borrow out costs continued in the quarter. Purchased services and material expense remained elevated, up 18%, driven by cost to maintain a larger active locomotive fleet, volume-related purchase transportation expense at our loop subsidiary and inflation.\nEquipment and other rents increased 3%, driven by the impact of slower cycle times on car hire expenses. Other expense was flat in the quarter as higher travel and casualty expenses were offset by a partial insurance recovery related to 2021's bridge fire as well as lower state and local taxes.\nLooking to 2023, we have opportunities across the board to improve efficiency and that's job 1 as we recover our service product. Although we still expect to be more than volume variable with our workforce, we will continue to aggressively hire crews in critical locations and to backfill attrition. For 2023, we expect our all-in inflation to be around 4%, while cost per employee is expected to increase in the mid-single digits as elevated wage inflation is partially offset by productivity.\nDepreciation expense should be up around 3% versus 2022. And below the line, similar to last year, we expect other income to remain elevated versus historic levels driven by higher real estate and interest income. Finally, we expect our 2023 annual effective tax rate to be around 24%.\nMoving to Slide 20 with a quick recap of full year 2022 results, which are shown on the slide as reported and include the impact of the third quarter PEB adjustment. Revenue was up 14%, an annual record, driven by increased fuel surcharges, strong pricing gains and 2% volume growth. Record operating income increased 6% to $9.9 billion, which includes a net increase of just under $700 million from fuel surcharges. Our full year reported operating ratio of 60.1% deteriorated 290 basis points versus 2021. Network inefficiencies and inflation were the primary components of the degradation with the PEB adjustment and higher fuel prices impacting the full year operating ratio by 30 basis points and 20 basis points, respectively.\nEarnings per share finished the year at a record $11.21, a 13% increase versus 2021 results. Our consistent and disciplined approach to deploying capital back into our railroad coupled with volume growth that produced increased operating income drove a 90 basis point improvement in return on invested capital to a record 17.3%.\nTurning to shareholder returns on the balance sheet on Slide 21. Full year cash from operations increased over $300 million to $9.4 billion, a 4% increase from 2021. The first priority for our cash is capital investment, which finished 2022 at $3.4 billion or just under 14% of revenue. Our cash flow conversion rate finished 2022 at 82% and free cash flow totaled $2.7 billion. Although a decrease of nearly $800 million versus 2021, that includes an almost $700 million increase in cash capital, a more than $350 million increase in dividend payments and $70 million for PEB backpay settlements. Our dividend payout ratio for 2022 was around 45%, in line with our long-term target as we rewarded shareholders with a 10% dividend increase in the second quarter and distributed nearly $3.2 billion.\nWe also returned cash through strong share repurchases, buying back 5% or $27 million of our common shares at an all-in cost of $6.3 billion. In total, between dividends and share repurchases, we returned $9.4 billion to our owners in 2022, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to deliver significant shareholder value. We closed out the year at an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.9x, consistent with our results to maintain strong investment-grade credit ratings as we finished the year A rated by Moody's, S&P and Fitch.\nTurning now to our view on 2023. We think about the year ahead in 2 parts, what we can control and what we cannot. We don't control the markets we serve. And as you saw on Kenny's slide of economic indicators, it's a mixed bag in terms of expectations. We do control the way we compete in those markets with the great foundation of the UP franchise. Onboarding Schneider is clearly the marquee win for 2023 and with Kenny's team posting profitable wins across the board, we are positioned to further outperform the market. In 2023, that will be evidenced by car loadings that exceed industrial production.\nAnother area where we don't have direct control is the current inflationary environment, which continues to be elevated. However, we know we have it within our control to improve operations. As you heard from Eric, it's imperative that we improve the reliability of our service product, while regaining lost productivity. In addition, as we've demonstrated consistently, we expect to generate pricing dollars that exceed inflation dollars in 2023.\nAssuming current fuel prices and our thoughts on volume, productivity and price, we expect to improve our full year 2023 operating ratio on a year-over-year basis. That said, there will be a lag to fully offset the impact of inflation on our profitability until we are able to actively touch or reprice our business while also further improving productivity.\nTurning to capital allocation. We continue to make significant investments into our business with an expected 6% increase in capital investments versus 2022 to $3.6 billion. Growth is the cornerstone to the long-term financial success of Union Pacific, and we are continuing to invest in opportunities that support that strategy. In addition to the locomotive and intermodal investments Eric described, we also are investing to support carload growth. The remainder of our capital allocation plans remain unchanged, rewarding our owners with an industry-leading dividend payout of around 45% and returning excess cash through share repurchases.\nWith our balance sheet currently leveraged at the desired levels, the amount of cash available for repurchases will be less than in prior years and predominantly funded from cash generation. With the new year, comes new opportunities. And by focusing on what we can control, we are confident in our ability to provide strong value to all of our stakeholders in 2023.\nSo with that, I'll turn it back to Lance.\n\nLance M. Fritz\n\nCEO, Chairman, and President, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nThank you, Jennifer. Let's wrap up on Slide 24. We made great strides on personal safety in 2022, and it's imperative we continue that momentum. The commitment made by our employees to care for one another has been exceptional, resulting in our best employee safety metrics in 5 years. We look to further translate these gains into better derailment performance in the upcoming year. We understand that safety is about culture, and it's about engagement. Listening to and responding to our employees' needs and ideas will continue to improve our safety performance.\nOur robust hiring pipeline and improving network fluidity strengthen crew availability. That leads to a more efficient and better service product that enables us to recapture lost productivity.\nOver the past couple of years, we've demonstrated our commitment to customer-centered growth as reflected in business development wins. And while growth in 2023 may be challenging given the uncertainty of the economic backdrop, we will continue to make strategic capital investments in support of our long-term growth objectives.\nOur fundamentals for long-term success have not changed, powered by our best-in-industry employees and franchise a strategy built for profitable growth and a more efficient and reliable service product, Union Pacific is poised to do great things in 2023, and we are ready to prove it.\nSo with that, let's open up the line for your questions.",

Welcome to Union Pacific's Third Quarter Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you. Mr. Fritz, you may now begin.\n\nLance M. Fritz\n\nCEO, Chairman, and President, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nThank you, Rob, and good morning, and welcome to Union Pacific's third quarter earnings conference call. With me today in Omaha are Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Eric Gehringer, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Jennifer Hamann, our Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore discussing results for the quarter, I want to thank our employees for their tireless efforts over the past several months to improve service levels. I'd also note the dedicated service of our craft professionals throughout the recent, very lengthy labor negotiation. The new agreements based on the Presidential Emergency Board recommendations reward our employees for their hard work, and with roughly half of our unions ratifying agreements, we are looking forward to complete this process and move forward.\nNow turning to our third quarter results. This morning, Union Pacific is reporting 2022 third quarter net income of $1.9 billion or $3.05 per share. These results include the impact of a $114 million charge for prior period estimates related to the new labor agreements. Excluding that charge, adjusted net income is $2 billion or $3.19 per share. This compares to third quarter 2021 results of $1.7 billion or $2.57 per share.\nOur adjusted third quarter operating ratio of 58.2% is 190 basis points higher than 2021. Costs related to higher inflation and ongoing network inefficiencies were offset by fuel surcharge revenue, volume growth and strong core pricing gains to produce adjusted operating income growth of 13%. We made real progress during the quarter to increase network fluidity and better meet customer demand. And as you'll hear from the team, we're continuing to take steps in the fourth quarter to better meet that demand and drive costs from the network. While the year hasn't played out as originally planned, our volumes have outpaced our peers, demonstrating the growth mindset that we're instilling within our organization.\nSo with that, let me turn it over to Kenny for an update on the business environment.\n\nKenyatta G. Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing & Sales - Union Pacific Railroad Company, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nThank you, Lance, and good morning. Third quarter volume was up 3% compared to a year ago as carloads increased across all 3 of our business segments. Although overall volume was up, we undoubtedly had less demand on the table as we continue to improve service across the network. Freight revenue was up 18% driven by higher fuel surcharges and strong pricing gains.\nLet's take a closer look at each of these business groups. Starting with bulk, revenue for the quarter was up 16% compared to last year, driven by a 14% increase in average revenue per car, reflecting higher fuel surcharges and solid core pricing gains. Volume was up 2% year-over-year. Coal and renewable carloads grew 5% year-over-year driven by continued favorable natural gas prices and 2 contract wins that started on January 1.\nGrain and grain products volume was up 3% with strong domestic feed grain and increased biofuel shipments for renewable diesel. Fertilizer carloads were down 7% year-over-year due to reduced shipments of export and domestic consumed potash. And lastly, food and refrigerated volume remained flat in the quarter.\nMoving on to Industrial. Industrial revenue was up 15% for the quarter driven by a 4% increase in volume and an 11% improvement in average revenue per car due to higher fuel surcharges and core pricing gains. Energy and specialized shipments were down 3% compared to 2021, driven by pure petroleum shipments, primarily due to regulatory changes in the Mexico market. Volumes for Forest Products was down 2% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower demand for corrugated boxes. This was partially offset by positive year-over-year lumber shipments.\nIndustrial Chemicals & Plastic shipments were up 8% compared to 2021 due to new business wins, customer expansion and market demand. Metals and minerals volumes continued to deliver robust year-over-year growth. Volume was up 7% compared to last year, primarily driven by an increase in frac sand shipments, growth in construction materials and metals business development.\nTurning to Premium. Revenue for the quarter was up 25% on a 3% increase in volume. Average revenue per car increased 21% due primarily to higher fuel surcharge revenue and core pricing gains. Automotive volume was up 19%, driven by strengthening production and inventory replenishment. Finished vehicles increased by 33%, and auto's parts increased by 11% against a softer comparison from last year. Intermodal volume was flat. Domestic intermodal was down 3% due to softening demand driven by a 16% decline in parcel shipments. However, International volume strengthened by 4% from ocean carriers, shipping more freight to inland terminals.\nNow moving to our outlook for the rest of 2022. At a macro level, we will be closely watching our markets to see how inflation and interest rates will impact our overall volume. But here is where we sit today with our markets. Let's start out with our bulk commodities. We expect biofuel shipments for renewable diesel to continue to grow due to solid market demand and business development wins.\nFor coal, we anticipate continued favorable natural gas prices to generate demand for both domestic and export shipments. However, the opportunity to capture demand is dependent on the available resources. And our outlook for grain is also dependent on our service recovery. But as we've mentioned before, we have a tough comp in the fourth quarter as exports were strong last year.\nMoving on to Industrial. The forecast for Industrial production is decelerating, and demand is softening in forest products. However, we expect construction to be a positive due to strong project demand in the south. And lastly, for Premium, we are closely monitoring domestic intermodal demand as spot truck rates fall and inventories climb. We expect parcel and truckload demand to remain soft as consumer preferences have shifted more to experiences versus goods.\nWe're also watching the international markets closely, but we expect to be positive in the fourth quarter due to easier comps. And we expect growth in automotive to be driven by improving supply for parts and inventory replenishment. Overall, we still foresee a favorable demand environment for the fourth quarter. Crew availability continues to improve, which will help us capture more growth and support our business development wins as we head into 2023.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance.\n\nEric J. Gehringer\n\nEVP of Operations, Union Pacific Railroad Company Inc.\n\nThanks, Kenny, and good morning. Turning to Slide 9. Our year-to-date safety results are demonstrating meaningful and sustained improvement compared to 2021.\nSafety impacts every facet of our business: our employees, our customers and our shareholders. While our safety management system is promoting the right culture, our #1 priority remains returning every employee home safely at the end of the day.\nTaking a look at our current network performance on Slide 10. Our operating metrics steadily improved through the third quarter, aided by improving crew availability from hiring initiatives, lower recrew rates and improved crew utilization. Our hiring and training pipeline is strong. To date, we have graduated 890 employees and have an additional 518 currently in training, all expected to graduate by January of 2023. We have now hired 1,408 new transportation employees, exceeding our goal for the year.\nFreight car velocity is approaching 200 miles per day, up from its low in April. Even more encouraging, the improvement came while moving 10,000 more weekly carloads. By utilizing approximately 250 borrowed out employees and adding new graduates to some of our challenged crew locations, we have been able to add more coal and grain sets back into the network. We also reduced our recrew rates from a peak of 11% in April to now around 7%. Exiting the third quarter, the network is in a more solid and fluid state than earlier in the year. Going forward, we are building upon these improved results to drive excess cost from the network.\nNow let's review our key performance metrics for the quarter, starting on Slide 11, which remained challenged when compared to 2021 even considering the relatively easy comparison from last year's wildfire and weather events. However, both freight car velocity and manifest and auto trip plan compliance strengthened sequentially from last quarter's results.\nIntermodal trip plan compliance was flat sequentially and remains impacted by persistent supply chain challenges, resulting in elevated chassis street times and container ramp to well. We continue to make progress at the West Coast ports as the number of stacked containers decline.\nTurning to Slide 12, to review our network efficiency metrics. During the third quarter, as performance improved, we were able to remove and stage locomotives across the network to improve overall fleet utilization. As a result, locomotive productivity did improve sequentially although remains below last year's metric. Entering the fourth quarter, as we continue to improve train speed and other measures, locomotive productivity will continue to strengthen as well. Third quarter workforce productivity was flat as both the labor force and car miles increased.\nTrain length improved 1% compared to third quarter 2021 as the team utilized longer trains to handle increasing volumes. We now anticipate completing an additional 4 sidings in 2022 on top of the 20 sidings in our original plan. This will bring the total sidings completed since 2019 to 80. These sidings are a key enabler of our ability to effectively use our resources and drive productivity.\nWrapping up on Slide 13. I'm encouraged by the progress we've made, but our work is not yet done. Using our PSR principles, we will further improve our service product and build a more resilient network. Our trajectory to this point reflects the great team we have at Union Pacific, and my thanks goes out to everyone for their efforts and dedication.\nTo finish 2022, we remain focused on further reducing excess inventory, safely improving operational efficiency and using our crews and locomotives even more effectively. Ultimately, as is always the goal, we need to run the network and manage our assets in a more than volume variable manner. To that point, we are storing excess international intermodal well cars as the expected levels of volume did not materialize.\nWhile at the same time, to capture demand in other areas, we are bringing cars out of storage. Additionally, to support bulk demand, we will continue hiring programs and send additional borrowed-out employees to crew-challenged locations in our northern region. As we wrap up the year and I look forward, I am confident that the foundation we are building will provide a better service product for our customers.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance.\n\nJennifer L. Hamann\n\nEVP and CFO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nThanks, Eric, and good morning. I'm going to start on Slide 15 with a walk down of our third quarter operating ratio and earnings per share. Our reported operating ratio of 59.9% and earnings per share of $3.05 includes a $114 million change in estimate related to the Presidential Emergency Board recommendation and subsequent ratified and tentative labor agreements. At a high level, the $114 million charge negatively impacted third quarter operating ratio by 170 basis points and reduced EPS by $0.14. For more granular information on the charge, please refer to the appendix slide at the back of the presentation deck. It's important to note, however, that while our general wage accruals weren't far off the PEB recommendation, we did not accrue for the $1,000 annual bonus payments.\nCore results in the quarter continue to reflect inflation and network inefficiencies as our operating ratio was unfavorably impacted 310 basis points but contributed $0.20 to EPS. Importantly, we did make sequential core improvement in our operating ratio of 40 basis points versus the second quarter. Decreasing fuel prices in the quarter and the roughly 2-month lag in our fuel surcharge program favorably impacted our quarterly operating ratio by 70 basis points and added $0.37 to EPS. Finally, third quarter results also include the favorable comparison to last year's weather and wildfire event, which adds 50 basis points to OR and $0.05 to EPS.\nLooking now at our third quarter income statement on Slide 16, where we provide both reported and adjusted numbers that exclude the impact of the labor charge. Throughout my remarks, I will speak to the adjusted results. Operating revenue totaled $6.6 billion, up 18% versus 2021 on 3% year-over-year volume growth. As we have seen throughout the year, higher fuel prices are the primary contributor to higher operating expenses, which increased 22% to $3.8 billion. Excluding the impact of higher fuel prices, our expenses were up 10% in the quarter.\nThird quarter adjusted operating income totaled $2.7 billion, a 13% increase versus 2021. Other income increased $86 million driven by higher real estate income, including a $35 million gain on sale and pension benefit. Income tax expense increased 13% as a result of higher pretax income, partially offset by corporate income tax rate reductions in 3 of our operating states. As a result of those changes, we now expect our full year tax rate to be around 23%. Adjusted net income of $2 billion increased 18% versus 2021 and adjusted earnings per share was up 24% to $3.19. Operating revenue, operating income, net income and earnings per share were all quarterly records.\nLooking more closely at third quarter freight revenue, Slide 17 provides a breakdown, which totaled $6.1 billion, up 18% versus 2021. Year-over-year volume gains, supported by our business development efforts and sequentially improving operational fluidity, increased freight revenue 325 basis points.\nFuel surcharge revenue impacted revenue 13 points, reflecting the impact of higher year-over-year diesel prices and the 2-month lag in our recovery program. Total fuel surcharge revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter. Strong pricing gains when combined with a slightly negative business mix drove 200 basis points of freight revenue growth. Lower petroleum shipments, combined with higher rock and auto part shipments, contributed to the negative mix.\nFrom a price standpoint, we have now lapped the positive benefit from coal contracts indexed to natural gas prices. So the year-over-year benefit is minimal. And as we experienced in the second quarter, network fluidity limited the upside for both price and mix. Setting these headwinds aside, we are confident that we will yield price dollars that exceed inflation dollars even with a higher inflationary hurdle than expected at the start of the year.\nMoving on to Slide 18, which provides a summary of our third quarter adjusted operating expenses where the primary driver again this quarter was fuel, up 71% on a 67% increase in fuel prices. While we saw fuel prices come down some in the quarter, our average quarterly fuel price was $3.96 per gallon, only $0.07 lower than second quarter's average price. Our fuel consumption rate achieved an all-time quarterly record in the quarter, improving 1% versus 2021 as a result of productivity gains and a more fuel-efficient business mix.\nLooking closer at the other expense lines, adjusted compensation and benefits expense was up 12% versus 2021. This includes an additional $19 million related to this quarter's accrual for wage increases and annual bonus. Total third quarter workforce levels increased 3%. Management, engineering and mechanical workforces grew 3%, while train and engine crews were up 5%, primarily reflecting year-over-year increases in our training pipeline.\nAs you heard from Eric, we have now exceeded our 2022 hiring goals. Cost per employee came in higher than anticipated, up 8%, primarily driven by wage inflation. We also experienced continued cost pressures related to network inefficiencies with higher overtime and borrow-out costs. For the fourth quarter, we expect the year-over-year increase to be around 7%, in line with tentative and ratified wage increases. Purchased services and materials expense remained elevated, up 23%, driven by higher cost to maintain a larger active locomotive fleet, volume-related purchase transportation expense associated with our Loup subsidiary and inflation.\nEquipment and other rents decreased 1% driven by higher equity income that more than offset increased car hire expenses. Other expense grew 18% in the quarter, a bit higher than we anticipated as a result of increased casualty expenses associated with freight loss and damage and personal injury. For the fourth quarter, we expect other expense to be flat versus 2021, as we are anticipating the receipt of an insurance settlement for last year's bridge fire. Overall, inflation and cost inefficiencies offset the benefits of volume leverage and resulted in fuel-adjusted incremental margins of just 2%. Although not the results we know we can achieve, it still reflects positive progress from the second quarter and provides us with momentum as we wrap up 2022.\nTurning to Slide 19 and our cash flows. Cash from operations through the third quarter increased 9% to $7.1 billion. Our comparable cash flow conversion rate was 80% and free cash flow totaled $2.1 billion. Although this is a decrease of $517 million versus 2021, it includes $745 million of increased cash capital spending and $317 million in higher dividends. With the increased capital spending to date, we now expect full year 2022 capital to be around $3.4 billion, up slightly from our prior guidance, but well within our overall guidance of less than 15% of revenue.\nYear-to-date, shareholders have received $7.9 billion through dividends and share repurchases. This level of cash returns demonstrates our firm commitment to rewarding shareholders with strong returns. Related to share repurchases, we now expect to buy back roughly $6.5 billion in 2022. Although we repurchased shares at a strong pace in the third quarter and expect that to continue for the remainder of the year, we have been impacted by higher-than-anticipated inflationary pressures and service costs.\nLastly, we finished the third quarter with a comparable adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.8x as we continue to maintain a strong investment-grade credit rating. In fact, during the quarter, we received an upgrade from Moody's to A3, and we are now A-rated across all 3 credit agencies. Also during the quarter, we issued $1.9 billion in debt, which included $600 million of green bonds, our first such issuance.\nWrapping up on Slide 20. With a little over 2 months left in the year, we are focused on building upon the positive momentum of the third quarter. The operating team is executing on its plan to improve operating performance and capture additional unmet customer demand. As you heard from Kenny, however, markets are softening a bit and that is resulting in a slight reduction in our overall volume expectations, now more in the range of 3% growth for full year 2022. With more clarity on the impact from the new labor agreements, our operating ratio outlook also has changed. We now expect our reported full year operating ratio to be around 60%.\nAs we close out 2022, attention is quickly turning to 2023. While we are not yet ready to share our outlook, it is important to reiterate our long-term view. Our focus on generating strong cash returns and improving ROIC remains unchanged, and we are firmly committed to achieving the goals established at our May 2021 Investor Day of a 55% operating ratio and incremental margins in the mid- to upper 60s. Since establishing those targets and even achieving them in a few quarters, the environment has changed. With higher inflation and a weaker economic outlook, the road to achieving those milestones now is a bit longer, but our road map to success is still the same. Supported by our great employees and the foundation of UP's strong and diverse franchise, we will leverage volume, pricing and productivity to achieve those goals.\nWith that, I'll turn it now back to Lance.\n\nLance M. Fritz\n\nCEO, Chairman, and President, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nThank you, Jennifer. As you heard from Eric, our year-to-date safety metrics have shown good sustainable improvement, which is very encouraging. However, the most important metric is for all of our employees to go home safely every day. We remain relentless in pursuit of that ultimate and most important goal.\nOn the sustainability front, during the quarter, we announced a $1 billion agreement with Wabtec to modernize 600 locomotives over the next 3 years. This is a key investment as we work to reduce our carbon footprint and meet our 2030 SBTI targets. This investment also supports what our customers need as each modernized locomotive is significantly more reliable. This is true game-changing for Union Pacific.\nAs we close out 2022, we look to capitalize on the demand available to us as we sequentially improve operational efficiency. And although we're still putting together our 2023 plan, we like our positioning relative to the industry, considering our great customer wins like Schneider, expected strong coal demand and a positive impact to our construction business associated with the infrastructure bill.\nI also want to reiterate Jennifer's point about our long-term view. We are committed to achieving a 55% operating ratio and mid- to high 60s incremental margins. These goals are achievable. And as we safely and efficiently improve operations, our customers, our employees, our communities and our shareholders will all win together.\nWith that, let's open up the line for your questions.",

Welcome to the Union Pacific Second Quarter Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you. Mr. Fritz, you may now begin.\n\nLance M. Fritz\n\nCEO, Chairman, and President, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nAnd thank you, Rob, and good morning, and welcome to Union Pacific's second quarter earnings conference call. With me today in Omaha are Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Eric Gehringer, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Jennifer Hamann, our Chief Financial Officer. As we expected and shared back in April during our first quarter earnings call, the second quarter was a tough quarter.\nOur initiatives to restore fluidity limited car loadings and increased operating costs, those actions are working. We made solid progress improving the network with increased car velocity, reduced card well and reduced excess inventory. But before we get into that discussion, I want to recognize the Union Pacific team that is making it happen. Our people truly are special, and they are the foundation of our long-term success.\nNow turning to our second quarter results. This morning, Union Pacific's reporting 2022 second quarter net income of $1.8 billion, or $2.93 per share. This compares to second quarter 2021 results of $1.8 billion or $2.72 per share. Our second quarter operating ratio of 60.2% deteriorated 510 basis points versus 2021. Network recovery efforts and record high fuel prices were headwinds. However, fuel surcharge revenues, strong core pricing gains and a positive business mix offset these pressures to produce operating income growth.\nAs we discussed during the quarter, we understood that the actions we took to improve fluidity would impact our financial performance. Those actions were necessary to increase the speed of our recovery and be in a better position to handle customer demand. The improvements we've made since mid-April gives me confidence that we'll grow volumes as we continue to improve service in the third and fourth quarters. There's more to be done, but we're moving in the right direction.\nLet me turn it over to Kenny for an update on the business environment.\n\nKenyatta G. Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing & Sales - Union Pacific Railroad Company, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nThank you, Lance, and good morning. Second quarter volume was down 1% compared to a year ago. Growth in our industrial was more than offset by a decline in our premium and bulk business segments. To improve network fluidity, we made reductions to our active freight car inventory, and those efforts had a negative impact on all 3 of our business groups. In addition, our intermodal volume was down due to continued global supply chain disruptions. Freight revenue was up 14%, driven by higher fuel surcharges, strong pricing gains and a positive mix. Let's take a closer look at each of these business groups.\nStarting with bulk, revenue for the quarter was up 10% compared to last year, driven by a 12% increase in average revenue per car, reflecting higher fuel surcharges and solid core pricing gains. Volume was down 1% year-over-year. Coal and renewable carloads grew 2% year-over-year, driven by continued favorable natural gas prices and 2 new contract wins that started on January 1.\nGrain and grain products volume was down 4% due to fewer grain shipments from longer shuttle cycle times, partially offset by increased shipments of biofuels. Fertilizer carloads were down 2% year-over-year due to reduced shipments of sulfur and domestic consumed potash. And lastly, food and refrigerated volume remained flat in the quarter as inventory reduction efforts limited car supply.\nMoving on to Industrial. Industrial revenue was up 12% for the quarter, driven by 6% increase in volume and a 7% improvement in average revenue per car due to higher fuel surcharges and core pricing gains. Overall, volume was up, although we certainly left demand on the table as we took actions to reduce car inventory to improve the network. Energy and specialized shipments were up 2% compared to 2021, driven by improvements across various markets, partially offset by fewer petroleum shipments.\nVolume for Forest Products was down 2% year-over-year, primarily driven by our service challenges, although overall demand for forest products remained steady in the quarter. Industrial chemicals and plastic shipments were up 3% year-over-year due to new business wins and demand within the plastics market. Metals and minerals volumes continue to deliver year-over-year growth.\nVolume was up 3% compared to last year, primarily driven by growth in construction materials and increase in frac sand shipments and metals business development. Turning to Premium. Revenue for the quarter was up 19% on a 5% decrease in volume versus last year. Average revenue per car increased by 26% due to higher fuel surcharge revenue, core pricing gains and a positive mix of traffic.\nAutomotive volume was up 11%, driven by auto parts, which increased 12% and finished vehicles increasing 10%, both driven by strong demand against a softer comparison. Intermodal volume was down 8%, primarily driven by service challenges and fewer international shipments from continued global supply chain disruptions. Domestic volume was up 1% in the quarter, aided by tight truck capacity and private asset growth, offsetting weaker parcel shipments.\nNow moving to our outlook for the back half of 2022. At a macro level, we will be closely watching our markets to see how rising inflation and interest rates will impact our overall volume. But based on our conversations with customers, I'm excited about the opportunities that are in front of us.\nLet's start out with our bulk commodities. We expect biofuel shipments to grow due to solid market demand and business development wins. For coal, we anticipate continued favorable natural gas prices throughout the year. We know there is more demand available than what we've captured to date. So our opportunity is to better match our resources to that demand. And our outlook for grain is also dependent on our service recovery where we expect cycle times to improve. But we have a tough comp in the fourth quarter as exports were strong last year.\nMoving on to Industrial. Our outlook has not changed. We expect our markets to be stronger than the current industrial production forecast. Customer expansions and business development wins will drive growth in our industrial chemicals and plastics commodity groups. We do not expect to see petroleum shipments return to 2021 levels. And lastly, for premium, we are closely monitoring domestic intermodal demand and spot truck rates have softened. We expect to see improvements in international intermodal with the recovery from the supply chain challenges and pandemic shutdowns in China. However, we will continue to monitor and receivers to make sure we maintain fluidity throughout the entire supply chain, from the ports to the warehouses.\nIn spite of elevated fuel prices and interest rate increases, we expect automotive growth in the second half of the year to be driven by improving supply of semiconductor chips and pent-up demand. Overall, I'm optimistic about the demand environment we see in the marketplace as we head into the third quarter. And you'll hear from Eric that we're seeing positive momentum in our service product.\nI want to thank our operating team and our customers for working together to recover our service levels. As we continue to improve the network, I'm confident that we can capture more growth in the back half of the year and into 2023. With that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance.\n\nEric J. Gehringer\n\nEVP of Operations, Union Pacific Railroad Company Inc.\n\nThanks, Kenny, and good morning. Beginning on Slide 9. As we discussed in April, we began the quarter with our service product in need of significant improvement. To recover the network and better serve our customers, we implemented decisive measures to reduce inventory levels and restore fluidity. The chart on Slide 9 shows the current state of operations. We hit a trough in April and have since made steady progress. While the improvement has not been a straight line because of continued crude challenges and isolated incidents, the team has stayed the course to build momentum and generate positive results.\nWe experienced reduced crew availability from the Father's Day and 4th of July holidays as we expected and planned for. We have, however, recovered from those holiday impacts and returned to our prior improvement trajectory. We continue to see the benefits of our hiring initiatives and feel confident in our ability to hire and train approximately 1,400 new transportation employees this year.\nTo date, in 2022, we have graduated 486 employees and have an additional 504 currently in training with almost 400 of those employees graduating by the end of the third quarter. Although the hard work is not yet done, I am encouraged by the improvement already made. I would be remiss to not acknowledge the efforts and cooperation from all to the operating and marketing and sales teams within UP and most importantly, our customers. Our network is in a better state today because of these combined efforts.\nNow let's review our key performance metrics for the quarter, starting on Slide 10. The key performance measures for second quarter 2022 continue to trend below 2021 results. We did, however, strengthen freight car velocity as well as manifest and auto trip plan compliance sequentially as we move through the quarter.\nIntermodal trip plan compliance continues to lag results from earlier in the year, due to continued supply chain congestion resulting in increased container boxed well and elevated chassis street time. Our attention remains on increasing freight car velocity, which will improve intermodal service performance although the challenges associated with the supply chain will likely persist.\nTurning now to Slide 11. The network efficiency metrics for the quarter illustrate the impact of our network recovery actions. Since the beginning of the year, we have added locomotives to the network, which when coupled with lower train velocity impacts locomotive productivity results for the quarter, declining 12% compared to 2021. As we anticipate volume growth heading into the second half of the year, locomotive productivity will improve with better fleet utilization as we move more carloads at a greater overall velocity.\nSecond quarter workforce productivity deteriorated slightly, down 2% as car miles were essentially flat for the quarter, while employee levels increased. Train length remains flat compared to 1 year ago. However, train length is up 3% sequentially. The team leveraged train length to improve crew utilization, aided by the completion of 10 sidings to date in 2022.\nWe continue to identify productivity opportunities as we build a more resilient and high-quality service product for our customers. Wrapping up on Slide 12. We remain committed to the goal of achieving world-class safety performance. The improvement in our employee incident metric provides evidence that the enhancements we made to our safety programs are beginning to take hold. While the derailment rates have not yet improved compared to 2021, we continue to educate our workforce to ultimately reduce variability and expense.\nThe swift and decisive initiatives implemented in April reduced congestion and sped up the network. An increase in crude supply will further support these recovery efforts. Looking forward to the second half of 2022, we plan to build on the momentum gained during the second quarter. With that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance.\n\nJennifer L. Hamann\n\nEVP and CFO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nThanks, Eric, and good morning. Let me start with a look at the walk-down of our second quarter operating ratio and earnings per share on Slide 14. Union Pacific's earnings per share increased $0.21 to $2.93 and our quarterly operating ratio of 60.2% worsened by 510 basis points. Rapidly rising fuel prices throughout the quarter, the lag on our fuel surcharge programs and the widening refining spreads negatively impacted our quarterly operating ratio by 130 basis points, while adding $0.18 to earnings per share.\nOur operating ratio and EPS were further negatively impacted 380 basis points and $0.02 per share, respectively, as core results reflect the impact of network recovery efforts that more than offset the benefits of our top line growth. Below the line, real estate sales and lower state tax rates netted to a year-over-year benefit of $0.05 per share. We closed the second half of a land sale with the Illinois Tollway authority, which we announced in May. And then the state of Nebraska changed its corporate tax rate in the quarter.\nLooking now at our second quarter income statement on Slide 15, operating revenue totaled $6.3 billion, up 14% versus 2021 on a 1% year-over-year volume decline. Operating expense increased 25% to $3.8 billion. Excluding the impact of higher fuel prices, expenses were up 11% in the quarter. Second quarter operating income was $2.5 billion, a 1% increase versus last year. Interest expense increased 12% compared to 2021, reflecting higher debt levels. Income tax decreased 2% due to the Nebraska corporate tax rate reduction I just mentioned and contributing to lower second quarter effective tax rate.\nNet income of $1.8 billion increased 2% versus 2021, which, when combined with the share repurchases, resulted in earnings per share, up 8% to $2.93. Looking more closely at second quarter revenue, Slide 16 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue, which totaled $5.8 billion, up 14% versus 2021. Lower year-over-year volume reduced revenue 150 basis points. Fuel surcharge revenue increased freight revenue, 11.25% points, reflecting the rising diesel prices. Total fuel surcharge revenue was $976 million in the quarter. Strong pricing gains combined with the positive business mix drove 425 basis points of freight revenue growth.\nThe significant decline in international intermodal volumes contributed positively to mix. However, the usually strong mix impact of year-over-year industrial growth was muted by strength in short-haul rock movements. Overall, the demand environment continues to support actions that yield price dollars exceeding inflation dollars. It's important to note, though, that our network recovery efforts limited our upside for both price and mix as we only count price if we move the cars.\nMoving on to Slide 17, which provides a summary of our second quarter operating expenses were the primary driver of the increased expense was fuel up 89% on an 87% increase in fuel prices. We saw a dramatic rise in prices through the quarter, paying record highs as they surge from an average of $3.71 per gallon in April to $4.34 per gallon in June. Our fuel consumption rate was relatively flat compared to 2021 as negative productivity was partially offset by a more fuel-efficient business mix.\nLooking further at the expense lines. Compensation and benefits expense was up 7% versus 2021. Second quarter workforce levels increased 2%. Management, engineering and mechanical workforces grew 1%, while train and engine crews were up 5%, primarily reflecting year-over-year increases in our training pipeline. As you heard from Eric, strong third quarter graduations position us to support our network recovery efforts and prepare for future growth.\nCost per employee increased 5% as a result of wage inflation and continued elevated costs relating to network inefficiencies that come in the form of higher recrew, overtime and borrow out costs. For the balance of the year, we expect year-over-year increases to be sequentially lower from the second quarter in both the third and fourth quarters. Purchase services and materials expense was up 30% driven by higher cost to maintain a larger active locomotive fleet, inflation and volume-related purchase transportation expense associated with our Loup subsidiary.\nWe also had an unfavorable comparison in the quarter versus 2021 where we called out a $35 million favorable onetime item. Equipment and other rents grew 15%, driven by lower TTX equity income and increased car hire expense related to network congestion. Other expense grew 17% in the quarter, driven by a $35 million increase in casualty expenses associated with adverse adjustments to older claims and increased business travel.\nFor the full year, we now expect other expense to be up low single digits versus 2021. Although fuel was clearly the driver of higher quarterly costs, the added expense from our service performance resulted in 69% fuel-adjusted decremental margins. Turning to Slide 18 and our cash flow. Cash from operations in the first half of 2022 decreased slightly to just under $4.2 billion, down 1%. Our cash flow conversion rate was 73% and free cash flow of $1.1 billion declined $727 million. This, of course, includes the impact of $455 million increased cash capital spending and $206 million in higher dividends.\nCapital spending year-to-date is up 38% versus 2021, which reflects both a more normalized spend trajectory and an increased capital budget for 2022. Year-to-date, we returned $5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This includes a 10% dividend payout increase announced in May, the third such increase in a little over a year's time. And we finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.8x as we continue to maintain a strong investment-grade credit rating.\nWrapping up on Slide 19. As we've discussed this morning, it was a difficult second quarter but necessary to position ourselves for success in the second half of the year. Importantly, we're demonstrating greater network fluidity as evidenced by the metrics and Kenny just described for you that there is still solid demand for our services despite some indications of economic softening. For example, full year industrial production is still forecasted at nearly 5%, but back half 2022 estimates are weaker. Against that backdrop, we expect to be back on track to exceed industrial production in the second half of 2022 and produce full year carload growth of 4% to 5%.\nAs it relates to our operating ratio, the first half performance makes achievement of year-over-year improvement unlikely. However, we do expect year-over-year improvement in the second half of 2022 and a full year operating ratio around 58%. While our 2022 results won't match our view coming into the year, we remain committed to our goal of ultimately achieving a 55% operating ratio. We're also revising our guidance for incremental margins, which we now expect to be around 50% for the back half of the year.\nBeyond 2022, we still expect to achieve our longer-term guidance of mid- to upper 60% incremental margins. Our capital allocation plans remain unchanged. Capital spending at $3.3 billion for the year, well within our long-term guidance of below 15% of revenue and we remain committed to leading the industry with our long-term dividend payout ratio and share repurchases on par with 2021.\nFinally, I feel fortunate to work with such a fantastic team of railroaders at Union Pacific. Every time I return from the field visit, I'm energized about the future of our company. Thanks to a great team. We have a bright future ahead. So with that, I'll turn it back to Lance.\n\nLance M. Fritz\n\nCEO, Chairman, and President, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nThank you, Jennifer. Before my closing remarks, I want to briefly touch on a couple of topics. First, related to our sustainability efforts, we've made great progress to increase the use of renewable diesel and biodiesel in our locomotives. We're currently over 4% blended in our fuel usage and on target to achieve our interim goal of a 10% blend by 2025. This is a critical initiative for us to achieve our 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. Second is a quick update on the status of our labor negotiations. Earlier this week, President Biden appointed a Presidential Emergency Board, and the Board's proceedings begin this coming Sunday in Washington, D.C. All parties are anxious for a reasonable agreement. Our employees are long overdue for a wage increase. We're ready to put the uncertainty behind us and look forward to a resolution in the near future.\nNow wrapping up, as you heard from Eric, we've made positive strides on safety in the first half of the year. I'm encouraged by the momentum that I see building within our safety programs. Having said that, we're short of our goal of world-class performance, and that is our task ahead. Our second quarter performance, both operationally and financially, did not reflect the best of Union Pacific. Yet we still achieved quarterly financial records. This reflects the great work we've done through PSR adoption in the last several years to make our company more resilient, efficient and profitable.\nOur focus over the next 6 months is to again demonstrate our ability to successfully grow volumes while improving and sustaining service levels. I am confident we will build that track record. These efforts are critical to our success in the back half of 2022 and beyond and are core to our long-term strategy to serve, grow, win together. With that, let's open up the line for your questions.",

    "content": "Q1 2022 Union Pacific Corp Earnings Call\n\nQ1 2022 Union Pacific Corp Earnings Call\n\nUNPNYSEAPR 21, 8:45 AM\n\nOperator\n\nGreetings, and welcome to Union Pacific's First Quarter Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you. Mr. Fritz, you may now begin.\n\nLance M. Fritz\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nThank you, Rob, and good morning, and welcome to Union Pacific's first quarter earnings conference call. With me today in Omaha are Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Eric Gehringer, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Jennifer Hamann, our Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we discuss our first quarter results, I want to reflect on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The people of Ukraine have had their lives turned upside down, and the UP family is holding them close in our thoughts and in our hearts. We've leveraged our resources to help, with a $500,000 donation from our foundation and by matching 2:1, our employees' gifts to select charities that provide direct aid. I also want to recognize the Union Pacific team for more than their generosity. They are a team dedicated to serving our customers. But recently, our service product has not met our customers' expectations. You will hear from Eric, we have an action plan in place to recover and it is starting to yield benefits. I'm confident in our long-term ability to grow while providing our customers a reliable service product. As they've proven time and again, no matter the challenge, our employees rise to the occasion.\nTurning to our first quarter results. This morning, Union Pacific is reporting 2022 first quarter net income of $1.6 billion or $2.57 per share. This compares to first quarter 2021 results of $1.3 billion or $2 per share. Our first quarter operating ratio of 59.4% improved 70 basis points versus 2021. Business development and a robust demand environment drove 4% volume growth in the quarter, coupled with strong pricing gains and the positive business mix. However, our service challenges are contributing to higher costs in the quarter. That performance is also having a real impact on our customers and their ability to serve their markets. We must improve to realize the volume growth we expect this year and into the future.\nSo let me turn it over to Kenny first for an update on the business environment.\n\nEric J. Gehringer\n\nEVP of Operations, Union Pacific Railroad Company Inc.\n\nThank you, Lance, and good morning. First quarter volume was up 4% compared to a year ago. Solid gains in both our bulk and industrial segments were more than offset by a decline in our premium business group from continued global supply chain disruption. Freight revenue was up 17%, driven by higher fuel surcharges, strong pricing gains and a positive mix. Let's take a closer look at each of these business groups.\nStarting with bulk, revenue for the quarter was up 21% compared to last year, driven by a 12% increase in volume and an 8% increase in average revenue per car, reflecting higher fuel surcharges and solid core pricing gains. Coal and renewable carloads grew 29% year-over-year, driven by continued favorable natural gas prices and 2 new contract wins that started on January 1. Grain and grain products were up 1% in volume due to the increased biofuels production, partially offset by fewer grain shipments from longer shuttle cycle time. Fertilizer carloads were up 2% year-over-year due to strong agricultural demand. And lastly, increased shipments of import beer and can goods were the main driver of the 4% increase in food and refrigerated.\nMoving on to Industrial. Industrial revenue was up 16% for the quarter, driven by an 11% increase in volume. Average revenue per car also improved 5%, primarily driven by higher fuel surcharges and core pricing gains. Energy and specialized shipments were down 6% compared to 2021, driven by fewer petroleum shipments. Volume for Forest Products grew 7% year-over-year, primarily driven by strength in both lumber shipments and paper. Despite rise in interest rates, housing starts continue to be strong, coupled with demand of corrugated boxes and scrap paper. Industrial chemicals and plastic shipments were up 14% year-over-year due to the increased demand and a favorable comp from last year's [gulf] swarm that impacted production. Metals and minerals volumes continued to deliver robust year-over-year growth. Volume was up 25% compared to last year, primarily driven by growth in the construction materials, strong steel demand and an increase in frac sand shipments. In addition, we had a favorable comp in our construction market from last year's storm that I mentioned earlier.\nTurning to premium. Revenue for the quarter was up 14% on a 3% decrease in volume versus last year. Average revenue per car increased by 17% due to higher fuel surcharge revenue, core pricing gains and a positive mix in traffic. Automotive volume was up 6%, driven by an increase in auto parts as demand recovers. Shipments for finished vehicles were down 3% as a result of ongoing semiconductor shortages. Intermodal volume was down 5%, driven by continued international supply chain disruption. However, domestic volume was up in the quarter, aided by business development wins, tight truck capacity and continued strength in parcel shipments.\nNow moving on to our outlook for the rest of 2022. At a micro level, we will be closely watching our markets to see how rising inflation and the global events in both China and Ukraine will impact our overall volume. But as it stands now, here is how we view the outlook across our business lines.\nStarting with our bulk commodity, we expect fertilizer to grow due to solid market demand, especially on the export side. For coal, we anticipate continued favorable natural gas prices to extend through the year. But when it comes to how much of that demand we can capture, that will depend on how quickly we recover our service levels. We are optimistic on growth with grain products from biofuel demand and business development wins. For grain, we have a tough comp to last year as exports were strong. And like coal, although we expect cycle times to improve, it is dependent on our service recovery.\nMoving on to Industrial markets. We continue to be encouraged by the strength of the forecast for industrial production. This will positively impact many of our markets, like metals. Customer expansions and business development wins will drive growth in our industrial chemicals and plastics commodity groups. We do not expect to see petroleum shipments return to 2021 levels.\nAnd lastly, for premium, we expect domestic intermodal to continue its benefit from inventory restocking, retail sales strength, tight truck supply and our business development wins. International intermodal is more uncertain with possible effects from ongoing supply chain challenges and pandemic shutdown in China. For automotive, while we do expect the supply of semiconductor chip to improve throughout 2022, recent events in China and Ukraine may disrupt the supply chain for certain key components. We are keeping an eye on whether this will have an impact on production and stand in close contact with our customers.\nAs I wrap up, I want to share a few insights on how the commercial team is navigating the current service challenges. First, all of our discussions have been centered around what actions we can take to improve service. Eric will provide insight on the levers we are pulling that are in our control. Likewise, the commercial team is asking our customers to help reduce railcar inventory. While those conversations have been difficult, I am encouraged by the high level of engagement and transparency we're having with our customers.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance.\n\nKenyatta G. Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing & Sales - Union Pacific Railroad Company, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nThank you, Kenny, and good morning. As I will discuss in greater detail in a few minutes, our service is not to a level that meets expectations, and we acknowledge the impact that deteriorated service levels are having on our customers. We are implementing plans to restore network fluidity and build a safer, more reliable and resilient network. Safety results have been mixed to start the year as we implement enhancements to our safety programs through partnerships and guidance from our external safety consultant. We remain focused on achieving world-class safety performance. We value the health and the safety of our employees above all and want all employees to return home safely each day.\nNow let's review our key performance metrics for the quarter, starting on Slide 9. Freight car velocity and the related trip plan compliance measures were lower relative to 2021. Coming into the year, the network was in a more fluid state, seeing improvements in operating metrics and crew availability from reduced COVID infections. In late February, however, while the network was still fragile, episodic events challenge the team and our service product. This led to both decreased velocity and an increase in freight car inventory, particularly private cars, as resources were added to counteract sluggish service and meet growing customer demands.\nTurning now to Slide 10. Although the overall network performance muted most of our efficiency metrics, we continue to operate a more efficient rail network compared to pre-PSR levels. Locomotive productivity declined 6% compared to first quarter 2021 due to locomotive utilization during the quarter. To assist and recover in the network, we also brought additional units online, further impacting our productivity results. First quarter workforce productivity improved 5% to a record 1,056 daily miles per FTE. We continue to hire for growth and normal attrition throughout the network.\nIn 2021, we graduated over 250 new transportation employees with almost 400 employees graduated to date in 2022. We have a strong training pipeline of roughly 500 employees as we work closer towards our goal of onboarding around 1,400 employees this year. We have, however, been challenged across the Northern region at several locations to meet our hiring targets. And we continue to work with our workforce resources partners to increase our hiring pools in those locations.\nTrain length is essentially flat compared to 1 year ago. While continued soft international intermodal volumes present a headwind to train length initiatives, we continue to advance train length for coal and manifest trains, which both grew compared to first quarter 2021. These productivity efforts are key to enabling us to recover the network and deliver a better service product for our customers.\nTurning to Slide 11 and a discussion on our path forward. This chart illustrates the current state of operations. Our operating car inventory levels rose over 20% since the beginning of the year, while our 7-day volume levels remained relatively flat week to week. We are at an inflection point and more critical action is needed. Our terminals remain fluid, and our focus on improving over-the-road operations and reducing the number of active trains on the network will ease mainline congestion. To accomplish this, we are taking actions on all fronts by selectively increasing network resources, collaborating with our unions, adjusting transportation plans and working proactively with customers to reduce the private car inventory buildup.\nThe entire team is dedicated to returning the network to a more fluid operating state. Looking beyond some of today's issues, our goal is to build a more resilient and consistent network to meet the growth needs of our customers.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance.\n\nJennifer L. Hamann\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nThanks, Eric, and good morning. Let me start with a look at the first quarter operating ratio and earnings per share on Slide 13. As you heard from Lance, Union Pacific is reporting first quarter earnings per share of $2.57 and a quarterly operating ratio of 59.4%, 70 basis points of improvement. Comparing year-over-year first quarter results, you'll recall that Winter Storm Yuri significantly impacted 2021. So in 2022, we have the positive effect to our operating ratio of 160 basis points and $0.16 to earnings per share. Rising fuel prices throughout the quarter, the lag on our fuel surcharge programs and widening spreads between WTI and highway diesel fuel prices negatively impacted our quarterly ratio by 80 basis points, while adding $0.12 per share. Core results were a 10 basis point drag to the operating ratio, but contributed $0.29 to EPS. These core results are indicative of both operational inefficiencies in the quarter as well as the strong top line growth we delivered.\nLooking now at our first quarter income statement on Slide 14. Operating revenue totaled $5.9 billion, up 17% versus 2021 on 4% year-over-year volume growth. Operating expense increased 16% to $3.5 billion. Excluding the impact of higher fuel prices, expenses were up 7% in the quarter. First quarter operating income was a record at $2.4 billion, a 19% increase versus last year. Adjusted for fuel price, first quarter incremental margins totaled 56%. Expectations for full year incrementals are unchanged in the mid-60s, which is the lower end of our Investor Day guidance. Interest expense increased 6% compared to 2021, reflecting increased debt levels, partially offset by a lower effective interest rate. Income tax increased 18% due to higher pretax income, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. We now estimate the full year effective tax rate to be around 23.5% as several states have lowered or are expected to lower rates.\nNet income of $1.6 billion increased 22% versus 2021, which when combined with share repurchases, resulted in earnings per share up 29% to $2.57.\nLooking more closely at first quarter revenue. Slide 15 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue, which totaled $5.4 billion, up 17% versus 2021. Broad-based volume growth supported by successful business development efforts, as Kenny discussed, contributed 425 basis points. Fuel surcharge revenue of $635 million increased freight revenue 800 basis points as the higher surcharge revenue reflects the significant surge in diesel fuel prices. The robust demand environment continues to support actions that yield price dollars that exceed inflation dollars. These gains combined with the positive business mix to drive 475 basis points of freight revenue growth. Lower intermodal volume, combined with higher industrial shipments, drove the positive mix.\nNow let's move on to Slide 16, which provides a summary of our first quarter operating expenses. As noted earlier, the primary driver of the increased expense was fuel, up 74% on a 59% increase in fuel prices and 9% higher gross ton miles. Our fuel consumption rate was relatively flat compared to 2021 as the favorable business mix was offset by negative productivity.\nLooking further at the expense lines, compensation and benefits expense was up 7% versus 2021. First quarter workforce levels increased 1% as a 2% increase in our train and engine crews were partially offset by flat management, engineering and mechanical workforces. As you heard from Eric, we continue to hire into our transportation crafts to support network recovery efforts and prepare for future growth. Cost per employee increased 6% as a result of wage inflation as well as higher recrew overtime and borrow-out costs related to network inefficiencies, partially offset by last year's weather-related expenses. Given the current operational challenges, we now expect cost per employee to remain elevated into the second quarter.\nPurchased services and material expense is up 14%, driven by inflation, higher volume-related purchase transportation expense associated with our loop subsidiary and cost to maintain a larger active locomotive fleet. Equipment and other rents was up 1%, driven by lower TTX equity income. Other expense increased 5% in the quarter, driven by higher state and local taxes and increased business travel.\nTurning to Slide 17 and our cash flows. Cash from operations in the first quarter increased to $2.2 billion from $2 billion in 2021, a 14% increase. Our cash conversion rate was 85%, and free cash flow of $657 million declined $146 million. This includes $312 million of increased cash capital spending and $93 million in higher dividends. The cash capital investment reflects both payments from elevated fourth quarter spending as well as a normalized start to our 2022 program. In the quarter, we returned $3.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This includes the $2.2 billion accelerated share repurchase program executed in February. And we finished the first quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.8x as we continue to maintain a strong investment-grade credit rating.\nWrapping up on Slide 18, I want to start by recognizing that several things have changed since we provided guidance in January, from fuel prices to our operational performance. As we sit here today, those pressures make achievement of around a 55.5% operating ratio unlikely. However, assuming some stabilization in fuel and recovery in our service product, we'll still look to achieve our long-term goal of an OR that starts with a 55 this year. Importantly, we are affirming our previously provided 2022 targets for volume, price and incremental margins.\nOur cash and capital plans also are unchanged. Capital spending remains at $3.3 billion for the year, well within our long-term guidance of below 15% of revenue, and we remain committed to an industry-leading dividend payout ratio and share repurchases in line with 2021.\nBefore I turn it back to Lance, I'd like to express my appreciation to the Union Pacific team. Working in an outdoor factory is always a challenge, but especially so during winter. Our employees, though, are undeterred in their desire to safely serve our customers while delivering another quarter of solid financial results.\nThank you. With that, I'll turn it back to Lance.\n\nLance M. Fritz\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nAnd thank you, Jennifer. As Eric mentioned, we've had an uneven start to the year with safety, but we're not deterred. We're in the process of implementing changes to our safety programs as a result of our work with experienced safety consultants. I'm confident these changes will be a catalyst for world-class safety performance. As you heard from Kenny, demand remains robust as our customers see growth opportunities in their businesses. However, we recognize that for growth to be sustainable, we need a reliable and resilient service product that our customers can depend on. Our strategy begins with serve, and it is the foundation for achieving long-term success for all stakeholders. Improving our service product has our full and undivided attention.\nCurrent challenges aside, we remain enthusiastic about the opportunities that exist this year to win with all of our stakeholders, and I am confident that 2022 will be a very successful year. Wrapping up with tomorrow being Earth Day, it feels appropriate to highlight an action we took during the first quarter to protect our planet and advance our journey to net-zero emissions by 2050. In January, we announced plans to purchase 20 battery electric locomotives for use in yard operations, creating the world's largest carrier-owned battery fleet in freight service. These locomotives do not use diesel fuel and emit zero emissions. We anticipate the first units will arrive on site in late 2023 with complete delivery by 2024. With this step, Union Pacific remains a leader on our nation's path to a sustainable future.\nSo with that, let's open up the line for your questions.",

Thank you.\nGreetings, and welcome to the Union Pacific Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Fritz. You may begin.\n\nLance M. Fritz\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nThank you, Rob, and good morning, and welcome to Union Pacific's fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me today in Omaha are Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Eric Gehringer, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Jennifer Hamann, our Chief Financial Officer.\nAs we wrap up 2021, I want to start with a thank you to the Union Pacific team. This past year has been anything but easy, as we dealt with massive weather events, wildfires, supply chain congestion and continued impacts from the pandemic. Through all of those challenges, our employees did the hard work necessary to deliver a record financial year. I am so grateful for our team's strength and their determination. They give me confidence that our best days truly lie ahead.\nTurning to our fourth quarter results. This morning, Union Pacific is reporting 2021 fourth quarter net income of $1.7 billion or $2.66 per share. This compares to adjusted fourth quarter 2020 results of $1.6 billion or $2.36 per share. You'll note that 2020 reported results included an impairment charge related to our Brazos Yard investment. Our fourth quarter operating ratio of 57.4% deteriorated 180 basis points versus 2020's adjusted OR largely driven by the headwind from fuel prices. For the full year, we achieved a record 57.2% operating ratio, an improvement of 130 basis points versus 2020 adjusted results. And as Jennifer will lay out in a few minutes, we're on track to achieve a full year operating ratio that starts with a 55% in 2022. Even with the challenges of the past year, we set fourth quarter and full year records for operating income and net income.\nA comparison to 2019 further demonstrates the achievements of the team over the past 2 years. As you'll hear in greater detail from Eric, our fourth quarter safety and service performance did not meet expectations. I am pleased, however, that as we exit the year, our network is healing. Reflecting back, 2021 was a difficult year in many ways. But through our commitment to PSR and delivering for our customers, we navigated each obstacle and are now better for having dealt with them. During 2021, we took significant steps to advance our ESG efforts kept off by the release of our initial Climate Action Plan in December. This plan lays out a framework to achieve our 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction targets and includes a commitment to net zero by 2050, and we are the only U.S. railroad to do so.\nOne element of our plan is reduced overall fuel consumption, and we made continued progress last year. Our full year fuel consumption rate improved 1% for a new record level. This represents the third consecutive year we improved our fuel consumption rate on a year-over-year basis, and it helped our customers eliminate 22.9 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions by using rail versus truck. So let's get started with Kenny for an update on the business environment.\n\nKenyatta G. Rocker\n\nEVP of Marketing & Sales, Union Pacific Railroad Company Inc.\n\nThank you, Lance, and good morning. Fourth quarter volume was down 4% compared to a year ago. Gains in our industrial and bulk segments were more than offset by a decline in our premium business group from continued global supply chain disruption. However, freight revenue was up 10% driven by higher fuel surcharges, positive mix and strong pricing gains.\nLet's take a closer look at each of these business groups. Starting with bulk, revenue for the quarter was up 16% compared to 2020, driven by a 5% increase in volume and a 10% increase in average revenue per car, reflecting higher fuel surcharges, positive mix and strong core pricing gains. Coal and renewable carloads grew 13% year-over-year. Our efforts to switch customers to index-based contracts are supporting domestic coal demand as a result of higher natural gas prices. The sequential decline was due in part to softer demand from milder weather in the fourth quarter. The harvest for grain and grain products drove the 15% sequential improvement. However, shipments were down 1% compared to 2020 due to reduced grain export shipments to the Gulf. Weaker grain shipments were partially offset by our business development efforts and strong demand for biofuels. Fertilizer carloads were up 9% year-over-year due to strong agricultural demand and increased core potash shipments.\nMoving on to industrial. Industrial revenue was -- improved by 14% for the quarter driven by an 8% increase in volume. Average revenue per car also improved 6% primarily driven by higher fuel surcharges and core pricing gains. Energy and specialized shipments were flat compared to 2020. Higher demand for LPG and soda ash was offset by fewer project-related waste shipments and petroleum products.\nVolume for forest products grew 7% year-over-year primarily driven by demand for brown paper used in corrugated boxes and scrap paper. Industrial chemicals and plastic shipments were up 6% year-over-year due to strengthening demand and business plans. Metals and minerals volumes continue to be a bright spot. Volume was up 18% compared to 2020 primarily driven by our business development efforts, along with strong steel demand. In addition, demand recovery for construction materials and favorable comps for frac sand contributed to strong year-over-year growth.\nTurning to premium. Revenue for the quarter was up 1% on a 14% decrease in volume versus 2020. Average revenue per car increased by 17% due to higher fuel surcharge, core pricing gains and a positive mix of traffic. Automotive volume was down 10% in the quarter due to semiconductor-related part shortages and associated plant shutdowns. However, sequentially, we saw a 10% increase versus the third quarter due to improved semiconductor availability.\nIntermodal volume was down 15% driven by continued international intermodal supply chain disruptions impacting the quarter as ocean carriers and BPO shifted more freight support to port. Sequentially, intermodal volume was down 10% versus the third quarter as global supply chains remain challenged.\nNow looking ahead to 2022, here are the economic indicators that correlate closely with our business. You see that industrial production is currently forecasted to grow at 4.8% in 2022. We also recognize that we will face continued challenges in our energy-related markets. But despite those hurdles, we continue to build upon our solid strategy to serve, grow, win together. This strategy enables us to outperform the markets with our reliable service and continued focus on enhancing the customer experience.\nSo as we began 2022, I'm excited and bullish for the opportunities we have in front of us. For our bulk commodities, we are optimistic about the growth in most of our markets due to favorable market conditions and business development wins. For fertilizer, we anticipate incremental growth with strong market demand and the long-term deal with Canpotex, where we have expanded terminal capacity to handle more volume with longer trains.\nCoal should see year-over-year growth based on the expectation of continued favorable natural gas prices. Additionally, plant retirements forecasted in 2022 will be offset by 2 new contract wins that started on January 1. For grain, we have tough comps versus 2021 as exports have been strong for the last couple of years. However, in grain products, we are leading the market in biofuel development by securing opportunities on both sides of the house, the inbound feedstocks and the outbound finished biofuels.\nMoving to our industrial markets. We continue to be encouraged by the strength of the forecast for industrial production. This will positively impact many of our markets like metal. Customer expansions and business development wins will drive growth in our industrial chemicals and plastics commodity groups. However, as we move through the year, we expect lumber shipments to be adversely impacted by the current forecast for housing starts.\nAnd lastly, for premium, we expect strong uplift for both our automotive and intermodal businesses. Automotive sales are forecasted to increase from 15 million units in 2021 to 15.4 million in 2022 due to the vehicle inventory restocking effort. Plus wins to convert finished vehicles and auto part shipments from over the road will further strengthen UP's automotive business. Domestic intermodal will benefit from retail inventory restocking, continued strength in retail sales and tight truck supply. We're seeing slow improvement on our international volumes, but we also remain cognizant of the continued labor shortages that are impacting the global supply chain.\nSetting aside those forces outside of our control, we continue to create our own opportunities to grow. We are focused on expanding our reach into new markets in the industry. We're growing our footprint In the Twin Cities and Inland Empire Intermodal terminal. This quarter, we will also have a new product offering with our ag transload site at Global 4 and a nice swift business win that started this month positions us for robust growth in 2022.\nBut just to be clear, we're not only investing on the intermodal side. We're making significant investment to support growth on the carload side, too. We've recently purchased 2 transpo sites in strong economic growth areas like the Inland Empire and Phoenix. As we forge ahead with our aggressive commercial strategy, we're accelerating growth beyond this year. The future looks bright heading into 2023 as we just announced that UP will be the primary intermodal rail carrier in the West for Schneider. This new business will start up in January 2023.\nI'm proud of our commercial team. They are intensely focused on working with our customers to find creative solutions to win in the marketplace. We are anxious to build upon this momentum and grow with our customers. With that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance.\n\nEric J. Gehringer\n\nSVP of Transportation, Union Pacific Railroad Company Inc.\n\nThanks, Kenny, and good morning. 2021 proved to be a challenging year operationally as we saw a right range of events impact the network from wildfires to supply chain congestion. The team leveraged their collective strengths to find solutions to keep trains moving. We exited the year in a more fluid state, recognizing additional improvement is still imperative.\nTaking a look at our key performance metrics for the quarter on Slide 10. Compared to fourth quarter 2020, our operating metrics deteriorated, although we improved most of our metrics sequentially from third quarter. Freight car velocity was impacted by reduced crew availability due to an increase in COVID infections and providing time off for vaccinations. Through reducing our recrew rate, recalling remaining furloughed employees, streamlining processes to onboard crews and increasing crew vaccination rates, our crew availability improved throughout the quarter.\nOur intermodal trip plan compliance of 78% is a decline from last year, however, is a 12-point sequential improvement from third quarter results. This sequential improvement is evidence that our intermodal assets are balanced, and we are poised for growth.\nOur manifest and auto trip plan compliance results of 58% represented a decline both year-over-year and sequentially. Crew availability had a greater impact on our manifest network. The December manifest and auto trip plan compliance results of 62% indicate we are trending in a positive direction, and we are building on these gains to start the year. Efforts during the quarter focused on the southeastern portion of our network, and we successfully returned manifest operations to a fluid state. Our bulk operations, however, are not currently to a level that meets expectations. We are focused on driving improvement to this network as we did to the manifest network.\nTurning to Slide 11. Our efficiency metrics remained strong in the quarter, although some results were muted by the crew availability and lower volumes. Locomotive productivity declined 9% compared to fourth quarter 2020 due to higher locomotive resources to assist with recovery efforts in the southeastern portion of the network. Fourth quarter record workforce productivity improved 1% to 1,046 daily miles per FTE. Recognizing the importance of balancing strong crew utilization and planning for the future, we are focused on effectively managing crew levels. We're in the marketplace hiring, although we have been challenged in certain locations, working with our partners and workforce resources to expand our reach. We are developing creative programs and campaigns like our second chance program to attract new employees to Union Pacific.\nTrain length increased 2% from a year ago to over 9,300 feet enabled by the completion of 15 sidings during the year. Although our ability to grow train length in the fourth quarter was impeded by lower volumes in the intermodal business, we did deliver train length improvement in other business lines, including a 4% improvement in our manifest train link. Utilizing the strong foundation built with the adoption of PSR, the team is ready to handle the expected growth in this and future years.\nTurning to Slide 12. With respect to our capital spending, PSR allows us to efficiently operate the railroad in a less capital-intensive manner. We continue to exercise discipline while still delivering value to our shareholders. Capital spending will remain in line with our long-term guidance of less than 15% of revenue. For 2022, we are targeting capital spending of $3.3 billion, pending final approval by our Board of Directors. The increase in capital spending is driven by targeted freight car acquisitions, investments and growth-related capital projects to drive more carloads to the network and, finally, slightly higher material and labor inflation cost. Approximately 80% of our planned capital spending will go towards replacement of our existing infrastructure. This spending will renew older assets, harden our infrastructure and allow us to continue to operate safely.\nWe are continuing to support intermodal volume growth, starting with investments in certain ramps to efficiently handle volumes from new and existing intermodal customers, including the Schneider business win that Kenny highlighted. We are also expanding the Twin Cities from a pop-up to a full-scale intermodal terminal and adding additional capacity to the Inland Empire pop-up intermodal terminal.\nAnd finally, we will wrap up the multiyear project to install a wide-span gantry cranes at our G4 intermodal terminal in Chicago, bringing additional capacity to a key intermodal market. We will also continue modernizing our locomotive fleet by upgrading approximately 120 older assets. These modernizations not only improve the reliability of the asset, but each unit is a 5% more fuel efficient and emits approximately 53% less carbon emissions.\nLastly, we will continue to invest in capacity projects that drive productivity and improve our network efficiency. We plan to complete approximately 20 sidings this year focused in the southern portion of our network to further support our train length initiative.\nWrapping up on Slide 13. Entering 2022, we are enhancing our safety programs. We've engaged an external safety partner to focus on advanced risk identification and mitigation coupled with enriched behavioral safety programs. Our goal is to be the first railroad to reach world-class safety performance as there is nothing more important than making sure every employee returns home safely.\nWith the robust market demand and strong volume outlook Kenny described, I have complete confidence that the operating team will be able to safely meet the growth needs of our customers. The operating team is focused on continuous performance improvement of the railroad to drive customer-centric growth while remaining judicious in our allocation of resources.\nWhile 2021 did not always bring optimal operating conditions by working together and remaining agile, we answered each challenge and laid a foundation for continued success this year and beyond. With that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance.\n\nJennifer L. Hamann\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nThanks, Eric, and good morning. Starting off with the income statement on Slide 15, where, as Lance mentioned earlier, we've adjusted 2020 results to exclude the Brazos impairment charge. Throughout my remarks today, I will be comparing 2021 to 2020 adjusted results.\nOperating revenue in the quarter totaled $5.7 billion up 12% versus 2020 despite a 4% year-over-year volume decline. Operating expense increased 15% to $3.3 billion. I'll provide more detail in a moment, but excluding the impact of higher fuel prices, expenses were up 7% in the quarter. Together, we are reporting record fourth quarter operating income of $2.4 billion, a 7% increase versus 2020. Other income of $83 million is up 26% driven by a $36 million gain on the sale of a technology investment. Interest expense was up 6% as increased average debt levels were partially offset by a lower effective interest rate. Net income of $1.7 billion increased 8%, which, when combined with our strong share repurchase program, led to a 13% increase in earnings per share to $2.66. Our 57.4% fourth quarter operating ratio increased 180 basis points, reflecting 100 basis point negative impact of higher fuel prices as well as reduced operational efficiency.\nAs we did throughout 2021, we're also comparing our results to 2019. Against that fourth quarter comparison, we generated 16% higher operating income on 1% less volume, clearly demonstrating the ongoing price discipline and operational efficiency we've achieved over the past 2 years.\nLooking more closely at fourth quarter revenue, Slide 16 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue, which totaled $5.3 billion in the fourth quarter, up 10% compared to 2020. Volume was down 400 basis points, driven by the factors Kenny described earlier. Positive business mix, coupled with the strong pricing actions that yielded dollars exceeding our inflation drove 725 basis points in total improvement. Lower intermodal volume, combined with higher industrial shipments drove the positive mix. Fuel surcharge revenue of $522 million increased freight revenue, 700 basis points as our fuel surcharge programs continue to chase rising fuel prices.\nNow let's move on to Slide 17, which provides a summary of our fourth quarter operating expenses. As I just mentioned, the primary driver of the increase was fuel expense, up 80% as a result of a 74% increase in fuel prices. Our fuel consumption rate was flat compared to 2020 as a favorable business mix was offset by negative productivity.\nLooking further at the expense lines, compensation and benefits expense was up 5% versus 2020. Fourth quarter workforce levels increased 1% as flat management, engineering and mechanical workforces were offset by 3% growth in our train and engine crews. This increase reflects our actions to recall furloughed employees as well as bring on new hires to manage utilization challenges and, importantly, in preparation for growth. Cost per employee increased 4% as a result of wage inflation as well as higher recrew overtime and borrow-out costs partially offset by last year's $37 million employee COVID bonus. Purchased services and materials expense was up 9%, in part due to the comparison to favorable interline settlements in 2020 as well as increased locomotive maintenance, crew van usage and purchase transportation.\nEquipment and other rents was up 5%, driven by lower TTX equity income. Other expense increased 29% in the quarter, driven by higher personal injury expense associated primarily with 2 adverse outcomes as well as increased freight loss and damage in state and local taxes. As we look to 2022, overall workforce levels are expected to increase with volume, although not 1 for 1 as we continue to drive productivity. Cost per employee in 2022 should increase in the low single digits as productivity partially offsets inflation.\nDepreciation expense will be up around 2% versus 2021 while we expect the other expense line to be relatively flat year-over-year. Purchased services and materials expense is a bit more of a wild card but will be impacted by inflationary pressure as well as the expected recovery in auto volumes. Finally, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be around 24%.\nLooking now at our efficiency results on Slide 18. We took a step back in the quarter and did not meet our original or revised productivity targets, finishing the year with $195 million of net productivity. Higher casualty expenses, increased costs associated with network operations and reduced volume leverage cumulatively drove the productivity loss. For the full year, we achieved improvements in all areas led by locomotive and workforce productivity initiatives. These gains were partially offset by roughly $55 million of weather and incident-related headwinds in 2021. While these results are clearly not what we expect of ourselves, we view the productivity as deferred, not lost.\nSimilarly, fourth quarter incremental margins were muted at 27%. For the full year, our 77% incremental margins are more indicative of our capabilities, particularly given the positive business mix in 2021. The ability to efficiently add volume to our network is the foundation for delivering strong shareholder value going forward.\nMoving to Slide 19. We'll review full quarter full year 2021 with earnings per share of $9.95, a 21% increase versus adjusted 2020 results. Revenue was up 12% on 4% volume growth, increased fuel surcharges, strong pricing gains and a positive business mix. Record operating income increased 15% to $9.3 billion. Even with a 140 basis point headwind from rising fuel prices, our full year operating ratio of 57.2% improved 130 basis points versus adjusted 2020. Our improvement in 2021 marks the fifth consecutive year of operating ratio gains for Union Pacific, demonstrating our ability to drive efficiency even during a difficult year. And a further comparison of our results to 2019 shows that the hurdles of the past 2 years has not slowed our momentum.\nTurning now to cash and returns on Slide 20. Full year cash from operations increased approximately $500 million to $9 billion, a 6% increase from 2020. The first priority for our cash is our capital investment, which finished 2021 just over $3 billion or roughly 14% of revenue. Our cash flow conversion rate was a strong 93%, and free cash flow after dividends increased $285 million or 9% compared to 2020. Our dividend payout ratio for 2021 was 43%, in line with our 45% target as we rewarded shareholders with 2 10% dividend increases during the year, distributing a total of $2.8 billion to shareholders. We also returned cash to our owners through strong share repurchases, buying back a total of 33 million common shares or 3% at an all-in cost of $7.3 billion, which includes $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter. In total, between dividends and share repurchases, we returned $10.1 billion to our owners in 2021, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to deliver significant shareholder value.\nNow looking at the strength of our balance sheet on Slide 21. We finished the year at an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.7x, consistent with our resolve to maintain strong investment-grade credit ratings. At year-end, our Moody's rating was Baa1 and A- from both S&P and Fitch. Our all-in adjusted debt balance on December 31 of $31 billion increased over $2 billion from year-end 2020 as we continue to utilize our strong balance sheet and earnings growth to reward shareholders.\nFinally, our return on invested capital came in at a record 16.4%, bouncing back more than 2 points from a challenging 2020 and increased 1.4 points from 2019. The reduced capital intensity associated with running a PSR operation is seen clearly in this performance and positions us for growth in the years ahead.\nSo wrapping up with a look to 2022 on Slide 22, let me start by pointing you back to our May Investor Day and the 3-year targets we laid out. Those targets remain intact and are the building blocks of our view to 2022. With volumes, we stated we would outpace industrial production through our business development efforts, which are going strong.\nAs Kenny mentioned, the current forecast for 2022 industrial production is 4.8%. To outperform that forecast, we have new business wins like Knight-Swift as well as the anticipated recovery of autos and International Intermodal. We also expect to have the added benefit of coal volume growth. As you'll recall, we originally anticipated coal to be a 0.5 point headwind over the next 3 years. But with current natural gas prices and recent business wins, that business should actually provide a tailwind in 2022.\nLooking at the cadence of volumes through the year, the first half should be led by bulk and industrial. In the second half, we look for stronger year-over-year gains and for it to be more premium-driven as supply chains and ship shortages improve. For first quarter volumes, specifically, we're anticipating carloads will track below full year 2022 growth expectations as we experienced a muted post-holiday rebound likely impacted by rising COVID infection rates plus continued soft international intermodal volumes. With a strong overall demand environment and our disciplined pricing approach, we expect to yield pricing dollars in excess of inflation dollars. Embedded in that guidance is our expectation that all-in inflation for the year will be elevated a little north of 3%.\nAt our Investor Day, we targeted incremental margins in the mid- to upper 60% range. For 2022, we would expect to be at the low end of that range given the significant mix shift to intermodal growth. The combination of growing volumes, pricing above inflation and strong incremental margins should lead to the achievement of our long-term goal of a 55% operating ratio. Putting a little finer point to it, we would expect to achieve around a 55.5% operating ratio for full year 2022.\nTurning to cash and capital. You heard our plan to invest around $3.3 billion of capital for the year, well within our long-term guidance of less than 15% of revenue. Strong top line growth, increasing profitability and ongoing capital discipline should result in a cash conversion rate near 100%. This strong cash generation allows us to continue rewarding our owners with an industry-leading dividend payout and strong share repurchases, which we expect will be in line with 2021 levels.\nBefore I turn it back to Lance to wrap up, I'd like to express my appreciation to the Union Pacific team. What they achieved over the past year is truly remarkable. Union Pacific's success begins and ends with our people. So with that, I'll turn it back to Lance.\n\nLance M. Fritz\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Union Pacific Corporation\n\nThank you, Jennifer, Wrapping up on Slide 24 with a look at our drivers for success in 2022. As you heard from Eric, it's imperative that we make progress on safety. While there are positive signs in the underlying metrics, the overall results need to improve. Safety is at the center of everything we do at Union Pacific as we strive toward our goal of world-class performance.\nOverall, the network is improving but with work to be done. We have work streams aimed at keeping a healthy pipeline of crews in place, and we're in the marketplace hiring for growth. In addition, we have numerous initiatives to improve the quality of our service. Our long-term growth opportunities are dependent on a reliable service product.\nAs you heard from Kenny, our growth outlook for 2022 is terrific. The growth mentality we're instilling on the entire team is manifesting itself in new customer wins while we continue to build stronger books with our long-term partners. We have an opportunity to offer an enhanced customer experience and new transportation solutions for our customers while helping them achieve their sustainability goals.\n2021 represented another milestone in our company's history and 2022 is poised to be even better. We'll be celebrating our 160th anniversary with what we expect to be our best financial year ever and take further steps on our ESG journey. We have great momentum as we strive for operational excellence, grow with our customers and as we win together with all of our stakeholders. So with that, let's open up the line for your questions.",

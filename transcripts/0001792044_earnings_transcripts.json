Please -- please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Bill Sablwki, Head of Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nWilliam Szablewski\n\nHead of Capital Markets\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to our Q3 2025 earnings call. With us today is our CEO, Scott Smith; CFO, Doretta Mistras; Chief R&D Officer, Philippe Martin; and Chief Commercial Officer, Corinne OGoff. During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements on a number of matters, including our financial guidance for 2025 and various strategic initiatives. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties.\nWe will also be referring to certain actual and projected non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to today's slide presentation and our SEC filings for more information, including reconciliations of those non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. When discussing 2025 actual or reported results, we will be making certain comparisons to 2024 actual or reported results on a divestiture adjusted operational basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency rates and also excludes the proportionate results from the divestitures that closed in 2024 from the 2024 period. We may refer to those as changes on an operational basis. When comparing our 2025 actual reported results to our expectations, we're making comparisons to our 2025 financial guidance. With that, I'll hand the call over to our CEO, Scott Smith.\n\nScott Andrew Smith\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Celgene Corp.\n\nGood morning, everyone. We delivered another strong quarter by focusing on our 2025 strategic priorities, driving strong commercial execution, advancing our pipeline, returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, pursuing in-market business development opportunities and advancing our enterprise-wide strategic review to identify opportunities to deliver meaningful net cost savings, a portion of which we anticipate reinvesting in the business to fund future growth. Our fundamentals remain solid, giving us good momentum as we head into year-end, momentum we expect to carry into 2026. Before we dive into the details of the quarter, let me provide an update on our strategic review. For context, the work we've done over the past 5 years, strengthening our balance sheet, divesting noncore assets and investing in innovation has set the stage for the strategic review as a natural next step in our evolution. We've made significant progress since we announced the initiative in February. We continue to perform a detailed analysis of the totality of our business. As part of our analysis to date, we've identified areas for potential operating efficiencies, including our commercial sales and marketing model and product mix, our R&D, medical and regulatory activities, our sourcing, manufacturing and supply chain, including inventory optimization and how our corporate functions provide support. Looking to the future, we envision a company that delivers sustained profitable growth by focusing on 3 key areas: a global generics business that will continue to evolve towards more profitable, higher-margin complex products, an established brands business that will be strengthened by continuing to add brands that leverage our global capabilities and an innovative brands business that will be expanded by building a portfolio of late-stage or in-market growth assets sourced both internally and externally.\nWe anticipate being able to deliver meaningful net cost savings over a multiyear period while also being able to reinvest a portion of the savings back into the business to fund future growth opportunities. We look forward to sharing more details, including quantification of the net cost savings and reinvestment opportunities at our planned investor event in the first quarter of 2026. Now let me share a few highlights from the quarter. This quarter's commercial performance was strong across our portfolio, particularly in Europe, emerging markets and the Greater China region. We delivered 1% operational revenue growth, excluding indoor, in line with our expectations, reflecting continued execution across our businesses, primarily driven by the benefit from foreign exchange and supported by our strong operational performance, we are raising our full year guidance range across certain key financial metrics, including total revenues, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. At our indoor facility, our initial remediation activities are substantially complete.\nWe recently met with the FDA to review progress and discuss potential timing for reinspection. While timing remains at the discretion of the agency, we have built and continue to build operational redundancies by requalifying other sites and adding third-party vendors for products originally manufactured at Indor. Importantly, we continue to make progress on advancing our pipeline. Here are some of the highlights. We are excited about our fast-acting maloxiccan. The acute pain market in the U.S. is significant, and we believe we can offer a differentiated alternative for patients seeking non-opioid pain relief. We expect to submit our NDA by the end of the year and are already working on our go-to-market strategy. Our low-dose estrogen weekly patch is now under FDA review following the filing of our NDA late in Q3 with a decision expected in mid-2026 and a launch soon thereafter. For sotagliflozin, we've already made filings in multiple markets around the world and expect to file in more countries by the end of the year. For selatogrel and cenerimod, Phase III enrollment for both programs is progressing well. In addition, we've initiated a Phase III program investigating cenerimod for the treatment of lupus nephritis with enrollment of our first patient anticipated by the end of the year. We continue to view both selatogrel and cenerimod as transformational treatments with blockbuster potential and are beginning to plan for commercialization. We are excited about our recent acquisition of [indiscernible] in Japan, adding 2 innovative CNS assets, [indiscernible] and SPIDA to our portfolio. This strengthens our presence in Japan, a strategically important market for us and leverages our CNS infrastructure and expertise. Business development and M&A remain key strategic levers to accelerate growth, enhance shareholder value and create meaningful impact for patients. Through regional business development, we continue to pursue opportunities to strengthen our generics and established brands portfolios while building our presence in innovative brands that can benefit from our global scale, capabilities and infrastructure.\nIn parallel, we are evaluating targeted strategic M&A opportunities, particularly in the U.S., focused on commercial stage accretive transactions designed to expand our business and further enhance the company's long-term growth profile. We're balancing investment in growth with return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Year-to-date, we've returned more than $920 million to shareholders, including $500 million in share repurchases. This puts us firmly on track to return over $1 billion in capital for the year. Overall, we're very encouraged by the progress we're making, taking bold actions that are intended to strengthen our foundation, expand our capabilities and position Viatris for long-term profitable growth. We believe we're building a company that's more agile, more innovative and better aligned with the opportunities for tomorrow.\nNow I'll turn it over to Philippe.\n\nPhilippe Martin\n\nChief Clinical Development & Operations\n\nThank you, Scott. We've had another strong quarter progressing our entire R&D pipeline globally and securing product approval in key markets worldwide. Our late-stage programs are advancing at a very strong pace, beginning with our fast-acting meloxicam. Over the past 2 months, we've participated in the American Society of Anesthesiology and the PainNWeek Medical conferences, generating strong enthusiasm among the pain health care community on our Phase III data. Several important data points from our presentations and KOL discussion underscore the product's distinct clinical profile. First, its pharmacokinetic profile and the speed of onset. This is demonstrated by faster Tmax and higher Cmax compared with Mobi. Specifically, fast-acting meloxicam achieved a Tmax of approximately 45 minutes versus approximately 4 hours for Mobi. Second, its strong and sustained analgesic efficacy with statistically significant pain relief over 48 hours versus placebo, confirming durable pain control in both soft tissue and bony surgical models.\nIn post-hoc analysis, fast-acting meloxicam showed greater overall pain relief over 48 hours and faster pain relief than its opioid comparator, tramolol, across both surgical models. And third, its opioid-sparing effect as demonstrated by a significant reduction in opioid use and a significantly higher number of opioid-free patients compared to placebo, indicating significantly reduced reliance on opioids for pain management. Our goal, subject to FDA agreement, is to include a reduction in opioid use as part of the product label. We anticipate submitting an NDA by year-end through the 505(b)(2) pathway, bearing any unforeseen delays related to the U.S. government shutdown. Turning to MR-141 in presbyopia. We plan to submit an sNDA by year-end. For MR-142 inimight disturbances, the second Phase III study is well on its way with full recruitment and top line results expected in the first half of 2026. Our NDA for our low-dose estrogen weekly patch for contraception was submitted in late Q3 ahead of the government shutdown. Approval is expected by mid-2026. In addition, our next-generation nurogesterin-only patch is currently in Phase III with results expected in 2027.\nWe've also submitted additional regulatory application in recent months for sotagliflozin in Canada, Australia and New Zealand with filings in Mexico and Malaysia expected by year-end. Recent data presented at the ESC Congress further highlights sotagliflozin's early benefit in reducing heart failure-related outcomes when initiated before discharge following a hospitalization for heart failure. Compared with selective SGLT2 inhibitor trials, the benefit observed with sotagliflozin in the SOLOIST study cohort distinctly differentiates sotagliflozin with the class, particularly when it comes to reducing cardiovascular death, worsening heart failure and all-cause mortality. Consistent with this dual SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibition, sotagliflozin is the first SGLT inhibitor to demonstrate a significant reduction in MI and stroke. In Japan, we have several near-term opportunities as we continue to steadily and strategically build our innovative pipeline. Our JNDA for EHXor for general anxiety disorder currently under review by the PMDA is progressing well with approval anticipated in the first half of 2026. The Japanese Phase III data supporting this submission was recently published in the Journal of Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences. The recent addition of pitolisant aligns with our strategy to acquire derisked assets supported by positive Phase III data. Pitolisant with its well-established profile has made a meaningful impact for patients in the U.S. and Europe.\nIt is approved for treating excessive daytime sleepiness or cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy in the U.S. and Europe. Additionally, it is approved for excessive daytime sleepiness associated with obstructive sleep apnea in Europe. We remain on track to submit 2 JNDAs for OSAS and narcolepsy during Q4 this year. Our Phase III trial of Mefecon for the treatment of IgA nephropathy is fully enrolled with results expected early next year. IgA nephropathy represents a significant unmet medical need in Japan with limited treatment options available. Our Phase II trial of ZOTIRVAYA for dry eye disease in Japanese patients was consistent with the global Phase III results. We expect to initiate the Phase II trial in Japan in the very near future. Turning to our complex generics pipeline. We've continued to secure approval for many of our generic products globally.\nWe expect to receive FDA approval soon for octreotide. This will mark our fourth injectable FDA approval this year, joining [indiscernible], paclitaxel and liposomal andphotericin B, underscoring our strategy to expand the generics portfolio with technically complex, high-value products. And finally, let's cover the progress we've made with selatogrel and Senerma. Selatogrel enrollment continues to accelerate, now approaching 1,000 patients per month, keeping us on track to complete enrollment next year. At the recent ICC Great Wall of China and ESC Congresses, KOLs emphasize the risk associated with patient delay in symptom recognition and the need for early intervention, reinforcing the potential of selatogrel's novel approach in providing early, rapid self-administered treatment for suspected MI. For cimod in SLE, patient enrollment in OPIS-2 will close this month, followed shortly by OPIS-1.\nWe anticipate our Phase III readout around year-end 2026. Recent insights from KOL interaction at AACR highlighted the importance of the S1P access in the pathogenesis of SLE and continue to validate cenerimod's differentiated mechanism of action, which acts on B and T cells as well as antigen-presenting cells and dampens both innate and adaptive immunity. In addition, cenerimod's mechanism of action is also highly relevant to lupus nephritis, and we've, therefore, initiated a Phase III program in this indication. Our first patient enroll is anticipated by year-end with full enrollment expected around the end of 2027. Phase III study is the most inclusive lupus nephritis study so far, inclusive of patients with active histological lupus nephritis Class III, IV and 5 with eGFR down to 15 milliliter per minute and with a broad background therapy with or without antimalarial or Benlysta. In closing, we've made significant strides advancing our pipeline. We are seeing the results of focused execution and scientific discipline as well as meaningful scientific engagement across our entire R&D pipeline from generics to established brands and innovative assets.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Corinne.\n\nCorinne M. Le Goff\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you, Philip. Our portfolio strategy is taking shape, fueled by the positive pipeline momentum we have seen this year. Today, I'll highlight a few of the more significant near-term commercial opportunities. As we shared last quarter, we remain excited about our fast-acting meloxicam. The moderate to severe acute pain market is substantial, and there remains a clear unmet need for fast, sustained and meaningful non-opioid pain relief. Let me share more on the broad market opportunity and how it's shaping our commercial strategy. There are approximately 80 million acute pain cases per year in the U.S. And going forward, the incidence is expected to grow at a 2% CAGR due to an aging population and an increased number of surgeries and medical procedures. These patients are predominantly seen in outpatient and ambulatory surgical centers for procedures like ball bladder removal, joint replacements, hernia surgery or bunionectomy or in procedure-focused offices for cosmetic or dental surgeries.\nNow switching to the evolution of the treatment landscape. Opioids currently account for roughly half of all acute pain prescriptions despite the known risk of dependence and misuse. Tramadol remains one of the most prescribed opioids for acute pain. There is, therefore, a strong demand for safer alternatives, combining strong efficacy with an established safety profile. In fact, current treatment guidelines show a strong consensus to minimize opioid use and prioritize non-opioid multimodal pain management strategies that include acetaminophen and NSAIDs. NSAIDs make up a substantial proportion of the total acute pain prescription volume because of their low addiction risk, short-term tolerability and anti-inflammatory effects. We believe fast-acting oral meloxicam is well positioned as a differentiated option among currently available NSAIDs for moderate to severe acute pain. Since receiving the data in May, our teams have been working hard to further shape our go-to-market strategy.\nWe are progressing well with launch planning, including branding, positioning, prescriber segmentation, channel strategy and pricing and payer dynamics. We are taking a targeted approach to market segmentation, focusing on settings where fast, effective alternatives to opioids are most needed. We plan to leverage our own specialty sales team and are exploring partnerships to expand reach across key prescriber segments, which will enable us to go to market more efficiently and cost effectively. We anticipate being in a ready position to launch pending the FDA review cycle. We are also very focused on launch preparations for our low-dose estrogen contraceptive patch. This weekly patch fills an important need for women seeking a lower dose estrogen option for contraception. It also offers advanced patch technology as demonstrated by potential best-in-class patch adhesion performance observed in our Phase III study.\nWe expect this product will be another meaningful contributor and we are planning towards a launch in the U.S. in the second half of 2026. Outside the U.S., we have made major strides in building out our innovative brand portfolio in Japan with the acquisition of Acculis.\nThe addition of [indiscernible] and [indiscernible] further expands our portfolio of innovative CNS products, which will be complemented by FX for generalized [indiscernible] disorder. These innovative assets, plus the many others in our late-stage pipeline combined with the strength of our generics and established brands portfolios position us well to positively impact patients' lives and create value for the business.\nNow I'll turn it over to [indiscernible].\n\nAaron Gal\n\nAnalyst, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC\n\nThank you, [indiscernible], and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that we had another strong quarter, underscoring the continued performance of our broad global portfolio of generic brands. My remarks this morning will focus on key highlights of our strong financial performance, significant free cash flow generation, capital allocation activities year-to-date and the outlook for the rest of this year. .\nFocusing on our third quarter results, total revenues were $3.76 billion, which were down approximately 1% versus the prior year. Excluding the indoor impact, we delivered operational revenue growth of approximately 1% versus the prior year. In developed markets, net sales were down 5%, primarily driven by the indoor impact.\nBreaking the segment down further. In Europe, our business continues to deliver consistent and durable performance, growing approximately 1% this quarter. The generics business continues to perform solidly and was up 5% year-over-year. This was primarily driven by new product revenues in key markets such as France and Eli. And within our branded business, solid growth in EpiPen, Creon and our Thrombosis portfolio helped to partially absorb the anticipated competition on Dymista. As anticipated, our North America business decreased 12% versus the prior year, primarily as a result of the indoor impact and competition on certain generic products. However, we continue to see double-digit growth in certain products such as [indiscernible] and YUPELRI as well as benefits from new product revenues, such as iron sucrose. In emerging markets, net sales increased approximately 7% versus the prior year. This was primarily driven by continued strength in our established brands across key markets, including Turkey, Mexico and Emerging Asia. And the growth in our generics business was primarily driven by stabilization of supply for certain lower-margin ARV products.\nIn Jan, net sales decreased approximately 9%. Results were primarily driven by expected impact from government price regulations as well as a change in reimbursement policy that impacted off-patent brands in Pan. We also saw competition on certain products in Australia. Lastly, we continue to see positive momentum in Greater China, where net sales exceeded expectations and grew 9%. This was primarily driven by our diversified commercial model and increased demand for our brands that are sensitive to proactive patient choice.\nNet sales again benefited from the timing of customer purchasing patterns, which we expect to moderate in the fourth quarter. Moving to the remainder of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 56% in the quarter was in line with our expectations. As anticipated, margins were impacted versus the prior year due to the indoor impact. Operating expenses were essentially flat versus the prior year. This was as a result of increased R&D spending driven by accelerated enrollment in our selatogral and cenerimod clinical trial programs, which was offset by the continued benefit in SG&A from our 2025 cost savings initiatives.\nWe continue to generate strong and durable free cash flow. This quarter, we generated $658 million of cash, which includes the impact of transaction-related costs. Excluding this impact, free cash flow would have been $728 million. Our significant free cash flow has enabled us to execute on our capital allocation plan.\nSince our Q2 call in August, we have repurchased an additional $150 million of shares, which brings our year-to-date total repurchases to $500 million, achieving the low end of our full year range. Including dividends paid, we have returned more than $920 million of capital this year to our shareholders, and we remain on track to deliver on our commitment of returning over $1 billion of capital this year. With regards to business development, the Acculis transaction highlights our ability to leverage our global infrastructure to strengthen our commercial portfolio in Japan through disciplined business development.\nThe $35 million upfront payment is expected to be expensed as IP R&D in the fourth quarter. Now a few comments on our updated outlook and phasing for the remainder of the year. We are raising and narrowing our 2025 financial guidance ranges across certain metrics, primarily driven by foreign exchange as well as share repurchases completed year-to-date. Our outlook is supported by the continued strength of our underlying business performance. With respect to anticipated phasing in the fourth quarter relative to our third quarter results, total revenues are expected to be lower across all of our segments due to normal product seasonality, resulting in our third quarter revenues being the highest quarter of the year.\nGross margins are expected to be stable, and SG&A is expected to increase due to investments in our pipeline and upcoming launches to drive future growth. Lastly, free cash flow is expected to step down due to the timing of interest payments and the normal phasing of capital expenditures. As we close out the year, we expect the underlying positive fundamentals of the business to continue. As normal course, we will provide our outlook for 2026 in the first quarter of next year. along with our Q4 and full year results. However, from where we sit today, there are several dynamics to consider as we think about next year.\nThese include timing of approvals and uptake from recently launched products, competitive dynamics in North America and potential loss of exclusivity for Amitiza in Japan. Investments supporting our pipeline and launch preparedness to drive future growth and the implementation of our enterprise-wide strategic review. In summary, we remain encouraged by the underlying fundamentals of our global business and the continued execution of our disciplined and balanced capital allocation plan.\nAs Scott mentioned, we plan on hosting an investor event during the first quarter of next year, where we expect to provide our strategic and financial outlook, an update on our pipeline and portfolio and details on our enterprise-wide strategic review.\nWith that, I'll hand it back to the operator to begin the Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] Please also note today's event is being recorded.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the floor over to Bill Szablewski, Head of Investor Relations. Sir? Please go ahead.\n\nWilliam Szablewski\n\nHead of Capital Markets\n\nGood morning, everyone.

We achieved 3 divestiture adjusted operational revenue growth, excluding the impact from [Audio Gap], driven primarily by strength in Europe and the Greater China region. These results reflect the strength of our execution and the resilience of our diversified global business. We have also made significant pipeline progress. 5 of our 6 anticipated Phase III readouts have shown positive results. Most recently, this includes positive data from 2 ophthalmology programs, targeting dim light disturbances and presbyopia, both of which address high unmet medical needs. With these readouts and our commercial assets, our IR Division remains well positioned to become a more meaningful contributor to be addressed over the next few years. Earlier this year, we shared positive results for Effexor for generalized anxiety disorder in Japan, Xulane Low Dose for contraception and our fast-acting formulation of meloxicam in acute pain. These achievements reinforce the strength of our pipeline and lay the foundation for the future.\nOf particular note, the 2 Phase III studies for our meloxicam candidate demonstrated meaningful improvement in pain and reduced opioid use relative to placebo, a well-characterized and well-tolerated safety profile, inferior pain control versus an opioid arm in post-hoc analysis. We expect to file by year-end and intend to commercialize this as a branded product, tapping into an $80 billion U.S. acute pain market.\nFor selatogrel and cenerimod, enrollment for the Phase III global programs for both assets is progressing well with first data readout expected in 2026. We continue to view both of these as potentially transformational blockbuster treatments for patients in their respective therapies areas.\nFor sotagliflozin, we received our first approval in the UAE earlier in the year and filings are progressing well in other key countries around the world. As our pipeline advances, we remain committed to returning meaningful capital to shareholders. So this year, we have returned more than $630 million, including $350 million in share repurchases. We continue to balance our focus on returns with strategic accretive in-market business development investments that could fuel future growth.\nWe are also making strong progress on our enterprise-wide strategic review, evaluating all aspects of our business to ensure we're building a company that is both competitive today and prepared for the future. We plan to share an update of our progress during our Q3 earnings call in November.\nTurning to operational priorities. We remain focused on remediation efforts at our indoor facility, which are now nearly complete. Before this month, we'll be asking the FDA for a meeting to discuss the progress of our remediation efforts and the potential timing for reinspection of the facility. At our Nashik facility, while FDA classification is still pending, all committed actions have been completed for some time. Encouragingly, we recently received FDA approval for darunavir tablets and antiretro revival medicine made at our Nashik facility.\nFinally, I'd like to touch on the recent policy developments, including proposed U.S. tariffs, which could impact the broader pharmaceutical landscape. Viatris serves approximately 1 billion patients worldwide each year. Our global supply chain is built to support patients where they live. Of the 37 manufacturing, distribution, R&D and packaging sites within our global network, 8 are located in the United States, which should position us well to navigate the impact of any future changes to trade policy. While we're monitoring tariff developments closely in order to assess potential impact on our business, based on the available information, we do not anticipate any material effect on 2025 financial picture. We will continue to assess the impact of any potential tariffs on patient access and company financials and will provide updates accordingly. We also continue to advocate strongly thoughtful policymaking that protects access to medication especially generics account for 90% prescriptions filled in the United States and just 1% of the total health care spend. Currently, more than half of our U.S. revenue is sourced domestically, and we are currently exploring ways to further leverage and expand our network. With that said, based on the current pricing dynamics in the generics industry, we believe that moving additional manufacturing of noncomplex generics in the United States would be very difficult in the short term and not likely sustainable in the long term. However, our move towards more complex innovative, higher-margin products does bring potential opportunity to further expand our domestic footprint. We are committed to evaluating all possible options. Ultimately, our goal is to ensure the right infrastructure is in place to [Audio Gap] in the United States and around the globe and maintain a sustainable business model.\nIn closing, we have great momentum going into the second half of the year. Given the [Audio Gap] results, we are reiterating our financial guidance ranges across all key metrics and currently expect to be in the top half of the range on revenue, adjusted EPS. We remain confident in the long-term trajectory of the interest. The strength of our business, our maturing late-stage pipeline, disciplined capital allocation and strategic flexibility positions us well for sustainable growth in '26 and beyond.\nNow I'd like to turn it over to Philippe for more details on the pipeline.\n\nPhilippe Martin\n\nChief Clinical Development & Operations\n\nThank you, Scott.\nWe are proud of the significant progress our R&D team has made in advancing our pipeline of generics and late-stage novel and innovative assets. Starting with our Phase III programs, where 5 of our 6 anticipated Phase III readouts have shown positive results. We're presenting detailed results from our fast-acting meloxicam pivotal studies at the upcoming Pain Week Medical Congress in September. Five abstracts were accepted covering efficacy, safety and reduction in opioid use and 2 different surgery models as well as pharmacokinetic data.\nOverall, we remain highly enthusiastic about the potential of this asset as an acute pain, non-opioid treatment option with a benefit risk profile that offers potential advantages over available treatment options and mainly to a significant reduction in opioid use. We are awaiting FDA's response on the potential for an early submission and accelerated approval path, given the strength of the data, the unmet public health need. We continue to target the submission of a new [Audio Gap] by the end of this year.\nTurning to Xulane Low Dose. We remain on track to submit the NDA in the coming weeks and anticipate approval mid next year. Our second contraceptive patch in development, not just terminally weekly patch, is more than halfway through Phase III enrollment with data expected by early 2027.\nNow shifting to our ophthalmology programs. We are pleased with the positive results we recently shared from the second pivotal Phase III trial of MR-141 in presbyopia. Results reinforce our confidence in MR-141 and its benefit risk profile as a potential noninvasive option to support the million of patients impacted by this cushion. We expect that this data will be presented at the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery Annual Meeting in April 2026. We are targeting our application to the FDA in the second half of 2025.\nIn June, we also announced both top line results from our pivotal Phase III trial evaluating MR-142 in treating visual disturbances in low-light conditions following keratorefractive surgery. The study demonstrated significant functional improvement in these patients in their ability to drive and function under low-light conditions. Importantly, there are currently no FDA approved options and the FDA has granted fast radiation, further emphasizing the unmet need. This data will be presented at the American Academy in Optometry in October 2025. We recently started our second pivotal study and expect to have results in the first half of 2026.\nThe last of the ophthalmology results that we recently announced was our Phase III study of MR-139 for blepharitis. The study did not meet its primary endpoint of complete resolution of debris at week 6, nominally significant change from baseline in debris at week 6 was observed, suggesting that this mechanism of action remains relevant for the treatment of blepharitis. MR-139 was generally safe and well tolerated. Additional work is ongoing to determine the appropriate next step for this program.\nMoving to selatogrel and cenerimod. We are pleased with our recruitment efforts for these 2 programs. For selatogrel, we have reached an enrollment rate of approximately 600 patients per month and anticipate we will reach approximately 1,000 patients per month by the end of the year and reach full enrollment 2026.\nTurning to cenerimod in SLE. Enrollment is nearing completion, and we have started notifying sites and investigators accordingly. We anticipate the first Phase III readout near the end of 2026 followed shortly thereafter by the second readout. And if effort to explore additional value, this asset can bring to patients. We have received positive feedback from FDA and EMA on our proposed Phase III registration study in lupus nephritis and anticipate having our first patient enrolled by the end of the year. We are also making great progress with the remainder of our late-stage pipeline. Regarding sotagliflozin, we recently received our first approval in the UAE within a very short turnaround time. We have filed in Saudi Arabia and are expecting to file in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico and Southeast Asian countries before the end of the year. As we mentioned in our last call, JNDA for Effexor guide is under review by the Japanese Health Authority and is progressing well. We anticipate approval in the first half of 2026. In addition, we've had 2 recent approvals in China for Breyna and Yupelri, demonstrating our capabilities in that market.\nFinally, within our generic pipeline, all products scheduled for approval in Q2 were approved, except for [indiscernible]. We believe our application is substantially through its scientific review and expect approval in the near future. The majority of our anticipated generic approvals are weighted toward the back half of the year, they remain largely on track, including for trio type.\nOverall, we are pleased with the strong momentum we have across our pipeline and remain focused on delivering meaningful innovation for patients that address areas of significant unmet medical need.\nAnd now I'll turn the call to Dorette.\n\nTheodora Mistras\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Philippe, and good morning, everyone.\nWe had another strong quarter, and the underlying fundamentals of our base business of generics and established brands remain strong. Today, I'll walk you through the key highlights the progress we've made against our capital allocation plan and our confidence in the outlook for the remainder of the year.\nOur second quarter results came in ahead of our expectations, reflecting our well-diversified global business. Total revenues for the quarter were $3.58 billion, which were down approximately 2% versus the prior year. Excluding the indoor impact of approximately $160 million, our operational revenue growth versus the prior year would have been approximately 3%.\nNow let me walk you through the commercial highlights for the quarter across our segments, which includes the indoor impact. In developed markets, we saw continued strength in brands, which helped to partially offset the indoor impact. From a regional perspective, we continue to see consistent and durable growth from our European business, which grew approximately 2% this quarter in line with our expectations. In Europe, brands portfolio grew approximately 3%, led by EpiPen, Creon and Brufen in addition to positive contributions from key markets, including Italy. Generics performance in Europe was flat year-over-year despite the indoor impact and continues to benefit from the new product revenues in key markets such as France. As anticipated, our North American business decreased 11% versus the prior year, primarily as a result of the indoor impact and competition on Wixela and other products. This was partially offset by continued growth in Yupelri and Breyna as well as contributions from new product revenues. In emerging markets, net sales exceeded expectations and increased approximately 1% versus the prior year. This was primarily driven by continued strength in Turkey and our emerging Asia region as well as stabilization in the Korean market. This performance helped to more than absorb the indoor impact affecting our ARV generics business.\nIn Jan, net sales decreased approximately 11%. Results were primarily driven by expected government price regulations and a change in reimbursement policy impacting off-patent brands in Japan and competition in Australia. This was partially offset by slight volume increases in our generics portfolio in Japan. Lastly, we continue to see positive momentum in Greater China. Net sales exceeded expectations and grew 9%, driven by continued growth across the portfolio due to proactive patient choice. Net sales also benefited from the timing of customer purchasing patterns in the quarter, which we expect to moderate in the second half.\nMoving to the remainder of the P&L, adjusted gross margin of 56.6% in the quarter was in line with our expectations. As anticipated, margins were impacted versus the prior year due to the indoor impact as well as price regulations in Japan. Operating expenses were down versus the prior year as a result of the planned cost initiative, which primarily benefited SG&A.\nTurning to free cash flow. We generated $167 million of cash in the quarter. Excluding the impact of transaction-related costs, we would have generated $241 million during the quarter. This was in line with our expectations and reflects the timing of semiannual interest payments and working capital requirements in the quarter.\nMoving to capital allocation. We have repurchased shares totaling $350 million year-to-date, including dividends paid we have earned more than $630 million of capital this year to our shareholders. With this continued progress, we remain on track to deliver on our commitment of capital return this year.\nNow a few comments on our outlook and phasing for the rest of the year. Based on the strong operational performance year-to-date and continued visibility of the anticipated indoor impact, we are reaffirming all guidance ranges. Within total revenues, we expect to be in the top half of the guidance range as a result of positive operational momentum and the year-to-date benefit from foreign exchange. We also expect adjusted EPS to be in the top half of the guidance range, primarily driven by share repurchases. Some of the pushes and pulls in this outlook include: our continued expectation of divestiture adjusted growth, excluding the indoor impact of approximately 2%, continued growth in Europe, Greater China and emerging markets regions, and delays in the anticipated timing of approvals and launches of certain generic products, which could negatively impact our new product revenues this year.\nLastly, we continue to monitor foreign exchange. If current rates were to hold for the remainder of the year, it could result in an additional 1% to 2% tailwind on total revenues. This also results in adjusted EBITDA being in the top half of our guidance range. As a reminder, any potential foreign exchange tailwinds benefiting total revenues would incorporate certain hedging program costs, which could reduce the benefit to adjusted EBITDA. It is important to note that our guidance does not account for any potential impact related to industry tariffs. However, as Scott mentioned, we continue to assess the potential for future impact but based on available information, we do not anticipate any material impact on our 2025 financial results. The following are a few points about anticipated phasing for the rest of the year. Total revenues are still expected to be slightly higher in the second half at approximately 51%. This reflects phasing of indoor, normal product seasonality and low to mid-single-digit growth in Greater China. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS are still expected to be higher in the second half. This incorporates the timing of spend and investments we are making to support our pipeline and upcoming launches.\nLast, free cash flow is also expected to be higher in the second half and is expected to benefit from the timing of net working capital and disciplined inventory management. As you heard, our results for the quarter reflect strong performance. We remain encouraged by the underlying fundamentals of our global business growth and the success of our recent pipeline readout. With these positive trends, we are building strong momentum for the rest of the year.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it back to the operator to begin the Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Bill Szablewski, Head of Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nWilliam Szablewski\n\nHead of Capital Markets, Viatris Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to our Q1 2025 earnings call. With us today is our CEO, Scott Smith; CFO, Theodora Mistras. Chief R&D Officer, Philippe Martin; and Chief Commercial Officer, [ Karen Magal. ] During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements on a number of matters, including our financial guidance for 2025 and various strategic initiatives.\nThese statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. We will also be referring to certain actual and projected non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to today's slide presentation and our SEC filings for more information, including reconciliations of those non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nWhen discussing 2025 actual reported results, we will be making certain comparisons to 2024 actual or reported results on a divestiture adjusted operational basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency rates and also excludes the proportionate results from the divestitures that closed in 2024 from the 2024 period. We may refer to those as changes on an operational basis.\nWhen comparing our 2025 actual reported results to our expectations, we are making comparisons to our 2025 financial guidance. With that, I'll hand the call over to our CEO, Scott Smith.\n\nScott Andrew Smith\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Celgene Corp.\n\nGood morning, everyone. 2025 is off to a good start as we continue to focus on executing on our strategic priorities. Highlights include Q1 operational performance in line with expectations, significant pipeline progress, including 3 positive Phase III data readouts, returned approximately $450 million in capital to shareholders with approximately $300 million of that through share repurchases continued remediation of our indoor facility and on track to request reinspection midyear, significant progress on our enterprise-wide strategic review, working to set the organization up for future growth.\nIn Q1, we delivered $3.3 billion in total revenues, down 2% on a divestiture adjusted operational basis, driven primarily by the impact of indoor. We were particularly pleased with our strong execution and growth in Europe and China this quarter. So far this year, we've made tremendous progress in advancing our pipeline, and Philippe will provide additional details shortly.\nThis morning, we announced positive data for Phase III studies of our novel fast-acting [ meloxicam ] in moderate to severe acute pain. This is a significant advancement for Viatris in an area of high unmet medical need. We believe there's a tremendous demand for more non-opioid treatment options for patients in moderate severe acute pain.\nWe look very much forward to progressing this treatment for registrational filings in 2025. Additionally, in the quarter, we received positive data for [indiscernible] a transdermal patch that is being developed to offer women a low-dose estrogen combination birth control option. We plan to submit our NDA in the second half of this year.\nEarlier this quarter, we received positive results from the Phase III open-label long-term extension study for Effexor required for approval in Japan, where we filed an sNDA for Effexor for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, an indication for which no other treatment option is currently available or approved in Japan. To date, we received 3 of the 6 Phase III data readouts that we are expecting this year.\nImportantly, all other studies remain on track to read out later this year. In addition, we continue to make great progress on selatogrel, cenerimod and sotagliflozin, and these innovative assets remain on track for important data readouts beginning in 2026. As previously discussed, in Q1, we entered into agreement with our partners from Idorsia that allows us even greater control over the selatogrel cenerimod development programs and expands our geographic ownership of cenerimod.\nFrom a capital allocation perspective, during this period of significant market and policy unpredictability, we have prioritized returning capital to shareholders. To date, we have returned approximately $450 million in capital to shareholders with approximately $300 million of that from share repurchases and $143 million from dividends. We are reaffirming our commitment to prioritize return of capital to shareholders in 2025.\nWe continue to make progress on remediation at our indoor facility and have engaged third-party subject matter experts to assist in this task. As stated in February, we expect to submit a request for reinspection midyear. We have also kicked off our enterprise-wide strategic review and are taking the opportunity to look at our business holistically. We will do this while ensuring we continue to protect and grow the base business and further develop our innovative capabilities.\nThis is an opportunity for us to look at streamlining costs globally to reflect our smaller and more simplified post-divestiture footprint and ensure we are ready for the next stage of sustainable revenue and earnings growth. Considering our performance in the first quarter, we are reaffirming our outlook for the year.\nTurning to the current discussions around tariffs. At Viatris, we take seriously our mission to empower people worldwide to live healthier at every stage of life. In fact, we are very proud that we serve approximately 1 billion patients worldwide each year. While tariffs on pharmaceuticals [indiscernible] could have a negative financial impact on the organization, we are also concerned about the potential for additional supply shortages and disruptions that could have a significant impact on the ability for Americans and indeed patients around the globe to access the medicines they need.\nWe currently commercialize our products in 165 countries and have 36 manufacturing, R&D and packaging sites around the globe. Eight of these facilities are in the United States. We have deep expertise in managing a global supply network, and we are continually taking steps to be nimble and responsive to any opportunities or challenges that lie ahead.\nWhile our global and diverse supply chain is optimized to support patients where they live, as a U.S. company, we have been in the past and continues to be today, firmly committed to manufacturing in the United States. Last year, we manufactured approximately 8.5 billion doses in the U.S. and more than 50% of our U.S. revenue is currently sourced from the U.S. manufacturing site.\nWe look forward to understanding more about the specifics around the executive order issued earlier this week as we continue to explore ways to optimize the flexibility of our global network, including the potential to increase our manufacturing capacity in the U.S. We remain focused on ensuring we have the right footprint in the right places so we can continue to serve our patients worldwide while also maintaining a profitable and sustainable business.\nI'm now very excited to talk about the most recent addition to our executive leadership team. [indiscernible] joined us in as Chief Strategy Officer. He brings deep experience across the biotech and pharmaceutical industries and in every area of our portfolio, generics, complex generics, brands and innovative products.\nHe also holds a PhD in medical biophysics, giving him a unique perspective into the health care industry. I look forward to working with [indiscernible] the rest of our leadership team and, in fact, all of our colleagues globally as we continue to work to drive our base business, execute on our pipeline return capital to shareholders and position ourselves for growth in 2026 and beyond.\nNow let me turn it over to Philippe to discuss the exciting developments in our pipeline in more detail. Philippe?\n\nPhilippe Martin\n\nChief Clinical Development & Operations\n\nThank you, Scott. We have strong momentum advancing our Phase III programs, which is one of our key priorities this year. We previously mentioned that we would have 6 Phase III readouts in 2025. We've already had the first 3 readouts, and I'm pleased to report that all 3 are positive. These programs are now moving to the regulatory submission preparation phase.\nLet's begin with the Phase III readout of our investigational MR-107A-02 program for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain that we announced earlier today. The development of safe and effective alternative treatments to opioids is an important public health need. The improvement in pain we observed from our fast-acting meloxicam compared to placebo were statistically significant and clinically meaningful, building on an established mechanism of action and well-characterized safety profile.\nOur primary and secondary endpoints were met in both Phase III study. These results were consistent across multiple post-surgery models of moderate to severe acute pain. We believe that when approved, it is all non-opioid analgesic option for the treatment of moderate to CV acute pain will get us closer to addressing this important public health need.\nIn addition to placebo, these trials included an opioid arm, tramadol 50-milligram given every 6 hours to confirm the sensitivity of the pain model. Importantly, and in contrast to recently approved agents, our fast-acting meloxicam demonstrated superior pain control versus the opioid arm in both surgical models, further strengthening its value as a potential non-opioid option for acute moderate to severe pain.\nFor Cortex, this regimen of tramadol equals 40-year-old morphine equivalents, which is twofold higher than hydrocodone 20 milligram. Additionally, our fast-acting meloxicam demonstrated a significant reduction in opioid usage across both studies. This was demonstrated by a significant reduction in opioid use versus placebo and a significantly higher number of opioid-free patients on fast-acting meloxicam and placebo.\nOur fast-acting meloxicam was generally well tolerated. In both studies, incidence of TAEs was comparable to placebo in a postsurgical setting, few severe TAEs and SAs were reported with a rate consistent with placebo. No TAEs leading to death were reported. These 2 pivotal studies optimally position our fast-acting meloxicam for potential first-line treatment for moderate to severe acute pain. The company is targeting to submit a new drug application to the FDA by the end of the year based on the positive data from these 2 Phase III studies and supportive positive Phase II dose-ranging finding data in dental pain.\nWe also anticipate that the full data set from both Phase III studies will be presented during the Pain Week Medical Conference in September in Las Vegas. Next, let me provide more details about the positive results from our investigational Xulane Low Phase III readout that we have also announced today.\nThere are 3 important conclusions from the study. One is confirm the effectiveness of Xulane Low weekly patch for birth control in women of child-bearing potential. Two, we demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile with most TAs reported as mild to moderate and no new safety concerns identified. And three, it demonstrated potential best-in-class patch performance with very few patches completely detaching over the 7-day wearing period and less than 1% of trial subjects reporting severe local application site reactions.\nOverall, we are pleased with the results and believe Xulane Low also has the potential to address an important unmet need for women seeking a reversible birth control option with a lower dose of estrogen. We also design our patch with certain texture and sizing properties that we believe could be appealing to women we're seeking another weekly birth control patch option.\nViatris has a long history and strong track record of developing and manufacturing dermal patches at our R&D and manufacturing facilities in Vermont. We are looking forward to progressing this product toward regulatory submission, which we anticipate will be in the second half of this year. We also anticipate that the results from this Phase III study will be presented at the next American College of obstetrician and Gynecology conference.\nOur remaining Phase III readouts anticipated this year relate to our ophthalmology program. We remain on track to receive 3 key Phase III registrational readouts in the first half of the year. These include [indiscernible] for blepharitis, [ tantalamina ] ophthalmic solution for presbyopia and for visual loss in low-light conditions associated with [indiscernible] surgery. As for other advancements in our pipeline, our regulatory team is hard at work advancing key submissions.\nWe recently filed application to the Japanese health authorities for approval of Effexor for the treatment of adults with generalized angle disorder. There is no other treatment option currently approved for this indication in Japan. Our positive results from our previously announced Phase III efficacy and safety studies laid the foundations for our applications.\nWe are also pleased that these results have been accepted as a poster presentation at the Japanese Society of Neurology and Psychiatry Conference. In addition, we are focused on preparing our submissions for sotagliflozin in a number of ex-U.S. markets. Our findings in UAE and Saudi Arabia have been submitted, and we expect to [indiscernible] in Canada soon.\nMoving to selatogrel and cenerimod. Enrollment for both programs remains on schedule. We recently presented data at PANLAR that covered the multifaceted immunomodulatory properties of [indiscernible] Also, we are pleased to share the acceptance of our abstracts covering data from the additional analysis of the Phase II CARE study, providing information related to fatigue and quality of life at Lupus 2025 and maintenance of response at [ Ula ] 2025.\nWe look forward to continuing to engage with the rheumatology and lupus scientific and patient communities at several congresses throughout the year. For selatogrel, we had very productive discussions at the recent American College of Cardiology Congress and continue to see strong interest in the trial within the cardiology community.\nLastly, regarding our base business portfolio, we are on track with the approvals required for us to deliver $450 million to $550 million of new product revenue this year. including our anticipated approval for iron sucrose, octreotide and liraglutide. Overall, it's a strong start to the year. Our R&D strategy is driven by our deep in-house development capabilities and expertise and we are very pleased with our steady disciplined progress to date.\nI will now turn the call to Doretta.\n\nTheodora Mistras\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Philippe, and good morning, everyone. I'm glad you could join us. Today, I will walk you through the key drivers and takeaways for the quarter, the progress we're making against our capital allocation plan and our outlook for the remainder of the year. Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations and reflect our well-diversified global business.\nTotal revenues for the quarter were $3.25 billion, down 2% versus the prior year. The impact from indoor in the first quarter was approximately $140 million, which was in line with our expectations. Excluding this impact, operational revenue would have increased 2% versus the prior year. As Scott mentioned, the remediation effort at Indoor is progressing as planned.\nOur revenues benefited from growth in our brands of 3%. This was primarily driven by the expansion of our cardiovascular portfolio in emerging markets and growth in Greater China and developed markets. In developed markets, overall net sales were impacted by declines in our generics business, partially offset by growth in brands. From a regional perspective, we continue to see consistent and durable growth from our European business growing approximately 1% this quarter.\nThe brand portfolio grew 2%, led by Creon, Brufen and our thrombosis portfolio. Generics performance was flat year-over-year despite the indoor impact and continues to benefit from key markets such as France. Our North American business decreased 8% versus the prior year, primarily as a result of the indoor impact and competition on select generic products, which was expected.\nThis was partially offset by new product revenues and continued growth in [indiscernible] In emerging markets, net sales decreased approximately 5% versus the prior year primarily driven by the indoor impact and customer buying patterns affecting the ARV generics business.\nPartially offsetting this performance was growth in brands across the cardiovascular portfolio in certain Latin American countries and continued strength in the MENA and Eurasia region. In our Jan segment, net sales decreased approximately 6%.\nResults were primarily driven by expected government price regulations in Japan and Australia and a change in reimbursement impacting off-patent brands in Japan. This was partially offset by volume increases in the generics portfolio. Lastly, we see continued positive momentum in Greater China.\nNet sales grew 4%, which was as a result of our diversified model across e-commerce, retail and private hospitals. This led to growth across the portfolio, particularly brands that are sensitive to proactive patient choice. And looking at the P&L, adjusted gross margin of approximately 56% in the quarter was in line with expectations.\nAs anticipated, margins declined versus the prior year due to price regulations in Jan, the impact of indoor and the increase in certain product supply costs. Operating expenses were roughly flat versus prior year. Cost savings initiatives benefiting SG&A were offset by investments in R&D to advance our innovative pipeline. Finally, the company had a triggering event for goodwill impairment testing in the first quarter.\nDue to a decline in our share price and the increased uncertainty and volatility in the geopolitical and economic environment in which we operate. As a result, for U.S. GAAP purposes, we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of $2.9 billion, driven by an increase in discount rate assumptions reflecting the increased business risk. Despite this, we remain confident in our base business outlook and in our ability to deliver on our expectations for the year.\nTurning to free cash flow. For the quarter, it was $493 million and would have been $535 million, excluding transaction costs and taxes from the divestitures. Moving to capital allocation. We continue to prioritize capital return. And since the beginning of the year, we have repurchased over $300 million worth of shares. Including our Q1 dividend payment, we are pleased to have already returned more than $450 million of capital to our shareholders. Now a few comments on our outlook and phasing for the rest of the year.\nBased on the performance in the first quarter and trends we are seeing across the business, we are reaffirming our outlook for the year. Within our guidance, the drivers of total revenue include no change to the base business outlook, including the estimated financial impact from indoor and continued confidence in meeting our new product revenue range of $450 million to $550 million.\nWhile foreign exchange has been volatile, we have seen spot rates move favorably over the past month. And if current rates hold for the remainder of the year, this could offset the 2% to 3% headwind we had previously incorporated in our full year revenue guidance. Due to finalizing an agreement to expand our commercial rights for cenerimod, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS guidance reflects a $10 million impact from IP R&D.\nAdjusted EPS also reflects the benefit from share repurchases executed to date. It's important to note that our guidance does not account for any potential impact related to industry tariffs. With regards to anticipated phasing for the rest of the year, total revenues are still expected to be higher in the second half at approximately 52% of our full year outlook.\nThis reflects the estimated impact of indoor, normal product seasonality and back-weighted launches of new products. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS are still expected to be higher in the second half. And as a reminder, free cash flow is expected to be lowest in Q2 due to timing of semiannual interest payments and working capital requirements. In conclusion, I want to take the opportunity to reiterate our confidence in the fundamentals of our business and the progress we continue to make executing against our strategic priorities.\nOur well-diversified global business and our strong cash flow enables us to continue delivering on returning capital to our shareholders. We believe we are well positioned to meet our expectations for the remainder of this year. And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator to begin the Q&A"

[Operator Instructions] Please also note, today's event is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to Bill Szablewski, Head of Capital Markets. Sir, please go ahead.\n\nWilliam Szablewski\n\nHead of Capital Markets\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to our Q4 2024 earnings call. With us today is our CEO, Scott Smith; CFO, Theodora Mistras; Chief R&D Officer, Philippe Martin; and Chief Commercial Officer, Corinne Le Goff. During this call, we'll be making forward-looking statements on a number of matters, including our financial guidance for 2025 and various strategic initiatives.

We may refer to those as changes on an operational basis.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to our CEO, Scott Smith.\n\nScott Andrew Smith\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Celgene Corp.\n\nGood morning, everyone. 2024 was an important year for Viatris across all 3 of our strategic pillars. We saw growth in our base business, increasing our new product revenues to $582 million. We completely planned divestitures to simplify and streamline our organization. We returned approximately $825 million in capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We retired approximately $3.7 billion of debt and achieved our long-term gross leverage target.\nAnd we expanded our innovative portfolio with 3 new products: selatogrel, cenerimod and sodaliglozin or soda to help build our pipeline in the future. We finished 2024 with a full year revenue growth of 2% on a divestiture adjusted operational basis, in line with our guidance. On a reported basis, we had total revenues of approximately $14.7 billion, adjusted EBITDA of approximately $4.7 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.65 per share.\nFree cash flow was approximately [ $2.6 ] million, excluding divestiture related taxes and transaction costs. All in all, a very good year. Before we dive into our [indiscernible] priorities, I want to give you an update on the remediation at our facility in Indore, India and the estimated impact for this year. The FDA inspected the facility in June. Following the inspection, we immediately began implementing a comprehensive remediation plan to address the FDA feedback. The necessary corrective actions are well underway, including, but not limited to the late personnel actions, and we have engaged independent third-party subject matter experts to support our efforts.\nI assure you we take these matters very seriously as well as our commitment to quality across our entire network. We recently traveled to [indiscernible] to review the progress. I can tell you we are more than halfway through our efforts. We expect to be completed in a few months, at which time we anticipate asking the FDA to conduct a reinspection of the facility. [indiscernible] received a warning letter and import alert from the FDA at the end of December. The important alert affects 11 actively distributed products in the U.S., including lenalidomide.\nThe FDA made an exception subject to certain conditions for 4 products based on shortage concerns. We refinished interactions with the FDA about potential additional products exceptional and we do not expect any additional exceptions will be granted at this time. While product continues to be shipped from the facility to markets outside the U.S., we currently anticipate some impact in other markets, including parts of our ARV business and emerging markets and to select generic products in Europe.\nWe currently estimate the negative impact on 2025 total revenues to be approximately $500 million and on 2025 adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $385 million. To meet the needs of the patients we serve, we closely [indiscernible] with our customers to mitigate any supply disruptions, including potential site transfers and third-party arrangements.\nTurning our attention to our 2025 priorities. We are very focused on continuing to drive our base business with strong execution across commercial markets, and we are expecting several notable new product launches this year. From a pipeline perspective, we have 10 unique molecules in Phase III clinical development across our portfolio, and we are expecting 6 Phase III readouts this year, including for [indiscernible], which is being developed as an opioid-sparing treatment and acute pain.\nIn addition, we expect to achieve several important late-stage development milestones for our 3 innovative assets, selatogrel, cenerimod and soda. To preserve the ongoing continuity of the development programs for selatogrel and cenerimod, we have updated certain terms of our original global research and development class. Under the updated terms, we will receive the rights to additional territories for cenerimod including important markets in Asia, a reduction in certain contingent milestone payments, which will help improve the long-term economics of these assets, and certain other considerations in exchange for assuming a portion of Idorsia's remaining development cost obligation.\nWe continue to be excited by the promise of these 2 assets and will take full control over the development to help ensure development time lines remain on track. From a capital allocation perspective, we said that we expect our approach to be equally balanced between capital return and business investment over the next 3 to 5 years. And in any given year, we may prioritize one over the other. In 2025, we are prioritizing returning capital to shareholders. We will continue to support our dividend and are targeting at least $500 million to $650 million in share repurchases this year.\nAs we progress through the year, we expect to have additional flexibility. And as a reminder, we still have $1.5 billion in share repurchase authorization available to us. From a business development perspective, we will target accretive regional opportunities that leverage our unique commercial and R&D infrastructure and capabilities. Finally, we've begun an enterprise-wide initiative to review our global infrastructure and identify additional cost savings.\nWe expect this program to deliver OpEx savings in 2026 and beyond. Later this year, we'll hold an Investor Day to talk about our long-term outlook, how we are advancing our base and innovative pipelines and the progress we are making on our enterprise-wide review. Overall, I'm proud of what we accomplished in 2024, and I'm very confident in our future. We have our arms around the situation at Indore. In 2025, we have significant opportunity to drive our base business execute on our pipeline, return capital to shareholders and position ourselves for growth in 2026 and beyond.\nNow I'll turn it over to Philippe to share an update on how we are advancing our pipeline. Philippe?\n\nPhilippe Martin\n\nChief Clinical Development & Operations\n\nThank you, Scott. Our base business pipeline continues to be highly diversified across core generics, complex generics and novel products. This robust and deep pipeline representing approximately 100-plus submissions annually is the backbone of our ability to deliver more than $450 million in new product revenues for each of the last 5 years. Great progress in '24, delivering $582 million in new product revenues, setting us up very nicely to hit our target range of $450 million to $550 million in 2025. This is a particularly important year from an R&D and scientific execution perspective as we expect to receive approvals on a number of complex injectables that we have been steadily and strategically developing [indiscernible] sucrose, octreotide and liraglutide.\nGlucagon was approved last year and is actively being launched. These are difficult to develop and difficult to manufacture medicines, and we are proud of the scientific and development expertise we have built in this area. We plan to continue to leverage this differentiated platform as we further advance our base business pipeline. In parallel, we're getting these complex injectables to approval. We are also very focused on progressing our novel and life cycle management programs.\nWe have a number of Phase III readouts in 2025. The most near-term opportunity is Effexor for generalizing anxiety disorder in Japan. We announced positive top line results of our randomized double-blind placebo-controlled Phase III study last year and recently received positive results from the Phase III open-label long-term extension required for approval in Japan. We anticipate filing our submission in the first half of this year.\nAnother key program is for Xulane low dose, which is a transdermal patch that is being developed to offer women a low-dose estrogen combination birth control option. We expect our Phase III readout in the first half of this year. We received positive results from our first meloxicam Phase III bunionectomy study and are feeling optimistic about our development program as we await our second Phase III readout [indiscernible], which is anticipated later this year. We believe that this novel, fast-acting oral formulation of meloxicam has the potential to be an important operate option for patients with acute pain.\nNow moving to our innovative pipeline, beginning with eye care. We are continuing to advance our ophthalmology programs with these 3 key registrational readouts expected in 2025. We are on track to receive top line data for our MR139 or pMecolomus Phase III study for blepharitis in the first half of this year. We also have recently completed enrollment for our Phase III study, evaluating MR141 for price build and expect to receive top line results in the first half of this year.\nAdditionally, our partner recently received Fast Track designation from the FDA for their investigational new drug application for MR142, which is being developed for the treatment of visual loss in low-light conditions associated with Keratorefractive surgery. A substantial subset of these patients has night driving impairment for which there is no label treatment, thereby supporting the Fast Track designation. The development of this asset is also progressing well, and we anticipate completing Phase III enrollment and receiving top line results in the first half of this year.\nSelatogrel and cenerimod, we continue to be focused on increasing and accelerating trial enrollment for both SMI and Opus. Recruitment for Opus is well underway with plans to complete enrollment in the second half of this year. We continue to submit data from the Phase II CARE study for publication, and 3 abstracts have recently been accepted for presentation at 2 major congresses, Lupus 2025 and PANLAR 2025. Discover the multifaceted immunomgelatory properties of cenerimod and subgroup analysis from the Phase II CARE study on quality of life and impact on fatigue.\nRegarding selatogrel, the SOS MI trial is progressing according to previously communicated time lines. We have scaled up trial recruitment and increased awareness of the study. We are continuing to build on our legacy in this space and actively engaged key opinion leaders and the broader cardiovascular community at key medical meetings around the world. Moving to [indiscernible]. We are pleased with the recent public net diabetes and endocrinology. This data provides strong evidence of sotagliflozin's clinical benefit in reducing major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes, CKD and high cardiovascular risk.\nThe findings showed that sotagliflozin significantly and meaningfully reduces MACE versus placebo, demonstrating early and broad cardiovascular protection in this population. Sotagliflozin is the first SGLT inhibitor to show significant reduction in both stroke highlighting the potential role of SGLT1 inhibition in reducing ischemic events, an important distinction from selective SGLT2 inhibitors.\nWe are now collaborating with our partner, Lexicon to explore next steps, including a potential label expansion to increase patient access as we continue to remain on track for our regulatory submissions starting in 2025 in key ex-U.S. markets. We will be leveraging the dossier that led to FDA approval and expect registration in these markets starting in 2026. To recap, our R&D strategy is grounded in being disciplined about executing our near-term programs while preparing for the future. We have a strong focus on advancing our base business and innovative pipelines across multiple fronts with important complex generics approval, Phase III data readouts and key development milestones in our novel and innovative pipelines, all expected this year. And we are continuing to actively build our GLP-1 pipeline and supply chain, which we will share more information about at our upcoming Investor Day.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Corinne.\n\nCorinne M. Le Goff\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Moderna, Inc.\n\nThank you, Philippe. I'd like to start by outlining our 3 commercial priorities in 2025. First is driving the best business. 2024 was a strong year. All commercial segments grew year-over-year operationally. We aim to continue this momentum with focused execution in every aspect of the business to maximize the potential of our broad generic and brand portfolios. This means continued attention on delivering high customer service levels and leveraging our global health care gateway and regal capabilities and infrastructure to expand patient access. Our second priority is to execute our product launches.\nWe're expecting a number of new products coming this year, such as our complex injectables. In total, we are tracking more than [indiscernible] generic launches globally, and our aim is to ensure commercial success for each launch. The fundamentals of our base business are strong, and we are confident we will deliver the expected $450 million to $550 million in new product revenues. Our third priority is preparing the future business. We are [indiscernible] our strong commercial infrastructure by enhancing our innovative product commercialization capabilities and expertise across key markets. And we are developing global commercialization strategies for innovative and novel pipeline assets.\nTurning to our outlook for the year. As we heard from Scott, we are expecting an approximate $500 million revenue impact related to Indore affecting mostly the U.S. and emerging markets. In 2025, we expect total revenues to decline approximately 1%. Now let's dive into the geographic segments starting with developed markets. Europe is expected to grow year-over-year.\nI want to highlight some of the key positive drivers behind this anticipated performance. First, we expect new product launches in both our brand and generic portfolios, including carryover benefits from the [indiscernible] combination and rivaroxaban. Then the continued performance of our Thrombosis portfolio as well as key brands, LACREON and Brufen. And finally, we anticipate further volume growth in key markets, including Italy and France and strong generic performance across our diverse portfolio.\nNorth America is expected to decline year-over-year, which is driven by the Indore impact and expected competition on certain generics, including Fulin, [indiscernible] and prednisolone. Our focus is to continue to capitalize on the strength of our complex generics portfolio with a stable contribution of products like Wixela and Breyna as well as continuing the growth trajectory of promoted brands like YUPELRI, actively planning for several new launches during the course of the year in the complex injectable space, including iron sucrose and octreotide plus glucagon, which we are in the midst of launching.\nThe emerging markets segment is expected to grow year-over-year primarily driven by further expansion of our cardiovascular portfolio in Latin America as well as expansion in key markets such as Turkey, India, Korea, Brazil and emerging Asia, and volume growth on our overall base portfolio. Moving to JANZ. Similar to 2024, this year, we expect new government-driven price regulations in Japan and Australia as well as from -- in Japan's reimbursement off-patent brands that accelerated generic conversion.\nWhile we are forecasting JANZ to decline in 2025, we continue to benefit from ongoing from key brands and the expansion of our generic business, including through ongoing business development efforts. Japan is a key market and we're well underway preparing for the future. We are building our commercialization plans around a number of innovative and novel assets, such as FX for generalized anxiety disorder, Nefecon, scenario mode selatogrel and sotagliflozin. And lastly, in Greater China, we expect to deliver year-over-year growth in 2025, stemming from the continued patient demand for our portfolio of iconic brands addressing chronic diseases that are more and more prevalent in China's growing age.\nOur significant presence and leading organization in China as well as our commitment to patient access allow us to meet expanding health care demand. In addition, we expect to deliver on our pipeline with new product launches of Dymista and Breyna in China. By continuing to maximize our well-established commercial presence across multiple channels, including e-commerce, retail and private hospitals, we expect to be able to absorb the impacts from potential government implemented health care policy regulations. Overall, we are confident we will be able to deliver on our 2025 commitments through driving the base business and executing our new product launches while preparing for successful future innovative launches.\nWith that, I'll turn to Theodora.\n\nTheodora Mistras\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Corinne. Building on the team's comments around our operational performance, I'll briefly highlight full year and fourth quarter results. As a reminder, my commentary on our financial performance will be on a divestiture adjusted operational basis. We reported 2024 total revenues of $14.7 billion, which was up 2% year-over-year. This reflects growth across all segments and new product revenues of $582 million, the high end of our increased range.\nAdjusted EBITDA was [ $7 ] billion, which benefited from adjusted gross margins of 58% also at the high end of our range, driven by strong brands and complex generics performance. As it specifically relates to the fourth quarter, total revenues of $3.5 billion were in line with our expectations [indiscernible]. We saw continued momentum in growth across China, developed markets and emerging markets.\nOur global generics business grew 2%, driven by new product launches and complex products. Gross margins were in line with expectations and moderated in the fourth quarter due to expected segment and product mix. We had a strong cash flow totaling $685 million, excluding the impact from divestiture costs and taxes.\nOur free cash flow and proceeds from the divestitures were used to pay down approximately $1.4 billion in debt, which enabled us to achieve our gross leverage target at approximately 2.9x. Now that we've closed the year, we are also providing an estimate of our 2024 results on an x divestiture basis. These estimates exclude the benefit from the divested businesses totaling approximately $490 million in total revenue and $255 million in adjusted EBITDA.\nMoving to our plan for 2025 as the key drivers to give you a full picture of the year ahead. Given the continued strength of the dollar, we have assumed an FX headwind of approximately 2% to 3% on total revenue. As a reminder, approximately 75% of our revenues occur outside U.S. Excluding the impact of Indore, we expect our operational revenues to benefit from continued momentum and strong fundamentals, primarily in Europe, China and emerging markets. These trends give us confidence in the continued strength of our base business going forward.\nAnd as you heard from Scott, with respect to Indore, ongoing remediation has been an all-hands effort and is a top priority for our organization. We take the quality of our products very seriously and are making progress on the remediation plan, including the transfer of products across in [indiscernible] and with third parties where deemed possible and appropriate. Discussions with the FDA and our customers have been ongoing and have evolved to a point where we now have clarity on the products and scope and the anticipated associated financial impact, which we have included in our guidance.\nWe estimate an impact of approximately $500 million to 2025 total revenue and $385 million to adjusted EBITDA. This includes estimated penalties and supply disruptions [indiscernible] $100 million, which we believe are mostly short term in nature. Lenalidomide, which after discussions with the FDA, was not granted an exception is the largest product impacted and represents approximately 40% of the total revenue impact and 50% of the total adjusted EBITDA impact given its margin profile.\nAlso, based upon the existing settlement agreements with generic manufacturers, we [indiscernible] this product will face significant additional competition in early 2026. In Europe, we expect limited impact to select generic products. We believe this impact to be short term and expect to recapture some of this volume in the future. In emerging markets, we anticipate our lower-margin ARB business to experience certain disruptions over the short term, and we estimate an impact on total revenue of approximately $125 million.\nMoving to the drivers of gross margins and our adjusted EBITDA and EPS guidance. [indiscernible] gross margins to be impacted by Indore, normal base business price erosion and an increase in some product supply costs. Partially offsetting this impact is the expected benefit from segment mix. As it relates to our outlook for SG&A and R&D, we are taking a disciplined approach to managing our expenses and allocation of resources.\nTotal operating expenditures are expected to decline as we work to optimize the portfolio and reduced stranded costs associated with the divestitures. Our guidance assumes a reduction of approximately $150 million, predominantly benefiting SG&A. And with respect to Idorsia, as Scott mentioned, we have amended the collaboration agreement. As a result, we expect to incur an incremental R&D expense of approximately $100 million in 2025. In exchange, we have received a $250 million reduction in contingent milestones, of which $200 million is from future development milestones.\nWe have also gained additional territory rights for cenerimod. We expect this tax rate to increase by 150 basis points in 2025 due anticipated impacts from Pillar 2. A few points on our expectations for free cash flow and cash available for deployment in 2025. We expect strong free cash flow generation of approximately $2 billion, which takes into account Indore remediation and foreign exchange totaling approximately $300 million. Net of taxes and transaction costs associated with the divestiture, we estimate that we'll have approximately $1.7 billion available for deployment [indiscernible].\nConsistent with our stated strategy, we continue to prioritize capital return in 2025 with a focus on share repurchases. As such, we expect to repurchase between $500 million and $650 million throughout the year, preserving flexibility to the upside. With the approved annual dividend policy of $0.48 per share, we expect to return over $1 billion of capital to shareholders, nearly 70% of our available capital.\nNow a few comments regarding phasing of our guidance. Total revenue is expected to be higher in the second half, driven by the back-weighted launch of new products and normal product seasonality. We expect operating expenses to be evenly phased between the first half and second half. Taking into account phasing of revenue and margin, we expect adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS to also be more heavily weighted towards the second half.\nAnd as we think about the sequential quarterly roll forward, we expect the first quarter levels to step down from the fourth quarter, attributed to lower net sales from Indore related products and volume and seasonal impacts in Europe and [indiscernible].\nFinally, we will continue to be disciplined with our financial policy and remain in a very strong position given the breadth and diversity of our global portfolio, strong base business fundamentals, expected significant free cash flow generation and efficient low coupon fixed rate capital structure. Looking ahead, we have laid out a clear and transparent plan for this year and I have confidence that our strong foundation will position us for long-term success. We look forward to updating you each quarter on our progress and being available for your questions. And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator to begin the Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] Please also note, today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Bill Szablewski, Head of Investor Relations and Capital Markets. Please, go ahead.\n\nBill Szablewski\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to our Q2 2024 earnings call. With us today is our CEO, Scott Smith; CFO, Doretta Mistras; Chief R&D Officer, Philippe Martin; and Chief Commercial Officer, Corinne Le Goff.\nDuring today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements on a number of matters, including our financial guidance for 2024 and various strategic initiatives. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties.\nWe will also be referring to certain actual and projected non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to today's slide presentation in our SEC filings for more information, including reconciliation of those non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nWhen discussing 2024 results, we make concerned comparisons to 2023 results on a divestiture-adjusted operational basis, which excludes the impact of armed currency rates and also excludes the proportion of results from the divestitures that closed in 2024 and 2023 from the 2023 period. When discussing our expectations for 2024. We'll  be making certain comparisons to 2024 results when a divestiture adjusted operational basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency rates, and also excludes from guidance the results from the date of closing until the end of the period of the divestitures that closed in 2024.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to our CEO, Scott Smith.\n\nScott Andrew Smith\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Celgene Corp.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to our Second Quarter Earnings Call. I'm pleased to announce we have reported another strong quarter, our fifth consecutive quarter of operational revenue growth. We had a great start to 2024, and with the completion of our divestitures in July, we are now in an important inflection point for our company. Four years ago, Viatris embarked on a journey to build a new kind of healthcare company. By combining Mylan, a strong global generics company, and Upjohn, a division of Pfizer, with 20 of the most iconic off-patent brands, our goal was to build a unique global pharmaceutical company with the scale to bring patients access to high-quality medicines worldwide.\nThe team has done an outstanding job of executing the plan that was laid out when the two companies were brought together. Among the many accomplishments we have integrated two global companies, simplified and streamlined the business by completing our divestitures, returned the base business to growth, strengthened our balance sheet through significant debt pay-down, returned capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And importantly, we've already started to build our portfolio of innovative assets.\nAs we move forward in the second half of the year and beyond, we want to accelerate growth and shareholder return by building on the strength of our base business with an expanding portfolio of innovative, best-in-class, patent-protected assets that have the potential for meaningful revenue growth and patient impact. I believe we have all the components necessary to successfully execute our vision, including an extensive global footprint that reaches 1 billion patients annually, a globally integrated company with deep capability for manufacturing, medical and regulatory affairs, and commercialization, a robust development engine across a number of therapeutic areas, sector leading cashflow generation from our base business to fund our vision and continue returning capital to shareholders.\nSecond, our financial strength and significant cash flow. Our strong balance sheet and sector-leading cash flow generation differentiate us from our peers. We continue to deliver on our financial commitments, including debt reduction and returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. With divestitures proceeds now in hand, we have a clear line of sight to meet our long-term leverage target. And third, our expanding innovative portfolio. This area represents an increasing focus on efforts to identify that and secure best-in-class patented assets. We are looking for assets that target significant unmet medical need in areas in which the company can be successful. By expanding our innovative portfolio, we have the potential to drive accelerated and durable revenue growth.\nAs you know, we've already made disciplined investments in innovative assets and cardiovascular disease and immunology with SELATOGREL and CENERIMOD. We are making significant progress in accelerating the development of these assets. The additional leadership and scientific expertise we have brought in, along with the impressive core of competencies in key areas such as global manufacturing, medical affairs, regulatory, legal, and commercialization will all drive the success of this innovative portfolio.\nWe're already making progress on these three pillars, as evidenced by our strong results this quarter. I am pleased to report that in the second quarter, we delivered total revenues of $3.8 billion and operational revenue growth of approximately 2%. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.2 billion and growing approximately 2% from a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $0.69 per share. Second quarter free cash flow was $426 million, excluding the impact of transaction costs and taxes.\nIt is important to note that we delivered new product revenue of $210 million in the quarter. With a strong second quarter results, we see momentum heading into the second half. As a result, we continue to expect 2024 year-over-year operational revenue growth of 2% and are raising our expected 2024 new product revenue range to $500 to $600 million.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Corinne to share some of our observations from her first few months at Viatris. Corinne?\n\nCorinne Le Goff\n\nCEO, President & Director, Celsion Corporation\n\nThank you Scott. I have been with the company for about four months now. And based on what I've seen, I'm very excited about the opportunity ahead of us. I would like to share a few observations, as I've gotten to know the global commercial organization. Our strong performance is a result of many puts and takes that only the diversity and the strength of our portfolio across geographies can allow.\nOur global commercial footprint is extensive. We have a presence in 165 countries and territories, which is an incredible platform to leverage as we continue to grow our base business and expand our innovative portfolio. We have a broad knowledge across many therapeutic areas, and many of our branded and generic products are today's standards of care all over the world. This is a real differentiator as it demonstrates our unique ability to continue to drive volume and expand patient access at scale.\nAs we prepare for additional innovative opportunities, we have a lot to build from. For example, if I think about SELATOGREL, we are already leaders at rescue and emergency medicines in COPD, in asthma, and anaphylaxis. We have years of experience in educating patients to identify and attack and act in the moment. Plus, we have deep expertise in cardiovascular with a portfolio that treats a very large patient population for CV risk factors to see the events like thrombosis, MI, and stroke.\nFinally, I love what I'm seeing in our teams. I am impressed with the agility and efficiency of the commercial organization. And I also see incredible energy, entrepreneurial spirit, and proactivity to seize opportunities and make a difference in patients' lives. I am excited to continue to work with the entire team at Viatris on the tremendous opportunities ahead.\n\nScott Andrew Smith\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Celgene Corp.\n\nThank you, Corinne. Your wealth of experience and global perspective have been invaluable as we continue to build the truly unique company we have envisioned. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Philippe to talk about our approach to R&D, both our base business and our innovative portfolios. Philippe?\n\nPhilippe Martin\n\nThanks, Scott. I share the team's excitement about where we are today and where we are headed. I've had the opportunity to fully evaluate our R&D organization and further define our approach to innovation and growth. Our R&D, Strategies, driven by our deep in-house development capability and two engines to fuel our growth, our base business pipeline, and our innovative pipe. A base business pipeline provides Viatris with a diverse and resilient growth engine.\nWe anticipate a steady flow of core generics and an ever-increasing flow of complex generics in novel 505b2-like products. The strong pipeline gives us confidence in achieving our new product revenue goals. Our focus for our innovative pipeline is on expanding our patent-protected portfolio of assets that have the potential for meaningful patient impact and the ability to address significant unmet medical needs. I'm very impressed with the core competencies and talent we have at Viatris.\nIn particular, our strong preclinical, clinical development, and medical affairs teams across multiple therapeutic areas, our experienced manufacturing and device teams over a wide range of dosage forms, and our proven regulatory, pharmacovigilance, legal, and IP skill. This foundation is especially critical as we expand our innovative portfolio. We are identifying assets where we can leverage our expertise and global network and assessing each opportunity based on specific criteria. We are looking for de-risk-innovative assets that address significant medical need. This includes having a validated mechanism of action, a strong clinical proof-of concept and a clear path to regulatory approval.\nSELATOGREL and CENERIMOD are two great examples. SELATOGREL has the potential to relieve the high disease burden of acute MI and specifically address the dire need for early intervention at the onset of symptoms. P2Y12 inhibition is a well-established target in the treatment of MI with multiple products approved for chronic treatment. Our differentiated pharmacokinetic profile and unique mode of administration, together with our robust Phase II data gives us high confidence in SELATOGREL as a self-administrated emergency treatment for recurrent MI.\nOur comprehensive, but simple, Phase III Study, SOS-AMI, has a special protocol assessment in place with the FDA, and received fast track designation. CENERIMOD mode also has the potential to address a significant unmet medical needs. SLE is a chronic and progressive autoimmune disease with limited treatment options and significant morbidity. CENERIMOD, a novel S1P antagonist, has a unique mechanism of action, targeting multiple aspects of lupus pathogenesis.\nA robust proof-of-concept was achieved in Phase II, with data showing a highly differentiated safety and efficacy profile in a moderate to severe SLE patient population, similar to the patient population we expect to enroll in Phase III. CENERIMOD has also been granted fast-track designation by the FDA, and we have three comprehensive Phase III studies currently enrolling patients. With SELATOGREL and CENERIMOD now part of Viatris, we're able to leverage our global R&D network to accelerate clinical trial recruitment.\nWe've already significantly increased the number of sites we are targeting for both programs, adding approximately 250 clinical sites. We've also significantly expanded the geographic footprint, adding key countries like China, India, and Japan to ensure a steady flow of patients.\nThe team has been working hard to initiate these higher recruiting sites, and we anticipate that most sites should be able to recruit patients by the end of this year or early next year, which could shorten development time lines. The Medical Affairs team is also working hard to deepen relationships with KOLs and increase CENERIMOD's and SELATOGREL's presence at key medical meetings around the world, like ESC,, HACR and APLAR. And we are pleased to announce that the CENERIMOD manuscript for the Phase II Care Study has been officially accepted for publication in the Lancet Rheumatology.\nAnother exciting, innovative opportunity is with the eye care pipe. And is the Enriched Tear Film Gene Therapy Technology, which we acquired as part of the Oyster Point acquisition, which has the potential to treat a multitude of astounding diseases. Importantly, this technology is not genome editing, but rather it leverages normal cellular processes and proteins to deliver therapeutics to the Tear Film.\nOur most advanced project called MR-146 intended for the treatment of neurotrophic keratopathy or NK, is reaching the IND stage with a validated therapeutic target for this disease. There is a significant unmet medical need for patients with NK to have a treatment that restores corneal structure and neurological function with minimal treatment burden. These examples from our expanding innovators portfolio combined with our robust based-business pipeline energize me about the future and our ability to not only deliver on our vision but also to address significant medical needs. I will now turn the call to Doretta.\n\nTheodora Mistras\n\nThank you, Philippe, and good morning, everyone. To echo the comments from the team we reported a strong quarter. And I want to spend some time walking through the highlights. But before I dive into the details, I want to take a moment to expend on our financial strength and how we think about it in the context of our overall strategy.\nFirst, we have built an extensive global footprint that already enables us to reach over 1 billion patients annually. We've successfully stabilized the base business and expect it to be a source of growth. And today, we have a broad and diversified portfolio across markets and therapeutic areas.\nSecond, we have a strong balance sheet. We are committed to continuing to pay down debt and maintaining our investment grade rating and have a clear line of sight to reach our long-term growth leverage target this year. And finally, our ability to generate significant cash flow is sector-leading. This gives us the financial agility to fund our vision and continue returning capital to shareholders.\nAnd we have added new skills, new capabilities, and new areas of expertise to our already strong and talented executive leadership team. Doretta Mistras, our Chief Financial Officer, Philippe Martin, our Chief R&D Officer, and Corinne Le Goff, our Chief Commercial Officer, joined the team within the last year and are on today's call. All their great work over the last several years has put the company in a position to deliver on our future vision.\nNow on to the results for the quarter. Our second quarter results demonstrate the power of what our portfolio can deliver. Operational revenue grew for the fifth consecutive quarter, up approximately 2%. This performance also carried through to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS, growing approximately 2% and 3% respectively. We also generated significant free cash flow of $426 million in the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. This excluded transaction costs and taxes from the divestiture.\nLet's move on to discuss the performance of our base business, which grew, operationally, on a year-over-year net sales basis. Boat Generics, and Brands grew this quarter, up approximately 2%. The growth of our base business included new product revenue that was exceptionally strong, with $210 million in the quarter. The year-to-date performance and outlook give us confidence to increase our expectation for the year to a range of $500 to $600 million. This quarter, all of our segments grew operationally, versus the prior year.\nIn developed markets, net sales grew 1% and were driven by strong new product performance, including contributions from BREYNA, LISDEXAMFETAMINE, and other generics in North America and Europe. In Europe, we are seeing durable growth across our diversified business. This is as a result of portfolio breadth across brands and generics, well-developed market positions, and strong performance in key countries such as France. In North America, we saw continued growth in generics, which was up over 3% versus the prior year.\nThe portfolio is benefiting from complex products such as WIXELA and BREYNA. And within our brand's business, net sales continued to be impacted by increased Medicaid utilization and certain non-promoted brands, as well as lower EPIPEN volumes resulting from formulary changes in the previous quarter.\nIn Greater China, net sales growth was approximately 5% over the prior year. This was as a result of strong demand across multiple channels in China, including e-commerce, retail, and private hospitals. In emerging markets, net sales grew 7%, driven by the expansion of our cardiovascular portfolio and certain Latin-American countries, as well as strength in our MENA and the Eurasia region. These benefits help to absorb the ongoing impact of the therapy shifts in the ARV market.\nAnd lastly, JANZ grew approximately 1% over the prior year, benefiting from new products in Australia and volume growth of our promoted brands in Japan. This served to offset the impact of government price regulations in these countries.\nTurning to the PNL and free cash flow, this quarter serves as another demonstration of our financial strength and ability to generate significant free cash flow. Our segment and product mix led to a stable adjusted growth margin. The performance was in line with our expectations of approximately 58%. With respect to operating expenses, we are continuing to invest behind the business to fund our growth, which includes investments across segments, eye care, and in R&D. Free cash flow for the quarter was primarily impacted by lower adjusted EBITDA due to the closing of divestitures.\nOur free cash flow and existing cash on hand allowed us to strengthen our balance sheet with a debt paydown of approximately $800 million in the quarter. And as we look towards the rest of the year, we expect to have an excess of $3 billion in cash available for deployment. This takes into account divestiture proceeds received in the third quarter, expected divestiture costs, and our latest outlook for free cash flow. We expect the significant financial flexibility will allow us to pay down additional debt to reach our long-term growth leverage target of approximately three times by the end of the year. We also expect to return capital in the form of dividends and will remain opportunistic with a potential share of purchases and business development activities.\nLet's move on to items related to our financial guidance and key metrics for the remainder of the year. We expect our strong momentum to continue, and as a result, we expect operational revenue growth of approximately 2% versus 2023 and stable adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Our expectation for the year is to be at the midpoint of the estimated guidance ranges. The assumptions driving total revenue growth include continued growth in developed and emerging markets and better-than-expected performance in Greater China and JANZ, and new product revenue of $500 million to $600 million as a result of the strong uptake of generic launches and additional new products.\nWe are adjusting the following metrics across the P&L. Increased and adjusted growth margin range due to better segment mix, and SG&A as a percentage of revenue is expected to be higher. This reflects the reduction in total revenues from the investors and the impact of the synergies and costs of providing transition services. We expect certain costs associated with performing the transition services to be included in operating expenses. The Transition Income is expected to be recorded in non-operating other income.\nA few comments on anticipated phasing for the third and fourth quarters. Total revenue is expected to be slightly higher in the third quarter, mainly due to normal product seasonality. And adjusted growth margin is expected to moderate in the fourth quarter, given a normal product and segment mix. Taking these factors into consideration, we expect adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS, and free cash flow to be higher in the third quarter. To summarize, the results for the quarter demonstrate our solid fundamentals, including our diversified and growing based business and our consistent, significant free cash flow generation. We are well-positioned for a strong second half of the year, and expect to deliver on our capital allocation framework in support of the vision Scott laid out at the top of this call. And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator to begin the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator Instructions]  And our first question today comes from Ash Verma from UBS, please, go ahead with your question.\n\nAsh Verma\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking our questions. Congratulations on all the progress. So, I wanted to talk about 2025 dynamics a little bit. So I think the $2.3 billion free cash flow guide that you provided previously, what does that translate into EBITDA? Like, if you look at the run rate that you've had, sort of in the difference between EBITDA and free cash flow, it will roughly translate to $4.5 billion, to $4.6 billion. Is that something that you would be comfortable with?\nAnd then secondly, on new product revenues, so yeah, that's good to see you raising the guide there. Just what's driving that? Is that primarily the benefit that you saw from BREYNA? Or are there more products that you think that you're benefiting from? Thanks.\n\nScott Andrew Smith\n\nThank you, Ash. And good morning. Thank you very much for the question. Sort of two parts here, right, talking about new product revenue, which is very important as we move forward here. And we're very strong, as we saw in the second quarter, and we're expecting full year very strong new product revenue. And then also some 25' dynamics. I'll turn it over to Doretta to take those two for you. I will now turn the call to Doretta.\n\nTheodora Mistras\n\nGreat, thanks. Thanks, Ash. So yes, on new products, to your point, we feel great about the momentum we've seen from the new product perspective this year. This quarter, we did 210 million, and then when you add that to the 154 million that we did in the first quarter, already year to date, we're at 354 million. And so, that in addition to the momentum that we're seeing broadly across our new product portfolio, and it really isn't dependent on one product, one region, we've seen growth.\nTo your point in BREYNA and LISDEXAMFETAMINE. We've also seen growth in other generics in North America, but we've also seen new products in Europe and some additions in emerging markets in JANZ. So, as we look for the full year, the strong performance and the continuation of that really are going to be largely driven by products that we've already launched here to date. And that's what gives us confidence in the $500 million to $600 million for the year. With respect to '25 dynamics, it's still early. We feel good about the momentum that we're seeing thus far in 2024. We see kind of the stability of our revenue growth. We are going to continue to invest in our business from our kind of R&D and investment perspective to fuel our growth, but the kind of dynamics in terms of what we've seen from our free cash flow, we kind of continue to see the $2.3 billion that you mentioned in terms of free cash flow generation. And we're going to continue to kind of focus on our EBITDA conversion going forward, but with respect to '25, I think it's still too early to get into the dynamics specific to '25.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Chris Schott from JP Morgan. Please, go ahead with your question.\n\nEkaterina Knyazkova\n\nHey, thank you so much. This is Ekaterina on for Chris, and thank you for taking our questions. I'll start with a bigger picture one, if I may. So just given that you're now done with the divestiture process, can you maybe talk about how you think about the longer-term profile of the company, both from a margin standpoint and a top-line standpoint, and I guess where you see the most opportunity for the business from here?\nAnd then, second question, just on business development. I think you've touched upon this in your prepared remarks, but just what's your latest thinking in terms of business development and balancing development stage and commercial stage deals? And just what do you think makes the most sense for the company, and maybe where you're seeing more interesting opportunities? Thank you.\n\nScott Andrew Smith\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Celgene Corp.\n\nYeah, thank you very much, Ekaterina, for the question. Again, I'll maybe address the second one first. From a BD perspective, we're engaged in a lot of different discussions, and we're going to take a disciplined approach. As we got through the divestitures, sort of the net effect of that is that we're going to get to, we've got line of sight and paid down our debt going into '25. And executing on our capital allocation plan 100%, where we're giving back to shareholders at least $2.3 billion in free cash flow through dividends and share buybacks, but also taking a disciplined approach to business development.\nWe've got a diversified company in terms of the number of therapeutic areas that we're in, we're looking at a number of different assets, we're looking at things that can help us supercharge our growth as we get into '25 and beyond. It's very important to understand that the base business is solid. The base business we're showing operational growth. And on top of that, we want to add what I would consider significantly de-risked assets from an innovative perspective, assets that can help us drive growth in the future, that are focused on unmet medical needs, and have long runways that we can invest in. But we're also going to shore up our base business as well.\nWe're going to look for things currently marketed in different, particularly in particular geographies that we can be effective in. And so, we're going to do business development to shore up the base. And we're also going to do business development to bring in new innovative assets into the company.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from David Amsellem from Piper Sandler. Please, go ahead with your question.\n\nDavid A. Amsellem\n\nAnalyst, Piper Jaffray & Co.\n\nHey, thanks. So just a couple for me, and I apologize if you addressed this since I joined late. Can you talk about overall innovative brand strategy? I mean, you did an important in licensing earlier this year. I guess my question here is how aggressive do you want to be regarding adding innovative brands in the U.S. and developed markets, broadly speaking? So that's number one. Number two, can you just talk generally about complex generics and how we should think about contribution from complex products or new launches as we move through '25? It might be a little bit early to think about that, but I wanted to get a sense of what key launches on the complex front that you're flagging or should flag. Thanks.\n\nScott Andrew Smith\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Celgene Corp.\n\nThanks, David. I think you used the language, how aggressive we want to be from a BD perspective. I think what we want to be is we want to be disciplined. There are--we're engaged with a lot of companies; there's a lot of inbound that we've got, both for things to help build the base business and in new, innovative assets that we can take forward. And so, we're carefully looking at them all.\nWe're really looking forward to getting into '25, where we've got more capital to apply from a business development perspective. We want to build a pipeline of assets. You mentioned that we already did a deal in-license, SELATOGREL and CENERIMOD, two products, which can be very, very important to us. And we fully expect, either later in '24, as we get into '25, '26, to continue to add assets to the pipeline, both again, to shore up and accelerate the growth that we're seeing in the base business. And secondly, to add to the innovative portfolio. We plan on doing both. And I would say we want to do it in a smart and disciplined way. Philippe?\n\nPhilippe Martin\n\nYes, regarding complex generics, I think we, as you can see on this presentation that we provided, we have over 250 products in the pipeline that are either under development or under regulatory review. So, we think we'll be--we know we'll have a steady flow of complex generics coming in every year, this year and 2025 and so on. So, we feel confident about our complex generic pipeline.\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Please, go ahead with your question.\n\nUmer Raffat\n\nAnalyst, Evercore Group LLC\n\nHi guys, thanks for taking my question. I have a two-part question on just broad investments. First, perhaps on GLP-1. Scott, I'm curious, what are your GLP-1 aspirations? What's the capacity now? And what type of CAPEX investments are you or are you not looking to make? Just thinking about that out loud.\nAnd also, part two was the investment in CENERIMOD and Lupus. I'm curious how you guys are thinking about that in light of some really groundbreaking data we're seeing with CD19 CAR-Ts and, presumably, with bi-specifics as well. And how do you put that in perspective relative to what we know about CENERIMOD? That would be very helpful. And then finally, I think the prior question was on what your complex generics in '25 are? I don't think--maybe I misheard. What are the complex generics in '25 launches?\n\nScott Andrew Smith\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Celgene Corp.\n\nSo, thanks for the rough question, and we're sort of three parts there, right, to a complex generic CENERIMOD and how that fits into the therapeutic landscape. As we move forward here in advances have been made in Lupus, but I think highly differentiated relative to the CAR-T constructs and bi-specifics and other things. And then just a little bit on the overall GLP1 strategy. So, I'll kick it over to Philippe from a pipeline and R&D perspective to address those questions. Philippe?\n\nPhilippe Martin\n\nYes, from a GLP-1 point of view, we're looking at developing multiple GLP-1s, SEMAGLUTIDE as well as LIRAGLUTIDE, as well as MOUNJARO. So, we're deep into the development of these assets from a supply chain standpoint, as you know. The supply chain can be a little tight, but we've secured a supply of API for all these assets and certainly have invested in our capability to manufacture these drugs going forward. So, we anticipate we'll have a significant role going forward in the GLP-1 market.\nRegarding CENERIMOD, I think if you were to compare CENERIMOD benefit-risk profile versus the one we anticipate from the CAR-T or the bi-specific, you'd see that we anticipate it to be in the higher end of efficacy with a safety profile that is clearly differentiated. CAR-Ts and bi-specifics typically have significant safety baggage. And so, we anticipate our benefit-risk profile will be very different, which will allow us to be placed prior to the use of either a bi-specific, biologics, or CAR-Ts going forward. And I'm not even talking about the convenience factor of having an oral drug versus these CAR-Ts, that can be quite difficult to administer.\nAnd then on the last one, on the complex generic, I think I wouldn't highlight one specific product. I think it's the breadth of the pipeline that we have that we see will be delivered this year, for the rest of the year, '25, '26. So, we feel very confident in our new product revenue, as you can see, and we anticipate the same going forward.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Balaji Prasad from Barclays. Please, go ahead with your question.\n\nBalaji V. Prasad\n\nResearch Analyst, Goldman Sachs (India) Securities Pvt Ltd.\n\nThank you. Hi, good morning, and congratulations on the quarter. I have a couple of questions from me. Could you comment on the magnitude of the expected base business erosion from government price regulations in Japan and Australia? I presume in Japan it's the annual price cuts, or are there any other dynamics at play? Second, could you comment around the split between the innovative pipeline and the non-inventive pipeline currently? And with improvement cash metrics, how do you see the spend on innovative R&D progressing into the next couple of years? Or do you intend to keep it at a similar percentage? Thanks.\n\nScott Andrew Smith\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Celgene Corp.\n\nThank you very much, Balaji. I'll take the first question over to Doretta to talk about the dynamics that we're seeing in Australia, Japan, etc.\n\nTheodora Mistras\n\nTo your point, Balaji, we aren't seeing anything, it really is driven by the ongoing price, normal government price declines that we're seeing in Japan and Australia. Now the offset to that is we actually have seen better volume in Japan as well, and given that Japan and the broader JANZ region is actually performing better than our expectations for the year.\nAnd relative to your question on R&D spend and where we're going from an R&D perspective, maybe I'll make a general comment and Philippe you can comment as well here. But we're going to continue to invest in both the base business, the base genetics, complex generics and others, and in the innovative pipeline, we've already talked about here a couple of new innovative assets through our business development activities, through the global healthcare gateway and others, we're going to continue to bring in assets, continue to develop them. So, you might see some movement of distribution of that spend as we bring in more innovative assets. But we're going to continue to invest in all components of the base business and the new innovative assets as we move forward.\n\nBalaji V. Prasad\n\nResearch Analyst, Goldman Sachs (India) Securities Pvt Ltd.\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Jason Gerberry from Bank of America. Please, go ahead with your question.\n\nBhavna Patel\n\nHey guys, this is Bhavna Patel on for Jason Gerberry. My first question is, can you approximate the full year 2024 EBITDA contribution from divestitures that provided partial first half 2024 contribution? Just so that we can understand the RemainCo business profile and model appropriately headed into 2025 and onwards. And then my second question is, given all the changes in the portfolio, relative to reported financial results in 2022 and 2023, do you see low 30% EBITDA margins, similar to certain peers like Organon, as a good long-run assumption, pending any breakthroughs on the pipeline side of course. And with regard to your pipeline, is there a timeline update based on new enrollment strategies for the Phase III SELATOGREL SOS-AMI trial? Thank you.\n\nScott Andrew Smith\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Celgene Corp.\n\nSo I'll thank you very much for the question. I'll ask Doretta to address the first part of your question, and then I'll talk about the SELATOGREL and CENERIMOD later.\n\nTheodora Mistras\n\nGreat, thank you. And on the divestitures, I think as we've laid it out when we started the year, the way we've approached it is, as we close the divestitures, we've adjusted and taken out the kind of impact from our--and provided the impact from our actuals, and then also adjusted our guidance going forward to reflect those divestitures. And we'll continue to do that, kind of, now that the divestitures are behind us, as we get through the back half of the year, and we look into '25. We will be providing that additional kind of detail as we move into the rest of the year. But as we had in our earnings presentation and our press release, we do lay out the components of both the divestitures that have closed, as well as the impact to our guidance and our results. With respect to margins, I mean, I think as we think about the business, we have confidence in both our base business growth as well as the stability of our EBITDA margins as we continue to invest in growth.\nBut as Scott laid out, as we continue to invest in the business, and bring in more patent-protected, innovative assets, we have the opportunity to continue to expand the business. But I think we feel good about the stability of our EBITDA.\n\nScott Andrew Smith\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Celgene Corp.\n\nAnd then, relative to pipeline acceleration on innovative assets, I'll say that we're very, very excited about both SELATOGREL and CENERIMOD. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're already making significant progress in doing the things we need to do to accelerate the development of these assets and move the timelines forward.\nI don't have a specific update for you on that date. We want to get in and do some remediation further, continue to open new sites, continue to invest in the development, and then by the time we get into the new year, we'll be able to be in a better position to give you sort of specifics on where we think those timelines are going. But we think we're going to be significantly be able to help and accelerate the development timelines. And again, we'll look to update those timelines as we get into '25.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd Ladies and Gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's question and answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Scott Smith, CEO, for closing. \n\nScott Andrew Smith\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Celgene Corp.\n\nThank you, everybody. And thank you to the operator. In closing, it's been a great year for us so far with the completion of our divestitures in July. We're the turning point for the company. We have built a strong foundation, we have a bold vision for our future, and we have the key ingredients we need to be successful to deliver on our goals. Thank you all very much for your attention.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's conference call and presentation. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines."

All participants will be in listen only mode. Should you need assistance, please signal your conference specialist by pressing the Star key followed by 0. After todays presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. To ask a question you may press Star then 1 on your touchtone phone. To withdraw your question, please press Star then 2. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Bill Szablewski, Head of Capital Markets. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nBill Szablewski\n\nGood morning, everyone welcome to our Q1 2024 earnings call. With us today is our CEO Scott Smith, CFO Doretta Mistras and Chief R&D Officer Philippe Martin. During today's call, we will be making forward looking statements on a number of matters, including our financial guidance for 2024 and various strategic initiatives. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. We will also be referring to certain actual and projected non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to today's slide presentation, and our SEC filings for more information, including reconciliations of those non-GAAP measures, the most directly comparable GAAP measures. When discussing 2024 actual results, we're making certain comparisons to 2023 results on a divestiture adjusted operational basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency rates and also excludes the proportionate results from the divestitures that closed in '24 and '23 from the 2023 period.\nWhen discussing our expectations for 2024, we will be making certain comparisons to 2024 results on a divestiture adjusted operational basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency rates and also excludes from guidance the forecast the results from the date of closing until the end of the period with the divestitures that closed in 2024. With that, I'll hand the call over to our CEO, Scott Smith.\n\nScott Andrew Smith\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Celgene Corp.\n\nGood morning. Our first quarter financial results demonstrate continued execution against our business fundamentals, which include maintaining base business stability while driving new product revenue and executing on our vision for future growth. We are making progress on all our key priorities, including completing planned divestitures, continuing to pay down debt, increasing shareholder return, fueling our base business, and importantly, making strategic investments in future growth. Since last quarter's call, we closed our transaction with Idorsia and held a successful R&D event in which we reviewed key elements of our base business pipeline and did a deep dive into our newest assets, SELATOGREL and CENERIMOD. Our focus for the event was outlining how we are continuing to evolve our R&D strategy and deliver on our goal of assembling a more durable, high margin portfolio of patented innovation on the foundation of our strong base business.\nWe were joined by two key opinion leaders, Dr. Deepak Bhatt, Director of Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital and are widely recognized cardiology expert, and Dr. Anca Askanase, Founder and Clinical Director of Columbia University's Lupus Center. Dr. Bhatt and Dr. Asskanase discussed challenges in treating acute MRI and lupus highlighting the need for highly innovative novel products that have the potential for meaningful patient impact that address significant unmet need in these two areas. We also reviewed the study designs for the Phase III SOS-AMI study for SELATOGREL, and the Phase III Opus studies for CENERIMOD. I am pleased to say that since we closed the transaction, we are already leveraging our own existing infrastructure and experience to expand and accelerate the development plans for both assets. Turning to the first quarter, we delivered total revenue of approximately $3.7 billion, adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.2 billion, adjusted EPS of $0.67 per share and free cash flow of approximately $565 million.\nWe have now closed our women's health care business divestiture. We expect to close our API divesture imminently. We are on track to close the OTC divesture by mid-year subject to receipt of certain regulatory approvals and consents. Today we are reaffirming our 2024 financial guidance after adjusting the range is solely to reflect the impact of divestitures and acquired IP R&D. We are also reaffirming our 2024, new product revenue range of $450 million to $550 million. From a capital allocation perspective, we continue to focus on delivering strong total shareholder return. In the first quarter, we returned $393 million to shareholders in dividends and share buybacks and our Board of Directors has declared another quarterly dividend of $0.12 a share for this quarter. We also continued to pay down our debt and we are continuing our efforts to identify that and secure additional best in class patented assets that have the potential to contribute to our future revenue growth. Before we move on, I want to talk about the executive leadership team we've put in place since our last call to deliver on our strategy. Executing on our base business, while also pursuing opportunities for innovation and growth will be key to our future success.\nWith these two priorities in mind, we have built a leadership team there is a balance between the talented group of leaders we already have within via tourists with some new faces, who add new scale, new capabilities and new areas of expertise. The most recent addition to the team is Corinne Le Goff, who joined us as Chief Commercial Officer. In addition to bringing a wealth of experience from serving in executive leadership roles at companies across the biotech and pharmaceutical industries, Corinne's also lived, worked and studied around the world, bringing a global perspective that is important to a company like Viatris that reaches patients to more than 165 countries. I am very pleased to have Corinne onboard, I look forward to working with her and all of the members of the executive leadership team as we continue to build a truly unique company that we have in vision. Now, let me turn it over to Philippe Martin to discuss progress on our pipeline. Philippe\n\nPhilippe Martin\n\nThank you, Scott. I'd also like to welcome Corinne to Viatris and I look forward to working with her. Since our last earning calls, we held the R&D event to discuss key elements of our pipeline, as well as details about the collaboration with Idorsia, including the two potential blockbuster assets, the SELATOGREL and CENERIMOD. As we said, we have built a strong foundation, our base business pipeline and portfolio is expected to keep delivering inconsistent results currently reaching more than 1 billion patients a year. Our new partnership with Idorsia has the potential to broaden that reach. We are very excited about SELATOGREL and CENERIMOD, they are highly innovative products that have the potential to deliver meaningful patient impact and significantly advance treatment in areas of high unmet medical need. The deal closed on March 15th, and since then, we have brought on board approximately 80 Idorsia employees, ensuring no interruption in program continuity. They are a team of talented drug developers, who are fully dedicated to driving forward the development programs for both assets.\nWith SELATOGREL and CENERIMOD we are focused on expanding and accelerating enrollment of the Phase III study SOS-AMI study and Phase III Opus studies, respectively. We are adding approximately 250 sites to each program and we are expanding into additional regions leveraging the strengths of Viatris' global reach. We have initiated the development of lifecycle strategies for both assets looking to maximize these opportunities by developing additional indications or expanding into broader patient populations, as well as optimizing labeling and launch sequencing globally. Finally, we will have an oral presentation at [inaudible] in June focused on CENERIMOD's effect on bio marker of inflammation in Italy. Looking at our eye-care pipeline, we launched RYZUMVI in the U.S. for the reversal of pharmacologically-induced mydriasis on April 1st.\nWe are actively enrolling Phase III studies of MR-139 for the treatment of Blepharitis and MR-142 for the treatment of dim light or night vision disturbances. Our MR-146, a gene therapy for neurotrophic keratopathy, we are targeting a [inaudible] in the second half of this year. Looking at our base business pipeline, we have more than 25 products in our novel portfolio. Of those, I would like to highlight three particular projects. Our GA DEPOT as you know, our partner Mapi received the CRM back in March, we are working with Mapi to respond to comments. We see some [inaudible] and intend to seek a meeting with FDA in the next few months. We will determine the next steps after that meeting. Phase III studies for MELOXICAM, fast acting, a potential opioid sparing treatment in post surgery pain are well underway.\nThe Phase III study for XULANE LOW DOSE for use in contraception has completed enrollment. With our complex injectable pipeline alone, we have more than 50 products in total - 15 product currently under FDA review. None of these represent potential first-to-market opportunities. Finally, our core generic pipeline is progressing well with submissions continuing at a steady pace in line with expectations. In summary, we are making progress on key elements of our pipeline, we have an incredibly talented team and we have clear plans to deliver on our key R&D objectives to support Viatris' overall growth. Now, I will turn the call over to Doretta to walk through the quarterly results.\n\nDoretta Mistras\n\nThank you, Philippe. And good morning, everyone. It's great to be here to discuss our Q1 performance. As Scott highlighted, we are off to a strong start the year with our fourth consecutive quarter of top line growth. We continue to execute against our growth plan, which includes maintaining our base business stability and driving new product revenue. Our globally diverse platform is generating growth from our base business in emerging markets in Europe and from higher than expected new product revenue. In the quarter, we made great progress on our strategic initiatives. We closed the women's health care business divestiture, completed the Idorsia transaction, and expect to close the divestiture of the API business eminently. I'll provide an update on these items as it relates to guidance in a bit. And I echo Scott's comments as it relates to Corinne. I look forward to working closely with her as we continue to drive growth and unlock value from our platform.\nTurning to first quarter performance, we delivered 2% year-over-year operational growth, which was in line with our expectation. This excludes the impact of foreign exchange, which was approximately 2%. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of topline growth, and once again, highlights the power of our well diversified global platform. The growth was driven by strength in emerging markets, Europe, and JANZ, and by better than expected new product revenue of 154 million in the quarter. Moving to our commercial segment. For developed markets, Europe delivered another strong quarter, growing approximately 2% versus the prior year. We saw growth across our broad portfolio of brands, generics in key markets, such as Italy, and France, and the positive benefits from new product launches. Our North America business declined approximately 3% year-over-year as a result of channel dynamics and customer formulary changes in our brand portfolio. This was partially offset by approximately 18% net sales growth in YUPELRI and continued uptake in TYRVAYA versus Q1 of 2023.\nGenerics performed better than expected driven by new product launches, including BREYNA, as well as strong performance in base business complex products, such as WIXELA. Emerging markets had another strong quarter, delivering approximately 9% year-over-year operational growth. This performance was driven by strong results in the MENA and Eurasia region, as well as key countries like Thailand and Malaysia. Generics grew approximately 10% due to ARV phasing benefits and strength across our broad portfolio. And brands were up approximately 8% more than expected driven by key products, such as LIPITOR, ELIDEL and XALABRANDS. grew approximately 2% over the prior year, driven by expansion of business activities in Australia. This helped to more than offset the expected declines due to government price regulation in Japan and Australia. And lastly, in greater China, our results were flat versus Q1 2023. We continue to focus on the retail segment and on growing the self pay patient base, while navigating the evolving policy environment.\nNow I'll walk you through the remainder of the P&L and the drivers of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Adjusted gross margin of approximately 59% in the quarter was ahead of our expectations and was driven by positive portfolio and segment mix. As anticipated, adjusted gross margin declined versus the prior year due to price regulations in Japan, and the increase in Cogs. As expected, first quarter operating expenses increased due to SG&A investments in the eye care franchise, new product launches and progress in key R&D programs. Free cash flow for the quarter met expectations, and versus prior year, was driven by lower adjusted EBITDA, the closing of divestitures, and the timing of working capital. Excluding transaction costs and taxes from the divestitures, free cash flow would've been 648 million.\nIt is important to note that related taxes and transaction costs associated with the divestitures will continue to impact cash flow from operating activities. The proceeds received from the divestitures will benefit cash flow from investing activities. Moving to the balance sheet and capital allocation. We ended the quarter with approximately 1 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand. Continue to execute on our balanced capital allocation framework, and returned $393 million of capital to shareholders in Q1 in the form of both dividends and share repurchases. Now I'll walk you through the details of our financial guidance for the rest of the year. We are reaffirming our 2024 financial guidance after adjusting the range is solely due to divestitures and acquired IP R&D. These adjustments represent approximately $270 million in revenue, $86 million and adjusted EBITDA, and $0.04 in adjusted EPS for the remainder of 2024.\nThe underlying fundamentals for 2024 total revenue guidance include no change to the base business growth of approximately 2% operationally versus 2023, and continued confidence in meeting our new product revenue range of $450 million to $550 million due to the strong uptake of BREYNA and the breadth of our new product launches. Lastly, if April foreign exchange rates hold for the rest of the year, there could be a headwind of approximately 2% on full year revenue. Now a few comments about anticipated phasing for the rest of the year. Total revenue is expected to be modestly higher in the second half mainly due to normal product seasonality. New product revenue is expected to be higher in the first half driven by BREYNA, which is treated as new product revenue through July. Adjusted gross margin is expected to be higher in the first half versus second half due to product and segment mix. We expect operating expenses to be relatively evenly phased between the first half and the second half. Taking these factors into consideration, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS are expected to be slightly higher in the second half. Free cash flow is also expected to be more weighted to the second half.\nAs a reminder, free cash flow tends to be lower in Q2 and Q4 due to timing of semi annual interest payments. Based on the strong fundamentals of our business and our progress to date against our objectives, we believe we are well positioned to meet our expectations for the remainder of this year. With that, I'll hand it back over to the operator to begin the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nYes. Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question you may press Star then 1 on your touchtone phone. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, please press Star then 2. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble the roster. And the first question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.\n\nNathan Rich\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\n\nYeah. Great, good morning. And thanks so much for the questions. Maybe a couple of product questions to start. First, I guess, Doretta, you mentioned in North America, softness in brands, could you elaborate on the channel on formulary dynamics that you saw. How much of that was different than your expectations? And is there anything you can do to improve access there? And then, with respect to GA DEPOT, and the expected meeting with the FDA in the third quarter, I think you had previously talked about kind of site inspection that needed to be done, as well as some questions on the Phase III study, I guess, as you had a little bit more time to talk to Mapi. What is the current kind of timeline for remediation that you see and when that product could potentially get approval and launch?\n\nScott Andrew Smith\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Celgene Corp.\n\nSo, Scott Smith here, thank you Nate and good morning to you. I'm going to kick it over to Doretta to answer the product specific question and Philippe will address the GA DEPOT. So, Doretta?\n\nDoretta Mistras\n\nThank you. Specifically, I would say North America, as mentioned, as you noted, we were impacted by two items. The first was a formulary change and the second with channel dynamics. That formulary change really impacted EPIPEN, that changing channel dynamics in Q1, we saw slightly higher than expected utilization in certain kind of legacy brands, and that was really due to higher utilization in those noncommercial channels. I would say, kind of over the course of the year, we do expect those impacts to be offset by growth in other brands. So, we saw 18% in YUPELRI growth, TYRVAYA growth - these are factors that we're all kind of monitoring in Q1, I would say we were - it was disproportionate impact than what we originally anticipated, but I think as we go through the course of the year, we expect these to be offset.\n\nScott Andrew Smith\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Celgene Corp.\n\nAnd then, just a couple of comments before I turn it over to Philippe. Q1 for brands in the U.S. is always a little bit choppy. Again, as Doretta said, we expect to have a good full year performance. And I would just like to say, overall the business is performing as expected, globally. It's a very large and diverse business, there's lots of puts and takes, but we are very happy with the overall global performance this quarter.\n\nPhilippe Martin\n\nThanks, Scott. With regards to Mapi and GA DEPOT, we are working with them to address comment that we received from the FDA, as I mentioned, and taking a meeting in the next few months. Once we have that meeting, we'll have clarity on - more clarity on the timeline and what to expect. So, we'll be sharing that with you once available.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And the next question comes from Jason Garberry with Bank of America.\n\nUnknown\n\nHey, guys. This is [inaudible] on for Jason. For us, I just wanna focus on this TYRVAYA. The product appears to be evaluated in a million dollar product with moderate growth, so maybe, can you just help us form the bridge to the $1 billion in ophthalmology sales that you're expecting by 2028 between Oyster and family care assets? I believe the recently launched RYZUMVI was framed as a sort of commercially niche product. So, is the key seeing an inflection in TYRVAYA and the remainder of 2024? And then, second on the free cash flow, longer term, do you continue to see a floor as being $2.3 billion, unchanged, post divestitures, which would be 2025 onwards? Thank you.\n\nScott Andrew Smith\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Celgene Corp.\n\nThank you very much for the question. TYRVAYA, you know, we're seeing positive trends, we're seeing continued uptake with TYRVAYA, performed in line with our expectations in Q1, we're very helpful on the trajectory of TYRVAYA. We just started the DTC in Q4, and we'll see where it goes. That billion dollars that you're talking about over the next 4, 5, 6 years is relative to the whole pipeline of products. Definitely, presumably, is a little bit of a niche product that's complementary to what we're doing with TYRVAYA, in terms of sales call dynamics and things, but we're continuing to be very, very hopeful relative to the ophthalmology business and we've got a number of products in the pipeline.\n\nDoretta Mistras\n\nAnd specifically to free cash flow, the short answer is, yes, with respect to your question around $2.3 billion kind of - we feel that even post the divestitures kind of as we look into 2025 and beyond, just given the diversity of our business, the portfolio and the stability of the base business, as well as some of the kind of broader objectives and cash optimization kind of initiatives we've put in place, our business should be able to generate at least $2.3 billion in free cash on an ongoing basis.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And the next question comes from Glen Santangelo with Jefferies.\n\nGlen Santangelo\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\n\nYeah, good morning and thanks. Hey, Scott, in your prepared remarks, I mean, you obviously made the comment that API is expected to sort of close imminently. And I didn't hear clearly what you said on OTC. Is that still expected to close by June 30, I think was the previous timing. Is that still fair?\n\nScott Andrew Smith\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Celgene Corp.\n\nYeah, I think what we talked about in the last time was close by mid-year. I'm not sure if it's going to be June or a little bit later than that, but we're expecting to close at midyear. It's obviously subject to certain regulatory approvals and consents, which are a little bit out of our control, but that continues to track very well. We're pleased with our progress there. We should be closing that transaction by mid-year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And the next question comes from Ash Verma with UBS.\n\nAsh Verma\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. I had two. So, just on JANZ maybe, can you elaborate the business dynamics here? It seems like the business has been facing some headwinds. I mean, currently you were up 2% on an operational basis, but not a relatively easy comp. And what sort of should be the go-forward trajectory here? And then second, on the new product revenue, good to see the $154 million, how much of that is driven by Tyrvaya? And can you get to your - this year guide for $450 million, $550 million without CapEx on once monthly? Thanks.\n\nScott Andrew Smith\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Celgene Corp.\n\nYeah, Doretta can answer the first part on JANZ and I'll take the new product question afterwards.\n\nDoretta Mistras\n\nGreat. So, I would say on JANZ, it is performing kind of in line with what we expected for the first quarter. We are seeing growth - we did see some FX headwinds relative to last year in the region. But the growth we're seeing there, that 2% operational growth was really driven by some expansion of business activities that we saw in Australia. And this is a business, kind of, that we expect on an ongoing basis there is natural price erosion just due to government price regulation, specifically in Japan and Australia. And so, that will factor in as we think about the rest of the year and we do expect this business to perform in line with our expectations. And then, specifically also just to add a little bit to what Scott said around new products, we have great confidence in our $450 million to $550 million of new product launches. One of the benefits is we're not dependent on any one single-product kind of BREYNA is performing better than what we expected, but there is a - kind of the breadth of our portfolio is what allows us to kind of have that confidence in our $450 million to $550 million.\n\nScott Andrew Smith\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Celgene Corp.\n\nAnd specific to your question, $0 of that is on TYRVAYA, that's no longer defined as a new product within our company. And again, just very pleased with $154 million in the quarter for new products and reaffirming the $450 million to $550 million despite maybe some delays in GA DEPOT.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question comes from Chris Schott with JP Morgan.\n\nChristopher Thomas Schott\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC\n\nAll right, great. Thanks so much for the questions. Just two for me. Maybe on - just some of the comments from the prepared remarks. I think on the Idorsia assets, you mentioned accelerating some site enrollment there or expanding the number of sites. Does that accelerate the timelines at all that you laid out at the analyst meeting or were those already reflected in those timelines? And then, my second question was on the capital deployment front. I know it's asked frequently, but just, Scott, can we see your latest thinking about how you're thinking about the range of opportunities you're evaluating as we think about in-market versus pipeline, in-licensing or partners versus outright acquisitions? Just, is there any baskets within there that seem particularly interesting versus others? And maybe just as part of that, just with where the stock is, how you're thinking about repo in the mix of capital deployment? Thank you.\n\nPhilippe Martin\n\nSo, I'll take the first question on Idorsia. This is Philippe. So no, it's not - the acceleration that we are currently working on by adding a significant number of sites and expanding into regions - that regions that originally were not planned by Idorsia, but where Viatris has significant experience is not included in the timeline that we presented at the R&D Day. It's too early for us to see the impact that this is going to have, but we'll keep you updated as we go forward.\n\nScott Andrew Smith\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Celgene Corp.\n\nAnd relative to capital allocation, important to note already this year, we have bought back shares, delivered on a dividend, done the Idorsia deal and brought assets and that could drive potential future growth. In terms of the things that we're looking at, I'll continue to say we look at all manner of different opportunities. Certainly, I like the licensing partnership route for a lot of it. Given the strong global company we have and the base we have worldwide that I think we're a very favorable partner for people with good technologies and products to be able to launch their products globally. So, we're looking at partnering. There's a lot of interesting opportunities out there for a company of our size and our breadth and we're sorting through it all. And I will say, as we continue through the year, although we've already done some share repurchases and some BD, we expect to have the capital to be able to continue to do some share buybacks as we get through the year and also potentially some BD if the right opportunities arise for us.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And the next question comes from David Amsellem with Piper Sandler.\n\nDavid A. Amsellem\n\nAnalyst, Piper Jaffray & Co.\n\nThanks. So, a couple questions. On injectables, any color on VENOFER and also GLUCAGON? I know you've cited those two in prior slides. And then also in general, how are you thinking about the broadening of your complex injectable footprint? I know you cited some metrics in the slides, but I guess the question here is how big of a priority is that as a percentage or as a portion of your overall generic R&D mix? And how are you thinking about new launches outside of this year in terms of how you're thinking about a number of potential complex injectable launches for '25 and '26? Thanks.\n\nScott Andrew Smith\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Celgene Corp.\n\nSo, I'll kick it over to Philippe to talk specifically about some of the products and the strategy. But just overall, the complex injectable portfolio is a very important part of our base business. We're investing in it. We see important products on the market today from it. We see important products in the future from it. So, it's a very sort of important part of our base business mix and important to continue to invest in the complex generics as we move forward and add other new products, innovative products, patented products to the portfolio to accelerate that growth.\n\nPhilippe Martin\n\nYes. And to answer your question - your first question, the two assets you mentioned are second-half launches. We're working through the regulatory approval process. We remain confident in our $450 million to $550 million new product revenue guidance for the full year. And we've - as you know, we've been very successful in bringing similar products to market in the past. So, we feel good about our new product revenue going forward. And then in terms of the mix of products regarding the injectable - complex injectable pipeline, I mean, they represent more than 50 products in total and we have about 15 that are currently under FDA review. So, in terms of product mix, they represent a significant number of approvals for us going forward. So, that remains a very important segment of our R&D portfolio that will continue to grow over time.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And the next question comes from Balaji Prasad with Barclays.\n\nBalaji V. Prasad\n\nResearch Analyst, Goldman Sachs (India) Securities Pvt Ltd.\n\nHi, good morning, everyone. A couple of macro questions and a bookkeeping question from me on firstly emerging markets, looks like this quarter has been largely driven by emerging markets. Can you comment around the sustainability of this? And maybe also understand how this translated on an FX basis through the P&L? And on the guidance and revised guidance and the divestiture impact, if I understand right, so the $270 million strip is for nine months of Women's Health and seven or eight months of the API business? Is it the right way to think about it? Thanks.\n\nScott Andrew Smith\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Celgene Corp.\n\nThank you, Balaji. I'm going to hand it over to Doretta to ask - answer the specific questions on the emerging market segments and the divestitures.\n\nDoretta Mistras\n\nYeah, so on emerging markets specifically, we were very pleased with the performance that we've seen in that region. It was really - we saw broad performance specifically both in our MENA and our Eurasia region, both across generics and across our branded portfolio such as LIPITOR, ELIDEL, XALABRANDS. So, we really saw outperformance across the board. And this was despite some FX headwinds that we saw in that region. We had multiple currencies that we saw some weakness in versus the U.S. dollar relative to last year. So, we were very pleased with our performance in emerging markets. With respect to your second question around the divestitures, so yes, so as kind of the Women's Health transaction we closed in March. Given we expect to close the API transaction imminently, the way we've thought about the remainder of '24, we've stripped out Women's Health as of its close and we've stripped out the API business as if it has closed in May given its imminent closure - expected closure.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to return the conference to Mr. Scott Smith, CEO, for any closing comments.\n\nScott Andrew Smith\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Celgene Corp.\n\nSo, thank you and thank you to everybody online for your attention this morning. In closing, we're continuing our momentum for last year. We've had a great - we've made great progress on all our key priorities and have a strong executive leadership team in place, a passionate global workforce that's dedicated to leading the company into what we believe is an exciting future ahead. Thank you again.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your phone lines."

Should you need assistance, please signal a conference specialist by pressing the star key followed by zero.\nAfter today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. To ask a question, you may press star and then one on your touchtone telephone. To withdraw your question, you may press star and then two.\nAlso note, today's event is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Bill Szablewsky, Head of Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nBill Szablewsky\n\nGood morning everyone. Welcome to our Q4 2023 earnings call. With us today is our CEO, Scott Smith, President, Rajiv Malik, CSO, Sanjeev Narula and CFO, [inaudible].\nDuring today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements on a number of matters, including our financial guidance for 2024 and various strategic initiatives. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties.\nWe'll also be referring to certain actual and projected non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to today's slide presentation and our SEC filings for more information, including reconciliations of those non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nWhen discussing 2023 actual results, we'll be making certain comparisons to 2022 results on a divestiture, adjusted operational basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency rates and also excludes the results from the divested biosimilars business and proportionate results from the divestitures that closed in 2023 from the 2022 period.\nWhen discussing our expectations for 2024, we will be making certain comparisons to 2023 results on a divestiture adjusted operational basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency rates and also excludes the results of the divestitures that closed in '23 from the 2023 period.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to our CEO, Scott Smith.\n\nScott Andrew Smith\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Celgene Corp.\n\nGood morning everyone. 2023 was an outstanding year for Viatris in which we delivered strong operational results, streamline the company and finished the year with a third consecutive quarter of operational revenue growth.\nI am pleased to say that as we begin 2024, I could not be more excited about the future ahead. We are already executing on our vision for our next chapter. We continue to generate strong free cash flows. This provides us with the flexibility to balance returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We're continuing to fuel our base business and make strategic investments in future growth.\nAs I've said in addition to continuing to develop the three core therapeutic areas that we've previously identified, ophthalmology, dermatology, and GI, we are also going to be opportunistic in seeking out assets that fit our company well and have the potential to contribute significantly to our future revenue growth.\nToday's announcement that we've entered into a global research and development collaboration with Idorsia is a great example of this approach and [inaudible]. We are bringing in two late-stage potential blockbuster assets with long dated patent protection and we are connecting Idorsia's proven, highly productive drug development team and innovation engine with our own strong existing infrastructure and experience.\nWe believe that together we will be able to execute on the potential of these global assets and any future asset as we work to deliver on our goal of building a more durable, predictable portfolio on the foundation of our strong base business.\nWe believe there's a lot of [inaudible] can become meaningful components of the Viatris' business over the long term. I'll talk more about the deal in a moment but first, 2023.\nWe finished the year strong with full year results in line operationally with our 2023 adjusted guidance. Importantly, our fourth quarter results represent our third consecutive quarter of operational revenue growth, giving us good momentum going into the year. We expect that momentum to continue into 2024 and beyond.\nIn 2023, we delivered total revenues of approximately $15.4 billion, adjusted EBITDA of approximately $5.1 billion and free cash flow of approximately $2.4 billion. We have already completed certain of our divestitures and are on track to complete all remaining divestitures by mid-year subject to final regulatory approvals.\nTurning to 2024, today we are sharing our full year guidance ranges for total revenue, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and adjusted earnings per share. Adjusted EPS will increasingly become an important metric to reflect earnings growth and balanced capital allocation for us in '24 and beyond.\nFrom a capital allocation perspective, we continued to pay down debt and expect to reach our long term gross leverage target this year. We are maintaining our dividend for 2024. We completed 250 million in share repurchases earlier this year. Our board of directors has provided us with an additional 1 billion share repurchase authorization to you use at the appropriate time, bringing our total authorization to $2 billion, of which we have used $500 million and have $1.5 billion authorization remaining. And earlier today, we announced a significant global research and development collaboration.\nDiving further into our Idorsia announcement, we are very excited about this new partnership. The agreement combines Viatris' financial strength and worldwide operational infrastructure with a portfolio of novel assets that we believe will provide the foundation for accelerated top line growth. Viatris will receive exclusive global development and commercialization rights to two assets, [inaudible], potential lifesaving self administered medicine for patients at risk of recurring heart attack and [inaudible], a novel immunology asset that has the potential to be a first-in-class oral therapy for the treatment of [inaudible] with potential broad application across multiple other autoimmune diseases.\nThe global collaboration also includes future optionality to expand the collaboration with additional pipeline assets in a transaction that minimizes near term P&L impact and provides significant upside following phase III readouts and regulatory approvals.\nThe addition of [inaudible] builds on Viatris' existing global cardiovascular franchise and a deep knowledge and expertise in self administered medicine for acute life threatening conditions. [inaudible] has the potential to be a cornerstone asset in Viatris' immunology platform, an area which I personally and our Chief R&D Officer, Felipe Martin and others at Viatris have deep development and commercialization expertise.\nThe agreement also highlights Viatris' capabilities to identify and secure high growth assets in areas of unmet medical need and do it in a way that reinforces our disciplined approach to capital allocation. We will be hosting an R&D event March 27th in New York City to discuss the collaboration with Idorsia and other elements of the company's pipeline in more depth.\nBefore I move on, I want to take this opportunity to welcome Doretta Mistras, who will become our new Chief Financial Officer on March 1st. Doretta joined us in January as CFO elect. He has been spending valuable time getting to know the company even better than she already did as a former company adviser.  I am pleased to have Doretta coming on board for what I expect to be an extremely successful next phase for Viatris.  She will share a few comments later in the call.\nBut now, let me turn the call over to Rajiv as we continue our discussion of our strong fourth quarter and full year 2023 results and our expectations for 2024. Rajiv?\n\nRajiv Malik\n\nPresident & Executive Director, Mylan NV\n\nThanks Scott and good morning everyone. As we close phase one of our strategy, I'm incredibly proud of all that we have accomplished. We simplified but more importantly, stabilized our base business. We continued to deliver on our strong pipeline and are in the final stages of reshaping the company with remaining divestitures being on track. We believe that the stability of our core business and our deep pipeline positions the company very well for continued growth into '24 and beyond.\nLet me talk to you a bit more about what we believe makes our core business stable. It is driven by the consistent and steady performance of brand business, the sustainability of our genetics portfolio and our ability to continue to bring to market our organic pipeline consisting of high margin, durable, and complex products.\nLet me further expand this into three elements. First, our band business, which makes up about two thirds of our portfolio grew 1% in '23 supported by brands like [inaudible]. We expect our branded portfolio to continue to build upon the success of 2023 and show a moderate growth.\nNext is our genetics business, which now also includes our complex genetics and makes up that remaining one third of our revenue. This business was flat in 2023 and is expected to show slight growth in 2024. The geography and portfolio diversity, which includes a number of high value complex products, such as [inaudible] and lended this portfolio inherent stability.\nThe third driver of our stable base is our ability to execute on our pipeline. This is the third consecutive year that Viatris has delivered at least $450 million in new product launches. In 2023, we made significant progress across our complex injectables, select novel and complex products and eye care pipeline. We launched the [inaudible], the first genetics [inaudible] and several others.\nThe FDA accepted our NDA filing application for [inaudible] injection. We received FDA approval of the [inaudible] night drops for the treatment of pharmacologically induced [inaudible] and we received positive top line results for our phase III trials of [inaudible] in China. We also received positive top line results for our phase III trial of [inaudible] in China and subsequent [inaudible] acceptance of our NDA.\nFor 2024, we are excited to continue to deliver on our deep pipeline and execute on several key launches that will expand access to patients. For example, from our complex injectables portfolio, we expect to be an early intent with our [inaudible] product, liraglutide, a genetic [inaudible] as well as iron sucrose, a genetic form [inaudible].\nFrom our eye care pipeline, we expect to launch the [inaudible] and from our novel and five of five B2 pipeline, we are excited to bring to market our once monthly [inaudible] for patients with multiple sclerosis, and we are pleased to present our latest data this week at Actavis, a key medical conference.\nWe also continue to be laser focused on progressing our other pipeline assets, many of which are in phase III stages such as [inaudible] low dose meloxicam and [inaudible] DAD. We are especially excited about advancing our eye care pipeline that had several programs in a phase III aimed at addressing vision related disorders, such as [inaudible] night vision disturbances and blepharitis.\nLet me now turn to the commercial segment and our expectations for 2024. In '24, we expect total revenues to grow approximately 2%, which includes approximately $450 million to $550 million in new product revenue.\nStarting with developed markets, in '23 developed markets declined by 1%. Our European business for the third consecutive year demonstrated operational net sales growth led by Italy and Spain as well as contributions from new product launches.\nThis helped us to offset the decline in North America due to the expected impact of increased generic [inaudible] performance and higher competitive pressures on certain complex products, including [inaudible] in the first half of the year.\nFor 2024, we expect this segment to grow with both Europe and North America expected to grow 3%. Europe's growth is expected to be led by our strong brand portfolio, including [inaudible] and products from our [inaudible] portfolio. In addition, we anticipate further growth in key markets, including Italy, and France, and strong generic performance aided by new product launches.\nNorth America is expected to grow by 3%, driven by the exciting new launches of [inaudible], Liraglutide, and [inaudible]. In addition, we expect to further strengthen our position of respiratory products like [inaudible] and [inaudible]. [inaudible] is expected to continue its growth trajectory and grow by double digits.\nFor the eye care portfolio, we expect further gains in 2024, resulting from the continued prescription growth in [inaudible] as we expand access through patient fulfillment, coupled with the launch of new product [inaudible]. The [inaudible] DTC campaign launched in October has shown early indications are both increased patient responsiveness and performance as quarter four non-based prescriptions were up 18% quarter over quarter.\nEmerging markets had another strong year, delivering 7% year over year operational growth in '23. These better than expected results benefited from strength across our broader generics portfolio and stronger than expected performance from brands like Dymista and Viagra let by markets, such as Turkey, South Korea and Southeast Asia. Going into 2024, we are projecting this segment to grow by 6% year over year, primarily driven by our branded business.\nMoving to jazz. Full year 23 came in below our expectations due to the continued impact from the government driven price regulations in this region, which we expect to continue into two due to the floor. We anticipate to partially offset the pricing dynamics with the ongoing strong volume growth from our key brands, including Amitiza Creon and affects our advertise optimizing our genetics business. This segment is expected to decline by 8% in 2024. Okay. Greater China performed ahead of our expectations for the full year 2023, delivering 2% growth driven by strong performance of our retail channel in China. This is a result of our ability to adapt our business model to the evolving market dynamics.\nGoing forward, we will leverage our investments to further expand our self pay patient market and our brand equity in this channel, which we expect will help to absorb some of the impacts from the government implemented health care policy regulations. With these dynamics in mind, we [inaudible] a 2% year over year decline for 2024.\nBefore I conclude, I want to take the opportunity to thank the amendment team for their partnership over the years and all our employees who have helped us build a strong global platform. I'm very pleased with where we are today, and in the Viatris journey and [inaudible] stability of our core business, which is now nicely set up for continued growth from here onwards. With that, I'll hand the call over to Sandeep.\n\nSandeep Narula\n\nThank you Rajiv and good morning everyone. 2023 was another strong year across total revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow. Our results were in line or better than our expectations. We believe that the foundation we built sets the company up to deliver on our strategy and future growth outlook.\nOur guidance as updated in November, included a full year contribution from the divested businesses. As a result of a certain transaction that closed in 2023, we're adjusting our guidance on total revenue and adjusted EBITDA by $35 million and $20 million respectively. Adjusted EBITDA included $105 million of acquired IP, R&D, primarily related to upfront licensing payments.\nPlease note we do not include acquired IP R&D guidance for future periods as it cannot be reasonably forecasted. Free cash flow was impacted by approximately $235 million associated with the divestitures, including transaction costs and taxes. Excluding this impact, free cash flow would have been $2.64 billion on a full year basis.\nThis was the third consecutive quarter of operational revenue growth and we continue to see solid performance across developed markets, emerging markets in our greater China segment. Excluding the impact of divestiture, revenue grew over 1%.\nDuring the last earnings call, we noted that our adjusted gross margin would moderate in Q4 due to the timing of segment and product mix. On a full year basis, adjusted gross margin came in at the high end of our expectation at 59.1%, driven by strong brand performance. Adjusted SG&A and R&D included certain investment we made in Q4 to support future revenue growth.\nWe had another strong year of free cash flow generation, reflecting our underlying operational performance and continued priority on cash optimization initiative. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was impacted by transaction costs and taxes related to the divestiture and excluding these items would have been $454 million. It is important to reiterate that gross proceeds from the divestitures benefit cash flow from investing activities, while the related taxes and transaction costs are included in cash flow from operating activities.\nThe strong free cash flow generation over the last three years exceeded $7.5 billion and has enabled us to deliver on our financial commitments. This included debt paydown of greater than $6.6 billion and return of approximately $1.8 billion of capital to shareholders. These positive actions taken by the company reinforce our continuing commitment to an investment grade rating and an expectation of increasing the return of capital to our shareholders.\nFor 2024, our guidance includes the estimated full year results from theses divestitures that have not yet closed. The expected timing of closing of divestitures will impact reported results for the next few quarters. We will provide future adjustment to guidance as remaining divestitures close. The anticipated drivers for 2024 total revenue guidance include growth of approximately 2% operationally versus 2023 and expected new product revenue of approximately $450 million to $550 million and growth from our eye care division.\nAs a reminder, guidance currently includes approximately $1.1 billion of total revenue on full year basis from the remaining divestitures. The driver for adjusted EBITDA include contribution from new product launches and revenue growth, moderation in gross margin relative to '23 levels due to anticipated product and segment mix and increased R&D, primarily related to [inaudible] collaboration.\nThe estimated adjusted EBITDA from the remaining divestiture is approximately $320 million on a full year basis. We expect to generate approximately $2.5 billion in free cash flow in 2024 before any divestiture cost indexes. Lastly, we are providing adjusted EPS guidance as a measure of our expected O&M growth moving forward. Estimated shares outstanding include the benefit of share buyback executed earlier this month.\nNow a few comments about anticipated phasing in this year. Total revenue is expected to be higher in the second half due to launch of new products and normal product seasonality. Taking into account the phasing of revenue margins and investment, we expect adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow to be evenly phased between first half and second half. And in general, free cash flow tend to be lower in quarter two and quarter four due to the timing of semiannual interest payments.\nIn the revenue guidance walk, the 2023 adjusted number of $15.2 billion excludes the result of a divestiture that closed in 2023 and includes anticipated foreign exchange headwinds. We expect the reported adjusted EBITDA to be impacted by the benefit of approximately 2% total operational revenue growth, estimated impact of foreign exchange, divestitures that closed in 2023, and Idorsia R&D investment and impact of IP R&D.\nTaking these items into consideration, we expect adjusted EBITDA for the base business to be stable this year. We have pivoted to a more balanced capital allocation approach. This includes a focus on capital return and business development. The Idorsia R&D collaboration represents a disciplined approach with a modest upfront payment of approximately $350 million. A license structure serves to minimize and share the future development expenses for the programs, while providing potentially significant upside economics. The board has maintained the annual dividend policy of 48 cents per share in 2024.\nEarlier this month the company has repurchased approximately $250 million in shares of common stock. The board of directors has increased our existing share repurchase authorization by an additional $1 billion. We anticipate excess cash will be used opportunistically for additional buyback in future.\nLastly, we expect to continue to strengthen our balance sheet with debt paydown of approximately $3.5 billion this year to reach our long term gross leverage target.\nBefore I close, I want to take this opportunity to turn all of our colleagues around the world and a special call out to my finance team for their extraordinary work over the last 4 years. I am extremely proud of what we've accomplished together.\nI would be remiss if I did not acknowledge our management team and the board of directors for the opportunity to serve as the Chief Financial Officer of Viatris. Viatris in its strongest financial position here, the foundation is solid and will ensure its ability to make a real difference in patients' lives for many years to come. Now I'd like to turn it over to Doretta.\n\nTheodora Mistras\n\nThank you Sandeep. It's an honor to be here and I look forward to working with Scott and the rest of the management team to execute on the company's growth strategy and capital allocation priorities.\nPrior to joining Viatris, I had the benefit of working with the team as an adviser. I've helped companies across the healthcare industry drive shareholder returns for the past 20 years. This gives me a strong appreciation for the unique position that Viatris is in today to create significant value for our shareholders, given the diversity of the business and the stability of the cash flow.\nWith our gross leverage target in sight, I believe the company is striking the right balance with respect to business investment and capital return. I expect that with the strong foundation we have, coupled with thoughtful capital allocation, we will be a strong adjusted EPS growth story in the future.\nAs Scott mentioned, the Idorsia collaboration is a great example of the kinds of deals we'll continue to evaluate. This collaboration has the potential to enhance our growth profile by delivering a strong portfolio of branded, patent protected assets targeting significant unmet patient needs, while leveraging our capabilities in therapeutic areas where we have differentiated insights.\nAdditionally, the transaction was structured in a way that deploys capital judiciously and creates the potential for asymmetric returns for our shareholders relative to the quantum of capital deployed.\nNow, I'd like to turn it back over to the operator for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, at this time, we'll begin our question and answer session.\nTo ask a question, you may press star and then one on your touchtone telephone. If you are using a speaker phone, we do ask that you please pick up your handset prior to pressing the keys to ensure the best sound quality. To withdraw your question, you may press star and two. Once again, that is star and then one to join the question queue, we will pause momentarily to assemble the roster.\nOur first question today comes from Christopher Schott from JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nChristopher Thomas Schott\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC\n\nGreat. Thanks, So much just had a question on business development just building on some of the comments from the prepared remarks. Just so you think about business development opportunities, how do you think about balancing I guess kind of R&D deals that maybe come with a bit more risk like we saw today, it could be a nice opportunity upside, but have some risk with them versus maybe more in market transactions or in licensing of already approved drugs that maybe have potentially lower returns, but a bit more certainty. I'm just trying to sense is there a bias one way or the other or are you seeing more opportunities in one bucket versus the other? Thanks so much.\n\nScott Andrew Smith\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Celgene Corp.\n\nThank you Chris. Thank you for the question. I think we're going to look at all manner of opportunities in order to build the portfolio. I think licensing partnering M&A for in market assets is something that we're looking at. I also think we're looking at broader licensing agreements. In this case, we're looking at two phase III assets I  believe that are relatively de-risked that have real blockbuster blockbuster potential. I think [inaudible] has the potential for asymmetric return, which I believe is the case here. In terms of phase III assets, we also have an ability to affect the development in the registration strategy and of course, the commercial strategy going forward. So there are some benefits I think to doing things at this stage, but certainly we're going to look at all manner of opportunities and able to build a portfolio in the right way in the future.\nJust one comment, I think the solid base of the company that we built through '21, '22, '23 and '24 really provides us that opportunity to look for appropriate business development opportunities to build off that base and grow in the future.\n\nChristopher Thomas Schott\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Glenn Saint Angelo from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nGlenn Saint Angelo\n\nYeah, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just maybe to build on Scott's question, Scott what should we expect that this upcoming R&D Day? I mean, it seems you've been pretty clear that the hope was always to use half the available free cash flow towards business development, do you still expect that to be the case or based on your time in the seat do you see more opportunities maybe than what you originally thought? Because now it seems like you laid out your preferred therapeutic areas and we're buying outside of that, I'm just kind of curious to get your take on the market for these assets and what you're planning at a high level to discussed at R&D Day.\n\nScott Andrew Smith\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Celgene Corp.\n\nSo frst of all, thank you for the question Glenn and good morning. Our capital allocation plan is not changing. Going forward, we plan to deliver return to shareholders through share buybacks, which we've initiated in '24 and $250 million of dividends and then also looking for business development opportunities.\nAs I've said many times before, we're going to look at the core therapeutic areas: dermatology, Gi, ophthalmology, but we're also going to be opportunistic outside of those areas to find assets that fit what we do best. And in terms of these two assets, I think they fit what we do very, very well. We have $2.5 billion in cardiovascular revenue globally when you take a look at that, I think that a lot of growth fits very well into the pre-existing expertise and franchise that we have. And [inaudible] is an immuno modulatory drug, plays across multiple different therapeutic areas, including dermatology, Gi, neurology, rheumatology and so I think these two assets fit our portfolio very, very well.\nAgain, we're going to look at our three core areas, but we're also going to try and be opportunistic to look for opportunities outside of that. In terms of what we're going to cover in the R&D day, we're going to do a deep dive into the two assets that we're talking about here, so [inaudible]. We're gonna also talk about other opportunities in the pipeline that we have that we're developing, eyecare, as well as some other things in the pipeline. So it'll be a full pipeline review, but our main focus will be on [inaudible], including having some KOLs thoughts and expertise.\n\nGlenn Saint Angelo\n\nAlright, thanks for all that detail. Maybe I can just ask Sandeep a quick follow up on the guidance. In your slides, it seems and I think you've sort of commented on this a little bit that we should expect revs to be higher in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. Now I'm assuming that excludes the impact of divestitures so I just wanted to confirm that. But you also suggested that EBITDA and cash flow would be evenly phased sort of first half versus second half, I was wondering if you could just sort of comment a little bit on the cadence of how we should expect this year to play out.\n\nSandeep Narula\n\nThank you Glenn for the question. So you're right, the revenue for the business, so first of all this guidance includes the businesses that has not been divested as yet. I've given the clear impact of that in my prepared remarks so you can actually see and get to kind of like a pro forma number what that would look like for 2025 if you're looking at modeling. So during this year, on the total business before any divestment, the second half is going to be higher level. That's just a function of how the business is. New product revenue Rajiv talked about 450 to 550, a lot of that new launches that are happening in the second half of the year right, that's one.\nSecond is the productivity and obviously some of that we have in Europe, that happens in the second half of the year. So that's just a function of some of that happening. In terms of gross margin, you will expect a little bit of a moderation in the second half. That's again a segment of the product mix, a lot of the pricing impact happens in the later part of the year that will impact the gross margin from there. Typically the expenses pickup into the second half of the year with than kind of impact. When you put all those things together [inaudible].\nThe other thing to keep in mind Glenn is if we're looking at cash flow on a quarter to quarter basis, quarter two and quarter four tend to be lower for us because of our semi annual interest payments that we have and that kind of drive for that and that's why you'll see quarter four of this year and quarter two last year both were lower than quarter one and quarter three. So that's the overall kind of trending on the free cash flow. The other point that I would talk about is as and when these divestitures close, and we've given kind of on the slides, [inaudible] business will close kind of in the first half of the year and the OTC business probably in the middle of the year. We will provide the guidance update as and when those close so that you kind of have a sense of what the impact of that is. And then we will approach the revised guidance [inaudible] have transparency.\n\nGlenn Saint Angelo\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from [inaudible] Prasad from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nUnknown\n\nHi, good morning, and thanks for the questions. So I don't want to front run your R&D Day, clearly want to understand the deal today announced today. Firstly with both [inaudible] to understand the differentiation. When I look at the acute MI  landscape couple of approved drugs, including [inaudible] so help us understand the gap in the current treatment and how much more rapid or short acting [inaudible] is versus current treatment. Also, same question on [inaudible], just following up on-- I see that [inaudible] will contribute around $200 million in the next three years, is it fair to assume that Viatris will also be contributing an equal amount? Thanks.\n\nScott Andrew Smith\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Celgene Corp.\n\nYeah, thank you very much for the question. Just to start at the back, we will be contributing as well. I'm not saying it's equal, but the two companies will be contributing and Idorsia will be contributing up to $200 million in development programs going forward. In terms of our product differentiation, I'd like to turn it over to Philippe Martin, our Head of R&D just to  talk a little bit about some of the differentiation he sees at a very high level and these are the type of things that we're really going to dig into when we get to the R&D Day later in March and take a very strong, deep dive talking about the assets differentiation, where we think they're going to play therapeutically et cetera. But just to give a couple of initial thoughts on that, I'll hand it over to Philippe.\n\nPhilippe Martin\n\nThank you so much Scott. Yeah so just to targets a lot of ground. I think at a high level salado growth targets. The crucial time between the symptom onset and first medical attention that's the time, where. Currently there is really no treatment for these patients and Thats a critical time when. The heart muscle can can be impacted so that's clearly a different positioning in the treatment paradigm for C&I underground. . I think for you didn't ask for scenario really but. I think scenario. In terms of differentiation. Clearly we've seen a very strong phase two data that supports. Differentiated and highly competitive benefit risk profile. We have fast track designation for this asset and together with the latter ground I would say that the strength of the regulatory interactions.\n\nOperator\n\nBodes well for the for the future of these two assets, we have a spike in place towards the latter grill. And that gives you a good view on that. Agency support. For the critical elements of our people who protocol design, so really a benefit there is differentiation that comes through for these two assets and we really think. They have the potential to shift the treatment paradigm. And these two area of high unmet medical need so just to add onto what Felipe said quickly before we go to the next question and part of the excitement around scenario modest Phillipe and I have both been involved in the development registration and commercialization of molecules in the past. So it's a broad immuno module towards drug that we can take a lot of different places the initial indication is SLE. As you know there's proof of concept of molecules and things from multiple sclerosis, IBD certainly in skin. Jeremy dermatological conditions, including psoriasis so. Can really be. It could be ripe for a real indication expansion once we get through the first indication I think you can play in a lot of different therapeutic areas. So we're excited about it as well.\nOur next question comes from Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nOkay. Okay. One moment. Yeah. Okay. Once again the next question comes from Nathan Rich, Mr. Ritchie, you able to hear us.\nNext question. Mr. Rich are you able to hear us. Hi can you hear me now.\nI can hear you now yes, perfect. Okay, Hi, this is Sarah Colorado on for Nate. A quick question on the eye care franchise. So ahead of your second Eyecare lunch a Sunday in the first half how are you approaching the commercial launch and can you give us any details on plans to drive uptake and then one more modeling. This how should we model the product ramp compared to turbine and the timing of the associated expenses.\nSo thank you for the question, let me hand, it over to Rajiv to talk specifically about the Eyecare division into your buy and I will comment afterwards.\nThanks. I think we. We started with the DTC as we informed you know either. Q3 earnings we started with the BBC programming to cover Q4 in the quarter four. Non brakes prescriptions saw about 18% piece so all the other indications. Very very solid and we are seeing that expansion of the excess and we continue to be very optimistic and we are more optimistic now that the follow on launch of resumed. Earlier this year again, we would see a little bit more momentum behind that and more importantly, all the pipeline. Programs, which we acquired along with the continued to also progressed well as we have indicated earlier. In terms of a setup. The DRAM side. , so clearly the expenses, we're incurring so youll see it evenly phased. Expenses, because DTC is happening as we speak. For the year. And revenue as the scripts pick up we'll obviously some each quarter is going to be better than previous quarter for modeling purposes.\nJust a comment from me on the eye care Division, we're very early days here right. We're in the launch phase of . The first product, we're going to be launching. The second product very very quickly here and there is a a full pipeline of assets five or six further assets in development that we can bring forward. So we're very hopeful and aspirational to the eye care division is going to be a very important part of our business. As we go forward, we're looking for and as Rajeev said, we're looking forward to see. The second product very very quickly here and there is a a full pipeline of assets five or six further assets in development that we can bring forward. So we're very hopeful and aspirational to the eye care division is going to be a very important part of our business. As we go forward, we're looking for and as Rajeev said, we're looking forward to see. More data will be effective DC, DTC and see a further ramp in the business, but we're excited about the business overall.\nAnd our next question comes from Ash Birla from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.\nYes. Thank you. Thank you so much. That's on all the progress I had two questions one on the pipeline so for that to go. Uh huh. The phase III read out do you think this is a big binary risk type of program and also as a commercial opportunity. How do you expect patients to accurately identify the harder like symptoms and self inject under an emergency situation.\nAnd then second one. I wanted to get their thoughts on the FTC examination going into Pbms and wholesaler business practices pertaining to putting undue pressure on genetics. Do you expect to come out of this process and do you believe generic pricing could get capable and as a result of this thanks.\nThanks, Josh. So in terms of how to grow I believe there's approximately 6000 patients already enrolled in the phase III program. When we take a look at it from the phase two data and what's going on in Phase III. We think it's relatively de risked as an asset in terms of. The detailed question you asked on patient self diagnosis and self injection and identification of patients subsets. That's kind of thing that we're going to get into again, an R&D day in March 27th we will do a deep dive not only on the development programs the registered regulatory strategies, but also sort of our commercial strategies as well. Oh. And as to your follow up question on the FTC inquiry I think we have already seen some stabilization ended up after the pricing is concerned obviously when such investigation is on. There is a little bit of decent lower site. I believe our customers already appreciate our. Our industry has almost hit rock bottom and that's why you're seeing it or drug shortages and all of those things and everybody is taking attention of that and our dialogue with our customers have changed from the up always a cost plus price price price to availability. Uninterrupted supply the quality supply as well as new product. So I believe this is going to be good for our in depth of overall the health of the industry the genetics industry.\nOkay. Okay. And our next question comes from David from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead with your question. Okay. And our next question comes from David from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead with your question. And our next question comes from David from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead with your question.\nHey, Thanks, So just a couple first. Just wanted to pick your brain a little more on how you're thinking philosophically about business development Oyster point was. Outright acquisition. As more of a risk sharing type of arrangement. So I guess the question is. This transaction you announced today is that more of a harbinger of things to come in terms of what Youre looking for in terms of. A smaller type of upfront payment with. With milestones and royalties. Philosophically are you thinking about that or are you really just really casting a wide net. Just wanted to pick your brain a little more on how you're thinking philosophically about business development Oyster point was. Outright acquisition. As more of a risk sharing type of arrangement. So I guess the question is.\nThank you David for a further question there so when I when I look back at the deals that I've been involved with over my career, probably well over 100 deals of the work done and been involved with I would say the majority of them were partnering licensing of some sort we have an extraordinarily strong base and global reach from. From a commercial perspective in this in this company. So I think the idea of in licensing partnering assets is one that works very well for us, but we're going to we're going to throw a wide and that we're going to look at all manners to build the portfolio use our capital correctly, we will look at M&A, but we'll also look at licensing and partnerships at the end of the day will probably be a little bit more of the latter.\nGiven that there are a little bit less less initially capital intensive and also sort of risk sharing to some extent, but again, what we're looking to do we've got we've got a very strong global commercial network out there and we're looking to utilize that the best we can bring in assets that fit what we do best and we will do a combination of partnering licensing. Acquisition when. All the things that we need to do to build the portfolio. And. Acquisition when. All the things that we need to do to build the portfolio. And. All the things that we need to do to build the portfolio. And.\nNow to your second question I think you have more question is about the U S. Our genetics portfolio, but I'll answer it well. Comprehensively in the sense that globally, we have two thirds of the brand established brands iconic brands every market has a different needs. We continue to look into the markets best needs of the market and what do they know and needed from the next 2345 years, but overall, we take a we over the last three four years from the U S. One. Genetics point of view, we took a hard look into. While our portfolio focus was our excess how can we continue to provide access to affordable quality products and we saw that the cost was not up in the price is not the only reason, but if we see more than 10 15 players out there, yes, we've rationalized the number of products with more than 300 400. Products, just do take some volume off and focus on more complex more hot to make where again somebody needs to take a lead and bring access to those.\nIt looks like . Brent complex Injectables. So we are continuing to be focusing on where we can make a difference SaaS is always at the center and of course at a point in time, if we believe that something is not something is not making sense economically as well as there are from the supply point of view there are a number of. Players out there we do take off certain products often that's one I think every company every other company has also followed the same thing. Brent complex Injectables. So we are continuing to be focusing on where we can make a difference SaaS is always at the center and of course at a point in time, if we believe that something is not something is not making sense economically as well as there are from the supply point of view there are a number of.

Players out there we do take off certain products often that's one I think every company every other company has also followed the same thing.\nHello, Ladies and gentlemen, our final question today comes from Jason from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question just wanted to follow up on the. The BD . Strategy and mindful that you have a presence in sort of cardiology say O U S. I guess like when investors would see is that most of the value and innovative brands tends to occur in the U S market. So is the thinking here like you'd be in potentially four or five therapeutic areas and that's going to. Entail sort of. In investment both in more deals and scale up to be competitive in those categories. As we look at like a category like rheumatology, we see companies you know in the ini space, having to generate a lot of investment to be competitive in those areas and I'm sure. You can appreciate that from your time at Celgene. So just trying to think through. What this will look like from a P&L investment standpoint, and further BD to be competitive in the therapeutic areas. The BD . Strategy and mindful that you have a presence in sort of cardiology say O U S. Strategy and mindful that you have a presence in sort of cardiology say O U S.\nSo I think first of all you know from my perspective. The most difficult thing in this business as defined impactful assets that you can develop to become blog can become blockbusters that are patented with long term revenue streams. That's what's hard I think building the commercial structure around that is relatively easy. If you have an asset that can really play and be impactful. We're gonna be opportunistic we're going to look at our core therapeutic area.\nWe're going to look outside we're going to find things that fit we're going to find things that fit with the with the appropriate investment that we can make as a company. And so we're dedicated to again, finding the kind of assets that can really really drive business certainly we've got a very solid base business. We see growing in a couple of percent a year as we as we move forward and looking for things that can provide durable sticky long term revenue streams. For us as what we're really after here and we're going to do it in a smart and disciplined way and we're going to find areas that we can be competitive and leverage off the existing infrastructure as much as we can.\nOkay. Ladies and gentlemen that will conclude today's question and answer session I would like to turn the floor back over to Scott Smith for any closing remarks. Ladies and gentlemen that will conclude today's question and answer session I would like to turn the floor back over to Scott Smith for any closing remarks.\nThank you very much in closing 2023 was an outstanding year for that have continued our momentum as we enter the next phase of our strategic plan I expect 2024 will be a transformational year for our company as we continued to deliver on our base business, while building on our current strengths and adding new capabilities that will enable us to deliver on our future.

My name is Travis, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Viatris 2023 Third Quarter Earnings Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Bill Szablewski, Head of Global Capital Markets. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nWilliam Szablewski\n\nHead of Capital Markets\n\nGood evening, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2023 earnings call. With us today is our CEO, Scott Smith; President, Rajiv Malik; and CFO, Sanjeev Narula. During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements on a number of matters, including our financial guidance for 2023 and various strategic initiatives. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause future results or events to differ materially from today's projections. .\nPlease refer to today's slide presentation and our SEC filings for a fuller explanation of those risks and uncertainties. We will also be referring to certain actual and projected non-GAAP financial measures to supplement investors' understanding and assessment of our financial performance. Reconciliations of those non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, are available on our website and in the appendix of today's slide presentation.\nIn addition, during today's discussion, we will be making certain comparisons of results on an operational basis. which excludes the impact of foreign currency rates versus the plan that supports our financial guidance as well as year-over-year comparisons to prior period results, which also exclude the results from the divested bio-similars business. An archived copy of today's presentation and other earnings materials will be available on our website at investor.viatris.com following the conclusion of today's call.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to our CEO, Scott Smith.\n\nScott Andrew Smith\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Celgene Corp.\n\nGood afternoon. I'm pleased to report that Viatris had another outstanding quarter in Q3. We achieved our second consecutive quarter of year-over-year operational revenue growth. And our 11th straight quarter of strong operating results and consistently improving metrics. All evidence that we continue to build momentum as we bring Phase I of our strategic plan to successful completion. In the third quarter, we delivered total revenues of $3.94 billion, representing approximately 1% year-over-year growth. And adjusted EBITDA of $1.36 billion and free cash flow of $738 million, both of which, as you will hear more about from Sanjeev later were above our expectations. Based on our strong operational performance in the first 9 months of the year, we are reaffirming our 2023 financial guidance ranges for adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow.\nCompany is delivering strong operational revenues in line with our expectations. However, the impact of foreign exchange headwinds requires that we make a modest adjustment to our 2023 total revenue guidance range due solely to these FX headwinds. In addition, at the end of the third quarter, we were pleased to announce that we entered into agreements on all our planned divestitures. Announcing these transactions marked the achievement of an important milestone in the execution of our Phase I, strategic plan. We ran a strong and competitive process, and we're able to sign agreements to divest substantially all of our over-the-counter business, our women's health care business, our API business in India, and commercialization rights in certain noncore markets that were acquired as part of the Upjohn transaction. All within our previously announced time lines and valuation ranges. We anticipate closing all these transactions by the end of the first half of 2024.\nAs we look to 2024 and beyond, the momentum we see in the business gives us continued confidence that we are on track to meet our previously stated long-term goals. Specifically, we believe our existing business is well positioned to deliver organic top line growth over the long term, given the breadth of our pipeline and the number of expected new launches. We are on track to deliver $450 million to $550 million annually in new product launches from our existing pipeline. We continue to believe that adding new avenues for growth to the stable base business will help ensure that we reach our goal of accelerating growth in the future.\nAs we move into 2024, we remain confident that with the proceeds from our planned divestitures and our ability to generate at least $2.3 billion in free cash flow per year, excluding transaction costs and taxes, we have a clear line of sight to hitting our leverage target ratio of 3x. While also returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks and investing heavily to accelerating the growth of our business. We believe our focus on returning capital to shareholders and on investing in our business will be important levers to put the company on the path to achieve our long-term goals of revenue and earnings per share growth, 2 measures that we believe will be critical to valuing our company in the future. We plan to make investments both in our base business and in business development activities that give us the greatest potential for growth, patient impact and shareholder value. From a business development perspective, I am optimistic that we will be able to execute high-quality agreements that will capitalize on the strength of our global platform.\nWe are focusing our efforts on M&A, strategic licensing and partnerships. We are looking for innovative high-growth assets focused on areas of unmet medical need that meet our vision of addressing global health care needs and bringing access to high-quality medicines to more patients worldwide. Before I turn the call over to Rajiv to provide you with an update on our operations and our pipeline, I want to acknowledge the recent announcement that Rajiv will be retiring as an executive of the company next April.\nIt has been a privilege to get to know and to work with Rajiv during this past year. I could not have asked for a better partner during my onboarding at the company. I wish him nothing but the best in his eventual retirement. I look forward to working closely together in the months ahead as we complete our planned divestitures and prepare the organization for the future. And to his continued partnership as a member of the Board of Directors.\nI'd now like to turn it over to Rajiv.\n\nRajiv Malik\n\nPresident & Executive Director\n\nThanks Scott. I appreciate it and look forward to working with you to ensure a smooth transition while continuing to support you as we look out into the future, but in a different capacity. I also want to take the opportunity to thank all of our employees who have helped us build this strong global platform. I'm very pleased with where we are today in Viatris journey. And the strength as well as stability of our core business, which is now nicely set up for the continued growth from here onwards. Moving to our Commercial segment results. We have delivered a second consecutive quarter of year-over-year operational top line growth as we predicted, which further reaffirms that we are standing strong and set up for the future. This quarter, we recorded 1% year-over-year operational growth and are well positioned to end the full year in line with our expectations. Our well-balanced business of developed markets delivered another strong quarter growing 2% year-over-year operationally. Europe grew 1% versus the prior year on an operational basis, making it the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth.\nFrance and Italy led the growth in the region. A solid performance of generics in the Europe was another contributing factor. Our North America business was up 4% year-over-year on an operational basis, in line with our expectations. Our generics portfolio performed better than expected, driven by new launches such as Breyna, the generic for Symbicort, list [indiscernible] and the continued contribution of lenalidomide. Also some other key products, including glatiramer acetate, vancomycin and Xulane performed better than expectations. Our brand business was supported by strong demand in Yupelri, which grew 9% this quarter over the last year and in the epinephrine market. Overall, we remain confident that the developed market segment will meet our full year expectations. Emerging Markets had another strong quarter and delivered 2% year-over-year operational growth led by strength across our broader generics portfolio and stronger-than-expected performance from brands like Lyrica, Zolak and [ fecal ]. Margin Asia and Turkey were solid performing geographies. This segment is well positioned to deliver mid-single-digit year-over-year growth.\nMoving to JANZ, where brands performed in line with our expectations, while generics were slightly below expectations primarily due to customer buying patterns. We continue to be on track to deliver full year expectations. Greater Raja China experienced another solid quarter, primarily driven by strong performance of retail channel in China. Greater China was flat to the prior year, in line with our expectations. We believe that this segment will perform slightly better than our expectations for the full year.\nI'm also happy to report steady progress we made on our pipeline in this region. We recently received positive top line results for our Phase III clinical trials of Yupelri in China, which is consistent with our U.S. clinical data, and we look forward to submitting our NDA mid-'24. We currently have 10 other products under health authority review in China. Moving to the IK devision. As a bridge program sunset, We saw almost 9% non-bridge prescription growth in this quarter. We'll continue to focus on prescription growth in quarter 4 and into the future. supported by our first direct-to-consumer marketing campaign for Tyrvaya, which we launched in early October. We have recorded $345 million in new product revenue year-to-date and are on track to deliver more than $450 million of revenue from new product launches for the full year.\nLet me now discuss some key updates for our R&D pipeline. We are excited by the continued progress of our eye care pipeline, which is aimed at addressing a range of vision-related disorders. All the IK development programs remain on track, And we are pleased that we received FDA approval for [indiscernible] for the reversal of pharmacologically induced mydriasis and are looking forward to a commercial launch in the U.S. in the first half of '24. Switching to other pipeline updates, beginning with glatiramer acetate people. As you recall, the FDA had accepted for review our NDA and it assigned a PDUFA date of March 8, 2024. While we continue to make steady progress regarding the FDA review of our NDA, we are saddened by the tragic situation in Israel.\nAnd we are working very closely with our partner, Mapi, who remains fully operational. We have recently submitted our registration in Europe and are excited about the potential opportunity to bring this product to patients in Europe. Our BOTOX biosimilar program is progressing well from the development, characterization, validation of drug substance and drug product prospective. We recently completed the manufacturing of our IND-enabling drug substance batches and are well on our way to complete the drug product contracting. We remain on track to file our IND by the end of this year. We expect to initiate the pivotal clinical studies for this program in the first half of 2024.\nOur Phase III study for our XULANE low-dose program in U.S. remains on track, and we have benefited from an acceleration in the enrollment rate of rate for this study. We now expect to enroll our last patient this December. Also, we are closely interacting with FDA to initiate the Phase III program for our opioid sparing bloxicom novel product in late December.\nOur Phase III study for effects or generalized entity disorder in Japan continues to progress according to our schedule. And we remain on target to submit the NDA filing in the first half of 2025. Finally, all of our complex injectable programs are moving ahead as planned, and we continue to be very excited about the potential of this important potential $1 billion franchise. With that, I will hand the call over to Sanjeev.\n\nSanjeev Narula\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, and hello, everyone. Before I begin, I would also like to extend my congratulations to Rajiv. It has been a great partnership over the past 3 years, And I am proud of what we've accomplished together. We trust our colleagues and patients all over the world to benefit from your leadership, expertise and dedication to our business. Turning to our outlook. I want to reiterate my confidence in the strength of our unique global platform in the continued durability of our significant free cash flow generation. We're pleased with the outcome of our announced divestiture. Which upon closing will bring the successful conclusion to our Phase I commitments and further serves to accelerate our financial flexibility. As we work to finalize the plan for next year, and although we are not providing guidance at this time, we continue to expect at least $2.3 billion in free cash flow in 2024 even when taking into consideration inflation and foreign exchange headwinds to date.\nThis excludes any taxes and transaction costs associated with divestiture. For the second consecutive quarter, the business delivered total operational revenue growth versus priorities. The performance was diversified across regions and categories. The positive mix of brand and new products drove strong gross margins. From a regional perspective, we saw 2% growth in net sales from developed and emerging markets. The growth included the benefit from brands, generics and new launches. Net sales for the quarter were in line with the expectation and grew 1% versus the prior year. A diverse portfolio of growth driver included brand performance in emerging markets, Europe and Greater China. These revenue trends and positive momentum are expected to continue as we exit the year driven by brand strength of our global generic portfolio and new products.\nNew product revenue in the quarter met expectations and included the first quarter of Breyna. Adjusted gross margin was approximately 59% in the quarter and was ahead of our expectation. We continue to see the positive impact from portfolio decision driving favorable mix. We reported strong adjusted EBITDA, which included investment in SG&A and R&D to advance key programs across eye care, injectable and complex products.\nAs a result of strong adjusted EBITDA and improved cash conversion, we had an excellent quarter of free cash flow of $786 million excluding the impact of transaction costs, which represents growth of 3% on a reported year-on-year basis. [indiscernible] Enabling us to deliver capital allocation which has helped to further and help us maintain our investment-grade rating. Over the last 11 quarters, we have generated over $7.2 billion of free cash flow, and as a result, we have been able to pay down approximately $6.1 billion of debt during the same period, and we will pay down the $500 million maturity in Q4 from cash on hand.\nAdditionally, this quarter, we returned approximately $144 million of capital to our shareholders. So let me talk about -- the business continues to [Audio Gap]\nExpect to absorb this potential FX impact and still cash flow. Now a few updates -- we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA to be lower in Q4 than prior quarters driven by 2 factors: plus low gross margin due to less favorable portfolio and segment mix. Second, SG&A to increase driven by investment in the Tyrvaya direct-to-consumer campaign and other areas to drive future [ Cook ]. We anticipate free cash flow in Q4 to be impacted by lower adjusted EBITDA higher capital expenditure and timing of biannual interest payments.\nAs a reminder, our free cash flow guidance does not include any transaction costs and taxes associated with biosimilar divestments and the eye care acquisition or the planned divestiture. Additionally, our adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow guidance excludes any acquired IP R&D for unsigned deals. In closing, based on the continued strong underlying fundamentals of our business, we're well positioned for the remainder of the year and the outlook for 2024 continues to be positive. With that, I'd like to hand it back to the operator to begin taking your questions. Thank you."

My name is Todd, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Viatris 2023 Second Quarter Earnings Call and Webcast.\n[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Bill Head of Global Head of Global Capital Markets.\n\nWilliam Szablewski\n\nHead of Capital Markets\n\nGood morning, everyone. It is my pleasure to welcome you to our second quarter 2023 earnings call. With us today is our CEO, Scott Smith; President, Rajiv Malik; CFO, Sanjiv Niro; and Jeff Nau now from our Eye Care division.\nDuring today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements on a number of matters, including our financial guidance for 2023 and various strategic initiatives. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause future results or events to differ materially from today's projections. Please refer to today's slide presentation and our SEC filings for a full explanation of those risks and uncertainties and limits applicable to forward-looking statements. We will be referring to certain actual and projected non-GAAP financial measures to supplement investors' understanding and assessment of our financial performance. Reconciliations of those non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website and in the appendix of today's slide presentation.\nAn archived copy of today's presentation and other earnings materials will be available on our website at investor.vcs.com following the conclusion of today's call. With that, I will now hand the call over to our CEO, Scott Smith.\n\nScott Andrew Smith\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Celgene Corp.\n\nGood morning to everyone on the call. I am pleased to report that the second quarter of 2023 was one of the strongest quarters we've had to date at Viatris. I could not be more pleased with our overall execution. The positive momentum of the base business continues to push us forward. We are laser-focused on delivering our pipeline and are excited about new product launches.\nIn the second quarter, we delivered total revenues of $3.9 billion represented approximately 2% year-over-year growth on an operational adjusted basis, and adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion and free cash flow of $447 million, both of which were ahead of our expectations. Based on our performance this quarter, and in the first half of the year, we are reaffirming our full year financial guidance for 2023. These results signal the beginning of what we expect to be a growth journey for Viatris and set us up well for future success as we prepare to bring Phase 1 of our strategic plan to successful completion and initiate Phase 2 beginning in 2024. While I'm proud of our strong performance, the foundation the company has built and the stability and predictability that we believe have clearly been achieved my focus is on the future and on the trajectory of the company moving forward.\nNow let's turn our attention there. On executing our planned divestitures, we are on track to announce all transactions in 2023. As we've said, executing these planned divestitures as a matter of strategic choice, not a necessity. I am extremely pleased with where we are in the process. We are currently in advanced stages of discussions with potential buyers and anticipate announcing at least one significant divestiture in the third quarter, possibly more. As a result, I will not be in a position to take any further questions on this topic during Q&A today, but very much look forward to discussing in detail with you at an appropriate time in the future. The company has laid out clear capital allocation and business development priorities for Phase 2, and we are fully dedicated to executing on these priorities, which will allow us to continue our move up the value chain. We intend to earmark approximately 50% of our free cash flow annually to be returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and specialty share repurchases.\nWith the remaining capital, we intend to invest in our businesses both organically and inorganically. I continue to be focused on looking for strategically significant transactions in ophthalmology, gastroenterology and dermatology as well as evaluating other therapeutic areas should the right opportunities arise. It has become apparent to me that there are many assets that could fit our needs and are transactable. I am optimistic about our ability to execute high-quality business development deals, not only through M&A, but also through strategic licensing agreements and partnerships when the time is right.\nIn summary, I am very proud of our execution to date, the health of the company and a strong foundation that has been built. Looking ahead, I believe, in the future trajectory of the company, and I'm very excited for it to come. I'll now turn the call over to Rajiv to provide you with an update on our operations and our pipeline and then to Sanjeev, who will give you more details of our financial results, 2023 guidance and capital allocation activities. Rajiv?\n\nRajiv Malik\n\nPresident & Executive Director\n\nThanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Our strong performance this quarter highlights the momentum of our business like never before and further reinforces the predictability of our base business, which is well diversified from a geography as well as portfolio point of view. The performance of the last 10 quarters demonstrates that our business model of bringing access has never relied on any one product or any one market. The strength of our underlying business is enabling us to position the company well for Phase II growth.\nOur continued new product revenue performance is another key feature of our plan and for this year, again, we remain on track to deliver on our expectation of approximately USD 500 million of new product revenue. As I provide the commercial segment highlights for the quarter, I will be making certain comparisons on an operational basis, which excludes the negative impact of foreign currency base versus plan that supports our financial guidance. In addition, I will be making certain comparisons to our Q2 '22 results on a [indiscernible] adjusted operational basis as defined in our earnings release. This quarter, total net sales grew 1.5% on an operational basis due to a strong performance across various geographies and product portfolios.\nWe believe achieving this top line growth for the first time as Viatris reflects the power of our platform, well thought out strategy and our consistent execution. Let me get into our commercial segment highlights. Our well-balanced business of dwelled markets, where brands make up approximately 55% of our net sales in quarter 2, delivered another strong quarter. Europe performed ahead of our expectations, delivering 2% year-over-year growth on an operational basis. Italy, Spain and U.K. as well as several other markets drove the strong momentum for the quarter. A solid performance of generics in Europe was another contributing factor. Our North America business was flat year-over-year on an operational basis and also performed ahead of expectations. Generics delivered a better-than-expected performance led by Lennar Dumi, Wixela and Zulet.\nOur brand business was supported by strong demand in epinephrine market and YUPELRI, which grew 12% this year over the last year. YUPELRI, which is the only nebulized long-acting masclinic agent available in the market continues to show significant growth and enjoys about a 30% market share in the broader long-acting nebulized COPD market and is well on its way to become the #1 product in this space. Our new launches in North America are on track and we are very excited about our recent introduction of brine or generic to Symbicort. We expect that this launch will be 180 days first-to-file generic exclusivity which is subject to FDA's future determination of the issue, if and when another ANDA filer becomes eligible for final approval. For the second half of the year, we believe the developed market segment is poised for year-over-year growth, and we remain confident to meet or exceed our full year expectation of both North America and Europe.\nEmerging Markets had another strong quarter and delivered 10% year-over-year operational growth led by stronger-than-expected performance of generics and brands like Lipitor, Lyrica, Celebrex -- in margin Asia and Middle East were strong performing geographies. We remain confident for this segment to deliver better than expected for the full year and grow versus the prior year. [ jazz ]performed in line with our expectations, and we anticipate continuing to meet our expectations for the full year. In Greater China, we delivered 1% operational growth in this quarter, primarily due to Vigra and other retail-driven products in China. We remain on track to meet our planned expectations for the year. Our team in China has been focused on continuing to expand our presence in the private channel while navigating and managing the evolving policy dynamics on the ground. We have also been very focused on building and expanding our pipeline of new products in China. To that end, our NDAs for Dymista and performance received approval from SFDA in this quarter.\nIn addition to this, our partners NDA for TV was also accepted while 8 other products are under active review. Moving to Eyeicare. [ Tyrvaya ] launch continued to progress as planned in its second quarter as part of the cess. During the quarter, [ Teva's ] bridge program was optimized to drive increased value per script and achieve the highest quarterly TRX launch to date. Furthermore, we remain focused on maximizing its potential, including increasing share of Medicare prescriptions, driving continued growth in total prescriptions and launching the brand's first direct-to-consumer campaign in the fourth quarter, which together, we believe, provides support for our near- and longer-term expectations for the brand. We are also excited by the continued progress of our eye care pipeline, which is aimed at addressing a range of vision related disorders. Our NDA review of MR140 for the reversal of [ Madras ] program is under active review with a PDUFA date of September 28 of this year. We have completed patient enrollment in the first pivotal Phase III trial of MR-141 for the treatment of presbyopia and expect top line data in Q3 of this year and we remain on track to initiate the second Phase III trial later this year.\nWe have initiated patient enrollment in the first Phase III study, M148 for the treatment of dry eye disease and expect top line data in '24. We are initiating a Phase III program of MR-139 for the treatment of blepharitis later this year. MR142 for night vision is services and MR146 for neurotrophic Keratopathy also remain on track. Switching to other pipeline updates. And beginning with the news we announced today around GA Depot. The FDA has accepted for review our recently submitted NDA and have signed a PDUFA date of March 24. Our application is backed by Phase III efficacy and safety data, and we believe GA Depot could improve patient experience through fewer injections, greater tolerability and increased compliance. We are feeling very confident in the strength of our GAD clinical program and continue to believe that we remain on track to launch in the second half of'24. We are equally excited about the potential opportunity to also bring this product to patients in Europe, which we expect to file later this year.\nOur BOTOX biosimilar program is progressing well from the development, characterization as well as validation of drug substance and drug product perspective. We remain on track to fight our IND by the end of this year. Our Phase III study for our Xulane low-dose program in U.S.A. remains on track with nearly 800 of the planned 1,200 women enroll. We are targeting completion of enrollment by March '24. And our Phase III study for fear generalizing [ XT ] disorder in Japan is well on schedule, and we are targeting an NDA filing in the first half of '25. Lastly, all our complex injectable programs are moving ahead as planned. Before I turn the call to Sanjeev, I want to thank our colleagues for another strong quarter and consistent performance with that, Sanjeev.\n\nSanjeev Narula\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Rajiv, and good morning, everyone. We had another excellent quarter and are seeing the results of our efforts, which include revenue growth versus prior year. Unless otherwise stated, I will be making year-on-year comparison on a divestiture adjusted operational basis, as defined in our earnings release. The second quarter exceeded our expectation. We're encouraged by our fundamentals and continued strong operational performance. Our branded business and new product revenue is contributing to favorable gross margin.\nIn the quarter versus prior year, net sales from emerging markets, Europe and Greater China grew. The revenue growth included the impact of new products, and we expect this momentum will continue with our recent [ brainer ] launch. We continue to invest behind future growth driver, which includes the IT division's commercial investment and late-stage pipeline programs. We believe that our unique global platform, which is diversified across product categories has proven its ability to continue to generate significant and sustainable free cash flow, and we remain confident in the durability of this performance moving forward. Turning to Q2 and first half highlights. The summarized results versus prior year on a reported basis, including the biosimilar business in 2022. Net sales were slightly ahead of expectations and grew at 1.5% versus the prior year. This performance is consistent with our expectation for the business over the long term.\nOn a reported basis, Foreign exchange had an impact of approximately 2% on net sales versus the second quarter 2022. The [ Devers ] portfolio of growth drivers included brand performance in the emerging markets, Europe and Greater China. We expect the revenue trends to continue in the second half aided by product seasonality and the continued ramp of new products. New product revenue in the quarter met expectations and included sales of all strengths of [ lenalidomide. ] Adjusted gross margin of approximately 60% in the quarter exceeded our expectation and was driven by positive portfolio mix and lower-than-expected inflation on COGS. We reported strong adjusted EBITDA, which included the anticipated step-up in SG&A associated with the IK division and the R&D to advance key programs across eye care, injectable and complex products.\nWe had another solid quarter of free cash flow of $447 million ahead of our expectation. The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower adjusted EBITDA due to the biosimilar divestiture, the impact of foreign exchange and anticipated timing of working capital. We are delivering on our capital allocation priority and continue to pay down debt to reach our gross leverage target of 3x. We remain in a strong balance sheet position and are committed to our investment-grade rating. In the quarter, we paid down shortened debt of $181 million for a total of approximately $6.1 billion since the beginning of 2021. We expect to pay down the $500 million maturity in Q4 from cash on hand. Additionally, we returned approximately $144 million of capital to our shareholders in the quarter through the dividend. The strong performance in the first half this year gives us continued confidence in our Phase II outlook.\nAlthough we're not providing guidance beyond 2023, it remains our expectation to generate at least $2.3 billion of free cash flow from the rebased business before any associated transaction costs and taxes. We are reaffirming our 2023 financial guidance ranges and expect full year revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow to be at the midpoint of the ranges. We are closely watching foreign exchange of select currencies. While we have absorbed the impact of foreign exchange headwinds in the first half versus what we had assumed in our February guidance, it is possible that we may encounter a slight headwind in the second half.\nNow a few update on the expected phasing for the rest of the year. We continue to expect total revenue to be higher in the second half due to the launch and ramp of new products as well as normal product seasonality, particularly in developed markets. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be slightly lower in the second half, driven by 2 factors. First, gross margin moderating due to less favorable portfolio and segment mix as well as expected higher COGS driven by inflation. And second, the investment we're making behind future growth driver. This include DTC investment in [ Cervia ] high care pipeline and organic R&D. We anticipate free cash flow to be slightly lower in the second half based on our adjusted EBITDA outlook and increase in capital expenditure and onetime costs. As a reminder, our free cash flow guidance does not include any transaction costs and taxes associated with the biosimilar divestments, the Eye Care acquisition or the planned divestiture Additionally, our adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow ranges exclude any acquired IP R&D for unsigned deals.\nIn the second quarter, we incurred $10 million of IP R&D related to our investments in Japan. In closing, based on the continued strong underlying fundamentals of the business, we're well positioned for the remainder of the year and look forward to 2024 and beyond. With that, I'd like to hand it back to the operator to begin taking your questions. Thank you."

I'm excited to speak to you today officially as the CEO of Viatris. It's been a busy and productive first month. Viatris is a special company, I knew that from the moment I joined the Board in December, and I appreciate it even more today. It begins with our ability to sustainably deliver access to high-quality medicines at scale to people regardless of geography or [indiscernible].\nSince becoming CEO, I have met with colleagues all over the globe and have had the opportunity to spend time with each business segment. I have seen firsthand the unique combination of passion, dedication and skills of the people of Viatris. Their unwavering commitment to our mission is infectious. I'm honored to be part of this amazing organization, and I'm extremely impressed by everything that has been accomplished to date.\nIn addition to our historically strong regulatory, clinical and manufacturing capabilities, I've also been very impressed with the company's global commercial infrastructure and the talented people we have there. I look forward to finding additional ways to leverage these capabilities to deliver more access to more medicines to more patients around the world.\nI want to reiterate that I firmly believe in the strategic plan announced in November of last year. I believe that executing this plan will ensure that we are able to simplify our unique place in the global health care landscape. A critical part of my job is to enhance the already strong execution of the company and ideally accelerate our well-crafted strategy. What I've already seen and experienced, I believe we are positioned well to be set up for success in Phase 2 of our strategic plan.\nI believe that Viatris has the strong financial profile and financial flexibility to accelerate growth in the coming years, and I am fully aligned with the future capital allocation priorities that the company laid out in November, namely that, although we are not giving guidance beyond 2023, beginning in '24, we expect the reshaped, rebased company to generate at least $2.3 billion of free cash flows per year, excluding transaction costs and taxes. And in phase 2, we intend to remark approximately 50% of our free cash flows annually to be returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. With the remaining 50%, we intend to identify and be able to reinvest further in our businesses organically and inorganically with value-creating strategic transactions.\nWhile I will leave the discussion of details of our first quarter results to Rajiv and Sanjeev, I am very pleased to report that Viatris has had a great start to the year with yet another quarter of strong operational performance that gives us further confidence in our ability to return to growth as we enter phase 2 of our strategic plan in 2024.\nIn the first quarter, we delivered total revenues of $3.73 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $1.34 billion and free cash flow of $923 million. Based on the strong performance, we are reaffirming our financial guidance for 2023. We are also laser-focused on executing our pipeline, especially our 3 franchises with the potential to reach $1 billion each in peak sales by 2028: complex injectables, novel and complex products and eye care.\nOn our planned divestitures, I think it is important to note that we are in a position of strength. Executing these planned divestitures is a matter of strategic choice, not a necessity, that we believe will accelerate our ability to move up the value chain and lay a solid foundation for our return to growth in phase 2. We have been engaged in productive discussions with a number of interested parties to determine the right set for these well-performing assets. We continue to believe that these divestitures will unlock meaningful value for the company, and we remain on track with our stated goals, including announcing the transactions in 2023. I expect to be able to announce one or more of these transactions early in the second half of the year.\nAnd finally, on business development, the company laid out a strategic vision for business development in the area of ophthalmology, GI and dermatology. Our acquisitions of Oyster Point and Famy Life Sciences earlier in the year are excellent examples of the execution of that strategy, and I am focused on continuing to look for additional significant transaction in these areas and potentially others should the right opportunities arise. I think my combined experience with big biotech, big pharma and smaller biotech companies will help us accelerate this vision.\nIn summary, I could not be more energized by my time at the company so far, by the people I've met and by all that I've experienced. I look forward to the exciting path ahead.\nI'll now turn the call over to Rajiv to provide you with an update on our operations and our pipeline, and then to Sanjeev, who will give you more detail on our financial results and capital deployment activities. Rajiv?\n\nRajiv Malik\n\nPresident & Executive Director\n\nThanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. As Scott mentioned, we had another strong start to the year and a strong quarter of operational performance across various segments as well as product categories. Let me now begin by sharing our commercial segment highlights from the quarter. As I do, I will be making certain comparisons on an operational basis, which excludes the negative impact of foreign currency rates versus the plan that supports our financial guidance as well as to Q1 '22 results which also excludes the results from the divested biosimilars business from Q1 '22.\nOur well-balanced business of [indiscernible] markets where brands make up close to 60% of our net sales delivered another strong quarter. Europe performed ahead of our expectations, with France and Italy driving the strong performance. The region grew low single digits in Q1 compared to the prior year on an operational basis, making it our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Our key brands like Dymista, Creon and Brufen as well as our generics portfolio continued to perform strongly in Q1.\nOur North America business also performed ahead of expectations driven by better-than-expected performance in our generics portfolio, including [indiscernible] and our injectables portfolio. Our brand business was led by stronger performance of Yupelri. We look forward to launching several new products in North America this year, including Breyna, our generic to [indiscernible]. We and our partner[, indiscernible] Drug Delivery, have settled the patent litigation with AstraZeneca and expect to launch the product after expiration of regulatory exclusivity.\nWe anticipate launching Breyna with 180 days first-to-file generic exclusivity subject to FDA's future determination of the issue if and when another NDA filer becomes eligible for final approval.\nFor the remainder of the year, in developed markets, we expect to meet or exceed our expectations of both North America and Europe.\nMoving to emerging markets. Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, [indiscernible], Middle East delivered strong performance. Lipitor, Norvasc and Viagra performed better than expected. Generics also performed ahead of expectations driven by solid ARE performance. We remain confident for this segment to deliver mid-single-digit growth for the full year, primarily driven by our brand category of this region.\nIn JANZ, the brand category fell slightly behind expectations primarily due to customer buying patterns in Japan. We remain confident in our broad outlook for the year due to the projected strong performance of our generics, including authorized generics as well as our brands like Creon, Amitiza and Effexor.\nGreater China performed better than expected with 5% year-over-year growth on an operational basis. We expect another strong year of operational performance, in line with our expectations, as we continue to focus on the retail segment and growing the self-pay patient base while navigating the evolving policy environment. I'm also pleased to confirm that we have 10 regulatory submissions under review with the SFDA in China.\nMoving to Eye Care. [indiscernible] launch continue to progress as planned in its first quarter as a part of Viatris. March delivered through as the highest launch-to-date monthly prescriber count and total prescriptions. Furthermore, we remain excited about Tyrvaya's opportunities ahead, including driving prescriptions from the recent Medicare party coverage wins, leveraging Viatris' commercial infrastructure and launching its first direct-to-consumer marketing campaign in Q4, which together provides confidence in our current full year outlook for Tyrvaya as well as beyond that.\nWe have made significant progress in stabilizing our base business, which we believe is one of the key elements to the successful execution of our phase 2 strategy in '24 and beyond. One of the primary drivers to our expected stabilization is the effective management of our brand portfolio, which forms approximately 2/3 of our overall base. I'm pleased to report that for the last several quarters, our branded business has consistently performed at or above our expectations across the various geographies.\nThis continued strong performance of our branded category has led generics across the segments, combined with our anticipated $500 million plus of new product launches in '23, gives us tremendous confidence that our base business, excluding the positive impact of our Eye Care Division, will return to growth in the second half of the year versus the prior year. We believe we are headed into the final stages of completing all aspects our phase 1 commitment and will deliver another strong year that we expect will put the company in a very solid position to execute phase 2.\nLet me now switch to provide noteworthy updates on our pipeline with a focus on the 3 key buckets we highlighted at the beginning of the year. I will begin with our portfolio of complex injectable products. We secured the sole first-to-file position for Wegovy, a weight loss treatment. In addition, we can also confirm that we have achieved the sole first-to-file status for Ozempic 8-milligram strength. As we have previously disclosed, we have a shared first to file position on the other strengths of Ozempic.\nIn addition, we have strengthened this portfolio and submitted our NDA for Abraxane used in the treatment of breast cancer as well as advanced our MR-151 product, an anticoagulant, into its clinical phase of development. Finally, we have also submitted another first-to-market ANDA to FDA for MR-204, which is indicated for chronic dry eye disease.\nWithin our select novel and complex products pipeline, I'm really excited to announce that we filed our NDA for glatiramer acetate once monthly to FDA.\nAs we have previously noted, our [ GA ] one monthly product has met its primary endpoint of reduction in annual relapse rate in a placebo-controlled Phase III study. GA monthly demonstrated a 30% reduction in ARR compared to placebo. In addition to this, GA once monthly, when compared to placebo, demonstrated clinically relevant priority on the expanded disability status scale score that was statistically significant.\nFor Meloxicam, we have completed our end of Phase II meeting with FDA on May 1 with positive outcomes, and we look forward to initiating our Phase III clinical trial in the second half of this year.\nFinally, we are progressing our IND-enabling study for our Botox program and remain on track to making our IND filing this year.\nOur Eye Care pipeline is also advancing as planned. We are pleased that we have received positive top end results for Tyrvaya in China. We, along with our partner, are now checking our submission in China to August of this year.\nOur clinical program for MR-142 for night vision disturbances is progressing well. We also submitted our IND and are Phase III-ready for our MR-148 for dry eye disease.\nIn addition, we aligned with FDA on the Phase III study design for our blepharitis program, which will get initiated later this year. Finally, we are executing an IND-enabling study for our nerve growth factor product, MR-146, which we hope to progress to treat all stages of neurotrophic keratitis.\nBefore I hand it over to Sanjeev, I want to recognize that our execution has been and continues to be a team effort, and I would like to thank our colleagues around the globe for delivering another strong quarter. With that, I will now hand the call over to Sanjeev.\n\nSanjeev Narula\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Rajiv, and good morning, everyone. We're off to a great start to the year and as a team could not be more confident in our strategy to deliver our plan and return the company to growth.\nAs Scott mentioned, first quarter was in line or slightly ahead of our expectation. Our business fundamentals are strong, and we are encouraged by continued performance, including the stability of our base business.\nIn the quarter versus prior year, excluding biosimilar, net sales from our Europe, emerging market, China businesses grew operationally. New products contributed well. We are looking forward to several exciting launches in the second half of the year.\nEarly in the quarter, we closed the [ eye care ] acquisition and our SG&A and R&D expenses for Q1 includes costs associated with the commercial infrastructure and late-stage pipeline of these businesses. We continue to see benefit from our unique platform and its ability to generate significant cash flow from operations. We feel good about the opportunities ahead that will strengthen our free cash flow generation.\nLooking at quarter 1 2023 highlights, you will see our summarized results versus the prior year on a reported basis. It is important to note that for comparison purposes, our reported results for quarter 1 2022 included the biosimilar business.\nOur net sales and adjusted EBITDA walks show sales for the quarter were in line with our expectation and, on an operational basis, down slightly versus the prior year. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of approximately 5% on net sales versus the first quarter 2022.\nThe stability of our business was primarily driven by growth in Europe across diverse portfolio, key products in Greater China and brands in Emerging Markets. As mentioned, base business performance was in line with our expectation, and the full year remains on track with the estimate we provided in the February due to ramp of new product and volumes.\nNew product revenues, off to a solid start and benefited from sales of additional strength of [ lenalidomide ].\nAdjusted gross margin of approximately 60% in the quarter exceeded our expectation and was driven by positive portfolio and segment mix, new product launches, the lower impact of inflation on COGS and the impact of certain positive variances.\nWe reported strong adjusted EBITDA, which included SG&A investment in the eye care franchise and R&D to progress key programs across injectable and complex products.\nWe had another excellent quarter of free cash flow of $923 million. In the quarter, free cash flow conversion continued to improve. The year-on-year decline was driven by lower adjusted EBITDA with biosimilar divestiture and the impact of foreign exchange.\nIn the quarter, we incurred approximately $22 million in transaction costs, primarily relating to eye care acquisitions.\nWe continue to deliver on our capital allocation plan and financial commitment. As a result, we remain in a strong balance sheet position with a low coupon fixed rate capital structure.\nWe are committed to our investment-grade rating, and we continue to pay down debt to reach our leverage target of 3x. In the quarter, we paid down approximately $550 million of debt for a total of approximately $6 billion since the beginning of 2021. Additionally, we returned approximately $400 million of capital to our shareholders in the quarter.\nBefore I discuss the 2023 outlook, although we are not providing guidance beyond 2023, especially given the strong start to this year, I have even more confidence in our phase 2 outlook beginning in 2024. This includes the expectation of generating at least $2.3 billion in free cash flow from the rebased business before any associated transaction costs and taxes.\nComing back to 2023, we are reaffirming our 2023 guidance ranges. We currently expect full year revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow to be at the midpoint of the ranges. While foreign exchange continues to be dynamic, based on current rates, we have assumed a slight headwind in Q2 and minimal to neutral impact for the full year.\nNow a few update on our expected phasing for the rest of the year. We continue to expect total revenue to be higher in the second half due to ramp and launch of new products, including Breyna, our generic version of Symbico, as well as normal product seasonality, particularly in Europe.\nWe now expect adjusted EBITDA to be evenly weighted between the first half and the second half, driven by 2 factors. Number one, gross margins stepping down in Q2 and moderating in the second half due to portfolio and segment mix, expected higher COGS because of inflation and expectation that positive variance in the first quarter will not repeat. And number two, SG&A and R&D spending to step up in Q2 and increased sequentially in the second half. This includes the expected DTC invested in Tyrvaya as well as increased investment in the eye care pipeline and organic R&D.\nWe expect cash flow to be lower in subsequent quarters given the expected increase in capital expenditure, onetime costs and working capital. Specifically, quarter 2 and quarter 4 will be lower due to timing of semiannual interest payments.\nAs a reminder, our adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow guidance excludes any future acquired [ IP R&D ] for unsigned deals. And our free cash flow does not include any transaction costs and taxes associated with the planned divestiture or the eye care acquisition.\nIn closing, based on the sound fundamentals of our business, we are well positioned for a strong 2023, and nothing has changed with respect to our phase 2 outlook beginning in 2024.\nWith that, I'll hand it back to the operator to begin the Q&A."

Welcome to our Q4 2022 earnings and 2023 guidance call. With us today is our Executive Chairman, Robert Coury; CEO, Michael Goettler; incoming CEO, Scott Smith; President, Rajiv Malik; and CFO, Sanjeev Narula.\nDuring today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements on a number of matters, including our financial guidance for 2023 and various strategic initiatives. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause future results or events to differ materially from today's projections. Please refer to today's slide presentation and our SEC filings for a full explanation of those risks and uncertainties and the limits applicable to forward-looking statements. We will be referring to certain actual and projected non-GAAP financial measures to supplement investors' understanding and assessment of our financial performance. Reconciliations of those non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website and in the appendix of today's slide presentation. An archived copy of today's presentation and other earnings materials will be available on our website at investor.viatris.com following the conclusion of today's call.\nWith that, let me welcome Robert Coury.\n\nRobert J. Coury\n\nExecutive Chairman of the Board, Mylan N.V.\n\nGood morning. When I spoke with you on November 7, I shared my excitement for all that I saw ahead for Viatris as we begin to approach the end of Phase I of our strategic plan, which, as you know, has been our setup phase. And now as we prepare to enter Phase II beginning in 2024, I am pleased to report with our eighth consecutive successful quarter of execution behind us, the rebasing of our business model is well underway. And though we are not giving guidance for 2024, I am even more confident today that we will not only generate a minimum of $2.3 billion of free cash flows, excluding transaction costs and taxes, but now also see the potential for accelerated top line growth from 2023 to 2024 as well. This is on top of the expected top line growth you saw in this morning's press release between 2022 and 2023, after excluding the full year impact of the biosimilars business in 2022.\nNow turning to the other press release you saw this morning. The Board of Directors has appointed Scott Smith as Viatris' new Chief Executive Officer, effective April 1. Scott will lead the company in the execution of our previously announce Phase II strategy. Scott has been a member of the Viatris Board since December of 2022 and is a deeply knowledgeable senior global biotechnology pharmaceutical executive with over 35 years of experience, including as a former President and Chief Operating Officer of Celgene Corporation, where he built and oversaw the clinical development, registration, launch and global commercial success of the blockbuster drug, Otezla.\nMost recently, Scott has served as the President of BioAtla, a publicly traded global biotechnology company focused on the development of conditionally active biologic antibody therapeutics. The Board view Scott as a seasoned builder who possesses vast global commercial and pharmaceutical expertise and a proven ability to build, grow and manage large complex organizations. We see his strong commercial and strategic expertise being complemented by his experience in organically building product franchises and executing business development and partnering activities.\nHe also has substantial experience in the development of regulatory and clinical strategies that bring products to market. I personally have been very impressed with Scott's overall approach to leadership, his deep industry knowledge and forward-looking business mindset. With our foundation now firmly in place and as we enter into Phase II of our strategic plan, the Board truly believes that Scott is well positioned for success as he leads the growth of Viatris in the years ahead.\nWe are excited to welcome Scott and believe that he is absolutely the right choice to lead the company into the next phase of our journey. I'd now like to turn the call over to Scott to say a few words himself. Scott?\n\nScott Smith\n\nThank you, Robert, and good morning to everybody on the call. It's an incredibly exciting time to become Viatris' CEO. I watch closely in November as the company laid out the next important steps in its well-crafted strategic plan, including its commitment to its future capital allocation priorities, which I totally support. Since then and particularly after joining the Board and seeing their incredible level of engagement, I've been extremely impressed by everyone that I've met during this process and have also been inspired by all that has been accomplished in such a short period of time.\nI strongly identify with Viatris' culture, which, when combined with the company's strategic forward-looking mindset, makes it a natural fit for me. Just as importantly, I'm also motivated by the company's strong financial profile and financial flexibility, which has one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector. I can see many additional opportunities and options for Viatris to accelerate its growth in the coming years. I believe that my franchise building, business development and recent biotech experiences, coupled with the great platform we have to work from, can accelerate Viatris' momentum and help deliver on its full value and potential.\nI would like to thank Robert and the Board for this amazing opportunity and look forward to collaborating with Michael during this transition. I am very excited about the prospect of working with the Board, Rajiv Malik, Sanjeev Narula, and the entire management team on the execution ahead. And lastly, to the company's 37,000 employees, I am honored to have the opportunity to serve each of you and look forward to working with all of you in the near future as we continue to deliver on Viatris' mission to empower people worldwide to live healthier at every stage of life.\n\nRobert J. Coury\n\nExecutive Chairman of the Board, Mylan N.V.\n\nThank you, Scott. The Board and I very much look forward to supporting Scott during the execution of our Phase II strategy. While continuing to remain focused on identifying additional opportunities to further unlock value for our shareholders. Also, as Scott mentioned, Michael will be working closely with him to support a smooth transition and will then step down as CEO and as a member of the Board of Directors on April 1 of this year. I and the Board would like to personally thank Michael for his service and his dedication during this critical time of the creation of Viatris and the establishment of the ongoing execution of our Phase I strategy.\nWe wish him nothing but the best as he moves forward. With that said, I do look forward to answering your questions in the Q&A session. But for now, I'd like to turn the call over to Michael, so he can add a few comments and then also lead the walk-through of our 2022 fourth quarter and full year earnings. Michael?\n\nMichael Goettler\n\nCEO & Executive Director, Viatris Inc.\n\nThank you, Robert. We began this journey 3.5 years ago when we first made plans to embark on an unprecedented endeavor to combine Mylan and Upjohn to get a company that would spend the divide between generic and branded medicines to more fully address patients' expectations and needs around the world. Now it's been my sincere honor to serve as Viatris' first CEO for the past 2 years. The opportunity to create a new kind of global health care company has been experienced that I will never forget.\nAnd I want to thank Robert, the entire Viatris Board of Directors, Rajiv, Sanjeev, my leadership team, but most especially all of all Viatris' colleagues around the world whose tireless effort laid the foundation for what I believe to be a truly bright future. As Viatris now embarks on its Phase II of a strategic plan, this is now a natural time for a transition. And I'm pleased to welcome Scott into Viatris, I'm looking forward to supporting him during this transition as he is now well positioned to continue to build on the company's momentum.\nAnd now, as usual, here are some highlights for 2022. Quarter 4 was another strong quarter, in line with our expectations, taking into account the Biocon transaction and IPR&D accounting. For Viatris, this is the eighth consecutive quarter of strong operational performance, closing out another strong year. In 2022, we delivered total revenue of approximately USD 16.3 billion, adjusted EBITDA of approximately USD 5.8 billion and free cash flow of approximately $2.5 billion on a reported basis at approximately $2.8 billion after adjusting for the transaction costs and taxes associated with the Biocon transition.\nThis strong performance has not only enabled us to continue to deliver on our Phase I commitments, but has also built a solid foundation, setting our company up for 2024 and beyond. Our integration plans have captured approximately $750 million in synergies to date, and we're well on track to capture at least $1 billion of cost synergies by the end of Phase I and we've exited substantially all the transitional services agreements with Pfizer.\nAs of the end of 2022, we've paid down approximately $3.3 billion for the year-end debt and approximately $5.4 billion since the beginning of 2021. We continue to exercise financial discipline, maintaining our investment-grade rating and continuing to reduce our gross leverage towards our long-term target of 3x. We're returning capital to shareholders. Our Board of Directors just has approved a 2023 dividend policy of $0.48 per share and has declared a first quarter dividend of $0.12 per share.\nAnd cumulatively, since the formation of Viatris, we've already returned nearly $1 billion to shareholders through dividend payments alone. In January and February of this year, we've executed $250 million of our $1 billion share repurchase authorization. Now combined with the projected annual dividend, this represents an increase to date of more than 40% in return to shareholders over 2022 or put it another way, 33% of the midpoint of our free cash flow guidance for 2023.\nIn addition to that, we're continuing to execute on our plans to reshape our company for the future. In November, we completed our transaction with Biocon Biologics to create what we expect to be a unique, fully integrated global biosimilars leader. And as we provide transitional services to Biocon, we're deeply committed to doing our power to help Biocon Biologics succeed.\nIn January, we completed the acquisitions of Oyster Point Pharma and Famy Life Sciences to establish our new Viatris Eye Care division. And as we said, we anticipate the combined assets of these acquisitions to add to the top line immediately and growing strong double digits from there, reaching at least $1 billion in sales by 2028. Coupled with the strength of our organic pipeline, especially our complex injectables and novel product franchises, both of which also have the potential to reach $1 billion in peak net sales each by 2028.\nThis kind of business transaction is a very important component of our strategy. And finally, we remain on track to execute our planned and announced divestitures. Today, we'll also be sharing the 2023 full year guidance ranges for total revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow, which Sanjeev will give more details on in a moment.\nLet me summarize. By being laser-focused on our Phase I priorities, integrating the 2 organizations, generating $1 billion in cost synergies, deleveraging the balance sheet and strengthening the balance sheet, paying down at least $6.5 billion in debt, reducing our gross leverage towards our long-term target of 3x, maintaining our investment-grade credit rating, returning capital to shareholders through quarterly dividends and the share repurchase programs and reshaping the company through key divestitures and acquisitions, we are successfully stabilizing the business.\nAnd as a result, although we're not giving guidance beyond 2023, we're confident in our expectation that 2024 will begin a period of renewed growth for Viatris and generate at least $2.3 billion in free cash flows per year, excluding transaction costs and taxes, of which we intend to earmark approximately 50% annually to be returned to shareholders in form of dividends or share repurchases.\nAnd now for one final time, let me turn it over to Rajiv and Sanjeev to share more details. Rajiv?\n\nRajiv Malik\n\nPresident & Executive Director, Mylan NV\n\nThanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. 2022 was another solid year of business execution and performance. We met our stated commitments, including delivering the pipeline, integrating and capturing synergies and most importantly, stabilizing the base business. We are really excited with how we see 2023 shaping up, and nothing has changed from what we shared with you on November 7 as we prepare for 2024. Our path to return to growth in Phase II is clear announced about continued execution, which is what we do best. One of the key drivers behind the stability of our business is the understanding and effective management of our established brands. This was further evidenced by the better-than-expected performance of this category in 2022, driven by year-over-year growth from brands like Creon, Lipitor, Celebrex, Dymista and Yupelri, while Norvasc and Amitiza and Effexor held their ground. We expect this stabilization to continue into 2023 and beyond.\nLet me now turn to the commercial segments and our expectations for this year. I will be making certain comparisons to 2022 results on a constant currency basis, which excludes the negative impact of foreign exchange as well as excluding the biosimilars business from 2022. Our 2023 business is on a growth path. We expect to deliver approximately $500 million in new launches, plus $56 million in revenue from Tyrvaya, which more than offsets 2.9% erosion of our base business.\nAs Robert mentioned in his prepared remarks, while we are not giving guidance beyond 2023, we see the potential for accelerated top line growth as we go into 2024 and beyond. Developed Markets grew by 1% in 2022 on the strength of European growth, offsetting the decline in North America. For '23, we expect this segment to remain flattish. Europe grew by 4%, primarily driven by the stability of our Branded business, new launches and a strong performance from countries like France and Italy.\nIn 2023, we believe we are well positioned to further grow this region by 3%, led by brands like Creon, Influvac, Lipitor and our thrombosis portfolio. In North America, despite the solid performance of Yupelri, the business declined by 4% as we navigated the competitive headwinds on key products like Wixela and loss of exclusivity on Miacalcin and Perforomist. We project Yupelri to continue to have strong double-digit growth in 2023, which will help offset the continued competitive pressures on certain key products.\nThese market dynamics will be the primary reasons for our expectation of an approximate 3% decline in 2023. That said, we are excited and look forward to bringing several new products, including generic Symbicort to market this year. Greater China again performed strongly and grew by 3% year-over-year, despite COVID lockdowns in this region. Our hospital business performed relatively better than retail. We believe China has significantly improved the cost efficiency of the medical reimbursement funds while achieving their goals of providing the broader coverage of health care to its population through the successful implementation of VBP and other policies.\nAt the same time, market has evolved towards publicly reimbursed channel and private paid channels. We have made significant progress in adapting our business model to the evolving market dynamics while focusing on value-added activities to help patients manage their chronic disease states more effectively. These investments are helping us expand the private pay market and also leverage our brand equity in this channel. Keeping in mind the evolving policy framework, we have modeled a small year-over-year decline for 2023.\nEmerging Markets performed in line with expectations and benefited from a solid performance of the overall branded business, led by markets such as Middle East, Turkey and Korea. Going into '23, we are projecting this segment to grow by 4% year-over-year, primarily driven by our branded business. Our Gen segment performed in line with our expectations while continuing to be impacted by the government driven price regulations in this region. While our brand Creon grew both in volume and value, our other 2 key brands, Amitiza and Effexor showed solid volume growth in 2022. We anticipate strong volume growth to the continue for our key brands for '23. This segment is expected to decline by 4% in 2023.\nNow let me turn to our newly formed Eye Care division. We are pleased with the tailwinds that we expect with Tyrvaya in 2023. Since the beginning of this year, Medicare Part D coverage has grown from 2% to 32.5% of covered lives . We also launched a 90-day script program, and we are already seeing an uptick in the total prescriptions midway through this high deductible period of the year. We are significantly investing in the business and intend to launch a direct-to-consumer campaign in the fourth quarter of this year that is anticipated to start delivering results in early 2024.\nSwitching to our deep eye care pipeline. Our NDA review for reversal of mydriasis program was accepted and has been granted a PDUFA date of September 28 of this year. We have made the decision to terminate our Stage 1 neurotrophic keratopathy program because it failed to meet the primary endpoint in the Phase II OlympiA study. We have started enrollment in the first pivotal Phase III trial for presbyopia and are also on track to initiate the first Phase III study for the treatment of blepharitis in 2023.\nWith the positive momentum of Tyrvaya and continued progress in our pipeline, we remain confident that our Eye care division will deliver $1 billion in net sales by 2028. 2022 was a very productive year from a science perspective. We are very pleased with the progress of our complex injectable pipeline. Currently, we have 10 ANDAs under review with FDA and have secured several first-to-market generic product opportunities such as Sandostatin LAR, Ozempic, Wegovy and Abilify Maintena. We expect to file a number of complex injectables in 2023, including MR-117 for the treatment of breast cancer, MR-150 indicated for use in the iron deficient anemia and MR-151 for the use in the treatment of certain bleeding disorders.\nOur novel and complex product programs have also progressed well in 2022. As you are aware, our partner, Mapi, has successfully completed the Phase III trial for our glatiramer once monthly, and we are on track to submit this NDA to FDA by this April. We have also initiated a Phase III trial for expanding the indication of Effexor ER in Japan and have also made good progress on the recruitment of subjects into our Xulane Low Dose clinical program.\nLooking ahead into '23, we believe we are well positioned to initiate Phase III trial for our meloxicam rapid onset of action dosage form, which we believe has opioid sparing attributes. We also remain on track to initiate our clinical program for our biosimilar to Botox later this year.\nFor our core and complex generics, we made over 100 additional submissions globally in 2022, and we expect to see this trend continue through 2023. Our program for complex generic MR-153 indicated for treatment of type 2 diabetes and MR-154 indicated for the treatment of SMA are well on track. For China, 8 products were filed with FDA in 2022, including generic Symbicort. And we plan to submit additional 10 products this year in China.\nOur operations had yet another year of solid performance, delivering high customer service levels, and we see this strength continuing throughout 2023. From an integration point of view, we were able to exit substantially all the transition services with Pfizer in 2022 and are well on our path to achieve $1 billion in cost synergies by end of this year. Before I conclude, I would like to thank our colleagues for their hard work and commitment that delivered another year of strong performance.\nWith that, I will now hand the call over to Sanjeev.\n\nSanjeev Narula\n\nCFO, Viatris Inc.\n\nThank you, Rajiv, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with what you heard from Robert, in particular as it relates to 2024. We continue to feel confident about the starting point for Phase II as communicated in November of last year, and nothing has changed from then to now. As mentioned, although we are not giving guidance beyond 2023, we expect to have at least $2.3 billion in free cash flow from the underlying business in 2024 before any divestment, cost and taxes.\nThis reflects the expected cash flow generation after removing the planned divestiture. 2022 was another strong year for the company, enabling us to deliver on our Phase I commitment while further investing in our business. We're taking bold steps in reshaping the company and remain confident in our strategy to return to growth in Phase II.\nMoving to Slide 26. We finished the year on a strong note across total revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow and results were in line with our expectations. Recall that our previous guidance included full year contribution from biosimilar business. As a result, because of the Biocon transaction closing in late November, we're adjusting our guidance down by approximately $86 million in total revenue, $31 million in adjusted EBITDA and $20 million in free cash flow relating to the exclusion of results since closing.\nAlso impacting adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow was $36 million of acquired IPR&D, which was not included in the guidance. Free cash flow also impacted by $254 million of transaction costs and taxes related to the Biocon transaction. Excluding this impact, free cash flow would have been $2.8 billion on a full year basis.\nNow turning to Slide 27. Revenue was impacted by foreign exchange, given our significant international operation. Excluding this impact, we're encouraged by the operational stability and diversification of our global portfolio. As mentioned on the third quarter call, we anticipated adjusted gross margin to moderate in Q4 due to continued inflationary headwinds and product mix. On a full year basis, adjusted gross margin came in at the high end of our expectation at 58.9%, driven by strong brand performance.\nAdjusted SG&A and adjusted R&D came in line with our expectations and included certain investments we made in Q4 to support our 2023 plan. We had a very strong year of cash flow generation, reflecting our underlying operational performance and continued organizational priority on cash optimization initiatives. As mentioned before, free cash flow in fourth quarter was impacted by Biocon transaction. And excluding this would have been $243 million in Q4 2022.\nSlide 28 illustrates the uses of the upfront cash proceeds received upon the closing of Biocon transaction. It is important to note that the gross proceeds of approximately $2 billion are included in the cash flow from investing activities, while the related tax and transaction costs are included as negative cash flows from the operating activities. The net proceeds serve to accelerate debt pay down, fund the eye care acquisition and execute on share repurchase in Q1 2023.\nSlide 29 illustrates the continued prioritization of debt pay down, which has resulted in total pay down of approximately $5.4 billion over the last 8 quarters. As a result, and irrespective of the divestiture proceeds, we expect to meet our commitment of paying down at least $6.5 billion during Phase I. We exited 2022 with a gross average of approximately 3.2x. These deliberate actions taken by the company reinforce our commitment to the investment-grade rating.\nAnother priority is returning capital to our shareholders, which included approximately $580 million in dividend in 2022 and more than $980 million since the beginning of 2021.\nSlide 31 and 32 speak to the assumptions and guidance for 2023, which we expect to be a bridge year to get to our starting point in 2024. In 2023, we expect continued strengthening of our financial profile, which includes our expectation that total revenue will grow versus 2022, excluding the contribution of biosimilar.\nInvestment into Eye Care division and our strong pipeline for future growth. Another strong year of expected free cash flow generation and our capital allocation framework, which includes debt paydown and significantly enhanced capital return to our shareholders. As previously mentioned, the timing of planned divestiture may create fluctuation in our future reported results. The guidance we presented today includes the anticipated full year performance of businesses that we expect to divest.\nSimilar to Biocon transaction, we will provide as much transparency as possible on the expected impact to our guidance and results as and when these transactions are announced. As it relates to key metrics, we expect slight moderation in our gross margin relative to 2022 levels. This includes the expected pricing impact on key products, base business erosion and the continued inflation impact. With respect to acquired IPR&D, we do not include any amount in our guidance related to unsigned deal.\nNow let me explain the anticipated phasing for this year. We expect total revenue and adjusted EBITDA to be higher in the second half, due to ramp up new products and normal product seasonality. Specifically, we expect Q1 to be the lowest quarter for the total revenue and adjusted EBITDA. We estimated free cash flow will be evenly weighted between first half and second half.\nIn general, Q2 and Q4 tend to be lower due to timing of semiannual interest payments. It is important to note in the revenue guidance walk on Slide 33, the 2022 adjusted number of $15.65 billion excludes the 11-month biosimilar revenue included in our reported results. On a comparable basis, at the midpoint of revenue guidance, we expect total revenue of the underlying business will grow in 2023.\nBased on January FX rate, full year guidance assumes minimum foreign exchange impact on total revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. We remain encouraged by the operational performance of our segment, stability in global brands and expectation of approximately $500 million in new launches. In addition, we expect $56 million in revenue from Tyrvaya of our new eye care product.\nOn Slide 34 are few items that will impact adjusted EBITDA. First, we expect adjusted gross margin to be impacted from continued competition on key products. Next, adjusted gross margin of new products is expected to be above the company average. Third, we're investing in Eye Care division, which includes commercial infrastructure and DTC investment in the second half of the year. We're making further investment to advance the deep Phase III ready eye care pipeline. And lastly, other bucket includes the impact of continued inflation and investment with some offsetting benefit, including synergies.\nTurning to Slide 35. We expect another strong year of free cash flow generation as a result of expected lower onetime cash cost and continued focus on cash optimization initiatives.\nOn Slide 36, I will now turn to our financial commitment, including return of capital to shareholders. To start, we have completed $250 million of share buyback out of the previously announced $1 billion repurchase authorization. In addition, we anticipate an annual dividend of $0.48 per share.\nTaken together, this will increase our capital return by over 40% versus 2022. This represents a minimum payout of approximately 33% of the midpoint of free cash flow guidance. In addition to capital return, we will continue to prioritize debt reduction and expect to pay down our scheduled maturity of $1.3 billion in 2023, and thereby, we expect to deliver on our commitment of $6.5 billion of debt paydown in Phase I.\nThis is irrespective of proceeds from the divestiture. This is continued evidence of progress towards our stated gross leverage target of 3x. Within an extraordinarily strong financial position and are benefiting from our investment-grade rating in this rising interest rate environment. With nearly all of our capital structure being fixed rate, we expect interest expense for 2023 to be flat versus 2022.\nIn closing, we are well positioned for a strong start in 2023, which we considered our bridge year. The reshaping initiative will serve to strengthen the company and set us up well heading into 2024 and beyond.\nWith that, I will hand it back to the operator to begin Q&As."

My name is Gretchen, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Viatris 2022 Third Quarter Earnings Call and Webcast. (Operator Instructions) Thank you.\nI will now turn the call over to Bill Szablewski, Head of Global Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nWilliam Szablewski\n\nHead of Capital Markets, Viatris Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone.\nDuring today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements on a number of matters, including our financial guidance for 2022, various strategic initiatives in our Phase I and Phase II outlooks. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause future results or events to differ materially from today's projections. Please refer to today's presentations and our SEC filings for a full explanation of these risks and uncertainties and the limits applicable to forward-looking statements, including certain assumptions and risks related to the Phase I and Phase II outlooks.\nWe will be referring to certain actual and projected non-GAAP financial metrics to supplement investors' understanding and assessment of our financial performance. Reconciliations of those non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website and in the appendix of today's slide presentations. A copy of today's presentation and other earnings materials will be available on our website at investor.viatris.com following this call.\nNow I'd like to turn it over to our Executive Chairman, Robert Coury.\n\nRobert J. Coury\n\nExecutive Chairman of the Board, Mylan N.V.\n\nGood morning. Almost 2 years ago today, we brought together 2 great complementary organizations to form a new company, Viatris, with the purpose of creating a sustainable global health care leader. Under the leadership of our Board of Directors, along with management, we laid out a very clear and deliberate strategy to build a highly diversified company with multiple capabilities spanning numerous geographies and therapeutic areas.\nAt that time, we established a 2-phase road map that detailed and emphasized our strategic priorities to deliver value to our shareholders. Phase 1 has always been designed as our setup phase for Viatris. It is about building a rock-solid foundation setting us up for Phase 2, which is expected to be a period of renewed growth and leadership in our sector.\nUp until now, we have been laser-focused on executing on Phase 1, consisting of the years 2021 through 2023. In doing so, our priorities have been clear: integrate the 2 organizations, generate $1 billion in cost synergies, deleverage the balance sheet, pay down at least $6.5 billion in debt, reduce our gross leverage to our long-term target ratio of 3x and maintain our investment-grade rating, all while returning capital to our shareholders.\nToday, here's where we stand. First, we continue to execute on our integration plans and are well on track to capturing at least $1 billion of cost synergies by the end of Phase 1. Second, we continue to exercise our financial discipline and intend to keep our investment-grade rating.\nThird, we paid down $4.2 billion in debt since the beginning of 2021 and are on track to paying down at least $6.5 billion by the end of Phase 1. And lastly, we returned capital to shareholders beginning in 2021 with our inaugural dividend, growing the dividend by 9% in 2022 given our strong cash flow generation and plan to add to such return through the execution of our share repurchase plan.\nAll of this while delivering on the seventh straight quarter of strong operating results despite many industry headwinds, including inflationary pressures and a negative impact that we estimate to be approximately $1.3 billion year-over-year for 2022 to the top line as a result of the material effects of adverse foreign exchange movements. We anticipate that Viatris' second full year results will only further demonstrate the strength and robustness of our business.\nThis past February, we announced a strategically important transaction with Biocon Biologics regarding our biosimilars franchise, which we anticipate will close shortly. We also reported strong results on our first year of operations as well as announced, after careful analysis, the economics and proceeds that we anticipate receiving through other potential divestitures. I will give more detail and speak more about these potential divestitures shortly.\nBut first, while we will remain therapeutic-agnostic overall, we announced this morning 2 acquisitions consistent with one of our previously announced therapeutic areas of emphasis: ophthalmology. We anticipate the combined assets of these acquisitions to add to the top line immediately and grow in strong double digits from there, potentially reaching to at least $1 billion in sales by 2028.\nAs a result of the expected strong top line growth, we anticipate these acquisitions will also add at least $500 million in adjusted EBITDA by 2028 as well. The aggregate purchase price for the acquisitions is approximately $700 million to $750 million, which we expect to fund with cash on hand upon closing. Michael and Rajiv will discuss more about this in their prepared remarks.\nFurthermore, given that we believe that our shares are significantly undervalued, our view is that, in addition to investing in growth assets, repurchasing our shares is another one of the best uses of our cash. Therefore, we intend to increase our return of capital to shareholders not only through the continuation of our dividend, but also following the receipt of the proceeds of the Biocon Biologics transaction, we intend to begin executing in 2023 on the $1 billion stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors earlier this year.\nAnd now with almost 2 years of operations under our belt, we are even more confident in the strength of our platform and can more fully address a number of important questions that we have received from investors since our last investor update. These include: one, further details on our planned divestitures; two, the stability of our base business post Phase 1; three, our future capital allocation priorities and plans for Phase 2; four, how we will return our business back to growth; and lastly, confidence in our ability to ultimately execute on all actions that we have outlined to date.\nI will start with our announced divestitures. In February, management provided commentary with respect to our planned divestitures. We currently expect approximately $5 billion to $6 billion in pretax proceeds in addition to the proceeds expected from the sale of our biosimilars business.\nIn order to fully address the stability and outlook of our current base business in Phase 2, 2024 and beyond, I will need to identify for you additional detail on the planned assets to be divested. It is important to note that these identified assets, which once were core assets to us in the past based on where we were in our business life cycle then, but have been now determined not to be core assets today based on where we are taking Viatris on a going-forward basis, which is continuing to move up the value chain.\nSimilar to our biosimilars transaction, we believe some additional benefits of divesting these noncore assets are reduced SG&A costs, reduced capital expenditures, and the aggregate average gross margin profile of these assets is lower than the company's current gross margin as a whole.\nThe noncore assets that have been identified and that we intend to divest are as follows: one, our OTC business; two, our women's health care business; three, our active pharmaceutical ingredients business, or API, but retaining some selective development API capabilities; and lastly, certain geographical markets that were part of the combination with Upjohn's business that are smaller in nature and in which we had no established infrastructure prior to or following the transaction. We expect to complete these planned divestitures by the end of 2023 and also expect the proceeds to provide additional significant financial flexibility for both our Phase 1 and Phase 2 commitments.\nNow that I've addressed our divestiture plans, let me provide some additional detail on the outlook of our current business in Phase 2. My comments will refer to the base business from that point going forward, but before any positive impact of the 2 acquisitions we announced this morning, unless otherwise indicated.\nWe believe that our base business will be well positioned to deliver 1% top line growth long term. This is supported primarily by our strong internal organic pipeline for our new product launches. We expect our strong pipeline alone to more than offset our annual base business erosion, which we now expect to be 2% to 3% beginning in Phase 2 versus previously forecasted 4% to 5% that we modeled for Phase 1. Rajiv will provide more details later.\nAdditionally, when including the potential financial impact of the 2 acquisitions announced this morning, which we expect will only be additive to our growth, we are targeting towards Phase 2 a top line total revenue CAGR of approximately 3%, adjusted EBITDA CAGR of approximately 4% to 5% and, most importantly, an adjusted earnings per share CAGR of approximately mid-teens.\nNote that while these CAGRs include acquisitions announced this morning, they do not take into consideration the positive impact of any future business development or M&A. These targets reflect our commitment to executing and delivering growth to our business only using the assets that we already have in-house, a continuation of paying down debt and thereby decreasing net interest expenses and, most importantly, returning capital to shareholders through our anticipated future share repurchases plans, which I will discuss shortly.\nFor modeling purposes, you should consider 2 adjustments in exchange for the additional $8 billion to $9 billion of aggregate pretax proceeds we anticipate to receive by the end of 2023 or shortly thereafter from all our divestitures, including our biosimilars business.\nTherefore, as we enter Phase 2 beginning in 2024, you should think about making the following adjustments where we see ourselves for 2022: first, an adjustment of $2.1 billion in revenues and $700 million in adjusted EBITDA to reflect our 4 planned divestitures just mentioned, including our biosimilars business; and two, an adjustment of approximately $300 million in increased R&D expenses, partly due to the impact of the recent SEC guidelines for licensing deals that were previously excluded from adjusted EBITDA but will be included in the future.\nAlso in that number are some continuing development expenses for the 2 acquisitions announced this morning, which will drive our continued long-term growth. Although we are not giving any official guidance today beyond 2022, these adjustments have taken into consideration the remaining actions that need to be taken on our divestitures as well as other expected pushes and pulls in 2023 as we reshape and rebase Viatris.\nNow turning to our future capital allocation priorities. For Phase 2 beginning in 2024, we expect to reshape and rebase Viatris to generate at least $2.3 billion of free cash flows per year, excluding transactions, costs and taxes, of which we intend to earmark 50% annually to be returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and future share repurchases. With the remaining approximately 50%, we do intend to identify and be able to reinvest further into our business organically and inorganically with value-creating, financially accretive, bolt-on transactions and other potential transactions that fit the mold of what we announced this morning.\nWe are excited as we begin to approach the end of Phase 1 and enter Phase 2 of our strategic plan. After reporting on 7 straight strong quarters, we are hopeful that the market will increasingly begin to recognize the value of our strong balance sheet, our ability to generate strong cash flows, our ability to return capital to shareholders through our dividend and especially now with our commitment to future share repurchase plans given the tremendous undervaluation in our security shown by our current P/E multiple.\nNow in terms of adding to the growth of our base business, when we laid out our strategic vision at our February investor event, we discussed business development in the areas of ophthalmology, GI, dermatology as an important complementary vehicle to drive inorganic growth for our company. As Michael and Rajiv will elaborate later, we believe that the acquisitions of Oyster Point and Famy Life Sciences are excellent examples that will establish for Viatris a strong foundation for a leading ophthalmology franchise.\nWe expect these acquisitions over time to be substantially additive to both our top line and bottom line. And on a stand-alone basis, when combined with our commitment to begin repurchasing our shares, we expect these acquisitions to be adjusted earnings per share accretive in 2023.\nI would like to personally welcome Dr. Jeffrey Nau, CEO of Oyster Point Pharma who, upon closing, will be the newest member of Viatris' management team and who will be introducing himself and speaking to you shortly. Dr. Nau will be leading our new ophthalmology franchise at Viatris along with his talented and seasoned management team. We have been keenly impressed by Jeff and his team's accomplishments and especially Jeff's leadership and vision. We are confident that their talent and expertise will be a great asset to Viatris following the closing of the acquisition of Oyster Point Pharma and the complementary acquisition of Famy Life Sciences.\nIn terms of the confidence in our ability to execute on all the actions that we have just detailed, when you consider the tremendous operational and financial progress that we have made over the past 2 years despite a challenging external backdrop, there is no stronger testament to our entire company's ability and capabilities to successfully execute on all facets of our plan than delivering the consistent results that we have.\nAnother notable achievement in our continuing successful integration is having been able to exit substantially all the transition services with Pfizer last month. And for all of this, the Board of Directors would like to thank the senior management team and all of our approximately 37,000 employees around the globe for their unwavering commitment, dedication and performance, especially towards some of the toughest years in this industry, including taking on the global fight against COVID.\nBefore I conclude my prepared remarks, I would like to provide to the broader investment community a few items from our perspective that might be self-evident but underappreciated. One, how truly differentiated our company is amongst many of our peers. I believe that it sometimes gets lost on the investment community that we are no longer just a U.S. generics and specialty pharmaceutical company that is materially exposed to all of the volatility and the level of erosion that exists in the U.S. market.\nIn fact, only $1.8 billion out of an estimated $16.5 billion of our estimated sales in 2022 will represent the total sales of our generics in the U.S. We have deliberately taken steps to minimize such exposure by derisking our business model in the United States through geographical expansion and also by moving up the value chain with more highly complex products launched in the United States and elsewhere where our products would be differentiated and with a better financial analog.\nTwo, Viatris is the only U.S. company with an investment-grade credit rating amongst our peers, which we believe is significant and meaningful especially in today's environment. Three, with one of the strongest balance sheets amongst our peers and significant cash flows, we have significant financial flexibility, which we believe positions us to be able to quickly adapt and adjust to the ever-changing global health care environment. And four, we have one of the lowest gross leverage ratios amongst our peers.\nFive, we will be returning a quantum capital to shareholders through what we believe is an attractive dividend and soon through share repurchases. Six, the Board will continue to look at opportunities to add or even further unlock value when and where we see opportunities. And lastly, we represent a unique opportunity for the investment community to participate in what we expect to soon be a strong adjusted earnings per share growth story.\nSimply put, once our business is rebased, we feel very confident in our future prospects for where we believe we will be able to deliver top line growth, adjusted EBITDA growth and adjusted earnings per share growth. And with our significant cash flow generation, we expect to be able to return capital to shareholders through dividends and especially through share repurchases.\nWith that, and before I turn the call over to Michael, Rajiv and Sanjeev, I would like to note that following the call today, we will be commencing our annual shareholder outreach program. So please look forward to hearing from us in the coming weeks. Thank you, and especially thank you for your interest in Viatris. I look forward to answering your questions during our Q&A period.\nI will now turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael Goettler\n\nCEO & Executive Director, Viatris Inc.\n\nThank you, Robert. Now following your detailed outline, let me go directly to today's acquisition announcement and a high-level overview of our Q3 results.\nIn February, we announced 3 therapeutic areas of focus for moving up the value chain with NCEs and 505(b)2s, and that included ophthalmology. We believe that the 2 ophthalmology acquisitions which we're announcing today, Oyster Point Pharma and Famy Life Sciences, give us a significant head start in creating an ophthalmology franchise within the company that will set a strong foundation for what we expect to be a future ophthalmology leader and in accelerating our strategy to move up the value chain. The total cash consideration for both acquisitions, including equity and debt, will be between $700 million and $750 million.\nI'm excited about the assets, the talent, the expertise and the capabilities which we're bringing into the company with these acquisitions. Oyster Point will provide us with an exciting commercial-stage growth asset, Tyrvaya, the first and only FDA-approved nasal spray for signs and symptoms of dry eye disease with a unique and novel mechanism of action, activating the trigeminal parasympathetic pathway to increase the production of the patient's own natural tear film.\nTyrvaya was launched in November 2021, and patients and physician feedback is very encouraging. Dry eye disease is an area of major unmet medical need, affecting approximately 17 million patients in the U.S. alone. And we're excited to bring an important innovation like Tyrvaya to more patients and more countries, consistent with our mission to empower patients worldwide to live healthy at every stage of life regardless of geography or circumstances.\nClinical development is also ongoing to expand Tyrvaya into further indications such as neurotrophic keratopathy. In addition to that, the Famy Life Sciences acquisition will add 5 additional Phase III or Phase III-ready front-of-the-eye programs in various indications. We believe Tyrvaya and these front-of-the-eye ophthalmology assets could potentially have combined annual revenue of at least USD 1 billion by 2028.\nTogether with our own capabilities, we believe we'll have everything we need to set the foundation to become the next global ophthalmology leader. The entire management team and I look forward to working with Dr. Jeffrey Nau, who will be leading this effort, and his talented team as we build a leadership position in ophthalmology and as we execute to make this area one of several billion-dollar growth drivers for Viatris.\nAs you can see, and consistent with our strategy which we announced in February, we continue to make important strides to reshape Viatris and we believe we have a clear, defined path to return our company to top and bottom line growth for 2024 and beyond and to have the necessary financial flexibility to return significant capital to our shareholders as well as to continued business development.\nAnd this all would not be possible without the solid performance in our current business and focused execution of our integration and reshaping plans. We now have a track record of 7 quarters of consistent and strong business performance. And for the third quarter of 2022, we delivered total revenue of USD 4.08 billion, adjusted EBITDA of USD 1.5 billion and free cash flow of USD 765 million.\nOur teams across the world are highly engaged and are performing at peak levels. Our pipeline continues to deliver, especially in the area of complex generics and injectables. We added USD 144 million in new product revenue in the quarter 3.\nThe year-to-date performance is operationally in line or better than our own expectations and we believe enables us to continue to deliver on our Phase 1 financial commitments. Notably, we have paid down approximately $2.1 billion in debt year-to-date in 2022 and approximately $4.2 billion since the beginning of 2021, putting us squarely on track for our target to pay down USD 6.5 billion by the end of 2023.\nOur Board of Directors has declared another quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share. Cumulatively, since the formation of Viatris, we've already returned more than $800 million to shareholders through dividend payments.\nWe are reaffirming, again, our most recent 2022 full year guidance ranges for total revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow, driven by solid operating momentum and in spite of further increased foreign exchange headwinds. As Robert has already clearly indicated, we are confident in the outlook and future growth potential of Viatris.\nThe key tenets for that confidence are: the strength and market dynamics of our remaining base business after the main divestitures; our base business stabilizing the results of business transformation and portfolio choices we have made in the past years as well as solid performance of our branded portfolio; the strength of our pipeline, especially with complex generics and complex injectables as well as novel products, 505(b)(2)s and NCEs; and the expectation of our growing ophthalmology franchise upon completion of the acquisitions.\nWith that, I would like now to hand it over to Rajiv to give further details on the Q3 performance and the outlook of our business going forward. Rajiv?\n\nRajiv Malik\n\nPresident & Executive Director, Mylan NV\n\nThanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. I'm very proud of what we have accomplished in our last 2 years as Viatris. We have executed 7 consecutive quarters of strong performance, underscoring the underlying strength of our diversified base business.\nLet me begin with brief commentary about our strong third quarter operational results. On an operational basis, we were down 1% year-over-year for the quarter. Every segment performed solidly versus our expectations, including China, despite COVID headwinds. Our Generics segment in Developed Markets benefited from the launch of lenalidomide in North America.\nOverall, our Brands grew 1% year-over-year on an operational basis in the quarter and performed better than expected, led by Lipitor, Brufen and Creon. Our resilient global operations once again delivered excellent customer service levels while we weather increasing headwinds from inflation.\nMoving to integration. We successfully completed our remaining SAP cutovers from Pfizer, and we have now substantially exited all of the remaining transition services. For the full year '22, we now expect to deliver approximately $525 million in new product launch revenue with better-than-expected margins, but below our expectations due to the timing of certain launches.\nAnd on the R&D front, we crossed a major milestone with the announcement of positive top line results from our GA Depot Phase III clinical trial along with our partner, Mapi. We remain on track for our submission to FDA in quarter 1 '23.\nNow turning to the next slide. I want to remind you of our operational priorities for Phase 1. We are well on our way to integrate and synergize, stabilize the base business and deliver the pipeline. In addition, we are on track to complete the planned divestitures by the end of '23. We believe these achievements position Viatris well for the future growth.\nFlipping to the next slide. As we look ahead to Phase 2, our priorities are to continue to optimize and minimize total base business erosion; further enhance our existing durable, higher-margin organic pipeline to offset base erosion; maximize the execution of our ophthalmics franchise; and identify and add inorganic opportunities to further accelerate the growth.\nNow on the next slide, I'll walk you through some details behind what is driving our total base erosion improvements. Recall, we originally modeled our total base erosion in Phase 1 to be about 4% to 5%. Based on our better-than-expected Brands performance and combined with other key catalysts, we believe the total erosion for Phase 2 is expected to improve by 200 basis points, getting us to the 2% to 3% of total erosion range.\nTurning to the next slide. Our Brands business, excluding China, will make up slightly more than 50% of the portfolio. Prior to formation of Viatris, our combined Brands were trending at approximately 6% erosion. At the launch of Viatris, we modeled approximately 4.5% to 5.5% brand erosion based on that trend. But as a result of our ability to effectively manage the Brands business, we have been able to contain this erosion to 1.5% to 2.5% over the last 7 quarters.\nThe line graph on the right depicting our total Brands sales, excluding China, from 2017 to this quarter, is an insightful visual. Our business operating model completely changed and stabilized the trajectory of our expected erosion. And we expect this improvement to continue in Phase 2, which will potentially contribute an uplift of 150 basis points to our total base erosion.\nThe next slide lists some other key contributors to our total erosion improvement and stabilization of the core in Phase 2, which we expect to contribute an additional 50 basis points. These include no additional significant LOEs on the horizon; our purposeful diversification of our core generics portfolio, which is now repositioned towards complex products; our decreased dependency on the commoditized U.S. generics market, today, the total U.S. generics portfolio contributes approximately 11% of total net sales; and the anticipated divestitures of certain noncore assets which, once completed, will not only help simplify the company, but will also help to further stabilize the remaining business.\nWe believe that our ability to minimize the total base erosion when combined with our current organic pipeline lays a solid foundation for us to return to growth in Phase 2, which I will cover on the next few slides. Our current pipeline, which is driven largely by the U.S. market, consists of an increasing number of complex, hard-to-make products with a higher barrier to entry as well as fewer number of partner programs.\nIn addition to this, some other key geographies like China, Europe and the rest of the world markets will also benefit from the efforts of the last few years because of their dedicated and focused programs to build their pipeline. We expect Europe to have $100 million to $150 million of new product revenue every year and China to get the benefit of close to $100 million every year from '25 onwards.\nAs Robert said, we have certain underappreciated assets in our pipeline that we have invested in during the recent past. We anticipate our complex injectables and select novel products to each make up at least $1 billion in peak annual net sales in Phase 2. Given all of these pieces, we feel confident to deliver $450 million to $550 million of annual new product revenue.\nOn the next 2 slides, I'll share more about our complex injectables. Our science team has successfully developed several technology platforms including, but not limited to, nano-particles, microspheres, liposomes and nano-emulsions. We expect these platforms to deliver a strong portfolio of approximately 40 products, 10 of which are already filed and under review with FDA. This portfolio represents a rapidly growing $50 billion to $60 billion growing market. Perhaps a generic Copaxone analog as a reference is the closest to help model these products.\nI would like to highlight the pipeline chart on the next slide. Of the 10 products which are already under review with the FDA, we are confident that we will be the first to market with 7 generics, including Abilify Maintena, Invega Trinza and Sandostatin LAR. On a risk-adjusted basis, we believe these complex injectables franchise represents at least a $1 billion peak net sales opportunity in Phase 2.\nTurning to the next slide. Another growth catalyst of our organic pipeline is our novel products franchise with several 505(b)2s. We expect products like GA once-monthly and our novel meloxicam formulation will have patent protection. Additional in our products on the slide includes Xulane Low Dose and Effexor GAD. This chart also highlights our continued pursuit of highly complex products like the biosimilar to Botox. On a risk-adjusted basis, we believe these 5 select assets alone represent at least $1 billion peak net sales opportunity in Phase 2.\nNow let me move on to the great news we announced today. We have taken a major step to create an ophthalmics franchise. I want to echo the excitement you heard from Robert and Michael about the future addition of Oyster Point and Famy Life Sciences to Viatris family. Let me walk you through the strategic rationale for bringing these foundational assets together.\nOyster Point brings to Viatris not only a novel marketed dry eye product in the U.S., but more importantly, a very experienced team that possesses deep knowledge of the ophthalmic space from a clinical, medical, regulatory and commercial perspective. Further, when combining Oyster Point to the Famy Life Sciences pipeline and our global commercial footprint, R&D and regulatory capabilities, we believe that we are setting the foundation to become the next global ophthalmic leader.\nMoving to the next slide, I'm more excited that in addition to Tyrvaya, we are getting to start with a combined pipeline of exciting complementary programs, which include additional indications like neurotrophic keratopathy and 5 Phase III-ready programs we are acquiring from Famy Life Sciences. This combined global pipeline has the potential of net sales of more than $1 billion on a risk-adjusted basis by 2028. As we close this transaction, the ophthalmics franchise will function as a separate division within the company and will be led by Dr. Jeff Nau.\nIn summary, as I walked you through this morning, we believe we are well positioned to bring Viatris back to growth in Phase 2. We remain confident in our ability to contain erosion to 2% to 3% and generate $450 million to $550 million in new product revenue annually, which we expect will not only offset the erosion, but enable us to generate a 1% organic top line CAGR growth of the base in Phase 2. Maximizing and executing our ophthalmic strategy will help us reach a total revenue CAGR of approximately 3% from '24 to '28. Further, it's worth noting that this growth does not include any additional inorganic opportunities, which we expect to identify and add to our portfolio in Phase 2.\nWith that, I would like to welcome Dr. Jeff Nau to the call to share some more information about Oyster Point and its exciting growth driver as well as his perspectives on the Famy assets. But before I do, I would like to thank our Viatris colleagues for their continued performance and look forward to welcoming our future colleagues from Oyster Point and Famy Life Sciences who are listening today.\n\nJeffrey Nau\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Oyster Point Pharma, Inc.\n\nThank you, Rajiv, and thank you to Viatris for allowing me the opportunity to speak today. Good morning. My name is Jeff Nau, and I am the President and CEO of Oyster Point Pharma, a public biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of first-in-class pharmaceutical therapies to treat ophthalmic diseases.\nOur mission at Oyster Point is to advance truly breakthrough science to deliver therapies that patients and eye care professionals need. I was the first employee at Oyster Point in 2017. And since then, we have grown the company to more than 250 employees, including launching one of the most exciting commercial products in dry eye disease with a leading sales team in ophthalmology.\nBy educational training, I hold a Masters in Medical Science and a PhD in Public Health and Epidemiology. And for over 20 years, I have dedicated my career exclusively to drug and device development in the field of ophthalmology. Prior to joining Oyster Point Pharma, I was involved in the development of a number of promising therapies in the retina space, including while at Genentech, where I was part of the FDA approval and commercialization of numerous indications for the anti-VEGF therapy, Lucentis, a medical breakthrough for treating blindness which generated multibillion-dollar peak annual sales.\nThe Oyster Point team brings decades of experience in the eye care space with most of the leadership team dedicating their entire careers to eye care. Currently, we are 1 year into the successful launch of our first FDA-approved product. Tyrvaya is the first and only nasal spray for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. Dry eye disease is a large market affecting an estimated 38 million Americans and over 700 million people worldwide. It's a chronic multifactorial disease, which is characterized by the imbalance to the nutrient-rich layers of the ocular surface known as the tear film. Increasing the production of natural tear film is believed to reduce the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.\nPrior to Tyrvaya's entry into the market, many patients reported being dissatisfied with older treatments in the class due to lack of efficacy, slow onset of action and the stinging and burning associated with prescription eye drops. The team at Oyster Point broke new ground with Tyrvaya. Tyrvaya's differentiated clinical profile rapidly bio-activates tear film production to help the body create more natural tears and can be easily administered. It's a preservative-free nasal spray that's convenient with a twice-a-day dosing regimen with no contraindications.\nTyrvaya's unique mode of action involves activating the trigeminal parasympathetic pathway in the nose, which is believed to trigger tear film production. Tyrvaya was studied in a broad population of adults with mild, moderate and severe dry eye disease. In clinical trials, patients achieved statistically significant improvement in tear film production and other key dry eye measurements.\nIn addition to this exciting product, let me share details on what Oyster Point will add from a pipeline perspective. In our development pipeline, we have several programs aimed at treating other ophthalmic disease with unmet needs, including Stage 1 neurotrophic keratopathy, a severe degenerative condition affecting the nerves of the cornea. Separately, our proprietary transformational gene therapy program is currently progressing towards IND-enabling studies in 2023 for Stages 2 and 3 neurotrophic keratopathy, and we have begun early development for a therapy to treat vernal and atopic keratoconjunctivitis, severe allergic conditions of the eye.\nOyster Point originally engaged with Viatris on ex U.S. licensing and partnering opportunities for our products. As discussions progressed, we quickly realized that the Global Healthcare Gateway that Viatris has built provides a unique partnership opportunity to accelerate and amplify Viatris' and Oyster Point's growth strategies and would enable increased access to ophthalmic therapies for patients worldwide.\nJust as Oyster Point could propel Viatris' expertise in ophthalmology through its infrastructure and deep knowledge of the space from a clinical, medical, regulatory and commercial perspective, Tyrvaya and pipeline assets, Viatris could propel Oyster Point with its global commercial footprint, R&D and regulatory capabilities, supply chain as well as the multiple additional ophthalmic assets. Conceptually, this is not a 1 plus 1 equals 2 addition of companies, but potentially more like a 1 plus 1 equals 4 addition. The sum of the merger amplifies itself based on the synergy that both companies would provide to each other.\nOyster Point, as the foundation of the ophthalmology franchise of Viatris, will bring a team with deep expertise in ophthalmology to advance research and drug development as well as an experienced U.S. commercial sales and medical affairs infrastructure that I am confident will lead to a future innovation at Viatris.\nThe ophthalmology and optometry communities deserve partners who are committed to investing in and bringing new therapies to market for patients and eye care professionals. On joining Viatris as its new ophthalmology franchise, we'll be committed to being that market leader in addressing the industry's unmet needs.\nAs Rajiv previously stated, the ophthalmology portfolio that has been created to date is expected to have significant peak potential by 2030. What we have outlined here today is simply the foundation of what is expected over the next few years. Our focus will be to invest in the resources behind the continued launch and international expansion of Tyrvaya as well as the clinical development of multiple key assets ranging across a full spectrum of eye care disease areas, including dry eye disease and potentially glaucoma, neurotrophic keratopathy, blepharitis, presbyopia and a number of other vision-related disorders.\nIn closing and on a personal note, I would like to thank the Oyster Point team for building such a strong organization over the last 5 years. We have built capabilities in R&D, clinical development and commercial within the eye care space in such a short period of time. It is the value of our people, our lead asset Tyrvaya and our pipeline that compelled Viatris to decide to bring our company into their organization. I would like to thank Robert, Michael, Rajiv and our future colleagues at Viatris for the opportunity to join the Viatris family and to say that I also share in the excitement surrounding the future of Viatris.\n\nSanjeev Narula\n\nCFO, Viatris Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be with you today to share my thoughts on the recent quarter and expand upon what you've heard from Robert, Michael and Rajiv on the outlook of our company.\nPlease turn to the slide with our third quarter financial highlights and the outlook for fourth quarter and full year 2022. We had another strong quarter operationally that was in line with our expectation. On a reported basis, revenue was impacted by foreign exchange headwinds by approximately 9% versus Q3 2021.\nLet me walk you through the key drivers that contributed to the strong performance in third quarter. For revenue, we saw continued stability in our segments, including Developed Markets and China. New product revenue in the quarter benefited from the launch of lenalidomide in the U.S. This performance contributed to an overall favorable mix resulting in better gross margin.\nWith respect to SG&A, we continue to benefit from synergies. R&D increased due to continued investment in the pipeline. We had another strong quarter of free cash flow generation. This underscores our confidence in the stability of our base business and the organizational effort around cash optimization initiatives.\nOn a year-to-date basis, we have met 2020 commitments and have paid down approximately $2.1 billion in debt and have also paid out approximately $436 million in dividends. With 3 quarters of solid performance under our belt, we feel good about the rest of the year and expect the positive momentum to continue.\nNow a few comments on the expected Q4 financial results. We anticipate the gross margin percentage will moderate from third quarter levels due to product and segment mix. SG&A, similar to last year, is expected to step up from Q3 2022. Free cash flow is expected to be significantly lower compared with Q3 2022 due to anticipated lower adjusted EBITDA, phasing of interest payments and higher CapEx.\nGiven the continued strength from operations, we expect to absorb the incremental impact from foreign exchange. We are reaffirming our guidance across total revenues, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. As previously mentioned on our Q2 call, it is likely we will come in at the lower end of the adjusted EBITDA range due to foreign exchange. And for free cash flow, it is likely we will end up at the midpoint of the range, fully absorbing the foreign exchange headwind.\nThe next slide is an illustration of free cash flow over the last 7 quarters. Q3 was another strong quarter, especially considering it included EpiPen settlement for approximately $259 million. Taking this into account, the underlying free cash flow would have exceeded Q3 2021. This is another indication of stability we see in our business.\nI'm very pleased with the progress we are making in improving cash conversion. This is a focus we expect to continue in 2023 and beyond. As mentioned, we expect the Biocon transaction to close shortly, and we expect to update you at that time with the associated impact on the current guidance.\nThe next slide is an illustration of our sources and uses of divestiture proceeds. A key takeaway: we expect significant amount of cash over next year or so. On the left, we anticipate total estimated pretax proceeds of approximately $8 billion to $9 billion. This includes approximately $5 billion to $6 billion of pretax proceeds from the divestitures of identified noncore assets. Since our Investor Day in February, we have made significant progress on these initiatives and have updated our ranges based on latest discussions with our advisers.\nWe expect to cover all taxes and transaction costs with the divestiture proceeds. It is important to note that the proceeds from these divestitures will not be reported in the U.S. GAAP net cash provided by operating activities. However, the taxes and transactions costs will be reported in our future U.S. GAAP net cash provided by operating activity and therefore will impact reported free cash flow. As these costs are incurred, they will be appropriately disclosed in order to better model the underlying base business free cash flow.\nTotaling the estimated uses, including the cash to acquire ophthalmology franchise, we expect net divestiture proceeds of approximately $4.9 billion to $6.1 billion. We intend to allocate this significant financial flexibility towards incremental debt paydown, share buyback and potential future business development.\nTurning to next slide, which highlights a few key points on the acquisitions we announced earlier today. We're excited about the acquisition of Oyster Point Pharma. The transaction will consist of $11 per share in cash upfront through a tender offer. In addition to upfront cash consideration, each Oyster Point stockholder will receive one non-tradable contingent value right, representing up to additional $2 per share contingent on Oyster achieving certain metrics based on full year 2022 performance.\nConcurrent to Oyster Point closing, we also expect to acquire Famy Life Sciences, which has a complementary ophthalmology portfolio, for a total cash payout of approximately $281 million. Both transactions are subject to customary closing conditions. We expect these transactions will be funded with cash on hand.\nNow moving to next slide, which captures all the components of capital allocation framework. Taking into account the net divestiture proceeds and the significant free cash flow from our base business, we have the confidence that we will not only able to deliver our Phase 1 commitment, but also be able to increase our return of capital to shareholders in Phase 2.\nTo recap our Phase 1 commitment, our highest priority in this phase has been debt paydown and leverage reduction. There are 2 components of this commitment: pay down $6.5 billion of debt, which represents the short-term and scheduled maturities between '21 and '23; and pay down additional debt to reduce our pro forma gross leverage ratio to 3x by the end of 2023. This priority fully supports our commitment to maintaining our investment-grade rating. The outcome is a financial profile that we believe differentiates us from our peers and has afforded us an attractive capital structure in these volatile times.\nAnother part of Phase 1 commitment was returning capital through a dividend, which we initiated in 2021 and increased in 2022. As we mentioned, the net divestiture proceeds and the underlying free cash flow gives us the necessary flexibility to begin executing on the authorized share buyback in 2023. The expected completion of these Phase 1 commitments, especially meeting our gross leverage target of 3x by the end of 2023, will enable us to rebalance our capital allocation plan for '24 and beyond.\nAs you heard in Robert's opening remarks, we expect to take a more balanced approach with a focus on capital return and business investment during Phase 2. This is a result of an expectation of significant free cash flow growth during this phase. We will remain committed to our investment-grade rating, and we'll target gross leverage at 3x with a range of 2.8 to 3.2x.\nWe expect there will be significant cash available for capital return. We anticipate allocating approximately 50% of annual free cash flow to share buyback and the dividend. The organic adjusted earning growth expected during this phase and the reduction in annual share count is expected to accelerate our adjusted EPS growth. With respect to investing in our business organically and inorganically and taking into account the importance of our investment-grade rating, we will continue to be financially prudent in targeting bolt-ons and tuck-ins.\nMoving to the next slide. After roughly 2 years of managing the business and the solid performance of last 7 quarters, we have high confidence on the rhythm of the business, the outlook, the investment needs to drive future growth. Therefore, we are in a position to provide long-term targets for total revenue, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and adjusted EPS. As Robert noted in his comments, these targets exclude the associated revenue of approximately $2.1 billion and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $700 million from the divestiture of biosimilars and noncore assets and $300 million of increased R&D.\nKey assumption to support these targets, including base business erosion of approximately 2% to 3%, being fully offset by new product revenue from our pipeline. The return to growth will also be supported by the ophthalmology franchise. The anticipated 3% total revenue CAGR from '24 to '28 does not reflect any additional business development activity beyond the acquisition of ophthalmology franchise.\nNow a few assumptions supporting the growth of adjusted EBITDA. With the evolution of our portfolio moving up the value chain and the focus on more novel and branded products, we anticipate relatively stable gross margin during this period. We anticipate [SGN] investment on a total basis to be stable, but to decline on a percentage basis as revenues grow during this period.\nR&D investment will include the novel and complex pipeline, as outlined by Rajiv, and the ophthalmology asset. It will also include the impact of recent SEC guidelines for licensing deals that were previously excluded from adjusted earnings but will be included in the future. Free cash flow growth is expected to be significant and will benefit from reduced interest expenses, reduced onetime cash costs and expected benefit from cash optimization initiatives.\nFinally, we expect adjusted EPS growth to be enhanced by annual share repurchases, which we believe will be an important part of our focus on capital return to shareholders. These assumptions, based on July 2022 foreign exchange rates, do not assume any benefit if foreign exchange rate return to historical averages.\nIn conclusion, I'm really pleased with how the business is performing after 7 strong quarters and the actions we're taking to strengthen our foundation. The free cash flow generation, along with financial flexibility from divestitures, gives us confidence in achieving our Phase 1 commitments, increasing our capital return to shareholders and positioning the business for future growth in Phase 2.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A."

My name is Leo, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Viatris 2022 Second Quarter Earnings Call and Webcast. (Operator Instructions)\nThank you. I'll now turn the call over to Bill Szablewski, Head of Global Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nWilliam Szablewski\n\nHead of Capital Markets, Viatris Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining me today is Michael Goettler, our Chief Executive Officer; Rajiv Malik, our President; and Sanjeev Narula, our Chief Financial Officer. A copy of today's presentation and other earnings materials are available on our website at investor.viatris.com.\nDuring today's discussion, we will be making forward-looking statements on a number of matters, including our financial guidance for 2022 and various strategic initiatives. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause future results or events to differ materially from today's projections. Please refer to Slide 2 of the presentation and our SEC filings for a full explanation of these risks and uncertainties.\nWe will also be referring to certain actual and projected non-GAAP financial measures to supplement investors' understanding of our financial performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to comparable GAAP measures on our website and in today's presentation.\nWith that, now I'd like to hand the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael Goettler\n\nCEO & Executive Director, Viatris Inc.\n\nThank you, Bill, and good morning, everybody. Thank you all for joining us for our second quarter 2022 earnings call.\nI'm proud to report that we're hitting on all cylinders operationally, even while foreign exchange rates continue to be challenging, and we have now demonstrated 6 consecutive quarters of strong performance. We're delivering on our financial and strategic commitments, and we're making great progress on the reshaping initiatives, which we announced in February.\nRemember, Viatris was designed with diversification and resilience in mind. We believe our geographic and product diversity allows us to balance occasional headwinds in one part of the business with opportunities in others, which we expect will enable us to deliver consistent and predictable performance over time.\nWe are reaffirming our full year 2022 financial guidance ranges for adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. Because of our continued strong operational performance, we believe that we can absorb the foreign exchange rate impact within those ranges.\nHowever, we are revising our full year 2022 financial guidance range for total revenue, solely to reflect our current expectation of the negative impact of foreign exchange rates. You will hear later more specific commentary on the guidance ranges for all 3 of these metrics, including our consideration of the foreign exchange rate impacts.\nNow let me share some highlights from the quarter. In the second quarter, we reported total revenue of $4.12 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $1.48 billion. Free cash flow generation continues to be strong at USD 719 million for the quarter.\nI'm pleased with our solid performance across segments this quarter, particularly in China and our operational growth in Europe. Our continued strong performance has enabled us to continue to deliver on our financial commitments for debt repayment and returning capital to shareholders through the payment of our dividends.\nIn the first half of the year, we paid down approximately $1.5 billion in debt, and we're on track to achieve approximately $2 billion in debt repayment for the year. We continue to be committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating, which is something that we believe really differentiates us from our peers.\nOur Board of Directors has again authorized payment of a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share. And we're very proud that our internal development engine continues to deliver key pipeline milestones, which we believe positions us well to continue to move up the value chain. Overall, we're on track for approximately USD 600 million in new product revenue for the full year, and we look forward to the anticipated launch of lenalidomide in the second half of 2022.\nAnd finally, we're continuing our successful integration, capturing synergies and simplifying our processes and our organization. By the end of this year, we expect to have exited substantially all transitional service agreements with Pfizer. In addition, we are seeing continued strong engagement for our employees, who are all working diligently to execute on our priorities.\nAnd as you remember, in February, we announced a significant global reshaping initiative to unlock trapped value and build what we expect to be a simpler, stronger and more focused company that's well positioned to deliver more access to patients and more value to shareholders. We continue to make good progress on the biosimilar transaction with our partner, Biocon Biologics.\nThe transaction received key antitrust clearances in the U.S., India and other markets, and we are still targeting a deal close in the second half of this year. While we await final regulatory approval from the Reserve Bank of India, the 2 companies have been working productively to put plans and transition service agreements in place to ensure business continuity for patients, customers, and importantly, our colleagues.\nWe're also making good progress on the previously announced divestitures of other select noncore assets. And we continue to expect to execute against these plans by the end of 2023.\nWith regard to business development, we further ramped up our inorganic activities in our global health care gateway. We're looking at everything. We remain therapeutic area agnostic, and our business development efforts are centered on bolt-on and tuck-in opportunities that match our 3 identified therapeutic areas or moving up the value chain as well as other opportunities.\nIn summary, we had a very strong quarter, and we're excited about the future we're building for Viatris. The entire company is focused on executing on the initiatives we set forth for the business, meeting or exceeding our operational goals that we have set, generating significant free cash flow and unlocking value while reshaping our company for a stronger future.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Rajiv. Rajiv?\n\nRajiv Malik\n\nPresident & Executive Director, Mylan NV\n\nThat's Michael, and good morning, everyone. For 6 consecutive quarters, we have consistently executed against our overall operational priorities. Our strong operational performance this quarter reflects the resilience of the diversified business we have deliberately built.\nAs shared before, we are not dependent on any one market or any one product, and we remain agile and opportunist in how we manage the business with the goal of maximizing the strengths of each market and address unforeseen challenges. Our execution has been and continues to be a team effort. And I would like to thank our colleagues for delivering another solid quarter and continuing to meet our customer commitments.\nThe strong business performance and the execution of our underlying plan in the first half of the year, supported by consistent supply, gives us the confidence that the momentum will continue for the second half and deliver our operational commitments for the year. We also continue to expect to achieve over approximately $600 million new launch revenue target for '22.\nMoving to our quarterly segment results. I will be making certain comparisons to second quarter 2021 results on a constant currency basis as well as comparisons on an operational basis versus our plan that supports our guidance. These comparisons exclude the impact of foreign currency exchange.\nOur North America business represents a balanced portfolio consisting of several brands, complex drug devices and many other generic products. We believe this mix provides the business enhanced stability and predictability.\nYupelri continues to grow and delivered high teens, and EpiPen performed better than we expected. We experienced healthy demand for our Generics portfolio, while [Canada] once again delivered a better-than-expected performance. We look forward to the expected launch of lenalidomide in the second half of the year.\nRegarding Breyna, our FDA-approved generic to Symbicort, we anticipate a ruling from the district court in the coming months on the trial that was held in May. We also have a separate case, brought on a newly issued patent that is in front of a different judge in the same court. We remain prepared operationally and continue to look forward to bringing the product to market at the earliest possible date as these court cases develop.\nOur European business had another strong quarter, delivering 8% year-over-year growth. Creon, Dymista, Brufen and our Thrombosis portfolio showed solid performance. France, Germany, Italy and Spain led the growth. The region also benefited from certain customer purchasing patterns in the quarter. We expect that the new launches across Europe will be another key driver for '22 performance.\nThe Emerging Markets segment delivered another quarter of consistent performance and was in line with our expectations. We delivered strong performance in key markets like South Korea, Brazil and Malaysia and in key brands like Lyrica and Norvasc. The year-over-year change was driven by previously disclosed anticipated ARV therapy landscape changes and sales of a certain COVID-related products in '21. Excluding these 2 items, total net sales were flat to the prior year.\nOur JANZ segment performance this quarter was driven by better-than-expected performance of our Generics business as well as our off-patent branded portfolio. Lyrica and Celebrex in Japan came in better than expected. Additionally, the Generics portfolio in Japan benefited from favorable market dynamics. The Generics portfolio in Australia also performed better than our expectations, which will be further supported by the addition of a key wholesale and pharmacy customer.\nGreater China continued its strong performance and exceeded our expectations this quarter with 1% year-over-year operational growth. Our ability to manage the business and supply chain effectively through the COVID lockdown period is a testament to our commercial strength in this market.\nOur hospital channel again demonstrated a strong performance, led by Lipitor and Norvasc. We are on track to meet our full year expectations as we continue to navigate the evolving health care policy. We also continue to make steady progress in building up our R&D portfolio for China.\nI will now share an update on our pipeline, which builds upon our strong legacy in the development of value-added complex products and our extensive scientific capabilities. I'm pleased to report that we have been able to successfully manage the trial of glatiramer acetate once-monthly and remain on schedule despite the unfortunate situation in Ukraine. We expect to read out our Phase III clinical trial by the end of this September, and we remain on track to make our U.S. submission in quarter 1 '23.\nWe received FDA approval of fingolimod, which is a generic to Gilenya, and are on track to launch in the U.S. in '24, timed with our settlement date. We filed our submission to Octreotide MR in U.S. in this May, which keeps us on track to launch in '24.\nOur new, in essence, ophthalmic program, MR-139, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic blepharitis is making steady progress. And we intend to submit the IND for this program at the end of the year in order to initiate the Phase III clinical trial in quarter 1 '23.\nWe are making steady progress on our biosimilar to BOTOX program with Revance. We are targeting a BLA submission in 2025, and we remain committed to the launch of this complex biosimilar at the earliest possible launch in the United States.\nAnd finally, Biocon expects FDA site inspection of 2 of its sites to be conducted in the next few weeks, which hopefully will pave the way for biosimilar bevacizumab and insulin as part of approvals later this year. We believe we are well positioned to add more complex products and pursue additional opportunities to further move up the value chain by leveraging our global health care gateway and strengthen our pipeline in the previously stated therapeutic areas of GI, ophthalmology and dermatology.\nAnd lastly, an update on integration. I'm pleased to report that we continue to make significant progress. As you may recall, the legacy Upjohn business was heavily dependent on Pfizer's systems and infrastructure, which was supported by a significant transition services agreement.\nWe are currently on track to exit the remaining Pfizer TSAs by end of this year, and I would like to thank our colleagues from Viatris and Pfizer around the world supporting this important initiative. We are also on track to achieve at least $1 billion in cumulative cost synergies by the end of 2023.\nWith that, let me now turn the call over to Sanjeev.\n\nSanjeev Narula\n\nCFO, Viatris Inc.\n\nThanks, Rajiv, and good morning, everyone. Slides 16 and 17 show second quarter financial highlights as well as results for the first half of this year.\nFor the quarter and first half of 2022, the operations of the business were in line or slightly ahead of our expectation. This performance is across our global diversified portfolio of Brands, Generics and Complex Products. As anticipated, operational revenue was solidly in line with our expectation, but slightly down compared to prior year.\nAdjusted EBITDA and free cash flow were ahead of expectation, and we were able to offset foreign exchange headwinds. The business benefited from strong adjusted gross margin, lower adjusted SG&A due to the realization of synergy and disciplined spend management. Cash flow benefited from our cash optimization initiative and reduction in onetime cash costs.\nMoving to Slide 18. For the quarter, we have seen dollar strengthening significantly against major currencies, including the euro. As a result, net of hedging activities, foreign exchange had an impact of approximately 7% on net sales versus the second quarter 2021. Net sales were in line with our expectation on an operational basis, down versus prior year by approximately 3% due to anticipated drivers.\nOur developed market business has a strong quarter and were operationally flat versus prior year. This performance was driven by strong growth in Europe due to category diversity, partially offset by anticipated competition on key products in North America.\nAs anticipated, other base business erosion was primarily driven by lower ARV volumes due to the anticipated change in therapy landscape and lower sales of certain COVID-related product. New product revenue was driven by interchangeable insulin glargine in North America.\nDespite foreign exchange headwinds, we had another solid quarter of adjusted EBITDA that were ahead of our expectations. Adjusted gross margin was driven by strong brand performance and favorable segment and product mix. SG&A continues to benefit from our synergies, integration activities and disciplined spend management.\nTurning to Slide 19. We had another excellent quarter with better-than-expected free cash flow of more than $700 million, up significantly versus the prior year. This improvement in our cash flow conversion was driven by positive changing -- changes in the operational working capital and lower onetime cash cost. Free cash flow through the first half of the year was strong at $1.8 billion, an increase of approximately 40% or $500 million compared to same period last year.\nSlide 20 illustrates our capital allocation framework and the strong and consistent history of free cash flow generation since the formation of Viatris. I'm proud to say that over the last 6 quarters, the company had generated more than $4.3 billion of free cash flow.\nWe are well over the halfway mark of our goal of generating more than $8 billion in free cash flow by the end of 2023. This has allowed us to deliver on our capital allocation commitment. For the year so far, we have repaid approximately $1.5 billion of debt and more than $3.5 billion since the beginning of 2021.\nAdditionally, we have paid approximately $219 million in dividend this year and approximately $690 million in dividends since the beginning of 2021. We remain committed to our 2022 debt repayment target of approximately $2 billion. This will strengthen our balance sheet and support our commitment to maintain an investment-grade rating.\nWe expect to accelerate financial flexibility through the anticipated closing of biosimilar transaction in the second half of 2020 (sic) [2022], which we expect to net approximately $1.6 billion after-tax proceeds. As we look ahead, we expect our capital allocation framework will broaden with potential share repurchases in tuck-in or bolt-on business development opportunities.\nBefore I discuss our revised 2022 financial guidance, if you recall, our commentary may mention we would reassess the foreign exchange impact on total revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. The dollar has strengthened significantly across major currencies, and approximately 70% of our business is nondollar-denominated.\nMoving to Slide 23. The business is in a strong position through first 6 months of the year. And we expect full year revenue to be in line, if not slightly ahead, of our expectation on an operational basis.\nWith respect to our revenue guidance, we now estimate an approximately 7% foreign exchange headwind on a full year basis, assuming July rate hold for the remainder of the year. As a result, we're revising our revenue guidance range by $800 million to $16.2 billion to $16.7 billion.\nOur revised revenue guidance takes into account foreign exchange impact through the first half of the year and approximately $600 million, split evenly between third and fourth quarter of 2022. Operationally, we expect revenue will be driven by continued ramp-up of new products, including the U.S. launch of lenalidomide in the second half and the seasonality of Influvac in developed markets.\nBecause of our continuing strong execution and operational performance, we currently expect to be able to absorb the foreign exchange headwind within our free cash flow range and also our adjusted EBITDA range. As it relates to adjusted EBITDA, we may end up towards the lower end of the range.\nOur expectation to absorb foreign exchange headwind is due to several factors, including positive product mix benefiting gross margin, favorable SG&A due to synergies and expense management as well as increased cash optimization initiatives and lower CapEx. Now let me cover some of the expected drivers for financial performance for the second half.\nWe expect sequential increase in SG&A and R&D in the second half of the year. We expect cash flow will be heavily weighted to the first half of the year, mainly due to the timing of onetime cash costs, of which we expect approximately 2/3 to come in the second half of the year. This includes the previously announced EpiPen litigation settlement, which was paid in July. In addition, we expect capital expenditure to ramp up in the second half of the year.\nWe're pleased with the strong first half performance. The momentum we see in the operations of the business position us well for the remainder of the year. Our capital allocation framework, including debt paydown goals, commitment to dividend and the value we see in maintaining an investment grade, will continue to be important drivers in creating long-term value.\nNow I'd like to turn the call back to the operator to open the call for Q&As."

My name is Britney, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Viatris 2022 First Quarter Earnings Call and Webcast. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Bill Szablewski, Head of Global Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nWilliam Szablewski\n\nHead of Capital Markets, Viatris Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining me today is Michael Goettler, Chief Executive Officer; Rajiv Malik, our President; and Sanjeev Narula, our Chief Financial Officer.\nDuring today's discussion, we will be making forward-looking statements on a number of matters, including our financial guidance for 2022 and various strategic initiatives. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause future results or events to differ materially from today's projections. Please refer to the press release that we furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K earlier today for an explanation of those risks and uncertainties and the limits applicable to forward-looking statements.\nWe will be referring to certain actual and projected financial metrics of Viatris on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. We will refer to these measures as adjusted and present them to supplement your understanding and assessment of our financial performance. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The most direct comparable GAAP measures as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to those GAAP measures are available on our website at investor.viatris.com and in the appendix of today's slide presentation.\nThe information discussed during the presentation, except for the participant questions, is the property of Viatris and cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Viatris express written consent and permission. A copy of today's presentation is available on our website at investor.viatris.com. An archived replay of the webcast will be available on our website following the conclusion of today's event.\nWith that, now I'd like to hand the call over to Michael Goettler, our Chief Executive Officer.\n\nMichael Goettler\n\nCEO & Executive Director, Viatris Inc.\n\nThank you, Bill, and good morning. Thank you all for joining us for our first quarter 2022 earnings call. I'm pleased to say that we're off to a good start to the year with strong first quarter results, in line with our expectations across all key financial metrics, delivering on our financial commitments and making good progress on the reshaping initiatives we announced in February.\nFor the full year, we remain confident in our 2022 financial guidance on an operational basis, and we're continuing to monitor the current headwinds brought on by foreign exchange rates.\nNow here are some highlights from the quarter. In the first quarter, we reported total revenue of USD 4.19 billion, adjusted EBITDA of USD 1.59 billion and free cash flow of $1.07 billion, a 34% increase over last year. This strong performance has enabled us to continue to deliver on our financial commitments for debt repayment while continuing to return capital to shareholders through the payment of a dividend.\nWe're continuing our successful integration, capturing synergies and simplifying our processes and organization. Our development engine continues to deliver key pipeline milestones and highlights for this quarter, include the launch of generic Restasis and generic Revlimid, and the full FDA approval of generic Symbicort. Overall, we generated approximately $120 million of new product revenue in the first quarter, and we're on track for $600 million in new product revenues for the full year.\nNow let me just switch gears to our future. In February, we announced a significant global reshaping initiative to unlock trapped value and build a simpler, stronger and more focused company, which is well-positioned to deliver more access to patients and more value to shareholders. Since February, we've engaged in conversations in a meeting with numerous shareholders. We've listened carefully to your feedback and we recognize there's a desire for more clarity and more certainty about our strategic plans and the steps we're taking to get there. We fully understand the importance of remaining engaged with you, and we'll update you on our progress as we go along.\nSo let me give you an update on what was achieved in the first quarter. I'm pleased to say we made good progress during the quarter on the biosimilar transaction with our partner, Biocon Biologics, and we believe we are on track to close the transaction in the second half of 2022. Rajiv later will give you more details on our activities to date.\nWe're also making good progress on the previously announced divestiture of the portfolio assets of other select noncore assets, which we identified. We remain confident that we execute against all of these plans by the end of 2023. We strongly believe that our company's equity securities continue to be significantly undervalued. And as we continue to generate strong operating cash flows from our business and realize the proceeds to more efforts to unlock value, we are focused on maintaining our quarterly dividend, paying down debt, future share buybacks and other actions, all of which will enhance shareholder value over the short, medium and long term.\nAnd with regard to timing for share buybacks, we hope to consider repurchases under the program already approved by the Board of Directors as soon after the close of Biocon Biologics as possible.\nIn summary, we had a very strong quarter, and we're excited about the future that we're building for Viatris. I can assure you that the entire company is focused on executing on these initiatives that we set forth for our business; meeting or exceeding the operational goals that we've set; generating significant free cash flow, which remains our financial north star; and unlocking value while reshaping our company for a stronger future.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Rajiv. Rajiv?\n\nRajiv Malik\n\nPresident & Executive Director, Mylan NV\n\nThank you, Michael, and good morning. I'm excited by our strong results this quarter that reflect our focused business execution on all fronts. We managed the base business, maximized new launches, delivered on our pipeline and continued to execute our integration and TSA exits, all while advancing our reshaping initiatives.\nLet me start with an update on transaction with Biocon Biologics. We are progressing with all regulatory approvals and importantly, have clearance from a U.S. antitrust perspective. The remaining regulatory approvals are expected in the coming months. Biocon is also on track with securing its financial commitments. With this positive momentum, we are well-positioned to close this transaction in the second half of '22.\nNow moving to our quarterly segment results, which begin on Slide 7 of our earnings slides posted on our website. As I walk you through the performance in each of our segments and product categories, I will be making certain comparisons on an operational basis versus our plan that supported our guidance we communicated back in late February.\nOur developed market segment continues to be a strong and resilient commercial business built on a foundation of a well-diversified portfolio of brand, generics and complex products, which has allowed us to improve the predictability and sustainability in what continues to be a dynamic and challenging environment. In North America, we continue to demonstrate our focus and dedication to patients through the innovative solutions based on the strength of our proven development capabilities.\nOur interchangeable biosimilar, Semglee, is off to a great start as the total prescription share approach is 10%, which is in line with our expectations. Generic Restasis is another example of a first-to-market complex product and is also off to a strong start.\nMoving to our generic Symbicort named Breyna. We are very excited to receive FDA's final approval in March. This milestone furthers our track record of successful first in developing complex generic medicines to help increase patient access. There is a trial scheduled for May 19 in the West Virginia Federal Court, and we continue to have the opportunity to launch this product in 2022 as upcoming proceedings developed.\nOther key products like Yupelri and Wixela performed in line with our expectations while showing year-over-year double-digit volume growth. Our European business is also off to a solid start and remains on track to grow mid-single digit for the full year '22. Italy, France, Spain and Portugal performed strongly to further enhance our retail channel leadership in these countries. We also saw stronger-than-expected performance across brands such as Creon, Lipitor, Dymista, Lyrica and Brufen. Our thrombosis portfolio continued to grow in line with our expectations. Hulio, our biosimilar to Humira, which has roughly 20-plus percent market share of the biosimilar market, is another key contributor to our German and France businesses. Our recently launched generic Revlimid is the first in series of key launches planned for Europe this year.\nOur emerging markets segment showed a strong quarterly performance. Our ARV franchise performed slightly better versus our expectations this quarter. Key geographies such as South Korea, Southeast Asia, Turkey drove higher volumes while Brazil realized better pricing. Lipitor and Lyrica led to strong growth in this segment and helped the brand category perform better than expectations.\nMoving to JANZ. The headwinds on account of annual government NHI price reductions in Japan are being partially offset by strong year-over-year volume growth of our authorized generics and brands like Celecox, Amitiza and Effexor. In addition, we saw strength in Creon and EpiPen in Australia versus last year. On biosimilars, we are pleased that Hulio has achieved more than 50% market share in Japan. However, we continue to believe that there's plenty of room for the overall Humira biosimilars market to grow as it only stands at 10% today.\nLastly, an update on Greater China. Our strong and broad commercial infrastructure has helped us to deliver a strong performance despite COVID and COVID-related lockdowns. Our retail channel performance, especially Viagra, was slightly impacted by COVID, which was more than offset by better-than-expected performance of the hospital channel primarily led by Lipitor. Our manufacturing operations in China continue to perform well. And at this time, we do not foresee any potential disruption to our China supply chain. Given our solid start to the year and the strong customer service performance across all segments delivered by our global supply chain, we remain confident to deliver on our full year expectations across all segments on an operational basis.\nSwitching now to our pipeline. For your benefit, we have included current snapshots in our earnings materials beginning on Slide 13.\nHere are a few noteworthy pipeline updates. Our Eylea biosimilar review is progressing well, and we can confirm that we have no outstanding science issues. We are currently waiting for the facility approval by FDA. As a reminder, this program is a part of Biocon transaction.\nOur biosimilar to BOTOX filing for USA FDA will be delayed. We remain committed to the successful development of this complex biosimilar with (inaudible) and to the earliest possible launch in the United States.\nOur clinical trial for GA once monthly has a number of patients who are located in Ukraine and are being impacted by ongoing situation there. As a result, we are pushing back our FDA filing by 1 quarter, which is now scheduled for the first quarter of '23. We recently received FDA approval of our levothyroxine oral solution named (inaudible) and are looking forward to launching later this year. Also, we received a PDUFA goal date of October 22 for our potentially first-to-file generic Pentasa. We believe that we achieved first-to-file status for our generic, Abilify Maintena, further enriching our first-to-market opportunities of complex injectables, which now include paliperidone 3-month, octreotide LAR, ferric carboxymaltose, iron sucrose and semaglutide.\nAnd finally, an update on integration. As you can see on Slide 17, we remain on track to realize $500 million of cost synergies over the next 2 years, resulting in at least $1 billion cumulative cost synergy, since becoming Viatris. Our objective throughout this year is to complete our TSA exits from Pfizer, making Viatris self-provide in terms of systems and processes and positioning the company to further accelerate the optimization of our infrastructure.\nBefore I conclude, I would like to thank our colleagues for their hard work to deliver yet another excellent quarter and lay a solid foundation for the year. With that, let me now turn the call over to Sanjeev.\n\nSanjeev Narula\n\nCFO, Viatris Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 18 as we discuss our first quarter 2022 financial highlights.\nWe're after a good start and saw strength across the business. Operational revenue was stable relative to prior year. Gross margin was strong. SG&A benefited from realization of synergies, and free cash flow improved significantly. This performance in total was solid and in line with our expectation. Let me walk you through the key drivers that contributed to first quarter performance.\nOn Slide 19, we have summarized our results versus prior year on a reported basis. Moving to Slide 20. Sales benefited from performance across our segments and several new product launches. As a result, sales were in line with expectation on an operational basis, down marginally versus prior year by approximately 1%.\nOur global business is approximately 70% non-U.S. dollar-denominated. As a result of dollar strengthening against major currencies, foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of approximately 4% versus first quarter 2021. Sales in developed markets were flat as a result of stability across brands and generics, along with contribution of new product sales.\nIn North America, sales of $1.1 billion were in line with expectation. We saw growth across products like Yupelri and the benefit of new product sales, including interchangeable insulin glargine and generic Restasis. In the quarter, these strengths contributed to overall performance and offset the expected impact of competition on key products and generic price erosion.\nIn Europe, we're off to a strong start, and sales grew by 5% on an operational basis. This is a result of category diversity, which spans generic brand products such as Dymista and Creon and our thrombosis business. We're seeing encouraging trends with recently launched generic, Revlimid. Moving on to emerging markets. Overall, operational sales were flat and benefited from growth in brands, including Lipitor and Lyrica. This offset pressure in generics as a result of lower ARV volumes.\nOur JANZ segment was down 4% driven by government price reduction, which we anticipated in Japan and lower volume in Australia. Partially offsetting these trends is a continued uptick of authorized generic products. Lastly, the Greater China segment was impacted by carryover of policy changes in China that were implemented in 2021. Overall, trends are stable across key brands such as Lipitor in the hospital setting. The retail selling continues to be a priority area of growth, given our focus on broadening the patient population.\nOn Slide 21, let me walk you through the P&L elements that led to EBITDA being essentially flat versus prior year. Adjusted gross margin of 59% came in slightly ahead of expectation and were driven by favorable mix associated with brand performance and new product launches. SG&A was down approximately 14% and benefited from synergies realized over the last year associated with integration and restructuring activities.\nTurning to Slide 22. We had an excellent quarter. Free cash flow of more than $1 billion, up 34% versus the prior year. This improvement in our cash flow conversion was driven by lower onetime cash cost, positive change in net working capital, which totaled approximately $300 million in the quarter. Improvement in flat free cash flow generation continues to be an organizational priority. We're confident that the cash optimization efforts will benefit cash flow throughout the rest of 2022. In the quarter, we delivered our capital allocation commitment, which included approximately $840 million of short-term debt payment and increased our quarterly dividend by 9%.\nMoving to Slide 24. We're off to a strong start in 2022, and solid quarter supports the operational strength of business across total revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. You will recall that the guidance we provided in February assumed a full year of biosimilar business, an FX impact of approximately 2% on total revenue and adjusted EBITDA versus the prior year. Given the dollar has strengthened against major currency, if the mid-April spot rates hold throughout the rest of the year, there could be an additional impact on total revenue, adjusted EBITDA and to a lesser extent, free cash flow. FX aside, the momentum seen first quarter gives us confidence in the outlook for the rest of the year.\nNow let me cover the estimated phasing of our financial performance for the full year. With respect to revenue phasing, we estimate 48% of revenue will come in the first half and 52% in the second half. This is driven by ramp of new products, the U.S. launch of generic Revlimid in the third quarter and seasonality of Influvac in developed market. We expect sequential increase in SG&A and R&D throughout the year with approximately 52% of spend occurring in the second half. For the full year, we expect gross margin, SG&A and R&D to be within the guidance metrics we provided earlier this year. As a result of previously announced legal settlement, which will occur in third quarter, free cash flow will be more heavily weighted in the first half.\nAlso, we expect onetime cash cost and capital expenditure to be more significant in third and fourth quarters. We are firmly on track with our 2022 debt paydown target of approximately $2 billion and are committed to maintaining an investment-grade rating. Before I conclude, I want to make a few comments on our reshaping initiatives. We expect the Biocon transaction would generate $2 billion in gross proceeds or approximately $1.6 billion after tax. The proceeds will be used for debt pay down and potentially for share buyback.\nAs Michael and Rajiv both mentioned, we are making good progress and expect other assets to be divested by the end of 2023. This will bring in significant capital for further share buyback and potential tuck-in [BD] opportunities. We're obviously pleased with the strong start in the first quarter. The momentum we see in the operations of the business position us well for the remainder of the year.\nNow I would like to turn the call back to the operator to open the call for Q&As."

I'm Bill Szablewski, Global Head of Capital Markets for Viatris. It is my pleasure to welcome you to our Investor event. With us today is our CEO, Michael Goettler; our President, Rajiv Malik; and our CFO, Sanjeev Narula. We have a lot to share today regarding the reshaping of Viatris into a simpler, stronger and more focused company. But before we get started, I need to cover off a few disclaimers.\nDuring today's investor event, we will be making forward-looking statements on a number of matters, including our financial guidance for 2022 and various strategic initiatives. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause future results or events to differ materially from today's projections. Please refer to today's slide presentation or the press release that we furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K earlier today for a full explanation of those risks and uncertainties and the limits applicable to forward-looking statements. We will be referring to certain actual and projected financial metrics of Viatris on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. We will refer to these measures as adjusted and present them to supplement your understanding and assessment of our financial performance.\nNon-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The most direct comparable GAAP measures as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to those GAAP measures are available on our website at investor.viatris.com and in the appendix of today's slide presentation. The information discussed during the presentation, except for the participant questions, is the property of Viatris and cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Viatris' expressed written consent and permission. An archived copy of today's presentation, along with a replay of the webcast, will be available on our website at investor.vetris.com, following the conclusion of today's event.\nWith that, now I'd like to hand it over to our CEO, Michael Goettler.\n\nMichael Goettler\n\nCEO & Executive Director, Viatris Inc.\n\nThank you, Bill. And good morning, and welcome to Viatris 2022 Investor Event. This is truly an exciting day for all of us at Viatris; for our 37,000 colleagues around the world; and for our shareholders. Not only are we reporting strong financial results for the full year of 2021 meeting or exceeding our guidance. Today, we'll lay out for you exactly how we expect to deliver on our vision for Viatris. We'll further review with you our current pipeline, our scientific capabilities, our proven track record and how we intend to reshape our portfolio towards higher margin, more durable assets such as NCEs and 505(b)(2)s. And finally, we'll give you an update on our business performance and execution, our 2021 financial results and our 2022 guidance.\nNext slide, please. Now what you will see is a Viatris that is simpler, that is stronger and that is more focused, the Viatris that we expect to deliver more access to patients and more value to shareholders with a durable higher-margin portfolio, significant financial flexibility and shareholder-friendly capital allocation and further enhanced commercial and scientific capabilities. And we'll lay out to you our very bold plan to reshape our company. And with today's announcement of the Biocon biosimilar transaction, we've already taken the first bold step to unlock value, accelerate our financial commitments and increase availability of capital for investing in our future or returning value to shareholders.\nNext slide, please. Viatris was created a little over a year ago, as you know, in November 2020, through the combination of Upjohn and Mylan. Our first year was focused in our immediate priorities of integrating the 2 companies and delevering our balance sheet. And we wasted no time. As you know, in December 2020, we already announced a significant global restructuring plan and executed against this plan. We defined and delivered clear financial targets, including our 2021 budget, our synergy targets, our goal to pay down $6.5 billion in debt by 2023 and the initiation and growth of a quarterly dividend. And I'm very pleased to say that we have now delivered 4 quarters consecutively of consistent and solid performance, meeting or exceeding our guidance. Sanjeev later will provide you more details on our full year 2021 results.\nMeanwhile, our pipeline achieved many significant milestones, including the historic approval of the first interchangeable biosimilar in the U.S. and the first approval of a generic to Restasis. Meanwhile, externally, we're recognized as 1 of the top 5 companies on fortress company that changed the work list. We're recognized by Forbes as one of the World's Best Employers, and by Newsweek as one of America's Most Responsible Company. But most importantly, most importantly, through 2021, we conducted a thorough strategic review of our entire business. We determined what was core and what was noncore to the future of our company. And today, I'm excited to share with you the output of that review and the actions that we're taking.\nToday, we're announcing a significant global reshaping initiative. The Biocon biosimilar announcement is only the first-but-critical step to unlock value and reshape Viatris. And combined with other initiatives, we expect to significantly enhance our financial flexibility, accelerate our financial commitments and enable us to invest in our future, continuing to move up the value chain by expanding to more innovative areas and to return value to shareholders.\nNext slide, please. We're taking immediate and concrete actions to execute on that plan. To unlock value and to simplify our business beyond the Biocon biosimilar transaction, we've identified other select assets, which we expect will unlock additional value. And as we continue to execute against our plan, we will become more efficient, reduce complexity and make Viatris a simpler, stronger and more focused company.\nIn total, we expect these initiatives to generate up to $9 billion in pretax proceeds by the end of 2023. And let me just put this in perspective. This is more than half of Viatris current market cap. In return, we're trading off approximately 20% of our current adjusted EBITDA. Sanjeev will provide you further details about our future financial profile later.\nAnd these proceeds will immediately accelerate our financial flexibility. Our financial commitments for Phase I, so that's the year '21, '22 and '23, remain unchanged: pay down $6.5 billion in debt, achieved $1 billion in synergies and grow our quarterly dividend to return value to shareholders. But in addition, we expect to have significant capital available to return to shareholders through share repurchases and/or investing in the growth of our business. And for this, the Board of Directors has already authorized a share repurchase program of up to $1 billion.\nShare buybacks will be an important benchmark for us as we make future capital allocation decisions and decide how to invest in our future. Our goal is to enhance our proven scientific capabilities and current global platform, including our Global Healthcare Gateway, to create a durable and higher-margin portfolio of products. And that means further expanding beyond our current scope into more innovative products, including NCEs and global 505(b)(2)s. And for that, we've identified 3 core global therapeutic areas: ophthalmology, gastrointestinal and dermatology. And that, we believe, will particularly fit our capabilities and our platform and where we have a credible path to leadership.\nWe're also further enhancing our commercial and scientific capabilities as needed for this future portfolio. And we intend to double our R&D investment, ramping up steadily to approximately 9% of revenue by 2026 to bolster our pipeline organically. And we expect to inorganically grow via business development through our global health care gateway. Now I'll explain further details on that strategy later. But for now, I would like to hand it over to Rajiv for further details on the Biocon biosimilar interaction, and I'll come back later. Rajiv?\n\nRajiv Malik\n\nPresident & Executive Director, Mylan NV\n\nThank you, Michael. As Michael just outlined, we have identified certain assets as a part of an extensive strategic review. These assets have a potential to unlock the trapped value and are potentially noncore to the future direction of the company. These assets can generate up to approximately USD 9 billion of pretax total proceeds. The plan is being executed as we speak, and up to $3.335 billion of these proceeds will come from the Biocon transaction, which I will walk you through now.\nThe transaction we announced today is the first step towards creating a simpler, stronger and more focused Viatris. Under the terms of the agreement, Viatris will contribute its biosimilars business to create what we expect to be a unique vertically integrated global biosimilars leader. It's not only the right natural next step for our partnership, but also a continuation of our biosimilars journey and enables us to participate in this space in a more optimized way while unlocking substantial trapped value. We believe this evolution positions Biocon Biologics to further optimize and maximize the biosimilars business.\nViatris and Biocon started the journey together in 2009, even before the biosimilars regulatory pathway was defined in many markets. We had many successes together and continue to build upon our momentum by adding more products to our pipeline. Together as partners, we have seen this landscape evolve from a science, regulatory and customer perspective. Biosimilars are heading steadily towards a face of a mature market. And as was in the case of generics, vertical integration will prove to be decisive to stay ahead. We believe this transaction positions the company as a world-class vertically integrated biosimilars leader and will enable the new company to optimize end-to-end operational capabilities, serve market needs with competitive advantages and will have sustained power.\nThe transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. Viatris will receive total consideration of up to $3.335 billion. $3 billion of the consideration will be received immediately on closing, with $2 billion in cash and $1 billion of convertible preferred shares. Viatris also expects to receive deferred consideration up to $335 million. Viatris will own a stake of at least 12.9% of the combined business on a fully diluted basis. We currently expect the combined business operating as Biocon biologics to commence an IPO in India by late '23. The deal consideration represents a transaction multiple of approximately 16.5x based on estimated ['22] adjusted EBITDA of our biosimilar business of approximately $200 million.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Viatris will contribute its biosimilar business, which includes all the programs currently partnered with the Biocon; as well as our biosimilars program for Humira, Enbrel and Eylea. To facilitate a smooth commercial and operational transition, we will provide [YATS'] select services such as commercial, regulatory and clinical. We will receive cost plus a markup of USD 44 million annually for the duration of TSA.\nNow I update on the share consideration. We will receive $1 billion of the convertible preferred shares that represent a stake of at least 12.9% on a fully diluted basis. We believe Viatris will be positioned to generate additional significant value through the potential upside of our ownership stake in the combined business.\nAn IPO in India is targeted in late '23. And Viatris has a certain priority rights in an IPO. Viatris will also receive customary anti-dilution and preemptive rights. On [Guarness], Viatris will be granted 1 seat on the Board of Biocon Biologics.\nIn terms of timing, while the transaction is subject to customary and regulatory closing conditions, we currently expect the transaction to close in the second half of '22. We expect the TSA services will end by quarter 4 of 2024. That transaction is an exciting evolution to our partnership with Biocon. I look forward to sharing more with you soon about how we will leverage the proceeds to reshape the Viatris for the future.\nNow I will turn it over to Sanjeev.\n\nSanjeev Narula\n\nCFO, Viatris Inc.\n\nThank you, Rajiv, and good morning, everyone. It's been an exciting day for Viatris. Today, we announced strong Q4 and full year 2021 results and financial guidance for 2022. We've entered into an agreement with Biocon Biologics for a total consideration of up to $3.335 billion. We've also announced a plan to reshape the company, which we expect to unlock additional value.\nIn the next few slides, I'll walk you through the reshaping initiatives underway, how it strengthens our profile, accelerates financial flexibility and enhance our capital allocation framework.\nSlide 15 represents an illustrative pro forma for what Viatris could look like post closing of Biocon Biologics transaction and after execution of plan for other select assets. There are a few key takeaways to highlight.\nFirst, as a result of the partnership structure and profit-sharing arrangements of the biosimilar business, the estimated 2022 biosimilar adjusted EBITDA margin is relatively lower compared to our company average. Second, looking at pro forma company, total revenue and adjusted EBITDA will remain largely intact after the transactions. Next, the Biocon transaction at roughly 16x 2022 adjusted EBITDA and estimated proceeds from other select assets are expected to unlock significant value above our company's current valuation. Finally, we expect these transactions will significantly strengthen our financial profile, unlock up to $4 billion to $5 billion of after-tax proceeds that will be deployed for investing into business and returning capital to shareholders.\nTurning to Slide 16. We highlight our illustrative financial profile across revenue, profitability and the balance sheet. For revenue, we plan to complement annual product revenue of approximately $500 million with business development that is targeted towards assets that fit our strategic, commercial and financial criteria. These opportunities can come in from of regional tuck-ins, a therapeutic focused pipeline and a broader distribution type arrangements via our Global Health Care gateway. For profitability, we expect gross margins to stabilize over time given the focus on complex products that are wholly owned and not subject to partnership payments. Given our track record of success and the value upside afforded by more durable, higher margin of complex products, we intend to increase our R&D investments.\nWe expect SG&A to continue to benefit from synergies in 2022 and 2023, averaging [out] at approximately 20% of total revenue. And finally, upon closing of the Biocon transaction, our balance sheet will be immediately strengthened with $2 billion in pretax proceeds to accelerate our Phase I financial commitment.\nNow turning to Slide 17. We expect that the anticipated cash proceeds from Biocon transaction, along with the plan for other assets, will provide additional flexibility and enhance our capital allocation framework. Under Phase I, we intend to accelerate the base plan by retiring short-term debt in 2022. In total, we intend to pay down at least $6.5 billion of debt between '21 and '23 in order to reduce our gross leverage to approximately 3x by the end of 2023. We intend to increase R&D and pipeline investment for future health of the business. As a result, we're taking a more balanced approach to capital allocation and have revised our midpoint of long-term gross leverage target from 2.5x to 3x. With the anticipated proceeds from Biocon Biologics and other select asset transactions, we expect to accelerate investment into business and return more capital through potential share repurchases. We will take a measured approach and we evaluate each option against our internal hurdle rate and other criteria.\nNow I'll turn it over to Michael.\n\nMichael Goettler\n\nCEO & Executive Director, Viatris Inc.\n\nThank you, Sanjeev. Now as we said, we plan to expand our portfolio to more innovative and more durable assets such as NCEs and 505(b)(2)s, and we will do that in a very focused way.\nNow for this, we conducted a thorough analysis of our current strengths and capabilities, especially our scientific capabilities. We looked at market sizes and growth opportunities. We looked at the degree of unmet medical need and the opportunity for innovation, the availability of Phase II and Phase III late-stage assets. And we looked at who our competitors would be and who our prescribers are. And the results were clear. Some therapeutic areas had too much competition or too much scientific risk for us to see a credible path to leadership in the time horizon that we're looking at. Others were too small or didn't provide enough room for innovation. And as I already mentioned earlier, 3 therapy areas in particularly hit the sweet spot for us. That's ophthalmology, dermatology and gastrointestinal. Depending on the opportunity, we may not pursue all of these equally at the same time, but they represent the kind of therapeutic area where we have the ability to leverage our existing infrastructure and maximize the opportunities.\nNext slide, please. Viatris today already has a unique hybrid model with the requisite capability spanning from what is needed to be successful in the generic space, to a strong base for what is needed in the brand and innovator space. And we expect to further expand on the innovator capabilities as we hone in on the targeted therapeutic areas.\nNext slide, please. To build a durable portfolio of innovative assets, we already have a solid platform to build on. We already have a proven track record in development and have a true development powerhouse. Rajiv will talk about this a little bit later. We already have a global commercial infrastructure. We already have a best-in-class global supply chain, quality and operational excellence. And the Global Healthcare Gateway is the heart of the company as we leverage our existing platform and expand into more innovative areas.\nIn fact, today, we're announcing that we already have entered into our first Global Healthcare Gateway transaction focused on ophthalmology, acquiring an exclusive license for Pimecrolimus Ophthalmic ointment for the treatment of blepharitis, which is a very common type of eye irritation. Blepharitis affects about 6.5 million patients in the U.S. alone. And in the U.S., there's currently no product specifically indicated for chronic blepharitis. This product will contribute to ophthalmology franchise while we continue to search for an anchor asset. And the path to leadership for us starts with the acquisition of an anchor asset in 1 or more of the 3 therapeutic areas as well as expanded R&D investment in those areas. And it's through the Global Healthcare Gateway and our global platform that we believe we can leverage the full global potential of these assets, organically or inorganically add complementary growth assets in some of these therapeutic areas and then leverage the benefit of therapeutic area leadership and focus by leveraging the existing health care provider coverage, leveraging our existing development expertise, leveraging our existing medical expertise, leveraging the connections we have in the scientific community, et cetera. As I said, we see a clear path to therapeutic area leadership in one or several of the TAs that we identified.\nSo let me summarize on the next slide. Viatris of the future is simpler, stronger and more focused. We have and are already executing on a clear plan to reshape the entire company and build a durable higher-margin portfolio consistent of generics, complex products and off-patent brands. We take some strategic actions on certain assets, but add an innovative growth engine of NCEs and 505(b)(2)s in our targeted therapeutic areas. And with this, we expect Viatris to have significant financial flexibility.\nIn addition to debt paydown and dividend growth, we now expect to have the opportunity for increased R&D investment, for extensive BD activities as well as share buybacks. And finally, building on our current platform and capabilities, we intend to have further enhanced commercial medical excellence with a focus on the identified therapeutic areas. Bottom line, a simpler, stronger and more focused company delivering access to patients and value to shareholders.\nWith that, I'd like to hand it over to Rajiv now, who will be giving you more details on our pipeline and how we are further enhancing that pipeline in line with our strategic vision. Thank you, Rajeev.\n\nRajiv Malik\n\nPresident & Executive Director, Mylan NV\n\nThanks, again, Michael. I'm going to focus this next session on the role our strong development platform can play to achieve the end goal of going up the value chain. As we have already touched on, enhancing our R&D is an essential part to achieve the future direction of the company. I am very proud of many accomplishments of our science team over the years. As I see it, we are a development house with capabilities that can be further strengthened and focused in coming years as we continue to move up the value chain. We intend to leverage our Global Healthcare Gateway to further strengthen our R&D engine with differentiated and novel products that target gaps in care. We believe that we are an ideal development partner that offers strong science, regulatory and clinical skills as well as strong global commercial footprint to companies with Phase II and III assets.\nWe'll continue to invest in generics with a focus on complexity and diligently pursue life-cycle management opportunities around our current therapeutic areas. We expect to ramp up our R&D investments steadily to approximately 9% of revenue by 2026.\nThis slide shows our road map to execute our R&D evolution. On the left, you see where our portfolio and pipeline is today, which is a diverse across a wide range of therapeutic areas across segments and markets. We intend to continue to build the pipeline focusing on products with complexity and also investing in life-cycle management of certain key products in our current portfolio of various regions. I'll walk you through certain examples in one of my following pipeline slides.\nWe will seek additional inorganic assets through our Global Healthcare Gateway around current therapeutic areas of regional focus. More importantly, we'll be aggressively looking into several Phase II and Phase III opportunities to build critical mass of new chemical entities and 505(b)(2)s novel products in the 3 focused therapeutic areas of GI, ophthalmology and dermatology, as Michael mentioned. In order to execute our R&D strategy, we will leverage the foundation that has been built over a number of years. This slide highlights our extensive scientific capabilities we have across a broad range of dosage forms and delivery mechanisms. We also have proven expertise in all of the related areas that are essential to develop and scale these types of products up through and including novel products.\nFor example, the robust API and formulation development capabilities; the global expertise in preclinical study design and execution as well as device engineering, strong clinical development and medical affairs across multiple therapeutic areas; strong in-market regulatory, legal and IP skill sets; and broad and scalable manufacturing capabilities. The backbone of this platform is, of course, a strong team of 3,000 scientists and medical professionals working across 12 development centers and having regulatory expertise in 55 markets. We have a broad range of demonstrated clinical experience and have conducted over 80 clinical development and post-marketing programs, including Phase I Phase II, Phase III and Phase IV studies.\nThe bottom line is that we believe we are well positioned to support and enable the advancing of the science of the value chain. There is no better representation of our scientific expertise than this slide are proven results. When we make a decision to pursue the development of a complex generic or a novel product, our track record shows our commitment.\nOn an average, complex products can take 7 to 9 years from development to approval. And we are so proud to bring most of these products first to the market. Recently, we added another first to our basket with the approval of generic Restasis, building off the momentum of our first interchangeable biosimilar assembly. I would like to dive a bit deeper into our existing pipeline to help visualize this progression.\nBeginning with our core generics. As you can see, we have either launched or have approval or have submitted some of significant products such as generics for Revlimid, Xarelto and Eliquis. We are targeting launching many of these core generics in the next 1 to 2 years.\nFlipping to the next slide. As you can see, we are continuing to move up the value chain with more complex products. Projected launch timings for many of these are in the next 2 to 4 years. What's unique about our complex generics pipeline is that it's primarily vertically integrated, giving us a much better control on the execution of these programs and R&D flexibility. You need to succeed and bring these products to the market. It also improves the margin profile of these products as we will no longer be sharing the profits. I'm very confident that like in the past, we are well positioned to bring the first generic of many complex products to the market such as Symbicort, INVEGA TRINZA, [Pentasa] and Abilify long-acting injection.\nAs I mentioned earlier, in the next 5 years, we also intend to invest in the life-cycle management of certain core products in our portfolio to meet unmet patient needs. We are already doing this for many products such as levothoraxin oral suspension, which we have submitted and expected regulatory action this year; glatiramer-once monthly injection, builds upon our success with generic Copaxone. And we are completing the clinical phase of the development in remitting and relapsing multiple sclerosis.\nWe have also initiated a Phase IV trial and are investing in the science around our Yupelri to explore the impact of revefenacin on a peak inspiratory flow rate and further expand the patient base. We are investing in the life-cycle management of our [Zolan] product and have initiated a Phase III study on a low-dose option. We have initiated a clinical study for EFFEXOR in Japan to extend the labeling for generalized anxiety disorder. And we are developing several new fixed dose combinations in cardiovascular for Chinese market. Finally, we are also developing Meloxicam for rapid onset of postsurgical pain. We have submitted our IND and are now entering into our Phase II studies.\nAs we enhance our R&D investments and put our capital to use, we look forward to further concentrating this pipeline around GI, ophthalmology and dermatology. Our pipeline, excluding biosimilars, that we shared with you today is well positioned to deliver approximately $500 million plus in new product launches annually after '23.\nOur total pipeline is valued at $183 billion in IQVIA brand value. This broad pipeline also shows that we will cover almost 80% of the current top 100 IQVIA products, and it's more heavily weighted on complex products. I can hope, you can feel and appreciate the excitement and the confidence we have in our platform. Let's now pivot and discuss the business execution for the near term.\nWhile we reshape Viatris in the coming years, our business execution remains a top priority. I walked you through how we will reshape our portfolio and deliver the pipeline earlier. So now I'll provide an update on how we performed in '21, the progress on integration and how we expect to continue to further stabilize the business in '22.\n'21, we performed strongly as a team while we were creating a new company and navigating a dynamic environment. I truly appreciate and thank all of my colleagues around the world, who seamlessly executed a successful first year as Viatris. We made significant progress with our integration. We executed our restructuring program and achieved our target of approximately $500 million of cost synergies while already executing the Pfizer TSA exits for several programs. We delivered strong overall results, exceeding our expectations across all segments.\nIn developed markets, Europe benefited from our (inaudible) promotion portfolio as well as strong performance in key brands like Influvac, Lipitor and biosimilars. North America's base business performed as expected, despite unexpected competition in products like Miacalcin. Yupelri and EpiPen were other key contributors to the growth. We effectively manage the dynamics of the hospital channel in China while strongly growing the retail segment. Emerging markets responded to the challenge of providing the COVID-19-related products like remdesivir and AmBisome in several of their markets, which help them offset the impact of changing therapy in (inaudible). Japan managed [Allorica] LOE exceedingly well, growing Amitiza and [Lepacrion] while leveraging the portfolio of authorized generics.\nOn the pipeline front, we delivered on our commitment of approximately $700 million in new product revenue and significantly progress our robust pipeline of hard-to-make and complex products. Our science teams once again made us proud with the FDA approval and the launch of the first interchangeable biosimilar assembly to expand access for patients with diabetes. The strong performance across the globe was well supported by our global supply chain, which enabled us to achieve a record high customer service levels while navigating COVID-19. Let me speak on the integration path forward.\nWe remain on track to realize an additional $500 million cost synergies over the next 2 years, resulting in $1 billion cumulative cost synergies since becoming Viatris. Our synergies in '21 were largely focused on actions around cost of goods, SG&A, cost (inaudible) and restructuring. And as planned, the remaining focus for our cost synergies in '22 and '23 is on the restructuring and exiting the remaining Pfizer TSAs. We have already completed a number of TSA exits through February of '22 and expect to exit the remaining TSAs by the end of the year. Let me now talk to you about '22.\nWe are laser-focused to continue to further stabilize the business during this transition period. You will have this slide as a reference point, as I would like to move to the next one to review the headwinds and tailwinds in '22.\nWe are well positioned to build on the momentum of '21. And we will do this by delivering the approximately $600 million of new product launches, which I will talk about more on the next slide; driving growth in our key markets, including Europe, where we expect mid-single-digit growth; as well as China retail, where we continue to invest in the same. The key emerging markets like Turkey, Thailand, Mexico, Brazil and Korea are also expected to grow on the back of a more normalized market environment post COVID-19. Growing products such as Yupelri, Viagra, our Thrombosis portfolio, Creon, Amitiza and Dymista are also expected to grow in '22 and lend strength and stability to the business in the respective geographies; continued ramping up of our market share of interchangeable assembly to mid- to high teens in '22, and building off our successful launch; and by maintaining our leadership in Wixela and Xulane. At the same time, dynamic market conditions are an inherent part of our business. And our job is to perform in this ever-evolving environment.\nSo '22 is going to be no different. We expect mid-single-digit pace business erosion in '22, largely driven by the continuation of increased competition in certain high-margin key products, like Perforomist and Miacalcin; continued implementation of China's health care policy; the changes in the (inaudible) therapy guidelines, which we expect to continue to drive contraction of the market that has been stable or expanding over the last 10 years. We also expect total revenue to be negatively impacted by lower volumes for COVID-19-related products, mostly in our Emerging Markets segment. In '22, we'll also face the inflationary impact on input costs on manufacturing operations of our business.\nGoing into more detail regarding our $600 million of expected new product launches in '22, of which about 1/3 is related to biosimilars. First, I'm excited to highlight that approximately 95% of our new product launches in '22 and '23 are already scientifically executed, meaning that they have been either already launched, approved or are pending approval. Interchangeable insulin Glargine, Revlimid, Restasis, insulin aspart are a few key products in this bucket.\nSo while we have not included Symbicort in our '22 financial guidance, we are happy with the progress on the product and remain ready to launch if the opportunity present itself in '22. While I won't go into great detail on the following segment slides, I'll hit on a few highlights.\nIn developed markets, we expect low single-digit growth, primarily driven by strong performance of Europe. In Europe, we expect to continue to see strong growth, driven by our Thrombosis portfolio, Creon and Influvac, along with the robust new generic launches like Revlimid and Zytiga. In North America, our balanced portfolio of brands, complex generics, injectables and retail generics as well as our robust product launches will help us partially offset the inherent [erosion] in the market as well as competition and lower EpiPen volumes coming off COVID-19 demand in '21. Yupelri will be the one of the key contributors to offset this.\nIn emerging markets, we expect to see a year-over-year decline entirely driven by impact of lower COVID-19 product-related volumes. In JANZ, we expect strong volume growth from our key brands like Amitiza, Lipacreon and EFFEXOR as well as continued success in building our authorized generics. We also expect common price regulations to have an increased impact, resulting in a high single-digit decline year-over-year.\nOur strong and well-established commercial presence in the hospital segment in China will support us as we continue to navigate the evolution of the health care policy. At the same time, we are confident in the macro drivers of China, supported by growth in the health care consumerism and therefore, are focused on continuing to expand our footprint in retail segment.\nTo sum up, it's all about execution of our key priorities. We will complete the integration and realize remaining cost synergies. We will deliver the pipeline and expand our robust development house to move up the value chain, and we will continue further stabilizing the business. While we take actions to reshape the company, we'll close the biosimilar transaction in the second half of '22. We'll start working on the other identified divestment opportunities to continue to unlock value and simplify the portfolio. And more importantly, we'll continue leveraging the Global Healthcare Gateway to find value-creating business development opportunities. With this clear execution plan, we will create a simpler, stronger and more focused company of the future.\nNow I will turn it over to Sanjeev.\n\nSanjeev Narula\n\nCFO, Viatris Inc.\n\nThank you, Rajiv. We had another excellent quarter and closed out the year on a strong note. It's been incredibly successful first full year for Viatris, and I'm really pleased how 2 organizations have come together. Our strong financial performance demonstrate the breadth of our global platform.\nAs I reflect on 2021, we delivered on our integration plan, met our financial commitment for deleveraging and dividend and developed a plan for bold strategic action to reshape our company going forward.\nMoving to Slide 53, we exceeded our November midpoint guidance and total revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. Total revenue was driven by strong performance in developed market, which saw approximately 7% operational growth in Europe, which included the benefit of our thrombosis franchise. In North America, new product revenue was offset by anticipated base business erosion and competition in complex products. Taking these factors into account, generic price erosion was in line with our expectation.\nIn JANZ, the impact from Celebrex and [Lyrica] LOE totaled approximately $600 million and now is largely behind us as we move into 2022. In Greater China, operational revenue was flat to the prior year as we continue to shift our business to the retail channel. Emerging market revenue was impacted by pressure on ARB business due to new treatment regimens, which were partially offset by the benefit of COVID-related products.\nAdjusted gross margin came in at 58.7% for the year, driven by strong brand performance and taking into account competition on key products in North America. In 2021, we were able to execute an accelerated integration time line, which allowed us to capture approximately $500 million in synergies across cost of goods sold and SG&A.\nFree cash flow benefited from underlying business performance, working capital optimization initiatives and low taxes. I'm pleased with the free cash flow generation for the year, which has enabled us to meet on our financial commitment.\nSlide 54 captures our reported financial results relative to the combined adjusted estimates for the prior year.\nSlide 55 identifies the driver of free cash flow for the quarter and full year. As we mentioned late last year, we anticipated Q4 2021 free cash flow to be impacted by several factors. These included timing of interest payment, higher CapEx and anticipated phasing of onetime cash costs. For full year, business performance, working capital benefits and lower cash taxes absorbed the higher onetime cash cost. These costs are expected to step down in 2022 and 2023 as we complete integration and restructuring activities. We delivered on our financial commitment and returned approximately $400 million in dividends and paid down over $2 billion in debt.\nSlide 56 captures key assumptions of the 2022 financial plan. The total revenue estimate assumes base business erosion to be in mid-single-digit range. Foreign exchange had a significant impact on results given our international exposure, which comprises approximately 70% of our total revenue. Key exposures include the euro and yen, with strong appreciation in the U.S. dollar over second half of 2021. And more recently, into 2022, our financial guidance incorporates approximately 2% headwind on the total revenue and adjusted EBITDA.\nWe expect another strong year for new product revenue across a broad range of generic, complex and biosimilar products. In generics, we expect important launches, including Revlimid, Restasis and [Sutent]. In biosimilars, we are seeing solid uptake of interchangeable version of Semglee. Our guidance assumed a full year of biosimilar, which is approximately $875 million in total revenue and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $200 million. New product revenue includes approximately $200 million for biosimilars.\nSlide 57 captures our financial guidance ranges for total revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow and corresponding detailed line item metrics.\nNow turning to revenue build on Slide 58. This bridges the illustrated expected major drivers for 2022 relative to 2021 actuals. Removing the impact of foreign exchange. Our year-on-year total revenue is declining by approximately 2%. Base business erosion consists of 2 buckets. The first is approximately $200 million and is related to expected continued competition on key products, including Miacalcin and Performist. The second captures the expected erosion from price deterioration in North America generics, annual price reset across the Japan product portfolio and the continuing pressure on ARB business due to new treatment regimens and lower COVID-related products. In the base business, we expect strength across categories in Europe and higher volumes in China.\nMoving to Slide 59. We're expecting inflationary pressures across third-party supply chain for input cost, distribution and finished goods. We expect adjusted gross margin to be under slight pressure due to competition on key products and erosion of ARB volumes in emerging markets. Through our planned reshaping initiatives between now and 2026, we intend to invest more in R&D to drive our strategy and pipeline towards NCEs and 505(b)(2)s. On commercial side, our financial guidance reflect investment in some segments to build demand generation and in-market capabilities.\nTurning to Slide 60. We expect another strong year for free cash flow generation. Lower restructuring and integration costs will be partially offset by the impact of EpiPen litigation settlement. We expect to broaden implementation of working capital optimization initiatives in receivable and payable areas to continue to benefit us on free cash flow generation.\nBefore I close, a few point on phasing. We expect total revenue and adjusted EBITDA to be slightly higher in the second half due to ramp of new products and normal product seasonality. We estimate free cash flow will be evenly weighted between first half and second half. In general, the second and fourth quarter tend to be lower due to timing of semiannual interest payments.\nIn closing, we're coming off a strong year and well positioned for a solid start in 2022. The estimated proceeds from the Biocon transactions, along with other reshaping initiatives, are expected to strengthen the company and position us for a long-term success.\n\nMichael Goettler\n\nCEO & Executive Director, Viatris Inc.\n\nThank you, Sanjeev. Thank you, Rajiv. As you can say, we're excited. Look, bottom line from today, what I really want you to take away from this, everything we presented today, is that the entire company, now that we laid out the strategy, the entire company, entire management team is focused on the future of Viatris. We're looking forward to build a company that's simpler, stronger, more focused, that has a portfolio consisting of generics, complex generics, off-patent brands and an increasing innovative growth engine of NCEs and 505(b)2s; a company that has significantly enhanced financial flexibility that we can put to use for either share repurchases and/or BD and R&D.\nAnd if you look at this simply put, the years '22 and '23 are really years of execution, execution against the commitments that we've made for Phase I, the debt pay down, the dividend, the cash flow, the synergies, but also against now all the initiatives that we outlined to set ourselves up properly for success in 2024 and for many years beyond. That's what we're excited about. That's the vision we're laying out today.\nAnd with that, we're going to go to a short break. And after the break, we come back, and we look forward to your questions. Thank you.\n[Break]"

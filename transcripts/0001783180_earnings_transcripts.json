I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Michael Rednor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Rednor\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Carrier's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with me today are David Gitlin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Goris, Chief Financial Officer.\nExcept where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations, excluding restructuring costs and certain significant nonrecurring items. A reconciliation of these and other non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the appendix of the webcast. We also remind listeners that the presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Carrier's SEC filings, including our Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid L. Gitlin\n\nPresident-UTC Aerospace Systems, United Technologies Corp.\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Q3 was generally in line with what we shared in mid-September. At the Laguna Investor Conference, we indicated that North American resi softness would create about a $500 million sales challenge and a $0.20 to $0.25 adjusted EPS headwind in the quarter. The actual impact was consistent with that. Partially offsetting this was better-than-expected performance in Commercial HVAC in the Americas, which was up 30% in the quarter, continued aftermarket traction, cost containment and a discrete tax benefit. .\nWe also drove continued double-digit sales growth across multiple parts of our business, including CSE residential heat pumps, container and our businesses in India and the Middle East.\nIn addition to driving strong growth across many parts of our portfolio, we are taking aggressive cost actions to reduce overhead, including the elimination of about 3,000 indirect positions, which is on top of footprint and direct labor actions required to rightsize for demand in our factories. Given confidence in our strategy and our track record of execution, our Board approved a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization.\nTurning to Slide 4. We are laser-focused on our strategic priorities and continue to gain traction on our key initiatives. Our 3 vectors of growth: products, aftermarket and systems are all progressing very well. With respect to our first vector, which focuses on gaining share through differentiated products, brands and channels, we booked our largest order ever earlier this month, securing another major win with a key hyperscaler.\nWe also converted a top U.S. homebuilder to Carrier, further enhancing our leading position in the new home construction sector. In Europe, we were again recognized for our market-leading Viessmann heat pump products. In addition, our newly introduced Toshiba VRF product line and energy-efficient container units are both contributing to share gains in their respective markets. On aftermarket, we delivered 12% growth in the quarter and remain on track for our fifth consecutive year of double-digit growth.\nConnectivity and digital differentiation remain foundational. Connected chillers were up 30% in the quarter. And last week, we had a major multiyear software win in the Middle East with Abound, our digital platform for buildings. Paid subscriptions for Lynx, our digital platform for transportation, were up 40% in the quarter to about 210,000.\nLast on systems. Field trials for our carrier energy HEMS offering in North America are progressing well, and we remain on track for market introduction mid next year. We also continue to make significant progress on our Quantum Leap integrated system offering for data centers with customer discussions advancing well. In our CSE RLC business in Germany, we continue to qualify additional systems Prophy installers. Certified installers realized growth of 15% to 20% in the quarter, far above the average installer.\nTurning to CSA resi on Slide 5. Though we are, of course, not pleased with the unexpected decline this year, this is a best-in-class business. We hold the #1 market position and our share continues to grow. Our products and brands are second to none. Our extensive distribution and dealer partnerships help provide competitive differentiation. All of this results in great margins and cash flow in this business.\nWe are working with our channel partners to collectively take all of our medicine this year. We are, therefore, being very purposeful about rightsizing field inventory levels as we head into 2026. At the end of Q3, field inventories were down 12% compared to last year. As of today, field inventory levels are down another 10 points since the beginning of the month and are down about 20% versus last year. By year-end, we expect inventory levels in the field to be down 30% versus last year, the lowest level since 2018. We will continue to play offense and given continued investments and our aggressive cost takeout, we expect to realize outsized returns as this business recovers.\nTurning to CSE's RLC business on Slide 6. The good news is that electrification across Europe is accelerating, and we are realizing the mix-up benefit from heat pump adoption. Our residential heat pump sales in Europe were up about 15% in the quarter with heat pump sales in Germany up about 45%. We expect this trend to continue. For example, we have seen heat pump subsidy applications in Germany increase and expect them to double versus last year to 300,000.\nNevertheless, in the category of controlling the controllables, we run the business to be successful independent of subsidies. This is why we have been focused on significantly reducing product and installation costs for our heat pumps to incentivize the continued transition to electrification independent of government subsidies.\nMore broadly, we continue to see a desire across European countries to become less reliant on gas and key leading indicators of continued heat pump adoption remain positive. Just last week, the EU gave another vote of confidence for ETS 2 to become effective on January 1, 2027, which as a reminder, is the system for increased pricing on carbon in heating and transport, supporting the continued transition to electrification. However, for the past couple of years, the strength that we have seen in heat pump unit growth has been more than offset by overall market unit declines driven by boilers.\nWith heating units in markets such as Germany at 15-year lows, these markets are poised for recovery. Importantly, we continue to make key investments in market differentiation and expansion while taking significant cost out, positioning us well for 2026 and beyond.\nTurning to Slide 7. Our commercial HVAC business in CSA has had best-in-class performance over the past 5 years. At the time of our spin, this was the one area within our portfolio where we were underinvested. We said we would invest, gain share and increase margins, and we have. Our investments in technology, know-how, capacity and talent are paying off.\nNot only has the total business more than doubled in 5 years, but also our applied business, aftermarket opportunity to further accelerate our share gains, as you see on Slide 8. Data centers remain a top priority for us, and our traction has been excellent, especially on orders in the past few months.\nWe remain on track to double our sales from $500 million last year to $1 billion this year. We expect to see continued growth in this vertical next year given that we project our backlog entering 2026 for 2026 to be up about 20% year-over-year. Relationships with all the hyperscalers and our colo customers are very strong. Our win rate and size of wins have continued to increase. For example, in addition to multi-hundred million dollar wins with hyperscalers, we recently secured a win with a colo customer in the Americas exceeding $100 million. Our overall backlog has increased quite a bit over the past few months and now extends into 2028.\nBefore I turn it over to Patrick, some high-level perspectives on Slide 9. We are very well positioned to create outsized value for our customers and our shareholders. Through a purposeful transformation, we created a focused yet balanced portfolio with leading positions in targeted geographies and verticals. We like that we are not overly exposed to any one geography or vertical and in fact, have balanced exposure to the right geographies and verticals.\nAs we look ahead, we expect the parts of our portfolio that have been strong to remain strong, particularly commercial HVAC and our aftermarket business, which together constitute just under 45% of our sales. And we expect that those parts that have faced near-term headwinds, particularly RLC in the Americas and Europe and Global Truck Trailer to be positioned for a return to growth. And when they do, we stand to have outsized benefit given our market-leading positions and the aggressive cost actions that we're taking this year.\nIn terms of controlling the controllables as we always do, you know our formula from our Investor Day, share gains through differentiation, sustained double-digit aftermarket growth and investing in systems to drive unique value for our customers and TAM expansion. You can always count on us to drive cost out of the system in a programmatic and aggressive manner, and we will be disciplined with capital allocation with a near-term focus on share buyback.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Patrick. Patrick?\n\nPatrick P. Goris\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 10. For the quarter, reported sales were $5.6 billion, adjusted operating profit was $823 million and adjusted EPS was $0.67. The year-over-year decline in these financial metrics largely relates to much lower volumes in our CSA residential business. The results are largely in line with what we outlined in September with the exception that we saw a $0.07 benefit from a lower tax rate, about $0.05 of which timing between Q3 and Q4.\nTotal company organic growth was down 4%. The 2024 exit of commercial refrigeration was also a 4% headwind, partially offset by a 1% tailwind from currency. Adjusted operating profit was down 21%, primarily due to lower volume in our CSA resi business. Tariffs were net neutral in the quarter. Adjusted EPS was down 13%. We included the year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge in the appendix on Slide 19. Free cash flow of about $225 million reflects lower operating profit as well as higher working capital levels given the sudden reduction in sales.\nMoving on to the segments, starting on Slide 11. Organic sales in the CSA segment declined 8%. Commercial delivered another exceptional quarter with sales up 30%. Residential and light commercial sales came in right about where we expected per our September update. Resi sales were down 30%, driven by a roughly 40% decline in volume, offset by double-digit regulatory mixup and pricing. Light commercial sales declined 4%. Aftermarket sales across the segment increased mid-teens with particular strength in controls. Segment operating margin was 19.7%, down 560 basis points, reflecting the impact of much lower resi volume.\nMoving to the CSC segment on Slide 12. Residential and light commercial sales were down low single digits, reflecting continued heating market unit declines in the region. As Dave mentioned, heat pump sales growth across Europe remains strong. Commercial declined mid-single digits, reflecting some large project timing that we expect to partially recover in Q4. Segment operating margin declined 110 basis points, driven by lower organic sales and mix, partially offset by productivity, including cost synergies. We are accelerating additional reductions in headcount and other cost actions in this segment.\nTurning to the CSAME segment on Slide 13. Organic sales declined 2%. Continued double-digit growth in India and the Middle East was more than offset by ongoing weakness in resi and light commercial in China. Within China, our resi and light commercial business was down mid-teens, partially offset by commercial, which was up mid-single digits. Segment operating margin of 11.6% was primarily driven by strong productivity gains, offset by lower volume.\nFinally, moving to CST on Slide 14. Organic sales were up 6%, led by continued very strong growth in container, partially offset by mid-single-digit decline in Global Truck and Trailer. North America Truck and Trailer was flat. Segment operating margin of 15.4% expanded by 80 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by the 2024 exit of commercial refrigeration.\nTurning to Slide 15. Total company organic orders were down high single digits for the quarter. Excluding CSA resi orders, which were impacted by last year's elevated preordering related to the refrigerant transition, total company orders were up low single digits. CSA residential orders were down about 40% compared to orders up 30% last year. As expected, commercial orders in CSA have been and will continue to be lumpy given large data center wins.\nIn CSA, residential and light commercial orders grew low single digits and are up mid-single digits year-to-date. We expect commercial orders in CSE to pick up in the coming quarters given a strong pipeline, including data center projects in this region. Orders in CSAME were flat with strong growth outside of China. CST orders were exceptionally strong, led by container up about 100% and Global Truck and Trailer, which was up about 25%.\nShifting to guidance and moving to Slide 16. The updated guidance primarily reflects market weakness in our residential and light commercial businesses in the Americas and Europe. We now anticipate CSA resi to be down high single digits versus our prior outlook of up mid-single digits. In Europe, we now anticipate our RLC business to be down mid-single digits versus the prior outlook of about flat.\nPartially offsetting these headwinds, the Americas commercial business is expected to grow over 25% this year, an outstanding performance. Overall, we now expect about $22 billion in sales for 2025. About $700 million of the reduction versus our prior guide relates to CSA resi.\nMoving to profit and cash guide on Slide 17. We are revising our full year adjusted operating margin guidance. Our updated margin expectation for CS Americas and CS Europe reflect volume declines in the RLC businesses in both segments. In addition, we are adjusting our margin outlook for transportation given stronger expected container sales and lower NATT sales.\nWe are adding to the cost reduction actions we initiated earlier this year to rightsize the business and now expect carryover savings in 2026 to amount to over $100 million. The net full year tariff impact in our current guide remains 0 in terms of operating profit. We expect full year adjusted EPS of about $2.65, including a lower adjusted effective tax rate closer to 21% and expect free cash flow of about $2 billion, reflecting lower earnings and higher anticipated cash restructuring costs of about $150 million.\nFinally, we continue to expect about $3 billion of share repurchases this year. Additional full year guide items are in the appendix on Slide 21. With respect to Q4, we expect CSA resi sales down approximately 30% and volumes down about 40% and continued significant headwinds from under-absorption as the channel continues to destock.\nBefore moving to Q&A, let me make a few comments on how to frame 2026. First, we expect to end 2025 with CSA resi destocking behind us. Obviously, we expect a difficult compare in the first half of 2026 in CSA resi, which will have an impact on total company performance, particularly in the first quarter. Second, we are executing on significant cost actions, which we have spoken about previously. This should amount to roughly $0.10 carryover adjusted EPS tailwind next year. Third, we expect about a 100 basis point ongoing benefit from a lower tax rate.\nIn total, we therefore expect about $0.20 of adjusted EPS tailwind in 2026 from the combination of carryover restructuring benefits, tax and share repo. It is too early to comment on the levels of 2026 organic growth, but it's fair to say that we target about 30% conversion. For planning purposes, given heightened levels of uncertainty, we are running the business assuming low single-digit organic growth in 2026. In addition, the net carryover impact of pricing and tariffs is expected to remain dollar neutral based on tariffs and pricing in place today.\nWith that, I would like to ask the operator to open the line for Q&A."

On the call with me today are David Gitlin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Goris, Chief Financial Officer.

We also remind listeners that the presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Carrier's SEC filings, including our Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nWe plan to file certain recast financial statements in connection with our resegmentation, which occurred during the first quarter of 2025. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid L. Gitlin\n\nPresident-UTC Aerospace Systems, United Technologies Corp.\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Another strong quarter. My thanks to our 50,000 team members globally for their continued great work. As expected, our organic growth picked up in 2Q. We delivered 6% organic growth with exceptional 45% growth in commercial HVAC in the Americas, total company aftermarket growth of 13% and very strong growth in India, Japan and the Middle East.\nWe converted the strong organic growth to attractive earnings expanded adjusted operating margins by 130 basis points and increased adjusted EPS by 26%. Free cash flow was also strong with first half free cash flow of about $1 billion. We remain on track for $3 billion of buybacks this year.\nTurning to Slide 4. At our Investor Day on May 19, we laid out our game plan for driving sustained 6% to 8% organic growth by exceeding customer expectations through differentiated products, double-digit aftermarket growth and unique system solutions.\nOn products, we continue to win. With respect to data centers, we are on track to double our revenues to $1 billion this year and are continuing to build our backlog for next year and beyond. Our nondata center commercial HVAC business is expected to grow about 10% this year.\nIn the Americas, we have increased both chiller capacity and revenues by more than 2x over the past few years and continue to build our backlog globally. For example, we recently booked a data center order for $45 million for a customer in the Middle East.\nOur global commercial HVAC sales, which exclude light commercial sales, will be about $6.5 billion in 2025, up close to 20% year-over-year. New product introductions have been instrumental to our win rate. For example, our new large capacity air cooled chiller with a proprietary magnetic bearing centrifugal compressor is both significantly more efficient than our competition and can operate at elevated ambient temperatures.\nBoth key performance requirements from our customers. We also continue to leverage Eastman and Toshiba technologies to introduce differentiated offerings in our ROC businesses. In the Americas, we are about to launch a fully integrated air-to-water heat pump that provides heating, cooling and domestic hot water.\nThis all-in-one solution provides homeowners with improved energy efficiency, frees up valuable indoor square footage and provides us with market expansion and mix up. Our aftermarket sales are up 10% through the first half of the year, and we remain on track for our fifth year in a row of double-digit growth.\nOur number of connected chillers was up 40% in the quarter compared to last year. And over the last 3 years, we have increased the number of connected chillers by more than 3x from roughly 20,000 to 63,000. With respect to Abound, we introduced enhancements to our Abound app that leverage AI to boost operational insights and user efficiency.\nFor our Climate Solutions Transportation business, Lynx subscriptions were up significantly in 2Q and are now close to 200,000. Turning to systems. In North America, our Carrier and team is making great progress. We are working with several utility companies to initiate field testing at homes in the United States for our fully integrated battery heat pump solution this quarter.\nWe remain on track for market introduction next year. We also continue to make significant progress with HEMS in Europe. In 2Q, sales from our Viessmann Systems Prophy Partners showed strong growth, significantly outperforming those of non-prophy partners.\nOn the commercial HVAC side, we continue to build out our capabilities for data centers, including Quantum Leap and its integrated CDU offering and are in active discussions with key customers. Outside of data centers, we recently had an important win with the Shanghai Oriental Hub infrastructure project, which includes a combination of our innovative centrifical chillers, heat pumps and our differentiated building management system.\nBy integrating these offerings, we expect to improve our customers' energy efficiency by about 20%. This is another great example of how fully integrated systems add outsized value to our customers and help us drive differentiation and an increased share of wallet.\nProductivity driven by Carrier Excellence is now deeply ingrained in our DNA as reflected in continued strong adjusted operating margin of 130 basis points to 19.1%. Turning to Slide 5 for a brief update on our RLC business in Europe. Though the overall European market since our combination has been more challenging than we expected, other benefits of the combination have exceeded our expectations.\nOur differentiated strategy around HEMS and Hydronics in the Americas are made possible by Viessmann. HEMS leverages Viessmann's battery, integration and digital expertise. Our global common design around controls and embedded software are both based on Viessmann design standards.\nWe are deploying the underlying technology of Viessmann's one-based digital ecosystem, which connects the company, installers and homeowners on a single platform to the Americas, leveraging our respective supply chains is helping us drive more than $2 million of expected cost synergies by the end of next year, and our purposeful multibrand, multichannel strategy is yielding great results.\nTake, for example, the opportunity around air conditioning in Europe, where only 20% of households have air conditioning versus 90% in the United States. Earlier this year, we introduced new offerings through the Viessmann channel, and our air conditioning sales in Europe were up over 25% in 2Q.\nIn terms of 2Q for RLC Europe, our sales were flattish as we expected. Though Germany was down, our heat pump unit sales in Germany were up over 50%, and the ratio of heat pumps to boiler has improved from 30-70 last year to about 50-50. We like this mix up and combined with our expected reductions in electricity prices and easy compares with total German heating units that are close to historic lows, the business is well positioned for a return to growth.\nOur RLC sales in Europe outside of Germany have returned to growth, up 3% in the quarter, and we expect that to further increase in the second half of this year. The integration of RLC and commercial HVAC in Europe also presents great sales and cost opportunities. Carrier and Viessmann are both top players in commercial and residential, respectively.\nThe countries where Carrier and Viessmann are both leaders are, in many cases, different, which provides the opportunity to leverage each other's respective strengths. Slide 6 is a reminder of where we have come over the past few years. Our portfolio is much more focused and simplified with a higher growth profile.\nAdjusted operating margins have expanded on over 100 basis points per year, and our adjusted EPS has grown at a high-teens CAGR. Despite a few unforeseen headwinds, the team continues to control the controllables and over-deliver, and we remain on track to deliver close to 20% adjusted EPS growth this year.\nOur team continues to deliver strong results, and I am confident that we will do so again in the second half of 2025 and beyond. With that, I will turn it over to Patrick. Patrick?\n\nPatrick P. Goris\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 7. We had a strong second quarter. Sales, adjusted operating profit, margins and adjusted EPS were all ahead of the guide we provided in May. Reported sales were $6.1 billion, with 6% organic sales growth and the point of tailwind from currency translation, partially offset by 4% net headwinds from acquisitions and divestitures, driven by the sale of commercial refrigeration. .\nQ2 adjusted operating profit of $1.2 billion increased 10% compared to last year, driven by organic sales growth and strong productivity. Tariffs were net neutral in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin expanded by 130 basis points compared to last year, about half of which is due to the absence of commercial refrigeration, the balance due to productivity, mix and price offset by mix.\nDuring the last earnings call, we indicated that we expected about 20% adjusted EPS growth. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.92, an increase of 26% year-over-year, better than expected due to slightly higher sales and stronger productivity. Year-over-year adjusted EPS growth was driven by organic revenue growth, strong productivity, lower net interest expense and a lower share count. We have included a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge in the appendix on Slide 18. Free cash flow of $568 million in the quarter was also stronger than expected.\nMoving on to the segments and starting on Slide 8. The CSA segment had another very strong quarter with organic sales growth of 14%. Commercial excluding Noresco led with sales up 45%. Residential sales were up 11%, below our expectations due to lower volume, which was down mid-single digits, reflecting a late start to the cooling season. .\nRegulatory mix up and pricing were all as expected. Combined, they were a benefit of mid-teens organic revenue growth. Over 90% of our volume was 454B. Life Commercial came in as expected, down about 20%. Adjusted operating margin was 27%, up 210 basis points, driven by strong organic growth and productivity.\nOverall, the Americas had another outstanding quarter. Moving to the CSE segment on Slide 9. Organic sales growth in CSE overall and residential and light commercial were both about flat. We delivered strong heat pump growth in Germany, the sales benefit of which was offset by a still weak overall German heating market with total units down about 25% so far this year.\nCommercial was up low single digits. Adjusted operating margin was about flat with cost synergies offset by unfavorable regional and product mix. Moving to the CS Asia Pacific segment on Slide 10. Organic sales were down 4%. Mid-teens or higher sales growth in Japan, India and the Middle East was more than offset by continued weakness in residential China and parts of Southeast Asia.\nWithin China, our residential and light commercial business was down around 20% and commercial was up low single digits. Adjusted operating margin of 15.3% was in line with expectation. The decline year-over-year was driven by lower volume and the absence of a prior year favorable currency-related item partially offset by productivity.\nMoving to CST on Slide 11. Organic sales were down 1% and North America truck and trailer returned to growth and container strength continued with sales up mid-single digits. This was more than offset by weakness in Europe and Asia truck and trailer. Adjusted operating margin of 17.6% expanded 340 basis points compared to last year, largely due to the commercial refrigeration exit.\nTurning to Slide 12. Total company organic orders were down high teens in the quarter as we faced a tough compare versus the prior year, where orders were up 30%. And North America resi was down about 60% compared to orders up over 100% a year ago. This was only partially offset by strength in commercial Americas high-teens, light commercial Americas up over 20% and transportation up high single digits.\nExcluding CSA resi, total company orders were up mid-single digits. Overall, we ended Q2 with a robust and growing longer-cycle backlog in commercial, which sets us up well for a strong second half. Moving on to Slide 13 and shifting to full year guidance. For the total company, we are reaffirming the guide we provided in May.\nWe continue to expect mid-single-digit organic sales growth, about 100% -- about 100 basis points of margin expansion and close to 20% adjusted EPS growth at the midpoint. Moving on to Slide 14. Each segment's organic growth is unchanged, but there are some moving parts within some of the segments, as you can see on the slide.\nMoving to profit and cash guidance on Slide 15. Total company adjusted operating margin expansion remains unchanged, up about 100 basis points versus the prior year. With respect to tariffs, the net tariff impact in our July guide is 0 just as it was in our May guide. The incremental price to neutralize tariffs is now about $200 million versus $300 million in our prior guidance.\nThe margin impact of tariffs is about 20 basis point headwind versus the prior year. As you can see on the slide, we made some minor adjustments to margin expectations in the segments. We are maintaining our estimate for free cash flow of between $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion, reflecting roughly 100% conversion and still expect to repurchase about $3 billion worth of shares in 2025.\nWe are maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance range of $3 to $3.10. Compared to the prior guide, lower sales in CSA resi and light commercial are offset by CSA commercial sales, and we are targeting incremental productivity and cost actions to offset unfavorable mix in CSA and CSE.\nAdditional full year guide items are in the appendix on Slide 20. Some color on Q3. We expect Q3 sales of about $6 billion with mid-single-digit organic growth versus the prior year and anticipate adjusted operating profit to be flat year-over-year.\nIn essence, we get a $200 million year-over-year sales benefit from currency translation and tariffs, tariff-related pricing with no drop through, while the benefit of productivity mix up and price is offset by unfavorable mix due to lower CSA resi sales.\nQ3 EPS is expected to be about $0.80. We expect Q4 EPS to be about -- to be up about 20% similar to first half EPS growth, including the benefit productivity and cost actions.\nIn summary, we remain on track to have another strong year with mid-single-digit organic growth, close to 20% adjusted EPS growth and strong free cash flow. With that, I would like to ask the operator to open up the line for Q&A."

He is leading our Climate Solutions segment in the Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa region, and we are thrilled to have him on board.\nSo a strong and better-than-expected start to the year. Orders were up high single digits with double-digit orders growth in Climate Solutions, Europe and Transportation. Within Climate Solutions America, sales in both residential and commercial were up about 20% each, more than offsetting weakness in light commercial. Global aftermarket remains on track for another year of double-digit growth following 1Q up 8%. Total company backlog was up about 10% year-over-year and 15% sequentially. The team continues to use Carrier excellence to drive strong productivity with core earnings conversion of about 100% and 210 basis points of margin expansion. We drove 27% adjusted EPS growth on 2% organic growth. Free cash flow was $420 million, and we returned about $1.5 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases plus paid down $1.2 billion in debt with no additional maturities until 2027.\nTurning to Slide 4. We made great progress on all 3 drivers of sustained growth: products, aftermarket and systems. In terms of differentiated products, channels and brands, we introduced Carrier's first air-cooled commercial heat pump in Europe, delivering high temperatures, increased energy efficiency, noise reduction and enhanced operational performance. All of which address increased demand for district heating and cooling in Europe. Also, as we displayed at the recent ISH Show in Frankfurt, we are gaining traction selling our Carrier-branded air-to-air residential heat pumps in Europe leveraging Viessmann's channel. Aftermarket strength continues. We drove tremendous progress in the attachment rates on our commercial chillers now surpassing 60% for the first time and we now have over 50,000 connected chillers, up about 5,000 versus the prior quarter. Aftermarket for Global commercial HVAC was up about 10%, supported by margin upgrades, which grew about 20%. We also introduced a smart device application for LYNX Fleet, providing increased real-time visibility, enhance customer operational efficiency and reduce costs while maintaining cold chain integrity. On systems, we introduced Viessmann's Profi to accelerate and expand our HEMS sales in Europe. Selling heat pumps versus boilers is a mix-up sales benefit of about 4 to 1 selling complete systems versus boilers is a mix-up benefit of closer to 8:1 with more value to the homeowner. So we see this as a significant win-win opportunity for sustained growth and customer stickiness. For HEMS in the United States, we announced an exciting new partnership with Google to enhance grid resilience and support smarter energy management. By integrating Carrier HEMS technology with Google's cloud, AI and analytics, we will help increase the efficiency of the existing energy infrastructure, reduce grid congestion, unlock greater energy utilization and reduce energy costs to the homeowner.\nTurning to Slide 5 for an update on the residential and light commercial business in Europe. Organic orders were up mid-teens, driven by strength in heat pumps, offset by a decline in boilers. Germany heat pump subsidy applications in Q1 were up significantly, the highest 1 we have seen in the past 5 years. Our RLC Europe book-to-bill was 1.3 and our backlog was up 60% sequentially. Organic sales were down about 10% as we expected, and we project the RLC Europe business to return to modest growth in 2Q. Revenue synergies remain on track for about $100 million this year and about $200 million next year. Cost synergies also continue to be strong, and we are on track to achieve more than $200 million by the end of next year.\nA few comments on the recent election in Germany. We were pleased to see that the new coalition government is committed to the European Union's 2030 climate goals, which include a 55% reduction in carbon emissions, which will contribute to a continued shift to electric heating. Also encouraging is the coalition's continued support for heat pump subsidies and its EUR 500 billion infrastructure investments, including about EUR 100 billion for additional green investments. Importantly, new government is also committed to bringing down electricity pricing by at least $0.05 per kilowatt, which is expected to bring the ratio of electricity to gas prices below 3. Further improving the ratio will be ETF 2, where across Europe in 2027, we expect fossil fuel prices to increase. All in, we're pleased with improving heat pump demand and traction on our key growth initiatives.\nA word on our guidance and the macro environment on Slide 6. Let me first say that we, of course, support free and fair trade. Also, Carrier is proud to be the largest U.S. domiciled player in our industry and we've grown our domestic headcount by about 20% over the past 5 years, and we continue to invest in our U.S. workforce and factories. With respect to tariffs, virtually all of our imports from Mexico are U.S. MCA compliant. For the tariffs that are in effect today, China is about 80% of our exposure. As reflected in our guidance, we are fully mitigating our tariff exposure through supply chain and productivity actions with the balance of about $300 million via price, which represents a little over 1% of additional pricing. In addition, given the fluidity of the current market environment, we are taking additional cost containment measures. Based on our strong start to the year and current FX rates, we are increasing our full year adjusted EPS guide to $3 to $3.10, which is up about 20% year-over-year.\nAs always, our team is committed to taking the actions needed to deliver on our commitments to our customers and investors. You saw this when we address COVID and supply chain disruptions, and we are confident that you'll see us do the same here. Importantly, while we remain clear-eyed and prudent given the current macroeconomic uncertainty, we will remain laser focused on our customers and continue to invest in differentiation and solutions to drive sustained outsized growth for years to come.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Patrick.\n\nPatrick P. Goris\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 7. As Dave mentioned, we had a strong start to the year with earnings ahead of our expectation than the guide we provided in February. Reported sales were $5.2 billion with 2% organic sales growth, including about 2 points of price. The impact of mix up and volume was net neutral. We had an unfavorable 5% net impact from acquisitions and divestitures and a point of headwind from foreign currency. Organic sales were largely in line with expectations with stronger-than-expected performance in Climate Solutions Americas, partially offset by weaker performance in Climate Solutions, Asia, Middle East and Africa. Europe and transportation came in largely as expected. Q1 adjusted operating profit increased 10% compared to last year, driven by strong productivity and price. As a result, adjusted operating margin expanded by 210 basis points compared to last year. The absence of commercial refrigeration was about a 70 basis point tailwind to margin. Adjusted EPS of $0.65 was up 27% year-over-year and better than expected due to strong productivity performance. Compared to last year, adjusted EPS growth was driven by improved adjusted operating profit, lower net interest expense from deleveraging and a lower share count. We have included a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge in the appendix on Slide 19. Free cash flow of $420 million in the quarter was also stronger than expected, driven by higher net income, lower-than-expected seasonal working capital build and lower capital expenditures. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.3 billion worth of shares. And in April, we repurchased an additional $320 million worth of shares. We continue to target $3 billion of share repurchases in 2025.\nMoving on to the segments, starting on Slide 8. The CSA segment had a very strong quarter, with organic sales growth of 9%. A bit more than half of the sales growth came from volume and mix up, the balance from price. Commercial ex NORESCO and residential strength continued with organic sales in both businesses up around 20%. Within residential, regulatory mix up was the high single-digit organic growth benefit with the balance split between volume and price. About 75% of our resi volume was 454 B, and we are realizing the expected 10% mix up. Light Commercial came in lower than expected, down around 35% with a tough compare versus prior year, which was up about 20%. Adjusted operating margins expanded 420 basis points, driven by strong organic growth and productivity. Overall, CSA had an outstanding quarter.\nMoving to CFE on Slide 9. About 75% of this segment sales represent residential light commercial or RLC, of which about 85% is represented by Viessmann Climate Solutions and 15% legacy Carrier. Commercial represents about 25% of the segment sales. Organic sales in CSE were down 7% with mid-single-digit growth in commercial, offset by about a 10% decline in ROC, largely in line with expectations. Adjusted operating margin declined 390 basis points driven by lower volume, mix and investments, partially offset by favorable cost synergies. At 9%, we are confident that we can and will drive significant margin improvement in this segment. We expect volumes to improve. We are addressing underperformance of Carrier's legacy ROC business. Commercial margins are on an improving trend, and there is significant additional opportunity to streamline and drive synergies within the region. More on that at our upcoming Investor Day in a few weeks.\nMoving to the CS AME segment on Slide 10. Organic sales were down 6%, driven by continued weakness in residential China and parts of Southeast Asia, partially offset by growth in Japan and India. Within China, our residential light commercial business was down around 20% and commercial was up low single digits. Both businesses faced challenging compares versus the prior year, which were both up around 10%. Despite the organic sales decline, adjusted operating margin for this segment expanded 240 basis points as a result of productivity and the absence of a prior year unfavorable currency impact.\nMoving to CST on Slide 11. Organic sales were up 2%, driven by container up 20% and partially offset by global truck and failure, which was down low single digits with over 30% growth in Asia, low single-digit declines in North America and high single-digit decline in Europe. Adjusted operating margin expanded 210 basis points compared to the prior year, mainly due to the commercial refrigeration exit.\nTurning to Slide 12. Total company organic orders momentum continued up high single digits. As you can see on the slide, we had high single-digit or double-digit orders growth in all segments, but CSAM. Within AME, China orders were down high single digits with a high teens decline in ROC and up mid-single digits in commercial where we continue to build backlog. Within transportation, within transportation, orders were up double digits, driven by global truck and trailer, where North America orders were very strong compared to last year. Overall, we ended Q1 with a robust longer-cycle backlog in commercial and continued broad orders momentum in over 85% of our business.\nMoving on to Slide 13. We and shifting to full year organic sales guidance. We continue to expect mid-single-digit organic sales growth. Given current FX rates, reported sales are now expected to be a bit above $23 billion compared to $22.5 billion to $23 billion in the February guidance. Also compared to the February guide we now expect slightly higher organic sales in CSA driven by tariff-related pricing to be offset by lower volume, mainly in light commercial. No other material changes in our organic growth outlook.\nMoving to profit and cash guide on Slide 14. At the top of the slide, you can see our margin expectations for each segment. Total company adjusted operating margin expansion remains unchanged and about 100 basis points versus the prior year.\nI will cover adjusted EPS on the next slide. But before I do, we are maintaining our estimate for free cash flow of between $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion reflecting roughly 100% conversion.\nMoving to Slide 15. We are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance range by $0.05 to a new range of $3 to $3.10. Stronger productivity and updated currency is partially offset by slightly lower expected volume. The net impact of tariffs is neutral.\nSome additional color on Q2. We expect sales of about $6 billion, 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and 20% adjusted EPS growth. Additional guide items are in the appendix on Slide 18.\nIn summary, Q1 was a strong start to the year. For 2025, we anticipate solid mid-single-digit organic sales growth, strong margin expansion and close to 20% adjusted EPS growth.\nWith that, I would like to ask the operator to open the line for Q&A."

I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Michael Rednor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Rednor\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Carrier's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with me today are David Gitlin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Goris, Chief Financial Officer.\nExcept where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from operations, excluding restructuring and significant nonrecurring items. A reconciliation of these and other non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the appendix of the webcast. We also remind listeners that the presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Carrier's SEC filings, including our Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid L. Gitlin\n\nPresident-UTC Aerospace Systems, United Technologies Corp.\n\nThanks, Mike, and welcome aboard. Let me start by saying thank you to our team for delivering great results in 2024 while completing such a significant portfolio transformation. I am more excited about 2025 than I have ever been entering a new year. I feel as if all of the work done by so many Carrier over so many years has positioned us for this moment to create outsized value for our customers, people and shareholders.\nAs you can see on Slide 2, 2024 was a strong and transformational year for us. We achieved 3% organic growth by delivering double-digit growth in global commercial HVAC and aftermarket, both for the fourth consecutive year to help offset unexpected weakness in residential light commercial HVAC in Europe and China. Total company orders were up low teens with HVAC Americas supplied up about 40%. Our global commercial HVAC backlog is up mid-teens versus last year, positioning us for another year of double-digit growth in 2025 in that business. For overall Carrier, organic growth and strong productivity contributed to close to 100% core earnings conversion, 180 basis points of margin expansion and 16% adjusted EPS growth. We delivered these strong results while we successfully completed our portfolio transformation. We integrated with Viessmann Climate Solutions and executed on our divestitures, yielding over $10 billion in gross proceeds. And as committed, we paid down debt and returned to roughly 2x net leverage. We also returned over $2.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nTurning to Slide 3. I think of our year since spin in 3 phases. During our first phase, we built the foundation for a new Carrier we promoted and added key talent we launched and have lived a new culture embedded in the Carrier way that has given us tremendous energy and a focus on growth and innovation. We launched Carrier excellence to drive operational execution, excellence and productivity. We invested in our product portfolio and developed and implemented our aftermarket playbook to position us for sustained organic growth. We sold Chubb, added Toshiba, simplified the backed office and paid down debt. 2023 and 2024 were fined by our mantra of performing while transforming. We sharpened our vision and successfully transformed our portfolio. We now have greater bandwidth to create even more value for our customers and thus our shareholders. Focus simplification, differentiation, customers, win, grow. The new phase accelerating growth has begun and there is tremendous energy within Carrier.\nAs we navigated this transition, we have been purposefully increasing our addressable market and value proposition for our customers, as you can see on Slide 4. In 2020, we began to not only increase our investments in our product portfolio, we significantly increased our focus on digitally enabled life cycle solutions market has increased our addressable market, contributed to margin expansion all while creating greater customer stickiness and increasing recurring revenues. Now in addition to driving differentiated products in aftermarket, we are introducing fully integrated systems, which further increased customer value across our 3 targeted ecosystems, homes, buildings and the cold chain. For Integrated Systems and homes, we are significantly expanding and enhancing our European home energy management system offerings. And through a newly created business within Carrier called Carrier Energy, we are bringing similar offerings to the United States. For the U.S., we are actively working with utilities to provide an end-to-end integrated battery heat pump solution with automated controls to run the system using stored energy during peak hours while recharging the system during the trough of energy grid usage. The interest from utilities and other customers have been very encouraging to address grid constraints and resiliency.\nWithin Building Systems, one offering is our integrated cooling solution for data centers that we announced last week under the brand of Quantum Leap. By combining traditional cooling, liquid cooling and our building and server management systems, we provide differentiated, more efficient solutions for our customers in this important and growing vertical.\nFor cold chain solutions, we are transitioning from solely selling reefers to providing end-to-end systems enabled by our Linx Digital platform and Sensitech technologies. Selling complete integrated systems provides us with a new and important opportunity for differentiation, customer value and increased revenue streams.\nSlide 5 lays out our strategic focus areas and priorities for 2025. In addition to our growth initiatives that we just discussed, we also remain laser-focused on margin expansion through carrier excellence while maintaining disciplined capital allocation. We deeply embed our priorities throughout our organization through a structured goal alignment process.\nSlide 6 shows how these priorities are reflected in our 2025 guidance. Given our strategic positioning, we expect organic growth in single digits with our fifth consecutive year of double-digit growth in aftermarket and global commercial HVAC. We will continue to drive productivity and expect 100 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion. We expect adjusted EPS to be up 17% at the midpoint and about 100% free cash flow conversion. As we look ahead, we will continue to focus on execution within Viessmann Climate Solutions, which we discuss on Slide 7.\nObviously, 2024 was well off what we expected coming into the year. Nevertheless, I am proud that the team controlled the controllables and drove share gains, significant cost synergies and key new product introductions. The team also took the tough but necessary actions to significantly reduce both temporary and structural overhead costs, positioning us for strong margin expansion as growth returns. Looking at our growth algorithm for 2025. Given political and economic uncertainty in Europe, we assume that market volume will be flat to down mid-single digits. In addition, we expect a 5-point full year revenue headwind associated with last year's Q1 backlog reduction, which normalized at the beginning of Q2 of last year.\nOn the positive side, we expect continued positive mix with double-digit growth in heat pumps offsetting a modest decline in boilers. Similar to last year, we expect VCS aftermarket to grow double digits, and we also expect a point or so of price. New products introduced last year, including the 19- and 40-kilowatt heat pumps will see a full year of sales in 2025. We are introducing a full lineup of cascadable heat pumps up to 560 kilowatts with natural refrigerants that we will be selling through the Viessmann channel. As we think about revenue synergies, we are excited for the ISH trade show in Frankfurt in March, where we will showcase our new multi-brand products such as our newly launched carrier branded air conditioning units that we will also be selling through the Viessmann channel. We gained share in key European geographies last year and expect that to continue in 2025. We and the team has been putting all the pieces together to significantly increase our complete home energy management system sales this year and beyond. We also remain confident in margin expansion and cost synergies. So all in, we expect a strong year across carrier with accelerated organic growth, margin expansion, EPS growth and strong free cash flow.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Patrick. Patrick?\n\nPatrick P. Goris\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8. In short, Q4 earnings were ahead of our expectations and the guide we provided in October. Reported sales were $5.1 billion, with 6% organic sales growth, including about 2 points of price and 4 points of volume. We had a favorable 13% net impact from acquisitions and divestitures. Organic sales were in line with expectations, driven by continued strength in global commercial and the North America residential HVAC, partially offset by weakness across residential and light commercial HVAC in Europe and China. Q4 adjusted operating profit was up 65% compared to last year, driven by the contribution of Viessmann Climate Solutions, the benefit of organic growth and productivity. As a result, adjusted operating margin expanded by 370 basis points compared to last year. The absence of commercial refrigeration was about 0.5 point tailwind to margin. Adjusted EPS of $0.54 was up 50% year-over-year. Operational performance was in line with our guide, and we benefited from discrete tax items. Net interest expense was a bit light versus our guide given the earlier close of the commercial and residential fire business. Free cash, and I'll now refer to both continuing and disc ops, was an outflow of about $90 million in the quarter. Full year free cash flow of $30 million was about $200 million better than we guided. Having closed residential and commercial fire in early December, we picked up the pace on share repurchases, and we ended 2024 with about $1.9 billion of share repurchases, about $1 billion more than our October guide.\nMoving on to the segments, starting on Slide 9. The HVAC segment had another strong quarter with organic sales growth of 11%. Organic sales in the Americas were up high teens. Within the Americas, Commercial was up mid-teens and light commercial was a little better than expected and down around 10%. In the fourth quarter of 2023 light commercial was up about 20%, so certainly a tough comp. Residential was up 35%, mostly driven by strong volume compared to a very weak Q4 last year which was about minus 20% as our channel was in destocking mode a year ago.\nOn the last earnings call, we mentioned that we expected no material prebuy in Q4. The actual prebuy was in line with expectations and movement was stronger than expected, movements that is sales from our distributors to installers has continued to be strong in January this year. Organic sales in EMEA were flat, driven by double-digit growth in commercial, offset by a decline in residential and light commercial HVAC reflecting continued market weakness. Organic sales in Asia were slightly positive, driven by strength in Japan and South Asia, partially offset by declines in our residential and light commercial business in China. The HVAC segment adjusted operating margins were up 250 basis points, driven by the benefit of organic growth and strong productivity. As you can see at the bottom of the slide, 2024 was another great year for our HVAC business with continued growth and margin expansion.\nTransitioning to Refrigeration on Slide 10. Q4 was the first quarter without commercial refrigeration given its exit on October 1. Overall, results for this segment were as expected. Our global truck and trailer business was down around 10% and with North America down about 25% and Europe down low single digits, only partially offset by high single-digit growth in Asia. Container was down low single digits. Our aftermarket and Sensitech businesses were both up mid-single digits. Operating margin expanded by 160 basis points year-over-year. For the full year, this segment was down 1% organically with container up roughly 25% and mostly offset by declines in North America truck and trailer. Margins expanded 20 basis points.\nTurning to Slide 11. Total company orders total company organic orders were up low teens. Overall, HVAC orders were up about 5% with continued strong orders growth in the Americas at about 10%. EMEA and Asia organic orders were down mid-single digits. In Asia, weak orders in China residential light commercial HVAC were partially offset by China Commercial HVAC orders and strength in other countries. Globally, commercial HVAC orders were up about 10%. Refrigeration orders were up around 55% in the quarter, mostly as a result of very strong growth in North America truck trailer on an easy comp. Truck and trailer orders in Europe were up over 20% and Asia orders were up mid-single digits. Overall, we entered 2025 with robust longer-cycle backlogs in commercial HVAC and orders momentum in key businesses.\nMoving on to Slide 12 and shifting to 2025 organic sales guidance. We expect mid-single-digit organic growth and reported sales of between $22.5 billion and $23 billion. This also includes a $750 million year-over-year headwind from the commercial refrigeration exit. We expect roughly a 1 point, we expect roughly 1 point of price and the remaining organic growth to come from volume and mix up. We expect currency translation to be at about 1 point of headwind.\nThe organic growth for Board segments is expected to be up mid-single digits for 2025. Within HVAC, we expect the Americas to be up high single digits driven by continued double-digit growth in commercial high single-digit growth in residential, driven by the new refrigerant mix up and low to mid-single-digit growth in light commercial. We expect Europe to be up low single digits with commercial up double digits and flat sales growth in residential and light commercial. Dave just walked you through our assumptions for flat sales growth in this market segment.\nFinally, within Asia, we expect low single sales growth with China sales flat and mid-single-digit growth outside of China. Within Refrigeration, we expect Global Truck and trailer to be up mid-single digits with North America truck trailer returning to growth in the second half of the year. We expect mid- to high single-digit growth in container and double-digit growth in Sensitech.\nMoving on to Slide 13, profit and cash guidance. Total company adjusted operating margin is expected to be up about 100 basis points compared to 2024 and with half of the increase driven by volume, price and net productivity, partially offset by investments. The absence of commercial refrigeration contributes 50 basis points of margin expansion. Core earnings conversion that is excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and FX is expected to be about 30%. We estimate free cash flow to be about $2.4 billion -- to be between $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion, reflecting roughly 100% conversion with normal seasonality. We Finally, we intend to repurchase about $3 billion in shares. Through last week, we repurchased about 900 million of shares so far this year. We estimate that average diluted share count for 2025 will be down about 5% from 2024.\nMoving to Slide 14. We expect adjusted EPS between $2.95 and $3.05, up 17% at the midpoint. The building blocks are identical to what we shared with you on the last earnings call, except for currency. Adjusted EPS growth includes about $0.30 of operational performance driven by volume leverage, price and net productivity and about $45 million of corporate stranded cost elimination, partially offset by investments. We expect foreign currency translation to represent a headwind of about $0.05. As a result of debt paydown, we expect net interest expense to be a $0.05 to $0.10 tailwind.\nFinally, we expect a lower share count, partially offset by a 22% tax rate and NCI to provide another $0.10 to $0.15 of EPS benefit.\nWith respect to capital deployment, we'll pay down $1.2 billion worth of debt this quarter. The dividend per share increases by 18%. And as I mentioned earlier, share repurchases are expected to amount to $3 billion this year. As usual, additional guide items are in the appendix on Slide 17.\nFinally, let me provide some additional color on the first quarter. We anticipate Q1 revenues to be about flat sequentially, a little more than $5 billion, with first quarter organic revenue growth flat, up low single digits. This reflects continued strength in global commercial HVAC and a tough comparison in resulite commercial HVAC in Europe and China. We expect organic growth for refrigeration to be about flat. We expect about 100 basis points of margin expansion in Q1 and adjusted EPS to be between $0.55 and $0.60. So overall, we ended 2024 on a strong note and expect 2025 to be another year of strong financial performance.\nWith that, we'll open it up for questions."

I would like to introduce your host for today's conference\n\nSamuel Joel Pearlstein\n\nVP of IR, Carrier Global Corporation\n\nThank you, and good morning, and welcome to Carrier's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. With me here today are David Gitlin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Goris, Chief Financial Officer. We will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call, which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in our earnings presentation, which is available to download from Carrier's website at ir.carrier.com.\nThe company reminds listeners that the sales, earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided during the call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Carrier's SEC filings, including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Once the call is open for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up to give everyone the opportunity to participate. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Dave Gitlin.\n\nDavid L. Gitlin\n\nPresident-UTC Aerospace Systems, United Technologies Corp.\n\nThank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. Let me first welcome Ed Dried into Carrier, who comes to us from RTX Collins Aerospace to lead our Refrigeration business, bringing extensive experience driving business growth and delivering results. Ed succeeds Tim White has moved into a new Chief Product Officer role responsible for program execution and our increased focus on global platforms, both reporting to me. Welcome, Ed, and thank you, Tim.\nPivoting to 2Q, another strong quarter. Q2 organic sales -- or excuse me, Q2 organic orders were up roughly 30% year-over-year and HVAC organic orders were up over 40% with very strong order intake in data centers. Better-than-expected and continued strong sales growth in our global commercial and light commercial HVAC businesses helped to offset weakness in our RLC businesses in Europe and China.\nImportantly, our resi business in North America returned to year-over-year volume growth and given strong orders and low inventory channel levels, we are now poised for a strong second half. Also, we continue to execute well, as reflected by another quarter of significant margin expansion. Q2 adjusted operating margins expanded by 200 points to 18.1% and adjusted EPS was again up double digits, fueled by strong productivity driven by our Carrier Excellence business operating system.\nWhile we perform, we continue to transform -- we closed on the sales of our access solutions and industrial fire businesses, KFI closed on its sale, and we expect to close the Commercial Refrigeration transaction around the end of Q3. We are also making great progress on the sale of our Residential and Commercial Fire business. Strong free cash flow in the quarter of about $550 million and our progress on the business exits have contributed to our significant net debt reduction in the quarter and have positioned us to initiate a multibillion dollar share buyback, $1 billion targeted for the second half of this year.\nAs you can see on Slide 4, we continue to stay laser-focused on and make great progress towards our North Star being the global leader in intelligent climate and energy solutions. Each word of our vision has meaning, and we are purposeful in our investments to prioritize the key elements of our strategy. As a global leader, we have gained share across all major segments. Connectivity is a key enabler to provide scalable intelligent solutions.\nWe now have almost 40,000 connected chillers on track to 50,000 by year-end. Our Abound intelligent building platform now monitors over 1.1 billion square feet, and we currently have over 150,000 paid subscriptions for our Lynx cold chain platform. We have also established an AI center of excellence. Internally, we are targeting increased productivity for everything from contract reviews where we have seen improved productivity of up to 90% to call centers. Externally, we now provide services to customers combining classic and generative AI, analyzing data alongside service and maintenance records to deliver more real-time and proactive chiller maintenance.\nWe continue to innovate and launch differentiated sustainable solutions. In Q2, we introduced a low GWP variant of our award-winning AquaEdge water cool chiller. Likewise, we are the first to offer 3 to 10-ton entry tier rooftop units using our highly differentiated EcoBlue fan technology with low GWP refrigerants. All these offerings provide our customers with energy savings while reducing their greenhouse gas emissions.\nWe play a key role in enhancing grid resilience. For example, Viessmann Climate Solutions recently launched a battery energy storage system with expanded capacity from 15-kilowatt hours to now 75-kilowatt hours, importantly expanding our addressable market. The solutions concept relates to the unique value propositions that we provide to our customers and greater recurring revenues they provide to us. You see examples of our continued traction on aftermarket on Slide 5.\nAftermarket growth in Q2 was 9%, and we are confident that this year, we will deliver another year of double-digit growth. We have further refined our playbook with new digital tools that we have cascaded globally driving both better execution and new solutions for our customers. We are confident that our proven formula works as we continue to target double-digit aftermarket growth forever.\nMoving to Slide 6. About a year ago, we announced that we would be transforming Carrier into a more focused pure-play higher-growth company with significantly higher exposure to the secular tailwinds around sustainability, electrification and energy resilience. I am proud to report that our team continues to do what we say we're going to do. We are successfully integrating with Viessmann Climate Solutions a truly world-class organization. Our divestitures remain very much on track and we are deploying the proceeds as committed.\nOur first 3 exits will yield over $7 billion in gross proceeds. Our commercial and residential fire exit is also progressing well, supported by excellent business performance. We plan to announce a signed agreement before the end of Q3 with a transaction closed around year-end. Given our progress, we have reduced net debt by over $5 billion in the second quarter and plan to initiate our multi billion dollar buyback that I mentioned earlier. With the portfolio transformation tracking to plan, we are heads down focused on working with Viessmann Climate Solutions to realize the full potential of this tremendous combination and you can see our progress on Slide 7.\nThis is truly a world-class team and business. Our heat pumps are unquestionably differentiated, providing superior electricity savings for our customers. noise attenuation, energy efficiency, ease of installation, reliability and aesthetics are all best-in-class. We have added 1,500 direct-to-installer relationships this year and continue to expand our network. The successful launch of our new larger capacity heat pumps will give us a point of growth this year, and we expect more than that next year.\nViessmann Climate Solutions has gained share in heat pumps across all primary countries where it sells with particular strength in Germany. We have also realized positive price year-to-date. We have identified hundreds of millions of dollars of run rate synergy savings. The most immediate opportunity is leveraging our respective channels. For example, in Europe, we have already delivered our first Carrier branded air conditioning units and our Beretta branded boilers through the Viessmann channel.\nGiven that only 20% of homes in Europe have air conditioning, roughly 12% in Germany, we see a unique opportunity for us to grow in the cooling-only space. We are also leveraging our combined technology strengths. Examples include deploying Viessmann's one-base digital platform across all residential applications and at a systems level, working to provide unique home energy management solutions for North America using Viessmann's battery and systems integration capabilities. We remain on track to achieve $75 million of cost synergies this year, and over $200 million by year 3 with particular progress on supply chain, logistics and value engineering.\nThe team is also taking tough but necessary additional cost control actions. All of this set us up for higher conversion rates. We are also clear that the residential market in Europe has been weaker than we expected. BCS Q2 sales were down about 30% year-over-year, roughly 1/3 of which was driven by lower solar PV sales. And our revised outlook for 2024 assumes about a 15% drop in year-over-year sales with a typical seasonal pickup in the second half.\nImportantly, we still have deep conviction in the long-term strategy and growth profile of the business. The EU remains steadfast in its target for 55% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and the shift to heat pumps must play a critical role. Over 25% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe come from boilers in homes. Heat pumps are clearly the best alternative to fossil fuel home heating. So we remain confident in this continued long-term transition.\nThe reality in our industry is that the macro surrounding certain geographies and verticals will not be strong every year. And the great thing is that we have been very purposeful about constructing our portfolio to provide focus, resiliency, balance, growth and increased exposure to key secular trends all of which you see on Slide 8. We love our positions globally. We are #1 or 2 in most segments with prospects to achieve the same ranking in other targeted segments.\nNot only do we believe that we have the right presence in the right markets, we have the global scale and engineering operations, aftermarket and other functions to benefit the entire portfolio. The combination of our portfolio and our performance culture gives us confidence that we will continue to consistently deliver on our commitments. As we look ahead to 2025, we are poised for strong growth across a significant percentage of our portfolio. With that, I will turn it over to Patrick. Patrick?\n\nPatrick P. Goris\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 9. We had a good second quarter. Earnings were in line with our expectations and ahead of our implied adjusted EPS guide provided in April. Reported sales of $6.7 billion were up 12% with organic sales up 2%. Acquisitions and divestitures had a net contribution to sales of 11%, substantially all driven by Viessmann Climate Solutions, partially offset by the absence of 1 month for Access Solutions. .\nQ2 adjusted operating profit of over $1.2 billion was up 26% compared to last year, mostly driven by the contribution of Viessmann Climate Solutions, price and productivity. Continued strong productivity also led to a 200 basis points adjusted operating margin expansion. Core earnings conversion that is excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and currency, was over 200% in the quarter.\nAdjusted EPS of $0.87 was up 10% year-over-year. Compared to last year, organic growth price and productivity more than offset the dilutive impact of the Viessmann Climate Solutions acquisition. We have included a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge in the appendix on Slide 22. Compared to our Q2 expectations, headwinds from lower earnings at Viessmann Climate Solutions and the earlier timing of the Access Solutions exit were offset by stronger sales in commercial HVAC and North America light commercial HVAC, productivity and a few cents from the timing of taxes. Free cash flow of about $550 million was better than expected, mainly driven by working capital performance and on a year-to-date basis, free cash flow is up 35% compared to last year.\nMoving on to the segments, starting on Slide 10. HVAC reported sales growth of 18% and reflects the contribution of Viessmann Climate Solutions and organic sales growth of 2%. Organic sales in the Americas were up mid-single digits, driven by double-digit growth in commercial and light commercial. North American resi was up about mid-single digits, and we expect volume to be up year-over-year in each of the remaining quarters. Organic sales in EMEA were up low single digits, driven by about a 15% increase in commercial HVAC, partially offset by weaker residential and light commercial sales.\nSales in Asia Pacific were down around 8% driven by weakness in our residential and light commercial markets in China, partially offset by double-digit growth in South Asia. The HVAC segment expanded adjusted operating margins by 110 basis points due to net price and strong productivity. Overall, another strong quarter for HVAC. Transitioning to refrigeration on Slide 11. Organic sales were up 1% and reported sales were flat. Within transport refrigeration, container was up around 35% year-over-year, while global truck and trailer was down mid-single digits, driven by about a 15% decline in North America. European truck and trailer was up mid-single digits and Asia truck and trailer was up over 25%.\nOur Sensitech business, which provides solutions for tracking and monitoring temperature was up mid-single digits. Commercial refrigeration was down mid-single digits year-over-year. Adjusted operating margin was flattish compared to last year. This was driven by favorable net price and productivity offset by business mix.\nMoving on to Fire & Security on Slide 12. Reported sales were down 7% with 3% organic sales growth, partially offset by a 10% headwind from the absence of 1 month of Access Solution and the deconsolidation of KFI in last year's second quarter. The residential and commercial fire business was up mid-single digits and is performing well. Adjusted operating margins were up a significant 310 basis points year-over-year as organic volume growth and strong productivity more than offset headwinds of the business exits. Overall, a very strong quarter for this segment.\nTurning to Slide 13. Total company orders were up about 30% in the quarter. Overall, HVAC orders were up over 40% with strength across key verticals. Within the Americas, orders were up over 70% with commercial orders up over 40% and light commercial orders about 5%. North America resi orders were up over 100% or around 60% when excluding preordering for late Q3 and Q4 deliveries this year. EMEA organic orders were up over 10%, with commercial orders up over 15%. Organic resi and light commercial order intake in EMEA was down low single digits.\nWithin Asia, weak orders in China were only partially offset by other countries. Globally, commercial HVAC orders were up over 20% and the backlog for that business continues to grow. We booked large data center orders in all regions, positioning us for continued strong commercial HVAC growth. Refrigeration orders were down over 5% in the quarter, with strength in container offsetting some weakness in North America truck trailer. As a reminder, our North America truck trailer orders were up almost 90% in last year's second quarter.\nTruck [ failure ] orders in Europe and Asia continue to be strong. Orders in our resi and commercial fire business were up over 10%. Turning to Slide 14, guidance. Before I get into the details, I will share that you will see in the 10-Q later today that we expect consistent with accounting rules that as we get closer to announcing a sale of the resi and commercial fire business, the Fire & Security segment in aggregate, will likely be presented in discontinued operations in future quarters.\nThis could happen as early as Q3, but would not apply to commercial refrigeration. We do not yet know the full impact on reported earnings from continuing operations this year, which is why our July guide is consistent with how we have been disclosing our results. In addition, we plan to continue to disclose actual and projected 2024 results of our core business, that is all the businesses we are keeping, including Viessmann Climate Solutions which we continue to see as the best base to project 2025 financial performance.\nWith that, let me provide our outlook for 2024. With respect to exits, our updated guide now includes commercial refrigeration for 9 months compared to 6 months in our previous guide. We now expect reported full year sales of roughly $25.5 billion compared to a little under $26 billion in our April guide with underlying organic growth of mid-single digits remaining unchanged versus prior guide. The expected upside from our commercial and light commercial HVAC businesses essentially offsets lower revenue at Viessmann Climate Solutions.\nLower residential and light commercial sales in China and a stronger foreign currency translation headwinds are only partially offset by having commercial refrigeration for another quarter. We are maintaining our adjusted operating margin guide of roughly 15.5%, maybe a little more. and continue to expect full year core earnings conversion to be north of 40%. Interest expense is expected to be about $510 million based on the timing of the exits and redeployment of the net proceeds. The end result is that we are maintaining our adjusted EPS guide range of $2.80 to $2.90.\nOur free cash flow outlook remains $400 million reflecting about $2 billion of tax payment on gains from the business exits and transaction and restructuring-related cash costs. Our underlying free cash flow outlook remains $2.4 billion. Moving on to Slide 15, full year adjusted EPS year-over-year guidance bridge. Adjusted EPS increases from $2.73 last year to $2.85 at the midpoint. The darker blue represents the business we are retaining, including Viessmann Climate Solutions, whereas the lighter blue represents the adjusted EPS contribution from the businesses we're exiting, you can see that the adjusted EPS from our core business is projected to be up 17% compared to last year.\nThe operational contribution of $0.55 now reflects stronger business performance within our commercial and light commercial HVAC businesses as well as stronger productivity. increased dilution from Viessmann Climate Solutions reflects lower expected sales. We updated the impact of the exits to include the net effect of losing 7 months of earnings from Access Solutions Six months of earnings from industrial fire and only 3 months of earnings from commercial refrigeration, all offset by net interest savings from the proceeds.\nThere is a modest benefit from our planned $1 billion in share repurchases in the second half and the headwind from a higher year-over-year adjusted effective tax rate. In the appendix on Slide 23, you will find a full year adjusted EPS guide to guide bridge. And on Slide 24, a there is a summary of additional items, which were also updated as part of the new guide. With respect to the third quarter, we expect sales of about $6.6 billion and adjusted EPS of about $0.80 including a few pennies from businesses yet to be divested, and we expect the adjusted effective tax rate to be up 500 bps compared to last year, a $0.06 headwind. In summary, a good second quarter overall and on track for another strong year. With that, we'll open it up for questions."

Please go ahead, sir.\n\nSamuel Joel Pearlstein\n\nVP of IR, Carrier Global Corporation\n\nThank you, and good morning, and welcome to Carrier's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. With me here today are David Gitlin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Goris, Chief Financial Officer.\nWe will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call, which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in our earnings presentation, which is available to download from Carrier's website at ir.carrier.com.\nThe company reminds listeners that the sales, earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided during the call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Carrier's SEC filings, including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. [Operator Instructions]\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Dave Gitlin.\n\nDavid L. Gitlin\n\nPresident-UTC Aerospace Systems, United Technologies Corp.\n\nThank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone.\nWe've had an exciting start to the year. We welcomed 12,000 new team members from Viessmann Climate Solutions to the Carrier family, made great progress on our business exits and delivered very strong financial results, positioning us for yet another year of significant margin expansion and solid growth.\nStarting with the highlights of our strong first quarter results on Slide 3. On low single-digit organic sales growth, we drove 280 basis points of adjusted margin expansion and 19% adjusted EPS growth. I am very proud of the team. We have made enormous progress on our lean journey and driving sustained productivity, and we are seeing it in our results.\nOur formula is working, drive productivity tenaciously simplify the business, reduce overhead, invest in growth, all while increasing margins. Our performance and transformation all tied to our clear North Star, to be the global leader in intelligent climate and energy solutions, and we are making great progress on our vision, as you see on Slide 4.\nWe provide our customers with differentiated sustainability solutions. For buildings, our North American small rooftop units have the highest efficiency in the market, with the smallest footprint. Our water cool chillers, with magnetic bearings, provide best-in-class efficiency with the ability to match cooling loads with variable demand during the course of the day.\nFor homes, Viessmann's newly launched heat pumps expand our addressable market in Europe by approximately $5 billion and in typical Viessmann fashion, deliver 15% to 25% energy savings versus competitors and are the quietest on the market.\nFor the cold chain, our new HE19 trailer reefer unit reduces fuel consumption by 30% compared to our previous offerings and by 10% compared to our competition. And our new OptimaLINE container unit consumes roughly 15% less energy than our competitors. Our digital strategy is also a critical enabler and differentiator.\nFor buildings, we now monitor more than 1.2 billion square feet through Abound, a 10% increase from last quarter, with additional key scale customers attracted to our new NetZero features. For homes, Viessmann's one-base digital platform is the only home energy management system in the world that integrates space heating and cooling, water heating, solar PV with battery storage with a grid interface. Both Viessmann one-based platform and our North American Intellicence platform enable early detection of potential malfunctions, with notifications to installers, helping address problems before they occur. In the cold chain, we have recently introduced new capabilities to help optimize cooling and thus, reduce our customers' operating costs, helping us increase link subscriptions by 50% in just the past year.\nIn summary, we are very pleased with our clear traction as the Global Climate Champion, driven by technology and digital differentiation. We also remain very purposeful in driving aftermarket growth as you see on Slide 5.\nIn Q1, aftermarket was up 6%, led by another quarter of double-digit growth in commercial HVAC, and we remain on track for another year of double-digit growth, we now have about 75,000 chillers under a long-term agreement, about 35,000 of which are digitally connected. And our attachment rate reached its highest level ever, 48%. We also connected nearly 5,000 chillers, the highest in a quarter since our spin 4 years ago. The playbook works and our KPIs are consistent and cascaded globally, bringing focus and execution to this imperative.\nWe remain committed to our goal of $7 billion of aftermarket revenues by 2026. When we made this projection at our 2022 investor meeting, it assumed a high single to low -- a high single to low double-digit CAGR. With our planned business exits and now the addition of Viessmann, we will divest about $500 million of net aftermarket sales. So to achieve the 2026 target of $7 billion, we now require a low double-digit CAGR. We remain committed to this goal and are accelerating the deployment of our proven playbook to achieve it.\nTurning to Slide 6. We could not be more proud of our combination with Viessmann Climate Solutions. Thomas Heim and his team have been all in on ensuring that our teams work as one, sharing best-of-best product technology, digital solutions, supply chain and operational opportunities and working seamlessly on multibrand, multichannel strategies globally. Viessmann Climate Solutions is a company built on excellence. This is a team that loves to win.\nThe opportunities to leverage its excellence in customer intimacy, product design, channel differentiation, brand strategy, sustainability solution, culture and talent development and operations will give Carrier a clear advantage to sustain differentiation and premier customer satisfaction.\nWe remain deeply confident in the long-term transition towards electrification and sustained growth in the market. With Germany aiming to become greenhouse gas neutral by 2045, and individual federal states like Bavaria as soon as 2040, discussions in major municipalities have started as to when the supply of natural gas to households will be limited or effectively stopped.\nAt the same time, 2 weeks ago, the EU adopted the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, under which each member country must adopt its own plan to reduce building energy usage by 20% to 22% by 2035, with at least 55% of the reduction coming from renovations to the worst performing buildings.\nWhile the long-term trend towards electrification remains robust, we are clear-eyed about the short-term market headwinds in the European residential market. Despite these headwinds, our team outperformed the end markets in Q1 through share gains, new product introductions, boiler sales and pricing. And our team is poised to continue doing so for the full year.\nViessmann's sales in Q1 were down 12% overall, more than half of which was driven by lower solar PV sales, which carry lower margins. For the full year, we now see VCS sales flat to down 5%, with Q2 revenues being similar to Q1 and an expected increase in the second half consistent with a typical seasonal pickup. Though heat pump orders in Q1 were down year-over-year. They were up nearly 60% sequentially and were the highest in the year. Despite 2024 sales expected to be lower than our February guide, we only see a modest impact to our full year adjusted EPS because the team is driving to offset reduced volume with increased productivity and synergies and favorable mix.\nCost synergies are tracking to about $75 million in 2024 and over $200 million by year 3. The cost actions position us for higher earnings conversion when the broader market recovers. We also remain very encouraged by revenue synergies, which we believe will be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. So we could not be more excited by the opportunities presented by this game-changing combination.\nLet me shift gears and talk about the unique opportunity presented by data centers, as you see on Slide 7. Over the past 3 years, we've capitalized on this important opportunity by securing key wins with scale customers globally. The AI movement is driving hyper and sustained growth in this space, not only driving data center growth, but also an outsized opportunity for cooling providers, given that AI chips drive 7x the heat generation versus traditional chips. Today, AI makes up about 20% of the load of a typical data center, and some of our customers project that percentage to increase to 80% in the next few years, thus parting huge demand on the grid and increasing the need for differentiated HVAC and control solutions.\nAccordingly, the data center market for the HVAC business is projected to increase from roughly $7 billion in 2023 to $15 billion to $20 billion in 2027. For us, this vertical represents a low double-digit percentage of our global commercial HVAC applied business, and we see a tremendous opportunity of increasing this segment to well over 20% of our commercial HVAC sales in the next few years. We doubled our backlog in Q1 alone, and in April, secured further key wins as we optimize the use of our global footprint to support our customers.\nTurning to our transformation updates on Slide 8. In addition to the Viessmann integration, our business exits also continue to progress well. We are moving with speed and maximizing shareholder value. In March, we announced a definitive agreement for the sale of industrial fire for $1.4 billion in gross proceeds. This deal is expected to close in early 3Q.\nWe now have definitive agreements for 3 of our 4 business exits and are within a couple of weeks of issuing our offering memorandum to prospective buyers for our residential and commercial fire business. We are targeting to close that deal by the end of this year.\nWe are focused, but not finished. The entire team remains extremely energized as we draw closer to becoming a higher growth, simpler, leaner pure-play climate champion. The pace of our transformation and the net proceeds put us on track to achieve about a 2x net leverage ratio this year and resume share repurchases in 2024.\nWith that, let me turn this over to Patrick. Patrick?\n\nPatrick P. Goris\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 9.\nWe had a good start to the year. Q1 earnings were well ahead of our expectations and the guide we provided in February. Reported sales of $6.2 billion were up 17%, with organic sales up 2% and a 15% net contribution from acquisitions and divestitures, substantially all Viessmann Climate Solutions. Q1 adjusted operating profit of $927 million was up 44% compared to last year, driven by favorable price and productivity and the contribution of Viessmann Climate Solutions, partially offset by investments. Strong price and productivity also drove adjusted operating margin expansion of 280 basis points compared to last year, despite the about 50 basis point dilutive impact from Viessmann.\nCore earnings conversion, that is excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and currency, was well over 100% in the quarter. Adjusted EPS of $0.62 was up 19% year-over-year and was well ahead of our Q1 guide of $0.50. March was particularly strong, representing 50% of Q1 earnings. Compared to last year, price and productivity more than offset the impact of increased investments and the expected $0.06 dilution from Viessmann Climate Solutions. We have included a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge in the appendix on Slide 23.\nCompared to our Q1 expectations, productivity came in stronger, and we benefited from the timing of a few items, including tax, amounting to about $0.05. Free cash outflow of $64 million was in line with typical seasonality and also reflects payments of M&A-related fees.\nMoving on to the segment, starting on Slide 10. HVAC's reported sales growth of 25% reflects the contribution of Viessmann Climate Solutions and 2% organic sales growth. Organic sales in the Americas were up mid-single digits, driven by continued strength in commercial and light commercial, each up around 20%. This was partially offset by a low single-digit decline in resi.\nNorth America resi volume was down mid-single digits, as we guided, and we expect volume to be up year-over-year in each of the remaining quarters. Organic sales in EMEA were down high single digits, driven by significant weakness in resi light commercial, while commercial sales in EMEA remained strong and were up around 10%. Sales in Asia Pacific were flat, with growth in China, offsetting a decline in Japan as we continue to improve our mix in that country.\nThis segment had very strong quarter -- had a very strong quarter, with a 240-basis-point adjusted operating margin expansion due to price and strong productivity and despite the consolidation of Eastman Climate Solutions that negatively impacted margin by about 80 basis points.\nVCS earnings were broadly in line with our expectations, with favorable mix, productivity and synergies offsetting the impact of lower-than-expected sales. An excellent quarter for HVAC. And based on first quarter operational performance, we now expect 2024 full year HVAC segment margins to be up -- to be about 17.5%, up about 100 basis points compared to last year.\nTransitioning to refrigeration on Slide 11. Both reported and organic sales were down 2%. Within transport, container was up over 50% year-over-year and Global Truck and Trailer was down low teens, driven by North America truck and trailer which was down about 25%, reflecting overall demand and elevated field inventories.\nAs a reminder, North America truck and trailer was up over 40% in last year's Q1. European truck and trailer was flat, and Asia truck and trailer was up a strong 20%. Our Sensitech business, which provides solutions for tracking and monitoring performance at temperature was up mid-single digits. Commercial refrigeration was down low single digits year-over-year. We now expect the refrigeration segment to be up low single digits in 2024 organically.\nAdjusted operating margin was down 120 basis points compared to last year. This was mainly due to the absence of a $24 million gain related to a sale in last year's first quarter. Excluding that gain, Q1 adjusted operating margins were up 150 basis points year-over-year, driven by price and productivity.\nMoving on to Fire & Security on Slide 12. This segment had strong financial performance in the quarter. Reported sales were up 2%, with 7% organic sales growth, partially offset by a 5% headwind from the KFI deconsolidation. The residential and commercial fire business was up mid-single digits.\nAdjusted operating profit was up over 50% versus the prior year, and adjusted operating margins were up a significant 610 basis points year-over-year as volume growth, strong productivity and currency more than offset the headwind of the KFI exit. Overall, a very good quarter for this segment.\nTurning to Slide 13. Total company orders were down about 7% in the quarter, mostly driven by North America truck and trailer orders due to a tough compare. In Q1 of 2023, North America truck and trailer orders were up 50% year-over-year, 5-0. Excluding North America truck and trailer, Carrier's organic orders were flattish in Q1. Overall, HVAC orders were down between 0 and 5% in the quarter.\nWithin the Americas, commercial orders were up mid-single digits and North America resi orders had a second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Light commercial orders were down roughly 35% as order rates are impacted by lead times and a tough compare. EMEA commercial orders were up almost 30%, with applied equipment orders up around 60%, including an over 45% increase in data center orders. Organic resi and light commercial order intake in EMEA remains very weak.\nWithin Asia, weak orders in Japan offset growth in other regions. Globally, commercial HVAC orders were up about 10%, and the backlog for that business continues to grow year-over-year and sequentially. Refrigeration orders were down about 25% to 30% in the quarter, mostly driven by the over 40% decline in global truck and trailer, reflecting the trends in North America, I mentioned earlier, along with growth in Europe and Asia. This was only partially offset by continued growth in orders in the container business, where orders were up high teens.\nOrders in Fire & Security were flat. Turning to Slide 14, guidance. Compared to our prior guidance, the only change with respect to exits is that industrial fire is now included for the first half of the year. Our prior guide included a full year of industrial fire as no definitive agreement had been announced at that time. So all 3 announced exits, access solutions, commercial refrigeration, and industrial fire are now included for the first half only of our 2024 full year guidance. Taking that into account, we now expect reported full year sales of a little less than $26 billion.\nEarlier business exit timing represents roughly $400 million of reduction and currency translation, another $100 million. Lower expected revenue at Viessmann Climate Solutions is roughly offset by expected upside in light commercial and commercial HVAC. The underlying organic growth rate in our guidance remains, therefore, unchanged at mid-single digits.\nWe are increasing our adjusted operating margin guidance to roughly 15.5%, driven by the strong earnings performance in Q1. We now expect full year earnings conversion to be north of 40%. Interest expense will be about $25 million lower, given the redeployment of the net proceeds from the industrial fire sale.\nWe are maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance range despite the earlier exit of industrial fire, which is a $0.05 headwind, given stronger performance in our core business. With the strong performance in Q1 and the exit of industrial fire in the second half, we now expect roughly 50% of full year adjusted EPS to be realized in the first half of the year.\nBefore I get to free cash flow, I'd like to remind you that proceeds from the sale of businesses are reflected in cash flow from investing, and therefore, do not impact free cash flow. However, the tax payments on the gains on the sale of businesses are reflected in cash flow from operations and therefore, do impact free cash flow. Whereas this, of course, does not impact overall cash performance for the company, it does impact our free cash flow metric.\nOur free cash flow outlook is now $400 million, reflecting about $2 billion of tax payments on gains from the business exits and transaction-related costs. So no change in the $2.4 billion underlying free cash flow performance versus the prior guidance. The lower free cash flow outlook only reflects expected tax payments on the now announced industrial fire sale.\nMoving on to Slide 15. Adjusted EPS guide to guide bridge. As you can see, our adjusted EPS guide at the midpoint remains $2.85, with stronger operational performance offsetting the $0.05 impact of the earlier exit of industrial fire and the impact of lower expected sales at Viessmann Climate Solutions. The dark blue represents the businesses we are retaining, including Viessmann Climate Solutions, whereas the lighter blue represents the adjusted EPS contribution from the businesses we are exiting.\nAt the midpoint of our new guidance, Core adjusted EPS increases $0.05 compared to our February guide to $2.60. In the appendix on Slide 24, you will find a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge at guidance midpoint.\nGiven the tremendous transformation in the portfolio of this year, Slide 16 may be a helpful framework for 2025. We start with a baseline of $2.60 from the core business at the midpoint of our 2024 guidance. In addition to our double-digit adjusted EPS growth target from our value creation framework, we expect another half year benefit from deploying the proceeds of industrial fire towards debt reduction.\nIn addition to that, net proceeds from the exit of commercial and residential fire would be available for deployment, including for buybacks. Finally, an additional lever is 2024 and 2025 free cash flow funded share repurchases. All of this is consistent with our prior messaging that we intend to repurchase at least the equivalent 58.6 million shares issued to the Viessmann family, while maintaining a solid investment-grade credit rating. In short, we have several levers available to deliver meaningful adjusted EPS growth in 2025 and beyond.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Dave for Slide 17.\n\nDavid L. Gitlin\n\nPresident-UTC Aerospace Systems, United Technologies Corp.\n\nThanks, Patrick. We delivered very strong results in the first quarter, and are confident that we will continue to perform while we transform. With the integration of Viessmann Climate Solutions, the completion of our exits and the superb progress on our base business, we continue to position ourselves as the global leader in intelligent climate and energy solutions.\nAnd with that, we'll open this up for questions."

I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Sam Pearlstein, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nSamuel Joel Pearlstein\n\nVP of IR, Carrier Global Corporation\n\nThank you, and good morning, and welcome to Carrier's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. With me here today are David Gitlin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Goris, Chief Financial Officer. We will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call, which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in our earnings presentation, which is available to download from Carrier's website at ir.carrier.com.\nThe company reminds listeners that the sales, earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided during the call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Carrier's SEC filings, including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. [Operator Instructions]\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Dave Gitlin.\n\nDavid L. Gitlin\n\nPresident-UTC Aerospace Systems, United Technologies Corp.\n\nWell, thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying a heartfelt thank you to our team for delivering excellent results in 2023 while navigating such a significant and compelling portfolio transformation. I'd also like to thank and welcome our new 12,000 team members from Viessmann Climate Solutions.\nOur formal kickoff last month had more energy, warmth and excitement than I have ever seen from day 1 celebrations. I profoundly believe that this will go down as the most impactful business combination that our industry has ever seen, and we are so excited to be on this journey together.\nAs you can see on Slide 2, the fourth quarter kept a strong finish to a great year for Carrier. In the quarter, we achieved 33% of adjusted EPS growth driving another quarter of double-digit aftermarket growth and 80 basis points of margin expansion on flattish sales. Importantly, free cash flow of over $800 million significantly beat our expectations, driven by continued strong performance in working capital. Overall, for 2023, I am so proud of what the team accomplished as you can see on Slide 3.\nOur team has consistently shown an ability to outperform without excuses. Overcoming COVID headwinds to deliver strong results following our spin in 2020, persevering through supply chain challenges and delivering for our customers and shareholders despite significant portfolio moves.\nFor the year, we delivered 17% EPS growth on 3% organic sales growth, drove about 40% core earnings conversion improved our free cash flow performance by more than 50% year-over-year from $1.4 billion to over $2.1 billion. Not only did we deliver strong results in the year, we also took key actions on growth initiatives and detailed productivity planning to position 2024 for solid growth and margin expansion. This consistent performance has led to differentiated shareholder returns since we became a public company, as you can see on Slide 4.\nAs we prepared for our spin, our goal was to leverage our many strengths that Carrier established over the past century but also take advantage of the unique opportunity to create a new Carrier. We established a performance culture with innovation and customer intimacy at our core and simplified our business and portfolio. We have been disciplined on continuous improvement in productivity, invested in growth and have driven recurring revenues with a proven playbook. We sharpened our focus as an organization to lean into the long-term trends around sustainability and have accelerated our leadership in this space.\nSo we're proud of our track record. We're even more excited about our next chapter as we take our performance to the next level. Our mission is clear, to be the global leader in intelligent climate and energy solutions, as you can see on Slide 5. It starts with differentiated product introduction, some of which you see listed here. We are now focusing our 6,000 engineers on developing differentiated sustainable solutions for our customers, specific technologies that cut across our portfolio across the globe, such as AI and sensing algorithms, low GWP refrigerants, energy efficiency, low temperature heat pumps, electrification and integrated energy management solutions. We are poised to out-innovate and win, and we will continue to invest to ensure that we do so.\nThese efforts are reflected in our results as we gain share across our portfolio. European commercial heat pump sales were up 25% in 2023. Nearly 40% of our North America residential split systems were heat pumps and our market-leading electric transport refrigeration sales in Europe grew over 70%.\nFor sustainability leadership, we walk the talk. We have reduced our customers' emissions by more than 270 million metric tons on our way to our 1 gigaton Scope 3 commitment for 2030. We remain on track for carbon neutrality in our operations by 2030 and are using Abound across our footprint to help ensure that we achieve it.\nWe also laid out a clear road map to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions across our value chain by 2050 under the SBTi framework. In addition to sustainability, one of our other key themes is achieving consistent double-digit aftermarket growth, which we achieved again last year, as you can see on Slide 6.\nGrowing 12% last year represents our third consecutive year of double-digit growth. We now have approximately 30,000 connected chillers in the field versus 5,000 just 3 years ago. This has helped our attachment and our coverage rates with commercial HVAC now at 45% attachment for long-term service agreements, up from roughly 20% just 3 years ago. We know the playbook. It's working, and we are targeting another year of double-digit aftermarket growth this year and beyond.\nIn summary, we continue to perform while we are transforming, as you see on Slide 7. I already mentioned the energy and warm reception that we received from our new team members and many customers across Europe just a few weeks ago. Here is what is clear. Viessmann is an organization with a deep culture of excellence, excellence in its product design, customer intimacy, channel superiority, culture, team, all reflected in its deeply admired brand.\nThe tangible and intangible benefits from this combination will benefit our people, customers, investors and the planet for decades to come. We are also fortunate to now have Max Viessmann on our Board, who is already providing us with unique insights and perspectives.\nWhen we look closer to 2024, we are planning for Viessmann Climate Solutions sales to be up mid-single digits off a 2023 year-end of about USD 4.2 billion with high teens adjusted EBITDA margins. This includes the benefit of our targeted first year cost synergies. Internally, we are targeting significant revenue synergies, which would all be upside to our business case.\nEven though last year's regulatory and subsidy uncertainty in some European countries delayed order intake, which we expect to impact growth in the first half of 2024, we do expect Viessmann Climate Solutions to return to solid growth in the second half of this year, and we target achieving or exceeding our year 1 business case adjusted EBITDA by accelerating supply chain and other cost savings. So we're off and running. We are applying the playbook from our successful integration with Toshiba to ensure that we preserve Viessmann's superb team and culture while integrating to create tremendous value together.\nTurning to our business exits on Slide 8. You all saw our announcements on Access Solutions and commercial refrigeration, which together will yield close to $6 billion or about $4.5 billion in net proceeds. We are making good progress on our industrial fire sale and still expect to announce a definitive agreement around the end of the first quarter. We are also preparing to exit our combined residential and commercial fire businesses via a sale or public market exit.\nGiven our cash performance and the progress of these business exits, we now have a path to achieve about 2x net leverage ratio by the end of this year, which is about a year earlier than we previously indicated.\nBefore I turn it over to Patrick, a quick word on our 2024 guidance on Slide 9. Even though GDP in many of our key markets looks to be less than 2%, we are planning for mid-single-digit growth. Sustainability megatrends and continued double-digit aftermarket growth enable us to significantly outgrow global economies. We will continue to be tenacious and disciplined on every aspect of productivity, and we are, therefore, targeting over 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion.\nWith that, let me turn this over to Patrick. Patrick?\n\nPatrick P. Goris\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 10. Q4 earnings were ahead of our expectations and the guide we provided in October, even though reported sales of $5.1 billion were about $150 million lower. Organic sales were flat and a favorable 1 point tailwind from currency translation was offset by the impact of divestitures.\nOrganic sales were lower than we expected, mostly in our North America residential HVAC business as lower volumes reflected demand and distributors drove down field inventories. Q4 adjusted operating profit was up 8% compared to last year despite flat sales driven by favorable price/cost and productivity, partially offset by investments. As a result, adjusted operating margin expanded by 80 basis points compared to last year.\nAdjusted EPS of $0.53 was up 33% year-over-year and was ahead of our implied Q4 guide of $0.50. Compared to our expectations, HVAC margins were a little better, fight and security and refrigeration margins were a little light, and we benefited from discrete tax items and somewhat lower net interest expense.\nFree cash flow of $829 million was about $150 million better than our October guide, and we generated $2.1 billion of free cash flow for the full year, which is 92% of adjusted net income. Excluding some of the M&A-related fees and cash restructuring spend, which are adjusted out of our results, we converted over 100% of adjusted net income into free cash flow in 2023.\nMoving on to the segments, starting on Slide 11. The HVAC segment had another good quarter with significant operating margin expansion despite flat sales. Organic sales were down 1%, mostly due to North America residential HVAC sales being down high teens. This headwind was almost completely offset by continued exceptional growth in light commercial HVAC, high single-digit growth in commercial HVAC, including over 20% growth in the Americas and another quarter of double-digit growth in aftermarket.\nNorth America residential HVAC volume was down in the high 20s, which was partially offset by continued price realization and the positive mix up related to the 2023 SEER transition. Our light commercial HVAC business finished a very strong year with another quarter of about 20% year-over-year growth. This business was up 35% for the full year, an industry best.\nAdjusted operating margin was up 250 basis points year-over-year on flattish sales growth driven by price cost and productivity. This led to a full year operating margin for this segment of 16.6%. Overall, another great year for our HVAC business.\nTransitioning to Refrigeration on Slide 12. As expected, organic sales for the segment returned to growth in the quarter and were up 6%. Within transport refrigeration, container was up significantly around 60%. Our global truck and trailer business was up low single digits with North America and Europe flat and strong growth in Asia.\nOur Sensitech business, which provides comprehensive visibility solutions for tracking and monitoring temperature-sensitive products was up high single digits. Commercial refrigeration was down high single digits year-over-year. Operating margin contracted 160 basis points year-over-year due to investments in a few onetime items such as warranty and insurance.\nMoving on to Fire & Security on Slide 13. Organic sales were down given a very tough compare in Access Solutions, partially offset by strength in industrial fire, which was up almost 20%. Adjusted operating profit was down 7% versus the prior year, driven by volume mix and currency, partially offset by favorable price cost. The revaluation of the Argentinian peso impacted margins by over 100 basis points. Full year operating margin for this segment was about 15%.\nTurning to Slide 14. As you can see on the left side of the chart, backlog for our longer-cycle commercial HVAC business continues to increase, while backlogs in our shorter-cycle businesses continue to normalize. Total company orders were down low single digits in the quarter, mostly as a result of our North America truck and trailer orders being down significantly compared to last year.\nIn Q4 of 2022, North America truck and trailer orders were up an exceptional 120% year-over-year as we opened the 2023 order book. Excluding North America truck and trailer, Carrier's organic orders were up mid-single digits in Q4. HVAC orders returned to low single-digit growth as residential HVAC orders were up mid-teens, which more than offset the decline in light commercial orders, which were down roughly 40% as lead times continue to improve in that business.\nCommercial HVAC orders were up low single digits, and the longer-cycle backlog remained strong, up around 30% on a 2-year stack and extending well into the second half of 2024. Refrigeration orders were down about 20% in the quarter, with global truck and trailer orders down roughly 50%, reflecting the very tough comp in North America, I mentioned earlier. This was only partially offset by a return to growth in orders -- in the container business, where orders were up nearly 60% and low single-digit growth in commercial refrigeration.\nOverall, we enter 2024 with robust longer-cycle backlogs in commercial HVAC and a return to orders growth in key businesses such as residential HVAC and container.\nMoving on to Slide 15, guidance. Let me start with some key assumptions embedded in guidance related to our portfolio transformation. We have included a full year of Viessmann Climate Solutions as we closed the acquisition on January 2. You may recall that we previously communicated that our business exits will remain in continuing operations until they close. Therefore, with definitive agreements in place for the sale of both Global Access Solutions and commercial refrigeration, our guidance assumes a midyear exit date, and so both businesses are included in 2024 guidance through the end of June.\nAccordingly, our guidance assumes the net proceeds from these 2 exits will be used to pay down debt. We include industrial fire and residential and commercial fire for the full year 2024 into our guidance and we will do so until there are definitive agreements in place, and we have a good estimate as to the likely exit date.\nNow to details of the 2024 guidance. We expect reported sales of about $26.5 billion, including mid-single-digit organic sales growth with about equal contribution from price and volume mix. We expect mid-single-digit organic growth for Viessmann Climate Solutions to contribute about 20% to reported sales growth and the deconsolidation of KFI along with the divestitures of Global Access Solutions and Commercial Refrigeration to represent about a 5% headwind to reported sales.\nAdjusted operating margin is expected to be between 15% and 15.5%, up over 50 basis points compared to '23, driven by price, volume and productivity. Productivity includes an $80 million benefit from restructuring actions we executed earlier this quarter as we simplify our structure given our transformation. The impact of Viessmann Climate Solutions and overall company operating margin is about neutral. Core earnings conversion that is excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and FX is over 30%.\nIncorporating an estimated 23% adjusted effective tax rate, this gets us to an adjusted EPS guidance range of $2.80 to $2.90, which includes about a $0.07 headwind from the Viessmann acquisition as we expected.\nUnderlying free cash flow is expected to be up about 10% compared to 2023. Reported free cash flow will be lower given some of the portfolio transformation activities. Similar to 2022, when we exited Chubb, cash flow from operations will be impacted by tax payments related to the gains on the sales of these business exits. Given the large expected gains on the 2 transactions already announced, we expect free cash flow to net about $700 million. This includes about $1.7 billion of cash outflows related to the expected tax payments on the gains of Access Solutions and Commercial Refrigeration, transaction fees related to all 4 exits and the Viessmann transaction and additional restructuring.\nSimilar to 2023, we expect higher than typical restructuring charges in 2024 about $100 million pretax. Seasonally, we expect our free cash flow to be back half weighted. Unlike the tax payment on the gain of the business exits, proceeds from the divestitures will show in the cash flow statement as investing activities and therefore, do not impact free cash flow.\nAs shown on the right side of the slide, we expect mid-single-digit organic growth in all 3 segments. Fire & Security operating margin of about 14% reflects the absence of the higher-margin Global Access Solutions business in the second half of the year.\nNow moving to Slide 16, 2024 adjusted EPS bridge. This chart shows how adjusted EPS increases from $2.73 to $2.85 at the midpoint. Our guidance includes the benefit of volume leverage and strong productivity leading to over 30% core earnings conversion and over 50 bps of margin expansion. Think of the dark blue as our core business representing all the businesses we will retain and the lighter blue representing the 4 businesses we are exiting.\nWe expect the earnings of our core business to be up close to 15% in 2024 despite the dilutive impact of Viessmann. You can see the net contribution from Viessmann Climate Solutions and the net impact of losing 6 months of earnings from Access Solutions and Commercial Refrigeration offset by interest savings from the proceeds. We expect the headwind from tax as we return to a 23% adjusted effective tax rate.\nOn the far right, you see that our full year 2024 guide includes about $0.30 of adjusted EPS related to businesses being exited. The $0.30 of course, does not reflect the benefit of the redeployment of expected net proceeds from the exits of industrial fire and residential and commercial fire.\nAs usual, we provide estimates of other items in the appendix on Slide 20. With respect to capital deployment in 2024, we recently announced a dividend increase payable starting with the February dividend. And our focus this year will be on deleveraging through free cash flow generation and net proceeds from the exits. As we return to about 2x net leverage, we do intend to resume share repurchases.\nFinally, before I turn it over to Dave, let me provide some additional color on the first quarter. We expect low single-digit organic revenue growth with about 50 bps of margin expansion. We had $0.10 year-over-year adjusted EPS headwind, including $0.06 from Viessmann, $0.02 from last year's gain on the sale and refrigeration and $0.01 each from the KFI deconsolidation and a higher tax rate. We, therefore, expect Q1 revenues of a little less than $6.5 billion and adjusted EPS to be right about -- right at about but not above $0.50.\nWe do expect organic revenue growth sequentially improve throughout the year with easier comparisons in the second half of 2024. We expect a little less than 50% of full year adjusted EPS to be realized in the first half of the year and the balance in the second half.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Dave.\n\nDavid L. Gitlin\n\nPresident-UTC Aerospace Systems, United Technologies Corp.\n\nThanks, Patrick. In closing, we delivered strong results in 2023 and are geared up to do so again in 2024. This is a big year for us as a company, and we will remain [ head sound ] focused on execution and we will start realizing the tremendous benefits that we'll see from the combination of Viessmann and as a sustainability-focused higher-growth pure-play company. In 2024, we will continue to perform while we transform.\nWith that, we'll open this up for questions."

I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Sam Pearlstein, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nSamuel Joel Pearlstein\n\nVP of IR, Carrier Global Corporation\n\nThank you, and good morning, and welcome to Carrier's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. With me here today are David Gitlin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Goris, Chief Financial Officer. We will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call, which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in our earnings presentation, which is available to download from Carrier's website at ir.carrier.com.\nThe company reminds listeners that the sales, earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided during the call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Carrier's SEC filings and in Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Once the call is open for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up to give everyone the opportunity to participate.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Dave Gitlin.\n\nDavid L. Gitlin\n\nPresident-UTC Aerospace Systems, United Technologies Corp.\n\nThank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I am very proud of our team for delivering another strong quarter, enabling us to again increase our full year guidance.\nHVAC environment security sales were both up mid-single digits with the overall company delivering yet another quarter of double-digit aftermarket growth. Adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS were both up over 20% year-over-year with adjusted operating margins up 240 basis points in the quarter. The HVAC and Fire & Security segments both delivered record adjusted operating margins in the quarter, approximately 21% and 18%, respectively.\nFree cash flow performance also continues to be strong, positioning us for some upside for our full year guidance. Bottom line is we continue to perform while we transform, as you can see on Slide 3.\nWe are a team that is very clear eyed about macro challenges. We are focused on controlling the controllables, driving operational excellence, being tenacious about customer centricity, out innovating our peers and consistently delivering on our commitments. With 2 months left in the year, we are confident that in 2023, we will deliver mid-single-digit organic growth, 15% adjusted EPS growth, margin expansion despite the negative impact from consolidating Toshiba Carrier and strong free cash flow. Not only are we poised to close out 2023 on a strong note, we have significantly matured our productivity processes. So we will enter 2024 and with even more rigor and detailed plans around our cost reduction activities positioning us for further margin expansion next year and beyond.\nWe also have confidence in continued growth driven in part by our aftermarket and recurring revenue traction as you see on Slide 4. We're on track for 80,000 chillers under long-term agreements and 30,000 connected chillers by year-end. The attachment rate in Q3 was approximately 50%, nearly double pre-spin performance. Abound continues to gain market traction exemplified by new scale customers committing to our Abound Healthy Air Solution and abound net 0 management offerings in Q3.\nAdditionally, we announced the launch of Lynx Logic, a new Software-as-a-Service application within our Lynx digital platform that helps predict and address supply chain disruption by automatically identifying trends, patterns and issues in distribution networks and transportation lines. Customers clearly see the benefit of Lynx capabilities, and we now have over 100,000 paid Lynx subscriptions.\nOur playbook around digitally enabled life cycle recurring sales continues to yield encouraging results globally as we are well positioned for another year of double-digit growth in 2023 and beyond. Our other major growth theme is around driving differentiated solutions to ensure sustainability leadership. You see examples of that on Slide 5.\nWe continue to introduce industry-leading products into the market that help our customers achieve their sustainability targets while decarbonizing the planet for generations to come.\nCarrier Transicold introduced a new Optimal line refrigerated container unit, which offers best-in-class energy efficiency versus the competition and is approximately 15% more fuel efficient than our prior units. We also introduced a comprehensive new line of high and very high temperature heat pumps for use in industrial, commercial and health care buildings as well as district heating. These key pumps reduced both carbon emissions and energy costs up to 80% versus traditional gas boiler applications.\nAdditionally, our new Zero GWP refrigerant aero to water high-efficiency heat pump will nicely complement Viessmann's offerings in the European market. And on top of these new product introductions, our existing business continues to gain momentum as European commercial heat pump sales were up 70% in Q3 and are up 40% year-to-date. Thanks to our sustainability product and service offerings, we are well on our way to achieving our Scope 3 commitment of reducing our customers' greenhouse gas emissions by more than 1 gigaton by 2030, having achieved approximately 270 million metric tonnes of reduction since 2020. We have and will continue to invest a disproportionate amount of our R&D in sustainability differentiation.\nWe are pleased to have been recognized by Time Magazine, Newsweek and many others for our sustainability leadership. Excitingly, the combination with Viesmmann Climate Solutions will further accelerate our mission of becoming the world leader in intelligent climate and energy solutions, as you see on Slide 6.\nLast month, we had the pleasure of hosting Max Viessmann, Chairman and CEO of the Viessmann Group, in our headquarters for a webcast event to discuss his views on the future combination, we are profoundly confident and excited in the value creation opportunities ahead of us. The trend towards heat pumps in Europe is unambiguous and will continue for many years to come.\nMax confirmed that European decarbonization is a trend that is not changing and is well supported by government in Europe. While individual countries may adjust regulations and subsidy levels from year-to-year, we see a multiyear growth opportunity as those countries meet their commitments for emission reductions backed by EU and country-specific funding.\nResidential heat pump penetration in Europe is only about 8%, and 21 countries have subsidies to support 2030 and 2050 decarbonization goals. Viesmmann Climate Solutions is also well positioned for continued share gains. Unlike some of its competitors, it has the advantage of providing solutions for all energy classes, heat pumps, gas boilers, hydrogen boilers while some of its competitors are pure-play heat pump or boiler providers. It has a connected ecosystem of offerings for an electric home such as solar PV, batteries and a differentiated digital platform while also driving increased subscription sales.\nA good example is the Vitocal 250-A natural refrigerant air to water heat pump that won this year's award for the Best Heat Pump in Germany. Viessmann Climate Solution is soon introducing a 19 kilowatts of output version that will now give it access to over 90% of the single-family home heating market. Additionally, the brand-new Vitocal 250-A Pro also releasing in Q1 will offer heat pumps outputs of up to 40 kilowatts, ideal for multifamily and commercial buildings. And based on our experience with Toshiba Carrier and that acquisition and integration, which is going extremely well, we are certainly confident in the cost synergies and already see potential for revenue synergies, which go well beyond our deal model.\nIn short, Viesmmann Climate Solutions is the most attractive business in the most attractive segment in our space, and we cannot wait to come together as one business, which is likely to close the first week of January 2024.\nLastly, a brief update on our business exits on Slide 7. First, my thanks to our teams who are working quite literally around the clock and doing a superb job. We have many advisers, who together with our bankers, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan on Fire & Security and Bank of America on Commercial Refrigeration, our focus on maximizing the net proceeds and speed while ensuring a clean exit of these businesses. We are progressing very well with the prospective buyers for security, commercial refrigeration and industrial.\nThe interest level has been extremely high, and we expect to be able to announce signed agreements before the end of 1Q, hopefully sooner. The capital market transactions for the combined commercial and residential fire business is on track. These are superb assets with deeply committed and effective team members, and we remain very optimistic about the value that we will realize on these exits.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Patrick. Patrick?\n\nPatrick P. Goris\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8. Sales in the quarter were $5.7 billion with organic growth of 3%, a 1% tailwind from foreign currency translation and a 1% net contribution from acquisitions and divestitures. The latter was substantially all driven by 1 month of Toshiba Carrier before becoming organic at the beginning of August.\nQ3 adjusted operating profit of over $1 billion was up more than 20% compared to the prior year on 5% reported sales growth. Strong productivity and price cost helped us expand our adjusted operating margin by 240 basis points to 18.2%. That is despite a 30 basis point headwind related to the Toshiba Carrier consolidation.\nReported earnings conversion was 65% in the quarter. Core earnings conversion that is excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency was far higher than that. Adjusted EPS of $0.89 is up 27% year-over-year and includes a tailwind from discrete tax items in the quarter. Free cash flow of about $950 million was up 35% compared to last year. Year-to-date, we have generated over $1.3 billion in free cash flow compared to about $400 million during the same period last year, reflecting improved working capital performance and higher earnings.\nOverall, a good quarter and better than we expected mainly as a result of better operating performance and the discrete tax items I mentioned earlier. Please turn to Slide 9.\nQ2 was another good quarter for HVAC. Organic sales were up 4%, driven by high single-digit growth in commercial HVAC, 30% growth in light commercial and double-digit growth in aftermarket. North America residential HVAC sales were down low single digits in the quarter. Overall resi volume was down low double digits and revenues continued to benefit from price realization and positive mix from the 2023 year transition.\nDestocking is expected to continue in Q4, and we expect North America residential HVAC volumes to be down mid-teens for the full year. We expect field inventories to end 2023 also down mid-teens from the beginning of the year, which should position them at more appropriate levels heading into 2024. Offsetting lower expected residential volume in 2023, we now expect light commercial HVAC sales to be up about 30% versus about 20% in our prior guidance.\nAdjusted operating profit for the HVAC segment was up 33% compared to last year on 7% reported sales growth, driven by productivity and price costs. Adjusted operating margin reached a record high and was up 410 basis points compared to last year despite a 50 basis point headwind from the consolidation of Toshiba Carrier.\nYou will see in the 10-Q later today that there was a onetime $60 million tax benefit from a joint venture that is included in equity income, so that was more than offset by other discrete items in the segment. In short, excellent financial performance of this segment in the quarter.\nMoving to Slide 10 for Refrigeration. Reported sales were flat in the quarter with organic sales down 3%, offset by a 3% benefit from foreign currency translation. Within transport refrigeration, global truck and trailer sales were up high single digits driven mostly by over 20% growth in European truck and trailer. Container continued to experience demand softness, however, and was down roughly 25% year-over-year.\nCommercial refrigeration sales were down about 10% in the quarter with orders for this business returned to year-over-year growth. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect the container business, commercial refrigeration and the entire Refrigeration segment to return to organic sales growth. Adjusted operating margin for this segment was down 80 basis points compared to last year, mainly due to the lower volume in container and commercial refrigeration, which more than offset the benefits from productivity and price costs in this segment.\nMoving on to Fire & Security on Slide 11. Just like HVAC, this segment had good financial performance in the quarter. Reported sales were up 2%, with 6% organic sales growth and the 1% tailwind from foreign currency, partially offset by a 5% headwind from the KFI deconsolidation. Organic growth was broad-based with high single-digit growth in Industrial Fire & Security and mid-single-digit growth in commercial and residential fire combined.\nAdjusted operating profit was up 13% versus the prior year. Similar to HVAC, adjusted operating margins hit a record level and were up 170 basis points year-over-year, driven by volume, productivity and price costs. Turning to Slide 12.\nTotal company orders were down a little less than 10% in the quarter, mostly due to the declines in the shorter cycle businesses. Overall HVAC orders were down about 10% in the quarter with expected declines in residential and light commercial HVAC. Commercial HVAC orders were flat against a difficult comp. Last year, orders were up 15% to 20%. And the backlog remains robust, up over 40% on a 2-year stack and extends well into next year.\nRefrigeration orders were down approximately 15% to 20% in the quarter, largely driven by Transport. Very strong orders growth in international truck and trailer, up 60% year-over-year, was more than offset by over 50% order decline in North American truck and trailer.\nFor North America truck and trailer, we opened the 2024 order book in Q2 of this year. For 2023, we opened the order book in Q3 of last year. On a year-to-date basis, North America truck and trailer orders are up low single digits, which is probably more indicative of underlying demand. Commercial refrigeration and container orders in October give us confidence in the Refrigeration segment's returned to organic growth in Q4.\nOrders in Fire & Security were up around 5% with particularly strong growth in industrial fire. We believe that lead times for the majority of our shorter-cycle businesses across our 3 segments have normalized with backlogs close to more typical levels. Our longer-cycle backlog continues to grow year-over-year.\nNow moving on to guidance on Slide 13. We expect full year sales to come in around $22.1 billion to $22.2 billion, including mid-single-digits organic sales growth. We are raising our full year adjusted operating margin guidance to about 14.5%, driven by strong year-to-date performance.\nWithin the segment, we are increasing our full year HVAC adjusted operating margin guidance to about 16.5% while maintaining our Fire & Security guidance at 15.5%. The Refrigeration full year adjusted operating margin is impacted by lower volume in container and commercial refrigeration and as a result, will likely end up a little lower than 13%.\nWe are increasing our full year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 compared to our prior midpoint to about $2.70. We have included a 2023 guide-to-guide adjusted EPS bridge in the appendix for your reference. In essence, improved operational performance drives about half the increase. The balance is mostly driven by a lower expected adjusted tax rate. Our full year adjusted effective tax rate is now expected to be between 21.5% and 22% compared to our prior guidance of about 23%.\nAs for free cash flow, we now expect to generate slightly more than $1.9 billion in 2023. Before I turn it back over to Dave, let me give you a couple of updates. You may recall that we will be funding the Viessmann acquisition through a combination of equity, cash on hand and debt. The latter will be a mix of term loans and long-term debt. We previously shared that we hedged the cash portion of the consideration against currency trend.\nIn the third quarter, we entered into a number of interest rate marks to mitigate interest rate exposure on the expected issuance of debt with maturities 10 years and beyond. As a result, we do not expect a significant change in our cost of financing for Viessmann compared to our original business case. We expect to be in the market for the bond offerings in Q4 in advance of an early January close.\nAs we communicated previously, we will be very focused on deleveraging post acquisition, and we'll use free cash flow and proceeds from the business exits to do so. We continue to expect to return through share repurchases as soon as our net leverage returns to about 2x.\nOne last topic. I'd like to share our current thoughts on how we will provide 2024 guidance in February, given the acquisition and the 4 business exits transaction. We currently expect that our 2024 guidance will include a full year of Viessmann Climate Solutions. The exact timing and the proceeds of the business exits are, of course, not known as of today.\nFor context, there are specific rules that determine when a business can be treated as discontinued operations in the financial statements, and it is our current assessment that the Fire & Security businesses being exited will likely not qualify as disc ops for reporting purposes until all of these transactions have been executed. We do not expect commercial refrigeration to qualify for disc op. Therefore, we intend to provide guidance consistent with how actual results will be reported. This means that we will include the earnings of the businesses to be exited into our 2024 guidance. We will then adjust guidance as needed for the exact timing of the exits and the use of the proceeds. By the time we provide guidance in February, we expect to have a better sense on timing and proceeds with several of the business exits.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to you, Dave.\n\nDavid L. Gitlin\n\nPresident-UTC Aerospace Systems, United Technologies Corp.\n\nWell, thank you, Patrick. In closing, Carrier continues performing while transforming. We had another strong quarter. And more importantly, we again increased our outlook for 2023 with mid-single-digit organic growth, margin expansion, double-digit adjusted EPS growth and strong free cash flow performance, all broadly in line with the value creation framework that we shared with you at our latest Investor Day.\nSo with just a couple of months more to go in 2023, we are, of course, already looking ahead to 2024 with continued confidence in strong top and bottom line growth and cash conversion.\nWith that, we'll open this up for questions."

I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Sam Pearlstein, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nSamuel Joel Pearlstein\n\nVP of IR, Carrier Global Corporation\n\nThank you, and good morning, and welcome to Carrier's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. With me here today are David Gitlin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Goris, Chief Financial Officer. We will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call, which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in our earnings presentation, which is available to download from Carrier's website at ir.carrier.com.\nThe company reminds listeners that the sales, earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided during the call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Carrier's SEC filings, including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Once the call is opened for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up to give everyone the opportunity to participate.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Dave Gitlin.\n\nDavid L. Gitlin\n\nPresident-UTC Aerospace Systems, United Technologies Corp.\n\nThank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. Our theme at Carrier remains performing while transforming. And I am proud of our team as we are progressing well with both.\nYou see that strong performance in our Q2 results on Slide 2. Organic sales growth grew 6% with both HVAC and Fire & Security up 9%. We drove strong double-digit growth in light commercial and commercial HVAC, global truck and trailer controls and aftermarket. Within Fire & Security, growth was broad-based across security, residential, commercial and industrial fire. Total company backlog remains well above historical levels, up 30% on a 2-year stack.\nAdjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS were up 12% and 13%, respectively, and free cash flow was strong at over $300 million. Price cost was increasingly positive in Q2. Toshiba Carrier performance came in stronger than expected, and we are on track to deliver $300 million of gross productivity this year.\nAs a result of our strong first half performance, we are raising our full year guidance for organic growth, adjusted operating margins and adjusted EPS. A key driver of our sustained organic growth and robust backlog is the result of our team leaning into secular trends around sustainability and healthy buildings, as you see on Slide 3.\nWith our clear and unwavering focus on being the global leader in intelligent climate and energy solutions, we continue to see traction from our sustainability-driven growth initiatives. Resi heat pump sales in North America have been up double digits year-to-date. We saw another quarter of over 20% growth in commercial heat pump sales in Europe and electric transport units doubled in Europe. Our healthy buildings pipeline is up over 2x to $1.6 billion, driven in part by K-12 in the U.S., where orders were up over 20% in the quarter. We are clearly positioned at the core of a transition to a more sustainable planet.\nWe published our 2030 ESG report yesterday in which we now disclose sustainability progress through the CDP. After completing our portfolio moves, about half of our sales will relate directly to clean tech, and we expect that proportion to continue to increase. We remain on track to reduce our customers' carbon emissions by more than 1 gigaton by 2030 while achieving carbon neutrality in our own operations.\nOur laser focus on digitally enabled aftermarket solutions continues to gain traction, as you see on Slide 4. Q2 saw yet another quarter of double-digit aftermarket growth with the first half up mid-teens compared to last year, and we remain on track to deliver double-digit growth this year and beyond. The playbook is working, expanding the capabilities and deployment of Abound & Lynx, our key digital platforms, increasing parts sales supported by agile pricing and improved fulfillment rates, increased attachment rates and overall coverage across the portfolio and deploying connected devices to increase recurring and subscription-based revenues.\nWe are also embedding AI and generative AI capabilities into Abound to drive solutions for our customers. By analyzing sensor data patterns and performance metrics, generative AI can help prevent equipment failures, drive improved air quality by controlling ventilation and increased energy efficiency by controlling temperature set points, airflow rates and scheduling strategies. So our execution is progressing well.\nA brief update on our portfolio transformation on Slide 5. On Viessmann Climate Solutions, the short version is the more we get to know them, the more excited we are to close. Our integration planning team in Frankfurt is actively working to ensure that we hit the ground running on day 1. Viessmann Climate Solutions is performing very well ahead of their projections. First half sales were up an impressive 20% year-over-year with heat pump sales up over 40%. Viessmann Climate Solutions profitability is also up significantly compared to last year, and they remain on track to deliver EUR 4 billion in sales and EUR 700 million in EBITDA this year.\nWe remain confident in the EUR 200 million of cost synergies, driven primarily by supply chain in-sourcing and value engineering. The growth opportunity for the combined business is even more compelling. The prime focus areas include expanding Viessmann's sustainable heating and home energy management offerings globally, driving incremental sales through Viessmann's European channel using a multi-brand strategy and building on Viessmann's digital platform to provide even more differentiated end-to-end solutions globally.\nMoving to the Fire & Security and Commercial Refrigeration exits. The good news is that strategics and sponsors have expressed considerable interest in these superb assets. We are tracking to the sequencing we've established for these exits. We expect to have commercial refrigeration now including pro for mechanical systems and the security business in the market in September with residential fire initiating its sale process a month or so later.\nCommercial and residential fire exits will follow. The result is the new carrier that you see on Slide 6. The combination of the acquisitions of Toshiba Carrier and Viessmann Climate Solutions, together with the tremendous positioning that Carrier has established over the past century, position the combined entity to become a true global climate champion in very attractive and growing market segments. Focus matters, and our focus on sustainability differentiation position us as a pure play, high-growth company. Our combined channels, brands, technology and world-class talent will create solutions for our customers, our people and the planet for generations to come.\nAnd with that, let me turn it over to Patrick. Patrick?\n\nPatrick P. Goris\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 7. We had record reported sales of about $6 billion, up 15% versus the prior year with 6% organic growth. 9% growth from acquisitions and divestitures was substantially driven by Toshiba Carrier, whose results will become organic starting in August.\nThe deconsolidation of KFI was not material to Q2 total company sales, but had a 3-point negative year-over-year impact due to Fire & Security segment reported sales. Q2 adjusted operating profit of $964 million was up 12% compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 16.1% and includes a 100 basis point headwind from the consolidation of Toshiba Carrier. This means adjusted operating margins would have expanded about 60 basis points, excluding the impact from the TCC consolidation driven by volume, productivity and price cost as well as strong margins in TCC.\nCore earnings conversion was about 30% in the quarter. Adjusted EPS of $0.79 was ahead of our expectations mostly because of stronger-than-expected sales, price cost and TCC performance. Free cash flow generation of $310 million was up significantly compared to last year, helped by inventory reduction. This positions us well to deliver approximately $1.9 billion of free cash flow for the full year. You will notice that our U.S. GAAP results include the impact of the deconsolidation of KFI and the mark-to-market adjustments related to foreign currency hedges associated with the Viessmann acquisition.\nYou may recall that we fully hedged the cash portion of the euro-dominated purchase price. As of yesterday's rates, most of the Q2 noncash loss on the hedges would be neutralized. We exclude these items from our adjusted results. Now please turn to Slide 8 to cover our segment's performance in more detail.\nHVAC had an excellent performance in Q2. Organic sales were up 9%, driven by high-teens growth in commercial HVAC, double-digit growth in aftermarket in controls and over 60% growth in light commercial. North America residential HVAC sales were down mid-single digits in the quarter, a bit weaker than we expected.\nOverall, residential volumes were down mid-teens as we adjusted to slower-than-expected movements in the quarter. North America residential revenues continued to benefit from price realization and mix up from the 2023 SEER transition. Adjusted operating profit for the HVAC segment was up 29% compared to last year, driven by volume, productivity, TCC performance and favorable price cost.\nAdjusted operating margin was up 70 basis points compared to last year despite a 200 basis point headwind from the consolidation of TCC. All 3 businesses within HVAC had strong margin expansion: Residential light commercial, commercial and Global Comfort Solutions.\nBased on the first half performance, we now expect 2023 full year HVAC segment margin to be closer to 16% versus our prior guide of over 15%. Let me move to Slide 9 and provide a brief update on our Toshiba Carrier acquisition as we closed that transaction about 1 year ago. As a reminder, we acquired Toshiba Carrier for $900 million, about 10x EBIT. We committed to $100 million in cost synergies in 5 years and projected to achieve mid-teens EBITDA margins in that same timeframe.\nOur Tokyo-based team is doing an outstanding job and performance is running ahead of all of our projections. Japan returned to profitability earlier this year. We are already achieving double-digit operating margins and are now projecting $200 million of cost synergies, which would drive EBITDA margins in the high teens rather than mid-teens.\nIn short, excellent performance by that management team, and we are, of course, using their experience and playbook as we plan for the Viessmann integration.\nMoving to Refrigeration on Slide 10. Reported sales were down 7% in the quarter with organic sales down 6%. The difference is the small divestiture we discussed in the first quarter. Within transport refrigeration, North America truck and trailer sales were up double digits, and European truck trailer was up mid-teens. This continued strong performance was more than offset by container, which was down roughly 35% in the quarter year-over-year.\nImportantly, we delivered more container units sequentially, and we expect the sequential improvement to continue in Q3 and Q4. As a result, we expect the container business and the entire Refrigeration segment to return to organic sales growth in the second half of this year. Commercial refrigeration was down high teens year-over-year as our European food retail customers continue to see pressures. The commercial refrigeration team is doing a great job managing working capital and adjusting our cost base to position this business for strong financial performance as the top line improves.\nAdjusted operating margin was down 240 basis points compared to last year, mainly due to the volume declines in container and commercial refrigeration and the absence of the $7 million gain in last year's second quarter. Price/cost was favorable. Excluding the onetime gain on sale in the first quarter, adjusted operating margins for refrigeration grew 250 basis points sequentially from Q1, and we are pleased with the progress this segment made in the quarter.\nMoving on to Fire & Security on Slide 11. Fire & Security sales were up 5% on a reported basis. Organic sales were up 9%. This was partially offset by 1% currency and a 3% decline from the deconsolidation of KFI. We saw strong organic growth across the F&S portfolio, including double-digit growth in Industrial Fire & Security and high single-digit growth in both residential and commercial fire.\nAdjusted operating profit was up 1% versus the prior year, which includes the year-over-year headwind from the deconsolidation of KFI, which was about $10 million or about $0.01 of adjusted EPS to Carrier. Adjusted operating margins were down 50 bps in the quarter as favorable price/cost, volume and productivity were offset by mix and the year-over-year impact of the KFI deconsolidation.\nSequentially, adjusted operating margins were up 230 basis points, and we expect adjusted operating margins to improve as the year progresses.\nTurning to Slide 12. Total company organic orders were down mid-single digits in the quarter as lead times continued to normalize throughout our businesses. As you can see on the left, backlogs remain at very healthy levels, above 2x 2019 levels and for our longer-cycle businesses extend into next year. We believe that strong backlogs and normalizing supply chains are reflected in our order rates.\nOverall, HVAC orders were down 5% to 10% in the quarter, with both business units seeing some declines. Commercial HVAC orders were down mid-single digits, but the backlog remains robust and grew sequentially, excluding NORESCO. Over the past month, commercial HVAC orders have returned to growth.\nRefrigeration orders were up 10% in the quarter, with growth in transport refrigeration and a decline in commercial refrigeration. Global truck and trailer demand remained strong with orders up about 40%, and those were partially offset by declines in container.\nContainer orders were about flat sequentially as demand begins to recover. Orders in industrial fire remained strong and were up double digits with lead times improving in security and commercial fire orders moderated and were down in the quarter.\nNow moving on to guidance on Slide 13. Performance in the first half of 2023 was better than we expected. We now expect 2023 revenues to be a couple of hundred million dollars more than $22 billion with mid-single-digits organic growth. The increase is primarily driven by commercial and light commercial HVAC and somewhat higher net price. We now expect adjusted operating margin to be between 14% and 14.5%, a little higher than what we previously guided, driven by slightly higher organic sales, improved price cost and better performance at Toshiba Carrier.\nWe now expect full year price cost to be about $300 million positive for the year. As a result, despite a $0.03 adjusted EPS headwind from the deconsolidation of KFI, we are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance range by $0.05 and we expect full year adjusted EPS to be at the midpoint of the new range.\nFor your benefit, we included an adjusted EPS guide to guide bridge on Slide 17. As for free cash flow, we continue to expect to generate approximately $1.9 billion this year. So overall, another good quarter and an improved outlook for 2023.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back over to you, David.\n\nDavid L. Gitlin\n\nPresident-UTC Aerospace Systems, United Technologies Corp.\n\nOkay. Thanks, Patrick. Let me first correct something that I misstated on the business exits. We expect to have commercial refrigeration and security in the market in September, industrial fire a month or so later, and then resi and commercial fire will follow.\nSo just in summary before we get into the Q&A. Carrier continues performing while we are transforming. Despite resi HVAC declines, we realized mid-single-digit organic growth in the first half of 2023. Secular trends and our aftermarket focus continue to drive demand. Price cost improvements and productivity are helping operating margins and funding growth investments. Toshiba performance is well ahead of schedule and giving us further confidence in the upcoming Viessmann integration. Our exciting portfolio moves are tracking to schedule, and we are raising full year guidance for organic growth, adjusted operating margins and adjusted EPS.\nAnd with that, we will get into the questions."

I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Sam Pearlstein, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nSamuel Pearlstein\n\nThank you, and good morning, and welcome to Carrier's conference call to discuss the transactions we announced last night along with first quarter 2023 earnings. With me here today are David Gitlin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Goris, Chief Financial Officer. We will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call, which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in our earnings presentation, which is available to download from Carrier's website at ir.carrier.com.\nThere are 2 presentations available there, 1 for the strategic actions and 1 for the first quarter 2023 results. The company reminds listeners that the sales, earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided during the call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Carrier's SEC filings, including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. [Operator Instructions]\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Dave Gitlin.\n\nDavid Gitlin\n\nPresident & CEO of Carrier, United Technologies Corporation\n\nWell, thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. A big day for us, and we appreciate your flexibility joining us this morning on short notice. Today, we are announcing a new Carrier, a new direction and an exciting transformation, a game-changing opportunity to acquire Europe's premier company in the most attractive market in our space, allowing us to capitalize on the energy transition in Europe.\nCombined with the planned exits that we are also announcing, Carrier will become a simpler, focused pure-play leader in intelligent climate and energy solutions that generates higher growth and superior shareholder returns. Before we discuss this transformation in more detail, we will cover the highlights of our Q1 results on Slide 2.\nIn short, good news, the team executed very well. We beat our forecast on the top line with 4% organic growth with double-digit growth in aftermarket, controls, commercial and light commercial HVAC and global truck trailer. Orders were modestly positive in the quarter with year-over-year orders performance improving as the year progressed. Adjusted EPS of $0.52 exceeded our projections, and we generated significantly more free cash flow year-over-year.\nBased on our strong Q1 results, we now have confidence in the high end of our full year adjusted EPS guidance range. Before we discuss our exciting announcement about our future, let me take a brief look back on how far we've come already on Slide 3.\nI am so proud of our team's accomplishments since spin. In short, we do what we say we're going to do. Our commitments were to drive sustained growth, improved margins through rigorous cost reduction, increased aftermarket revenues, deliver strong free cash flow, innovate and ensure customer loyalty, energize our teams and culture and strengthen our portfolio and balance sheet.\nWe have grown sales at an 8% CAGR since 2020. And since 2021, we have expanded margins by 150 basis points and have driven an adjusted EPS CAGR of 19%. We have effectively driven significant productivity, growing our aftermarket double digits annually and have introduced over 400 new products over the past 3 years. We launched important new platforms for our building and cold chain ecosystems, abound and links with both getting superb traction with our customers. We dramatically improved our portfolio, positioning ourselves in the fast-growing VRF market with the acquisition of Toshiba's HVAC business and Giwee while completing the sale of Chubb and our bearer shares.\nWe improved our balance sheet, reducing our net debt by 50% from $10 billion to $5 billion, all while doing $2 billion of share buyback and increasing our dividend payout ratio from 17% in 2020 to a targeted 30% this year. This outstanding performance has been made possible by our world-class workforce and agile new stand-alone culture. As a result of all of that, Carrier stock price has appreciated 229% since our spin date compared to 66% appreciation for the S&P 500.\nSo with our foundation firmly in place and a track record of execution, we are now announcing a purposeful shift in our strategy, which is what you see on Slide 4. We have a very clear and compelling vision. To be the world leader in intelligent climate and energy solutions. Strategically, we are positioning ourselves in the fastest-growing geographies with highly differentiated channel access and the most comprehensive and differentiated suite of sustainable technology and services.\nDigitally enabled life cycle solutions will increase aftermarket and recurring revenues. Our energized team will continue to drive unparalleled customer loyalty and superior shareholder returns. This strategic shift in our vision has led us to the decision to further focus our portfolio and align it with faster-growing end markets, which leads to the announcement that we're making today on Slide 5.\nThe first is the acquisition of Viessmann Group's Climate Solutions business, the premier company in the highest growth segment in the heat pump and energy transition markets. This will also expand our capabilities as a one-stop shop for renewable and climate management solutions. We are also announcing that we are initiating the process of exiting our fire and security and commercial refrigeration businesses. The former decision was easy, combining with the best asset in the best market could not be more compelling and exciting. The latter decision was tough. We love these businesses and our people in them. We have tremendous brands, gross margins, market positions and customer stickiness. But we saw the benefit of focus as we spun from UTC and we are confident that further focus will create additional tremendous value.\nThe result will be a new Carrier with higher revenue and EBITDA growth profiles, leading market positions globally with a portfolio unlike any other company in the world. So let me start with an overview of Viessmann Climate Solutions business on Slide 6. Viessmann Climate Solutions with 11,000 team members as part of the family-owned Viessmann Group who have established market leadership over its 106-year-old history.\nThe company has made a purposeful shift from fossil fuel boilers such that now 70% of its portfolio consists of premier heat pumps, digitally enabled services, solar PV and battery offerings. It also has highly differentiated boiler business that includes state-of-the-art hydrogen-ready offerings. About 40% of its sales are in Germany with very strong positions in France, Poland and Italy. Those 4 countries make up more than 50% of the heat pump installed base in Europe with 20% annual heat pump growth rates. The combination of Carrier and Viessmann's climate solutions creates a tremendous game-changing opportunity. And as a result, the Viessmann founding family is showing great confidence in the combined entity, taking 20% of the purchase price and equity, which has been fixed at signing. And we look forward to Max Viessmann joining our Board of Directors.\nFurthermore, we are excited to welcome the tremendous Viessmann team to the Carrier family to help us realize our shared vision. Carrier and Viessmann share a very similar journey as you see on Slide 7. A phrase that we have used a lot to describe Carrier is a 100-year-old startup. Interestingly, Viessmann is very much the same. Both companies had visionary founders who largely created and shaped the markets that we're in, and both of our businesses have evolved into agile, rapid innovation, climate-focused digital industrial leaders. Together, we are establishing a new global climate champion, and that is 1 of the many reasons why Viessmann Climate Solutions just fits like a glove, as you see on Slide 8.\nThanks to the generations that came before as a Carrier, we have established market-leading positions globally. But when we spun, we had 2 strategic gaps, BRF, which we have now addressed with the acquisitions of Toshiba and Giwee and European residential light commercial heating, which we are now addressing with the premier asset in the space. These transformative moves position Carrier with market-leading positions now globally. So as we look at Slide 9, you see the 3 primary rationales for this tremendously exciting acquisition. First, it is the most attractive market in our space globally. Second, Viessmann Climate Solutions is the premier asset in that market. And third, it positions our portfolio to expand into integrated renewable offerings in a unique and differentiated way. So I'll address each of these 3 elements, starting on Slide 10, explaining why the market itself is so attractive.\nThe megatrends that you see here are reshaping our industry. Climate change and sustainability, energy security and the rapid adoption of green energy solutions accelerated by government regulations and incentives. These secular trends are indeed global but are clearly most acute in Europe. Europe has long been out in front on sustainability. The Paris Agreement and the European Green deal set a target for a 55% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Fit for 55 targeted 40% renewable energy in Europe by 2030, which was recently raised to 45% when the EU passed REPowerEU following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nREPowerEU also aims to double the current rate of individual heat pumps to reach 10 million additional units over the next 5 years. Likewise, 17 European countries have announced or implemented bans on newly installed fossil fuel heating systems for homes, which has been supported by government subsidies. The result is the massive growth that you see on Slide 11.\nThere are 8.5 million heat pumps in European homes, which is expected to increase 25% annually to 40 million by 2030. Residential battery sales are also projected to increase over 20% annually during this time frame with a double-digit annual increase in residential solar PV sales as well. Carrier does not offer solar PV and home battery solutions today. So Viessmann Climate Solutions offering provide Carrier the perfect opportunity to pursue an incremental fast-growing annual TAM of $35 billion. The shift to heat pumps is unique and compelling, given the mix-up opportunity that you see on Slide 12.\nFirst is the rapid adoption of heat pumps, from selling about 1 million per year, going up to 10 million per year in 2030. Now factor in the positive mix impact with heat pump selling for as much as 4x per unit compared to boilers. The result of that combination is that the EU residential heat pump market is expected to grow revenues 25% annually for the coming years. The opportunity is tremendous.\nSo turning to Slide 13. Let me provide some additional color on why Viessmann Climate Solutions is the premier company in this space. Thanks to Professor Dr. Martin Viessmann, who represents the third generation of the founding family and his courageous move 30 years ago, Viessmann Climate Solutions is 1 of the very few companies in Europe that primarily sells directly to installers. 75,000 of them, with whom they have deep, long-standing relationships. This highly differentiated channel allows for best-in-class customer intimacy, rapid innovation in response to the customer desires and digital connectivity. Likewise, the Viessmann brand is iconic and highly trusted across Europe. It has often been compared to as the Mercedes of residential heating brands.\nDuring German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz's most recent New Year's address, he singled out Viessmann as a shining example of the innovative side of Germany. It has the highest ranked heating and energy brand in Germany and has been the most trusted OEM for almost 2 decades. The result thousands of customers recognize and demand Viessmann climate solutions and are willing to pay a premium for it. Its excellent reputation is largely driven by its track record of product leadership and premier innovation, as you see on Slide 14.\nViessmann Climate Solutions has leaned in to the use of natural refrigerants and as heat pumps require 50% less floor space and installation time. They also developed a new integrated heating solution called Viessmann Invisible, a patented concept, which optimizes space and aesthetics by integrating the heat pump, air handler, water tank and accessories into a decorative indoor panel. They are at the digital forefront, providing innovative heating as a service offerings and generating subscription-based recurring revenues. The result outside top and bottom line growth, as you see on Slide 15.\nWe expect approximately EUR 700 million of EBITDA on EUR 4 billion of sales in 2023. Fast forward to 2025, we expect those numbers to increase to over EUR 900 million and EUR 5 billion, respectively. That's double-digit top and bottom line growth, and it's nothing new for them. They've done it in the last few years, and we expect it to continue going forward. So best asset in the best market.\nWhat's equally exciting is that the combination positions Carrier to enter an entirely new market given that Viessmann Climate Solutions has effectively established and ecosystem approach, as you see on Slide 16. Viessmann has done a masterful job of creating common and distinctive designs across its product portfolio that all interact seamlessly with 1 another, so the consumer becomes attached to its ecosystem with multiple interoperable products, digital and value-added services.\nMax Viessmann and his team have effectively implemented this strategy. Its solar PV battery and heat pump systems can all be installed at different times, but are then seamlessly interconnected and interoperable, all underpinned by their common digital platform, one base. One base gives the customer an easy, reliable and quick way to operate their energy system via an app. The platform bundles devices and electronic applications into 1 single climate and energy solution for the home.\nThe beauty, as you see on Slide 17, is that Viessmann Climate Solutions is the only company in the industry with such a comprehensive solution level offering. When you combine Viessmann Climate Solutions unique market position and breadth of offerings with Carrier's technology and global channels the opportunity for us to create unique value to our homeowner and other customers and importantly, the planet is truly differentiated. Homeowners in Germany with boilers spend on average EUR 2,200 per year on gas heating.\nSwitching to an electric key pump can reduce the owner's cost by over 20% to EUR 1,700 per year. If those same homeowners implemented a complete renewable solution with solar PV, battery storage, heat pumps and an energy management solution with effective grid management and controls, they could reduce annual heating bills by 60% to 80% to about EUR 700 per year. Those same owners, same homeowners would also reduce their individual carbon footprint by about 50%.\nSo the world continues to be more electrified, integrated solutions provide a step change in customer value and benefit to our planet. This broad suite of offerings introduces a new addressable market to Carrier, as you see on Slide 18.\nHeat pump sells for about 4x the price of a boiler. When you add solar PV, battery and accessories and services, the installed price can be as high as 15 to 20x the installed price of a stand-alone boiler. The result is Carrier's ability to now pursue a $35 billion fast-growing market opportunity. The key to success is effectively integrating and coming together as 1 team. We have done it so effectively before, and I have no doubt that we'll continue to do it again as we see here on Slide 19.\nViessmann Climate Solutions is a highly integrated successful, well-run business. It has tremendous people, 1 ERP system, 1 brand, a deep well-established channel and a strong operations and innovation. We have been very impressed with Thomas Heim, Viessmann Climate Solutions CEO and his leadership team. Thomas will lead Carrier and Viessmann Climate Solutions Center of Excellence for our combined residential and light commercial European business, which will continue to be headquartered in Allendorf, Germany.\nAfter completing the acquisition and business exits, the vast majority of our business will be HVAC. As a result, Chris Nelson and I have collaboratively agreed to streamline the organization. Our superb HVAC business leaders will now report directly to me, and Chris will be departing Carrier next month. He has served the company for 19 years so well, and we wish him nothing but the best.\nAnother reason for confidence in the integration is how well our cultures align, as you see on Slide 20. A passion for customers and results, unwavering commitment to our people, values and purpose, innovation, community and a deep passion for the environment. Together, we will achieve important and compelling sustainability targets. We are aligned and cannot wait to move forward together as 1 team. Our base business case includes the cost synergies that you see on Slide 21.\nWe have identified EUR 200 million of cost synergies, the vast majority of which will be achieved by year 3, and we have a track record of over achieving our projections. On Toshiba, we committed to $100 million of synergies, and we are tracking to do meaningfully better than that. Viessmann Climate Solutions is a rapidly growing business, so this is not about employment reductions. Rather, about 85% of the cost synergies are driven by procurement and in-sourcing. For example, we anticipate in-sourcing differentiated inverter drives from Toshiba, heat exchangers from our facilities in Spain and Poland as well as other components like rotary compressors and [ vents ].\nCost synergies are expected to increase Viessmann Climate Solutions margins by over 200 basis points within 3 years. There were also revenue synergy opportunities, which we have not included in our base estimates such as introducing multi-tier offerings into Viessmann Climate Solutions channel and leveraging its digital ecosystem offerings and technologies more broadly across Carrier's channel. Now I will turn it over to Patrick to take you through the transaction itself on Slide 22.\n\nPatrick Goris\n\nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave. The enterprise value is EUR 12 billion, which is about 13x forecasted 2023 EBITDA, assuming EUR 200 million of run rate synergies. We are very pleased that the Viessmann founding family elected to take 20% of the transaction value in Carrier equity and that the family is making a long-term holding commitment. They share our excitement about the future -- the future value we believe this transaction will provide to our stakeholders.\nThe number of shares are based on a VWAP prior to signing and are those fixed. The balance of the purchase price, EUR 9.6 billion will be funded through a combination of cash on hand and debt. With respect to cash, we have $3.3 billion at the end of Q1, and we expect that to grow to about $4.5 billion by year-end, excluding the impact of the acquisition, since we paused share repurchases.\nWe have fully committed financing in place for about EUR 7 billion and have hedged the cash portion of the euro-based purchase price. Given Viessmann Climate Solutions growth profile, the acquisition is expected to add over 100 basis points to Carrier's overall revenue and EBITDA growth profile. We expect a high single-digit free cash flow yield starting in year 5. While the acquisition is expected to be adjusted net income accretive in 2024, we expect the acquisition to be adjusted EPS accretive starting in 2025 because of the additional shares outstanding.\nRetaining solid investment-grade credit ratings is very important to us. Yesterday, Moody's, S&P and Fitch have reaffirmed our current investment-grade ratings following the announcement of this transaction. Excluding proceeds from the business exits, we plan on deleveraging quickly following the transaction, returning to about 2x net leverage in 2025, after which we expect to resume share repurchases. The timing and net proceeds of the business exits may, of course, accelerate the timing of both the deleveraging and the resumption of share repurchases. We expect to repurchase the equivalent number of shares issued to the Viessmann founding family as soon as we reach our target leverage. This could happen as soon as 2024.\nFinally, we remain committed to a sustainable and growing dividend and expect the transaction to close around the end of 2023.\n\nDavid Gitlin\n\nPresident & CEO of Carrier, United Technologies Corporation\n\nWell, thank you, Patrick. [Technical Difficulty] So the $1.1 billion business that we are exiting at high single-digit EBITDA margins last year, we have invested significantly in restructuring and improving the margins of the business, which will significantly benefit the business going forward. We expect to exit this business over the course of 2024.\nTo be clear, we are retaining our cold chain solutions and transport refrigeration business, which includes truck, trailer, container, Sensitech sensors and our Lynx platform and all the related aftermarket and digital offerings.\nSo in summary, on Slide 25. These moves position us as a higher top and bottom line growth company. Had we made these transformational moves 3 years ago, Carrier's revenue CAGR would have been 2x the rate that we indeed achieved, mid-teens rather than 8%, thus giving us confidence that we are transforming into a sustained higher growth profile company.\nWith Viessmann Climate Solutions, we are now positioning ourselves to be the Global Climate Solutions Champion. We are buying the premier asset in the premier market. We are standing by our commitment with our portfolio to be clinical and dispassionate and though we are selling tremendous franchises, the result will be a focused, differentiated carrier that drives higher growth and returns for our shareholders and value for our employees and customers.\nAnd with that, we'll open this up for questions."

I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Sam Pearlstein, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nSamuel Joel Pearlstein\n\nVP of IR, Carrier Global Corporation\n\nThank you, and good morning, and welcome to Carrier's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. With me here today are David Gitlin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Goris, Chief Financial Officer.\nWe will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call, which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial conformance of the business.\nThese non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in our earnings presentation, which is available to download from Carrier's website at ir.carrier.com. The company reminds listeners that the sales, earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided during the call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Carrier's SEC filings, including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. (Operator Instructions)\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Dave Gitlin.\n\nDavid L. Gitlin\n\nChairman & CEO, Carrier Global Corporation\n\nThank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. Our Q4 results for sales, earnings and cash flow were all in line with our expectations, as you can see starting on Slide 2. We delivered organic sales growth of 5%, supported by another quarter of double-digit growth in light commercial and commercial VAC, global truck and trailer and aftermarket. Pricing remained strong and our realization continued to offset inflationary headwinds. Supply chain improvements continued, allowing for a reduction of our past due shipments with further improvements anticipated in 2023.\nOur backlog, which ended up mid-single digits year-over-year, up 40% on a 2-year stack and up 2x from 2019 remains at very healthy levels. Adjusted operating margins of 10.1% were flattish compared to last year despite a 70 basis point impact from the consolidation of the Toshiba joint venture. We made great progress on our productivity initiatives in the quarter and achieved our full year target of $300 million in savings.\nAdjusted EPS was $0.40 in the quarter at the high end of our guidance range. We generated about $1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter ending 2022 with $3.5 billion of cash, allowing us to continue to play offense with capital deployment as we head into 2023.\nMoving to Slide 3. I am proud of our team's accomplishments last year. We delivered on our full outlook for sales, adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS while significantly advancing our strategic priorities. We drove 8% organic sales growth, adjusted operating margin expansion of 60 basis points and adjusted EPS growth of about 15% when we exclude the impact of the Chubb divestiture.\nThough we did fall short of our original $1.65 billion free cash flow guide, we discussed in October resulting from supply chain and related inventory challenges, we did deliver on our revised guidance of $1.4 billion as a result of our strong Q4 performance. So our track record of delivering results without surprises continues, and our team is poised to continue to deliver in 2023, in part because of key secular trends that drive demand, as you can see on Slide 4.\nOur customers continue to look to us for healthy and sustainable solutions, and we have differentiated offerings that meet their needs, particularly in the fast-growing heat pump space.\nOur North America residential heat pump sales grew 35% in the quarter. However, European commercial heat pump sales were up 30%. We expect those areas to only grow stronger as the inflation Reduction Act and the repower EU initiative propel increased adoption. Additionally, Toshiba's innovative and leading inverter technology continues to impress. When combined with our multi rotary compressors, heat pump efficiency and capacity dramatically improve. Toshiba's technology and expertise are also helping us penetrate the attractive and growing residential heat pump market.\nOur position in transport electrification is also market-leading. We have units operating in 15 countries and plan to ramp significantly with more than half of refrigerated transport units sold to be electric by 2030. The healthy building trends continued to be a positive in the quarter as orders were up over 80% and our pipeline increased to over $1 billion. For the full year, healthy building orders were up about 50%.\nK-12 also remains encouraging with our pipeline up about 60% year-over-year, and with almost 2/3 of the federal government's SR funds yet to be allocated, we expect further acceleration into 2023.\nAs we continue to distinguish ourselves as a climate systems and solutions company, we remain focused not only on achieving our own ESG goals, but also helping our customers achieve theirs as well. We recently increased our previous aggressive 2030 net-zero targets, committing to set greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in line with the science-based target initiative criteria. Additionally, Carrier continues to be recognized in the ESG space, including distinguished recognition in London, where our customers' heating network will provide a $0.50 reduction in carbon emissions to network participants.\nWe also continued to perform on our aftermarket growth objectives, as you can see on Slide 5. When we became a stand-alone public company in early 2020, we emphasize increasing aftermarket growth rates from historical low single-digit levels.\nAnd last year, we produced another year of double-digit aftermarket growth. Our focus remains on providing differentiated digital solutions through our Abound and Lynx platforms and connecting not only our new products, but also our significant installed base. Our bound technology now monitors over 1 billion square feet, and we recently onboarded over 100 commercial sites for a key large-scale customer.\nWe recently released the Abound Net Zero Management, which provides customers with an easy way to view, track and analyze energy usage and emissions data across their global footprint and proactively identify conservation measures. We've made similar progress with our innovative Lynx platform and launched several new capabilities in the quarter. We expanded our reefer health capabilities to include early refrigerant leak detection, and launched a managed services linked fleet offering for a major grocery retail chain in the U.S.\nWe achieved our goal of having 70,000 chillers under long-term agreements by the end of 2022 and expect to increase that by another 10,000 in 2023. Importantly, we also achieved our objective of having 20,000 connected chillers and plan to connect another 10,000 this year. We recently announced a strategic collaboration agreement with Amazon Web Services to jointly build, market and sell Carrier's digital.\nNot only are we delivering on our financial and strategic imperatives, we are also making great progress on our portfolio optimization and executing on our capital deployment priorities as you can see on Slide 6. You'll recall that at the time of our spin, we carried approximately $11 billion of debt on our balance sheet and cash of about $1 billion. Over the course of just 2.5 years, we have reduced our net debt levels nearly in half from that $10 billion level to $5.3 billion while increasing our strategic organic growth investments by over $300 million.\nWe have also completed a number of compelling acquisitions highlighted by the consolidation of Toshiba Carrier. All acquisitions have been strategic and core to our business focused on enhancing sustainability leadership, accelerating aftermarket growth, driving digital and technology differentiation and expanding adjacencies and geographic coverage.\nWe've also been disciplined in evaluating our existing portfolio to ensure each business is core and that we are the best owner. Result, we optimized our portfolio by completing the sale of Chubb in our shares -- completing the sale of Chubb and our shares in Bayer while also reducing our minority joint venture count from 41 to 29 since spin.\nIn addition to our portfolio moves, we've been disciplined and proactive with our other capital deployment actions. We have steadily and consistently increased our dividend and have completed about $2 billion in share repurchases since spin. All of this to say, we have made great progress over the last few years, but that does not mean that we are done. We are always evaluating acquisitions in our current portfolio for potential opportunities for simplification and value creation. We will remain steadfast in our commitment to keep evaluating our portfolio as we enter 2023 and beyond.\nPatrick will cover our 2023 guidance in more detail, but I will emphasize a few highlights on Slide 7. Focus remains very thematic for us. All of our 52,000 team members are aligned on our key priorities, and those priorities remain consistent. Carrier 2.0 is a term that we have been using internally, which represents a very purposeful shift from a primary focus on selling equipment to now using digital and innovation to provide our customers with sustainable and healthy outcomes throughout the life cycle of our product and service offerings. The result will be our continued pursuit of higher margin, high aftermarket growth rates.\nWe remain focused on reducing costs and expect to get another $300 million in productivity in 2023. We are clear-eyed about the broader economic challenges and uncertainty in 2023 and have done our best to calibrate macro factors in our guidance that you see along the left of this slide. We expect to deliver solid organic growth, strong margin expansion, excluding TCC and high single-digit to low double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Strong free cash flow and a very healthy balance sheet enable us to play offense on capital deployment.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Patrick. Patrick?\n\nPatrick P. Goris\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8. In short, Q4 was very much in line with our expectations and the guide we provided. Reported sales were $5.1 billion, with 5% organic sales growth driven by about 8% price with volume down a couple of points. I'll provide a bit more detail on a future slide, but in essence, we saw continued strong organic growth in HVAC, Fire & Security and global truck and trailer, which was partially offset by a very weak quarter in container and, to a lesser extent, commercial refrigeration.\nThe Chubb divestiture reduced sales by 10% in acquisitions, substantially all Toshiba Carrier increased sales by 8%. Currency translation was a headwind of 4%. All segments were price/cost positive or neutral in the quarter.\nQ4 adjusted operating margin was about flat compared to last year, driven by a 70 bps margin headwind related to the TCC acquisition. Strong productivity almost completely offset the margin headwinds related to the lower volume and the TCC acquisition.\nAdjusted EPS of $0.40 was consistent with the upper end of our full year guidance range. For your reference, we have included the year-over-year Q4 adjusted EPS bridge in the appendix on Slide 20. $1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter was also as expected, and we generated about $1.4 billion for the full year.\nMoving on to the segments, starting on Slide 9. HVAC reported sales included a 16% benefit from the TCC acquisition. HVAC organic sales were up 9%, driven by low single-digit growth in residential, over 40% growth in light commercial and mid-teens growth in commercial HVAC. Sales growth was driven by both price and volume. Residential movement was down about 10% in the fourth quarter and quarter end field inventory levels ended up higher than the flat year-over-year levels we targeted.\nResidential HVAC growth was driven by price as volume was down mid-single digits. Commercial HVAC had another very strong quarter with double-digit sales growth in applied equipment, aftermarket and controls. All regions grew double digits. Adjusted operating margin was up 60 bps with volume, price/cost and productivity more than offsetting a 100 bps margin headwind related to TCC. Full year operating margin for this segment was 15.2%, in line with the guide we provided post the TCC acquisition, which had about a 70 bps dilutive impact on 2022 for this segment.\nTransitioning to refrigeration on Slide 10. Organic sales were down 7% and currency translation was also a 7% headwind. Within transport refrigeration, North America truck and trailer sales were up low teens and European truck and trailer was up high teens. This continued strong performance was more than offset container, which was down about 50% year-over-year driven by demand softness as well as a tough comp in the prior year. This is the second competitive down quarter for the container business and historical down cycles for this business have lasted about 4 quarters.\nCommercial refrigeration was down high single digits year-over-year as our European food retail customers continue to be pressured by inflation and energy prices. Adjusted operating margins for this segment were up 60 bps compared to last year despite lower sales with the margin headwind of lower volume, more than offset by productivity and price cost. Full year operating margin of 12.8% was slightly ahead of our 12.5% guide and expanded over 70 bps compared to 2021, despite lower sales as our refrigeration team managed price costs and delivered strong full year productivity to offset the impact of lower volume.\nMoving on to Fire & Security on Slide 11. As expected, the Chubb divestiture had a significant impact on reported sales. Organic sales growth was 6%, driven by price with volume down low single digits. Operating margin was short of our expectations for this segment due to continued high supply chain and logistics costs and operational performance challenges. As a result, full year operating margin of 15.2% for this segment was short of our 16% operating margin guide.\nSlide 12 provides more details on backlog and orders performance. As our backlogs normalize in some of our shorter-cycle businesses, such as residential HVAC, we expect order trends to adjust accordingly. We have seen that trend over the last few quarters and in Q4, particularly. As you can see on the left side, total company organic orders were down roughly 10% for the quarter and up compared to 2019 and 2020. Backlog ended the year up mid-single digits compared to last year, with backlog growth in HVAC and Fire & Security, partially offset by backlog reduction in refrigeration. As expected, Residential HVAC orders were down in Q4.\nLight commercial demand remains robust as orders were up mid-teens in the quarter. The backlog is up well over 2x for that business. Commercial HVAC saw double-digit orders growth for the eighth consecutive quarter. The commercial backlog is now up 35% compared to last year and extends well into 2023.\nRefrigeration orders were down roughly 10% in the quarter, driven by market weakness in container and commercial refrigeration that was only partially offset by global truck and trailer. North America truck and trailer continued to have strong orders in the quarter, up over 100% compared to last year. Global truck and trailer backlog is up high single digits as the strength in North America offset order weakness in Europe.\nContainer orders were down about 50% compared to a very strong fourth quarter last year. Commercial refrigeration orders remain weak and reflect market softness. Finally, Demand for our Fire & Security products was mixed. Orders were positive in roughly half of the businesses, including residential fire and access solutions. Fire & Security Products backlog is up almost 30% year-over-year with double-digit growth in all the businesses, except residential fire in the Americas.\nOverall, we entered 2023 with strong backlogs and continued strong order trends in commercial and light commercial HVAC and North American truck and trailer.\nBusinesses experiencing softer order intake include container, commercial refrigerating and residential HVAC.\nNow moving on to our '23 guidance on Slide 13. We expect reported sales of about $22 billion, including organic sales growth of low to mid-single digits. Almost all the organic growth will be priced as we expect volume growth to be flattish. We expect currency translation to be about 1 point headwind on while acquisitions, primarily the impact of Toshiba Carrier will contribute about 6% to the growth.\nAdjusted operating profit is expected to be up compared to 2022 with operating margin at about 14%, including a 50 bps dilutive impact from Toshiba Carrier. We expect high single-digit to low double-digit adjusted EPS growth in 2023. I'll provide more color on that on the next slide.\nWe expect a 23% adjusted effective tax rate and full year free cash flow of about $1.9 billion or about 100% of net income. Our free cash flow guidance assumes approximately $75 million of cash restructuring payments and about $100 million tax headwind since Congress has not renewed the full expensing of R&D. As shown on the right side of the slide, we expect mid-single-digit organic growth in HVAC as continued strong growth in light commercial, commercial HVAC and aftermarket are more than offset flat residential.\nReported HVAC sales growth should be in the low teens -- in the low double digits, given the additional contribution from 7 more months of consolidating Toshiba Carrier. In Refrigeration, we expect flattish organic sales as continued strong growth in global truck and trailer is offset by container and commercial refrigeration. For Fire & Security, we expect low single-digit organic growth. We expect the HVAC segment operating margin to be similar in 2022 despite absorbing about 100 bps of pressure from the consolidation of Toshiba, and expect operating margin expansion in Refrigeration and Fire & Security.\nLet's move to Slide 14, adjusted 2023 EPS bridge at our guidance midpoint. Our operating profit is expected to be up about $200 million, despite flattish volume growth. Price cost and gross productivity combined or an expected operating profit tailwind of $500 million, with $200 million coming from price cost and $300 million coming from gross productivity. Annual merit adjustments and investments about amounts to about $200 million in total, and we expect about a $50 million additional headwind of TCC integration costs. There are some other minor smaller moving pieces, but that all adds up to roughly $200 million in increased adjusted operating profit.\nCore earnings conversion, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and FX is about 35% at the guidance midpoint. Moving to the right on the bridge, some modest savings on net interest expense and a lower share count offset the expected higher tax rate and currency translation headwinds. That gets us to our midpoint of about $255 million for next year or 9% growth compared to 2022. As usual, we provide estimates of other items in the appendix on Slide 19.\nOn Slide 15, you'll see that our capital allocation priorities remain the same. In 2023, we expect about $400 million in capital expenditures. We recently announced another significant dividend increase and our dividend payout ratio is about 30%. Finally, we target $1.5 billion to $2 billion in share repurchases in 2023.\nBefore I turn it over to Dave, let me provide some additional color on the first quarter. We expect a $0.06 headwind from a higher effective tax rate of about 25% compared to 16% last year. In addition, we expect our first quarter to be the weakest quarter from an organic revenue growth perspective with organic sales growth flat and volumes down. This reflects continued growth in the HVAC and Fire & Security segments and a decline in the Refrigeration segment driven by container and commercial refrigeration. We expect residential HVAC to be down mid-single digits in Q1.\nRecall that our Q1 '22 rental HVAC sales were up an industry-leading 23%, so certainly a tough comp for that business. Overall, we expect revenues in Q1 to be a little over $5 billion and adjusted EPS to be between $0.45, $0.50. We expect first half adjusted EPS to be about $0.45 to $0.50 of full year earnings, the reverse of 2022. And as usual, free cash flow will be more weighted to the second half. We expect organic revenue growth to sequentially improve after Q1 with easier comps in the second half of 2023.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Dave.\n\nDavid L. Gitlin\n\nChairman & CEO, Carrier Global Corporation\n\nThanks, Patrick. We delivered strong performance in 2022, and we are targeting another strong year this year as we continue to execute and control the controllables. We continue to see opportunities to use our strong balance sheet to create value for our customers, shareholders and the planet for future generations to come.\nWith that, we'll open this up for questions."

I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Sam Pearlstein, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nSamuel Joel Pearlstein\n\nVP of IR, Carrier Global Corporation\n\nThank you, and good morning, and welcome to Carrier's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. With me here today are David Gitlin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Goris, Chief Financial Officer.\nWe will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call, which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in our earnings presentation, which is available to download from Carrier's website at ir.carrier.com. The company reminds listeners that the sales, earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided during the call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Carrier's SEC filings, including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. (Operator Instructions)\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Dave Gitlin.\n\nDavid L. Gitlin\n\nChairman & CEO, Carrier Global Corporation\n\nThank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying how proud I am of this tremendous Carrier team, which continues to deliver strong and consistent results.\nTurning to Slide 2 for a summary of our Q3 results. We delivered 8% organic sales growth on the heels of continued traction on pricing. Total company organic orders were up 3% in the quarter, and our backlog is up about 10% year-over-year. Importantly, we continue to deliver double-digit aftermarket organic growth. Adjusted operating profit was slightly better than we expected, and price cost continues to be positive. We are tracking to about $300 million of gross productivity, about $100 million of which will come from G&A reductions. We generated strong free cash flow in the quarter of approximately $700 million. Supply chains are generally improving. We have increased dual sourcing for critical components and supplier on-time delivery has meaningfully improved.\nThe improvements, though study have been later in the year than planned, thus impacting our full year free cash flow forecast. As supply chain and working capital improve, we expect to return to 100% free cash flow conversion. We successfully closed the Toshiba Carrier acquisition during the quarter, and we are making important progress on integration and are starting to realize synergies. We still have plenty of capacity for additional value-add capital deployment as our balance sheet remains very solid with approximately $3 billion of cash and no debt maturities until 2025. Earlier this week, our Board approved a $2 billion share repurchase authorization, which is on top of the $300 million remaining on the previous authorization. We are confident in our strategy and long-term prospects and remain committed to delivering shareholder value through disciplined capital allocation, including organic growth investments, M&A, dividends and share buybacks.\nMoving to Slide 3. I want to again emphasize our commitment to the value creation framework that we presented at our Investor Day earlier this year. Our team remains laser-focused on these 4 principles of driving above-market organic growth, expanding margins, delivering strong free cash flow and disciplined capital allocation. We have a thorough goal alignment process that cascades our critical focus areas to each of our 55,000 team members' individual performance goals.\nWe are making significant progress on our priorities, as you can see on Slide 4. Secular trends continue to drive sticky customer demand and one theme that certainly fits that definition is sustainability. Our customers in both the commercial and residential verticals are motivated to achieve their ESG targets and reduce their carbon footprint and energy bills with government mandates, policies and incentives further fueling this demand. A key sustainability enabler is the shift to electrification in buildings and cold chain distribution.\nStarting with buildings. In the U.S., the rapid transition to heat pumps will be further accelerated by the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act. Today, over 30% of our residential split sales include heat pumps. In Q3, our residential heat pump shipments were up over 30% compared to last year. We established our Tennessee facility as our North American heat pump center of excellence and are expanding customer financing offerings through our new EcoHome initiative. In addition to heat pumps, we continue to lead through innovation with energy-efficient solutions. The cutover to our differentiated new 2023 SEER 2 compliant units has gone well, and our resi HVAC team has done a great job managing the production and inventory transition.\nWe recently hosted 8,000 Carrier and Bryant dealers in Las Vegas and our industry-leading dealer network is energized about the product lineup. Our new indoor and outdoor units are complete redesign, differentiated in performance, size and weight. In addition, a 45% SKU reduction provides flexibility and operational efficiencies to the channel and to us. We are driving aggressive cost reduction actions and are pricing the new more efficient units, at least a 10% to 15% premium over previous-generation products.\nIn Europe, where we are the leader in commercial heat pumps, Q2 and Q3 heat pump orders were up 30%, and we anticipate the same magnitude for the full year. And the TCC acquisition enables us to accelerate product development in the heat pump segment and become a more significant player in the fast-growing Asia VRF heat pump market. We also continue to benefit from the shift to electrification in our truck trailer business with strong traction on our innovative Vector eCool units. Customers now operate these units in 11 countries, and our market leadership in this segment is being recognized. Just recently, Vector eCool earned the top product of the year award from the Environment and Energy Leader Awards program.\nIn addition to sustainability, we continue to lean into the opportunity presented by the increased focus on health and wellness. We are proud to partner with our friend, Russell Wilson as we work with large-scale customers to provide them with safe and healthy indoor environments. Demand for our innovative solution continues to build. In Q3, healthy building orders were up over 55% compared to last year, and our pipeline increased to about $900 million. Within the K-12 vertical, Q3 orders were up 20% and we are up about 35% year-to-date. Our intense focus is on digitalization goal for many reasons, but at its core, we are transitioning Carrier from an equipment-centric provider to a solutions company with more aftermarket and recurring revenues.\nThe opportunity to use digital offerings to embed ourselves in our customers' ecosystem to help them achieve specific outcomes is tremendous. Our Abound & Lynx digital platform sends and collect data and interact with key building and cold chain system technologies to provide customers with the outcomes they desire. Abound not only provides healthy and sustainable solutions, we have also introduced new applications, including Abound predictive insights that reduce the total cost of asset ownership by enabling smarter, and more predictive maintenance to optimize equipment health and performance.\nMy leadership team and I are interacting directly with scale customers, and I can tell you that their willingness to make long-term commitments to Carrier is encouraging. Recent Abound wins include a nationwide drugstore chain that will add an additional 2,500 stores to our growing portfolio of managed multisite retail locations and an installation of more than 100 commercial office buildings for a key scale customer.\nOur efforts here are being recognized as the Abound EcoEnergy has received 5 awards in 2022 for innovation, impact and customer service excellence and its ability to deliver positive outcomes. Growing Abound sales will generate higher margin, more predictable recurring revenues and a stronger pull for additional equipment sales and services. And the same holds true for Lynx and our cold chain initiatives. We continue to add capabilities to our Lynx platform focused on providing our customers with greater flexibility, visibility and intelligence across the cold chain. Our advanced reefer equipment insights and analytic models provide early and automated detection of refrigerant loss, enabling our customers to improve their asset uptime and operational performance and to protect the invaluable refrigerated cargo.\nIn our North American truck/trailer business, Q3 saw a more than 60%, six zero percent, year-over-year increase in service revenues driven by thousands of new Lynx subscriptions. We remain on track for 100,000 new Lynx subscriptions by year-end. Our traction on solution selling driving more recurring revenues is reflected in our continued aftermarket performance, as you can see on Slide 5. Aftermarket was up double digits organically in the third quarter, and we continue to expect to realize over $7 billion in revenue by 2026.\nConnected devices are a fundamental enabler. We remain on track for about 20,000 connected chillers, our attachment rate was 40% in the third quarter, and we expect to have 70,000 chillers under BlueEdge contracts by year-end. We are also expanding our parts sales enabled by our Breeze platform where we onboarded 2 new national accounts. Our aftermarket playbook is deeply embedded in our DNA, and we are seeing the results quarter-over-quarter.\nLastly, on Slide 6. We continue to be confident in our ability to drive shareholder value even in the face of economic uncertainty by staying true to our proven strategy. We have consistently exceeded our expectations, and we will utilize that same playbook in 2023 and beyond, driving strong and recurring growth through differentiated solutions that address secular trends and increased aftermarket opportunities, eliminating waste and driving tenacious cost reduction and remaining disciplined in our capital allocation to accelerate growth and return capital to shareholders. As we close out Q4 and look ahead to 2023, we will control the controllables by doubling down on this proven playbook.\nI am deeply confident in the Carrier's team ability to drive continued strong results despite challenges that may be thrown our way. With that, let me turn it over to Patrick. Patrick?\n\nPatrick P. Goris\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 7. Reported sales of $5.5 billion were up 2% compared to last year, and organic sales were up 8%, driven by price, with volumes flat. The Chubb divestiture reduced sales by 10% and acquisitions, substantially all Toshiba Carrier increased sales by 8%. Currency translation was a larger-than-expected headwind of 4%. All the segments were price/cost positive in the quarter.\nQ3 adjusted operating margin was down 40 basis points compared to last year. The margin impact of the Chubb divestiture and the TCC acquisition at about 70 basis points each offset each other. Price cost, although positive in the quarter, is a margin headwind of about 30 basis points. The adjusted effective tax rate of 23% is in line with what we now project our ongoing annual effective tax rate to be given the Toshiba acquisition. Adjusted EPS of $0.70 was stronger than expected and includes a $0.02 benefit from Toshiba, which will reverse in Q4, in essence, timing of integration expenses. For your reference, we have a year-over-year Q3 adjusted EPS bridge in the appendix on Slide 17. Free cash flow in the quarter was $699 million. While there has been some improvement in the supply chain, component shortages continue to affect deliveries and shipments and thus, inventory levels.\nBefore I move on to the segments, let me make a comment about the other income you see in our P&L. As a result of the Toshiba Carrier acquisition, we recorded a onetime gain of about $730 million in Q3, which, in essence, is the step-up associated with the ownership stake we already had in Toshiba Carrier. This is not a taxable event. We exclude this onetime gain and amortization related to acquired intangibles from adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS.\nMoving on to the segments, starting on Slide 8. HVAC reported sales were up 22% and of course, reflect the impact of Toshiba, which added 12 points of year-over-year growth. HVAC organic sales were up 13%, driven by high single-digit growth in residential and strong double-digit growth in our light commercial and commercial HVAC businesses. Resi movement was down mid-single digits in the third quarter, and quarter-end field inventory levels are up about 20% year-over-year. We continue to work towards balanced year-over-year field inventory levels by year-end as we transition to the new 2023 products. Residential HVAC growth was all driven by price as volume was down mid-single digits.\nOur light commercial business grew over 20% in Q3 and field inventories remained down about 10% year-over-year. Commercial HVAC had a very strong quarter with double-digit growth in applied equipment, aftermarket and controls. All regions grew mid-teens. Sales in China were up more than 50% as we recovered from the impact of the Q2 Shanghai lockdowns. Adjusted operating profit for the HVAC segment was up 6% compared to last year. As expected, operating margin was down 260 basis points with about 150 basis point impact from the Toshiba consolidation and 90 basis points due to price cost. The balance is unfavorable mix and lower JV income, offset by good productivity. We expect the HVAC segment to remain price/cost positive for the full year and to deliver full year margins of about 15%, consistent with what I shared with you last quarter. The Toshiba acquisition has about a 100 basis point dilutive impact on full year 2022 margins for this segment.\nTransitioning to refrigeration on Slide 9. Q3 reported sales include a significant headwind from currency translation as this segment is very global. Organic sales were down slightly, given significant supply chain constraints as truck/trailer growth offset declines in container and commercial refrigeration. With transport refrigeration or within transport refrigeration, North America truck/trailer saw a strong growth in the quarter, up high teens. However, supply chain issues affected Europe truck/trailer leading to increased backlog and inventories.\nContainer sales were down about 20% year-over-year based on demand softness as well as tough comps. Sensitech delivered another strong quarter with double-digit sales growth. Commercial refrigeration was flat year-over-year as our European food retail customers are pressured by high inflation and energy prices. Adjusted operating margins were up 80 bps compared to last year despite lower sales with favorable productivity, price cost and currency translation more than offsetting the volume headwind. The segment remains on track to deliver margins of about 12.5% this year.\nMoving on to Fire & Security on Slide 10. Excluding Chubb sales from the third quarter of 2021, Fire & Security segment sales were up 6%. Adjusted operating margins expanded 220 basis points in the quarter, mainly because of the Chubb divestiture and productivity, which more than offset the impact of negative volume. This segment is particularly impacted by supply chain challenges, especially in the higher-margin access solutions business. Price/cost was positive and this segment remains on track to deliver margins of about 16% this year.\nSlide 11 provides more details on orders performance. The total company organic orders were up low single digits for the quarter, and backlog remained strong throughout all segments. Similar to last quarter and as expected, resi HVAC orders were down in Q3 as the business continues to prioritize their order book and normalize the backlog that is still measured in months, versus typically weeks. Light commercial demand remained robust, and orders were up almost 50% in the quarter. Backlog is up 3.5x year-over-year within that business, which should position us for a good start to 2023. And as I mentioned, commercial HVAC saw double-digit orders growth for the seventh consecutive quarter. All regions within commercial HVAC saw double-digit growth and the commercial backlog, excluding NORESCO, is now up over 35% compared to last year and extends well into 2023.\nRefrigeration orders were up mid- to high single digits in the quarter, driven by an almost tripling of orders in North America truck/trailer as we opened the order book for the first half of 2023 in September. Given how we manage the order book, a better year-over-year comparison for North America truck/trailer is properly looking at year-to-date order performance. Through 9 months, orders are up 27% year-over-year for North America truck/trailer. The transport refrigeration backlog remains up almost 10% year-over-year as the North America strength more than offset some order weakness within the Europe truck/trailer business and container. Commercial refrigerated orders were down over 20% organically as the European food retail customers are impacted by energy prices and inflation. And as we continue to focus on improving profitability of this business.\nFinally, demand for our Fire & Security products remained healthy. Orders were positive in each of the businesses, except for access solutions, which has been most impacted by supply chain challenges. Fire & Security products backlog is up almost 40% year-over-year with double-digit growth in all businesses except residential fire in the Americas. As you can see on both the left and right sides of the slide, we saw strong demand in many of our businesses; however, we have seen some weakness in a few areas such as in Europe, driven by Europe truck/trailer and commercial refrigeration. In addition, the weaker container orders impact Asia, excluding China, given that this business mainly books orders in Singapore. For reference, with the addition of TCC, China sales are about 9% of our total company business.\nNow moving on to guidance on Slide 12. Compared to our prior guidance, we are reducing our full year expected sales by about $400 million with most of the reduction due to currency translation, the balance due to slightly lower organic sales growth. Accordingly, we now expect full year revenues of about $20.4 billion versus the prior guide of $20.8 billion. We now expect adjusted operating margin of 14.2%, up 60 basis points compared to last year and up 20 basis points compared to our prior guide. This reflects improved Q3 margin performance. Currency translation is also a minor tailwind to margins compared to our July guidance.\nWe are increasing our full year adjusted EPS guidance range to the high end of our prior guidance or $2.30 to $2.35. This is primarily due to the strong performance in the third quarter including productivity that more than offsets the incremental earnings headwind from slightly lower volumes and currency translation. We continue to expect the TCC acquisition to have a neutral impact on adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS in 2022 with operating profit contribution to be mostly offset by the loss of equity income and integration expenses. However, as I mentioned earlier, the timing of the planned integration costs shifted from Q3 to Q4 causing a TCC adjusted EPS contribution in Q3, but a negative impact in Q4.\nLastly, on free cash flow. Last quarter, we said achieving our free cash flow target has become more challenging given continued supply chain headwinds. While we did see supply chain improvements in Q3, the improvements are coming later than expected, and so it will not be enough to reduce our inventories by year-end to get to $1.65 billion of free cash flow. In addition, and to a lesser extent, Free cash flow is negatively impacted as we acquired cash from the acquisition of TCC rather than receiving that cash through dividends from equity investments. As a result, we now expect to generate closer to $1.4 billion in free cash flow. This still includes approximately $200 million in tax payments related to the Chubb gain and a $100 million unfavorable impact from the expiration of the R&D tax credits.\nIn summary, another good -- another quarter of good performance enables us to increase our adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS guidance. The strength we see in parts of our portfolio are helping to balance weakness in other areas such as Europe and some consumer-related end markets. Supply chain improvements are coming later in the year than we expected and are leading to elevated inventory levels impacting free cash flow.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Dave for Slide 13.\n\nDavid L. Gitlin\n\nChairman & CEO, Carrier Global Corporation\n\nThanks, Patrick. We have delivered very solid performance year-to-date and remain confident in our ability to close out another strong year. Demand for our innovative products remains healthy, and I'm excited for the opportunities that we have in front of us.\nWith that, we'll open this up for questions."

This call is being carried live on the Internet, and there is a presentation available to download from Carrier's website at ir.carrier.com.\nI would like to now introduce your host for today's conference, Sam Pearlstein, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nSamuel Joel Pearlstein\n\nVP of IR, Carrier Global Corporation\n\nThank you, and good morning, and welcome to Carrier's second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. With me here today are David Gitlin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Goris, Chief Financial Officer.\nExcept as otherwise noted, the company will be speaking to results from operations, excluding restructuring costs and other significant items of a nonrecurring and/or nonoperational nature, often referred to by management as other significant items. The company reminds listeners that the sales, earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided during the call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Carrier's SEC filings, including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. (Operator Instructions)\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Dave Gitlin.\n\nDavid L. Gitlin\n\nChairman & CEO, Carrier Global Corporation\n\nThank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by saying how proud I am of the Carrier's team ability to deliver strong results amidst the current backdrop of inflation, continued supply chain challenges and COVID lockdowns overseas. Our team's hard work, fueled by our high-performance culture, resulted in another quarter of solid organic sales and adjusted operating profit growth, capping a strong first half and enabling us to raise our full year adjusted EPS guidance.\nLooking specifically at our Q2 results on Slide 2. We delivered 7% organic sales growth, expanded operating margins by 130 basis points and increased adjusted operating profit by 4% year-over-year despite the Chubb divestiture. Price/cost was positive in the quarter, and we now expect to be price/cost positive for the year. Our backlog is up 20% compared to last year. Aftermarket performed particularly well and was up double digits. Free cash flow improved meaningfully compared to last quarter but was the use of cash.\nTurning to Slide 3. The value creation framework that we outlined at our Investor Day has not changed, driving above-market organic growth, expanding margins, delivering strong free cash flow and disciplined capital allocation. We recognize that there are concerns about slowing economies. In such times, we do not need a new playbook. We doubled down on the playbook that we have. We are focused on controlling the controllables, and our track record demonstrates that we execute in the face of challenges. We are playing offense, investing in growth, particularly digitally enabled aftermarket solutions. We have effectively driven price and aggressively driven cost out of the system, and our strong balance sheet provides us with plenty of flexibility for value-added capital deployment, including investments that will benefit from the compelling multiyear secular trends of healthy and sustainable environment as you see on Slide 4.\nIndoor air quality is critical to our health, safety and cognitive performance. Studies show that improved ventilation and filtration reduce the spread of microscopic particulates, including COVID, by up to 80%. But IAQ does more than prevent the spread of airborne illnesses, 8% of children suffer from asthma and improved ventilation in schools reduces their symptoms. Students also performed better with improved indoor air quality, 60% of K-12 classrooms have inadequate ventilation today. Studies show that cognitive performance improves by 2x when optimizing CO2 and VOC levels.\nProper filtration systems are equally important and can prevent harmful outside air, whether from forest fires or pollution, from entering the classroom or the home. IAQ is no longer nice to have. It's critical to our health and safety and our ability to perform.\nWe are responding to the challenge. K-12 orders were up over 35% in the first half of the year. In Q2, we saw a 20% year-over-year increase in healthy building orders, and the pipeline remains at over $800 million. Some key wins include a new U.S. theme park featuring air handling units antimicrobial coating and UV light technology at an industrial manufacturing facility upgrade in China with air handling units and HEPA filtration.\nCarrier also won the opportunity to partner with a large school district in North Carolina to provide holistic HVAC solution for 3 new schools that were prioritized into air quality.\nCustomers not only want healthy air environments in their schools, office buildings and restaurants, but also in their homes. And our diversified portfolio offers unique solutions. For example, our Kidde business recently introduced a series of smart, healthy and connected products that includes the industry's first integrated smoke, carbon monoxide and indoor air quality detectors. We are also excited about our recent healthy homes partnership with Procter & Gamble. We will start by educating our respective consumers on the benefits of healthy homes with a vision towards joint marketing and promotion activities in the future.\nOn sustainability, the last 9 years rank among the 10 warmest years on record. Recently, we saw record temperatures in the U.K. and Germany where less than 5% of homes have air conditioning. Demand for AC is increasing in those countries, and we are poised to support this demand in a sustainable manner. Addressing increased demand for air conditioning with sustainable solutions is critical to help reduce emissions and fight climate change. Therefore, we remain committed to providing innovative energy-efficient solutions using low GWP refrigerants and coupling them with digital capabilities to optimize asset utilization and energy efficiency.\nA proof point of our progress on differentiated solutions is in our North American light commercial business, where our rooftop units will now feature our innovative EcoBlue Technology. This technology improves performance and efficiency while decreasing installation and maintenance costs through our exclusive patented beltless direct-drive vane axial fan system, an industry first for rooftop units. Our units equipped with EcoBlue are up to 40% more energy efficient compared to the industry's traditional belt drive fans in a similar footprint, a real game changer.\nIt's the same with heating, where various factors are driving an accelerated shift away from fossil fuels and toward heat pump solutions. This shift presents a significant opportunity, and we start from a position of strength. We have the market-leading position in European commercial heat pumps, and are the leading player in residential and light commercial heat pumps in North America with over 30% of our residential split today comprising heat pumps.\nWe are also investing in effective and efficient low-temperature heat pump solutions. We have successfully completed all of the requirements for the Department of Energy's residential cold climate heat pump challenge, where we validated a coefficient of performance higher than 2.1 at an ambient temperature of 5 degrees Fahrenheit, and we are now commercializing that solution for market introduction.\nIncluding the heat pump revenues of Toshiba Carrier, an acquisition that we expect to close in early August, we will have about $2 billion of annual heat pump revenues globally, and we are confident that the combination of Toshiba Carrier, Giwee and our Riello business in Italy will enable us to grow in the European residential heat pump market with compelling product offerings.\nWe see the same shift to electrification in our transport refrigeration business with demand for our all-electric vector equal units steadily increasing. Dawsongroup, along with many other transport companies, added Carrier Transicold Vector eCool units to their fleet to be more efficient and sustainable. We are expanding our market leadership position in this space.\nRegarding digitalization, we continue to enhance our Abound and Lynx platforms to further differentiate our life cycle solution offerings. Abound continues to gain traction in verticals ranging from commercial office and university buildings to data centers to national retailers, with our focus remaining on providing scale customers with the solutions that they desire.\nOur advanced Lynx digital platform aimed at significantly improving the cold chain through enhanced visibility and increased connectivity, received a silver ranking from the Edison Awards for excellence in supply chain innovation. Like Abound, we are adding new features to Lynx. Our recent Lynx fleet rollout incorporates customer feedback and provides key alerts and metrics around fuel and battery levels and asset run hours. These notifications shown in a summary dashboard helped to minimize unit downtime and low loss, ultimately reducing our customers' operational costs. We remain on track to have 100,000 Lynx subscriptions by the end of this year.\nAnother critical growth driver is higher margin aftermarket and recurring revenues, which you see on Slide 5. Aftermarket has been up double digits through the first half of the year, and we're on track for another year of double-digit growth. All of our 3 segments saw double-digit aftermarket growth in Q2. Commercial HVAC is now up to over 15,000 connected chillers, putting us ahead of schedule for 20,000 connected chillers this year. We also remain on track for 70,000 chillers under BluEdge LTAs by the end of this year.\nIn residential and light commercial, the team continues to see expanded adoption of the Breeze platform by new national account customers to increase aftermarket parts sales. So our aftermarket playbook is working.\nBefore I turn it over to Patrick, a bit more color on the Toshiba Carrier acquisition on Slide 6. TCC's technology positions us well to accelerate the VRF, international light commercial and heat pump opportunities. TCC's pioneering inverter technology, coupled with its rotary compressors, allow for dynamic and intelligent balancing of air-conditioning demand, thereby providing customers with greater energy efficiency, longer life and quieter system operation. We will deploy our multi-brand, multichannel strategy to further penetrate critical markets. And our complementary global footprints and supply chains give us confidence in achieving run rate synergies of $100 million.\nWe created a new business unit within the HVAC segment, Global Comfort Solutions, with a strong leadership team based in Tokyo. Global Comfort Solutions will include the TCC and Giwee acquisitions as well as our European Riello business and the light commercial business outside of North America. The team has been working on detailed execution plans, and collectively, we're ready to go.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Patrick. Patrick?\n\nPatrick P. Goris\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone.\nPlease turn to Slide 7. Reported sales of $5.2 billion were down as expected due to the Chubb divestiture. Currency translation was a higher-than-expected headwind of 3%. All segments grew organically in the quarter, resulting in 7% organic growth for the total company. The impact of the Shanghai lockdowns on Q2 sales was in line with our expectations, roughly $100 million. All segments realized significant price in the quarter more than offsetting higher-than-anticipated inflation.\nQ2 adjusted operating profit was up 4% compared to last year despite lower reported sales. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter includes the benefit of about $35 million or $0.03 of favorable onetime items. Our results included gains on the sale of 2 Toshiba Carrier joint ventures and 1 refrigeration joint venture. These transactions are consistent with our plans to simplify Carrier and reduce the number of minority owned joint ventures. Even excluding these onetime items, operating profit was stronger than expected, mainly as a result of productivity and better price/cost despite currency headwinds.\nQ2 adjusted operating margin was up 130 basis points compared to last year, whereas price/cost was positive in Q2, it was still dilutive to margins.\nAdjusted EPS of $0.69 was stronger than expected, mainly due to better-than-expected margins. For your reference, we have a year-over-year Q2 adjusted EPS bridge in the appendix on Slide 17.\nFree cash flow was the use of $34 million. We paid about $70 million of taxes on the gain related to the Chubb sale in Q2. In addition, stronger-than-expected sales in June, particularly the second half of June, led to higher receivables. Inventories were relatively flat sequentially. Supply chain challenges have not yet subsided and continue to affect our inventory levels.\nStarting with Slide 8, we will cover our segment's performance in more detail. HVAC organic sales were up 8%, driven by double-digit growth in residential and our ALC controls businesses. Q2 resi movement was flat. After the weak May, movement was up very strong in June. Residential HVAC growth was driven by price.\nOur light commercial business was down mid-single digits due to supply chain challenges and a tough comparison as Q2 of last year grew over 60%. Light commercial demand remains very strong.\nAs we expected, commercial HVAC saw modest low single-digit growth in the quarter due to the impact from the Shanghai lockdowns. Adjusted operating profit for the HVAC segment was up 5% compared to last year driven by strong productivity, favorable price/cost and the higher equity income from the TCC gains I mentioned earlier, which are reflected in equity income in this segment.\nOperating margin was down 70 bps compared to last year, mainly due to the impact of price/cost and lower volumes, which offset strong productivity and the margin impact of the onetime gains.\nWe expect the HVAC segment to remain price/cost positive for the full year. The consolidation of TCC will dilute margins of this segment by about 100 basis points this year as we will no longer record equity income related to TCC, but instead will consolidate its entire income statement and incur about $20 million in upfront integration costs. Our current expectation of HVAC's full year 2022 operating margin is, therefore, about 15%.\nMoving to refrigeration on Slide 9, organic sales were up 9% in the quarter, driven by high single-digit growth for both transport and commercial refrigeration. This is despite an almost 40% reduction in China refrigeration sales related to the lockdowns and related project delays. Within transport refrigeration, container was up low single digits on top of last year's almost 40%. North America and Europe truck trailer saw double-digit growth as some of the component shortages that held up deliveries in Q1 were resolved in Q2. Sensitech continues to deliver solid results as it grew low teens in the quarter.\nAdjusted operating margins were up 230 basis points compared to last year, mainly due to volume, productivity improvements and the small onetime gain on the sale of a joint venture. Commercial refrigeration margins were up almost 300 basis points sequentially. We are pleased with the progress this segment made in the quarter.\nMoving on to Fire & Security on Slide 10. Excluding Chubb's sales from the second quarter of 2021, Fire & Security segment sales were up 4%. Adjusted operating margins expanded 310 basis points in the quarter, mainly because of the Chubb divestiture and strong productivity. Price/cost was positive in this segment as well.\nSlide 11 provides more details on orders performance. Total company organic orders were flattish for the quarter. Backlog remains at very healthy levels throughout all segments. As we expected, Residential HVAC and transport refrigeration orders were down in the quarter as both businesses continue to proactively manage their order book. Backlog for both resi and North America truck trailer refrigeration continued to grow sequentially. Light commercial orders were up about 25% in the quarter, signaling continued strong demand in that business. Commercial HVAC also saw solid continued demand in the quarter, marking its sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit orders growth with growth across all regions and backlog of about 20% compared to last year.\nRefrigeration orders were down approximately 20% in the quarter. The segment's backlog remains up almost 10% year-over-year, with transport refrigeration backlog of mid-teens along with a slight decline in commercial refrigeration backlog as we are very much focused on profitability of that business.\nDemand for Fire & Security products remains healthy, up about 10% to 15%. As you can see on the right side, order activity was flattish in the Americas and down in EMEA. China orders were down in the quarter, primarily due to the Shanghai lockdowns, but the Asia region, excluding China, saw strong demand.\nBefore talking about guidance, I wanted to provide an update on capital deployment. In the quarter, we repurchased about $275 million worth of shares, consistent with our plan to complete the remaining authorization by the end of the year. Year-to-date, we've repurchased about $1 billion.\nWe borrowed approximately $400 million under yen denominated term loan earlier this week that will be used to partially fund the $900 million TCC acquisition. The balance will be funded by cash. Consistent what we shared with you in February, our full year debt reduction will be about $750 million. The divestitures I referred to earlier further simplify our portfolio and are expected to yield approximately $75 million in after-tax proceeds, which we expect to collect in the second half of the year. Our actions will continue to be consistent with the capital deployment priorities we laid out at our Investor Day, and our balance sheet provides plenty of flexibility for continued balanced value-add capital deployment.\nNow moving on to guidance on Slide 12. Performance in the first half of 2022 has been better than expected. In addition, our updated guidance now includes the impact of consolidating TCC into our financials. Last quarter, I mentioned that we expected price to exceed $1 billion for 2022. We now expect the year-over-year impact from price to be closer to $1.5 billion. The additional revenue from price will be mostly offset by the unfavorable impact of currency translation and slightly lower volume as a result of supply chain challenges. We expect the TCC acquisition to add about $800 million in revenues this year.\nWith that, we are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance range $0.05 to $2.25 to $2.35. This is primarily due to the strong performance year-to-date, lower net interest expense and a lower share count, offset by a headwind from foreign exchange. The earnings impact of higher price is largely offset by increased input costs.\nWe do not expect an adjusted EPS impact from TCC this year as operating profit contribution is expected to be mostly offset by the loss of equity income and integration costs. As we expected, excluding the equity income from these joint ventures and consolidating the income statement, we will reduce full year 2022 operating margin by about 30 to 40 basis points. In addition, because equity income is our share of after-tax income, consolidating TCC will increase our effective tax rate for the full year 2022 by about 25 to 50 basis points. Importantly, this does not change our actual tax expense or the dollars of income but only changes the tax rate calculation.\nWe continue to expect to generate approximately $1.65 billion in free cash flow this year. Achieving this target has become more challenging given continued supply chain headwinds, but the team is focused on better working capital performance in the second half.\nLastly, as we shared in the press release this morning, effective with the close of TCC, we will exclude the impact of intangible amortization related to M&A activity from Carriers' adjusted operating profit, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS. The nature of this acquisition requires us to step up the value of the 60% economic interest in the joint venture we already own, which would drive unusually high amortization. We believe this adjustment provides investors better information to evaluate our operating performance.\nWe estimate the full year 2022 adjusted earnings will now exclude about $20 million or $0.02 of intangible amortization related to acquisitions compared to our prior guidance. For your benefit, we included a guide-to-guide adjusted EPS bridge on Slide 18. So overall, another good quarter and an improved outlook for 2022.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to you, Dave.\n\nDavid L. Gitlin\n\nChairman & CEO, Carrier Global Corporation\n\nWell, thanks, Patrick. We are pleased with our performance through the first half of the year. Our backlog instills confidence in our outlook for the second half, and I am confident in our team's ability to keep driving strong results.\nWith that, we'll open this up for questions."

This call is being carried live on the Internet, and there is a presentation available to download on Carrier's website at ir.carrier.com.\nI would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Sam Pearlstein, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nSamuel Joel Pearlstein\n\nVP of IR, Carrier Global Corporation\n\nThank you, and good morning, and welcome to Carrier's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. With me here today are David Gitlin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Goris, Chief Financial Officer. Except as otherwise noted, the company will be speaking to results from operations, excluding restructuring costs and other significant items of a non-recurring and/or non-operational nature often referred to by management as other significant items.\nThe company reminds listeners that the sales, earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided during the call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Carrier's SEC filings, including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. We will leave time for questions at the end. (Operator Instructions)\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Dave Gitlin.\n\nDavid L. Gitlin\n\nChairman & CEO, Carrier Global Corporation\n\nThank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a summary of our Q1 results on Slide 2 (sic) [Slide 3]. Q1 was another strong quarter for us, and I am proud of how our team continues to execute in the face of global challenges. We delivered 12% sales growth, excluding the impact of Chubb. Organic orders growth remained strong at 10% and our backlog is up almost 30% organically versus last year.\nAdjusted operating profit was up 7% compared to last year and up high teens, excluding the impact of Chubb. Price/cost was neutral in the quarter better than expected. Free cash flow was a larger-than-expected outflow in the quarter, mainly due to supply chain shortages impacting inventory levels. We continue to expect to generate $1.65 billion of free cash flow this year.\nWe remain focused on the priorities that you see on Slide 3 (sic) [Slide 4], above-market organic growth, margin expansion, strong free cash flow and disciplined capital allocation. This slide summarizes our value creation framework as presented at our recent Investor Day, which not only forms the basis for our updates to our investors but also drives our priorities via our internal goal alignment process. I recently spent a week in Europe and a week in Asia and saw firsthand how our people globally are driving results tied to these priorities.\nFrom our world-class operations in our Singapore container factory to the tremendous innovation from our colleagues in Hyderabad and New Delhi, to the discipline and energy in our sites throughout Poland, it was encouraging to see the power of focus, culture and talented empowered teams coming together to provide solutions for our customers.\nI'll address our progress on the key elements of this value creation framework starting with growth on Slide 4 (sic) [Slide 5]. We continue to lean into the opportunities provided by the secular trends presented at our Investor Day that we are confident will drive above-market growth despite macro uncertainty and supply chain challenges. On healthy indoor environments, we saw $125 million worth of orders in Q1, and our healthy buildings pipeline is now $850 million, up more than 20% sequentially from the fourth quarter. We continue to play offense on ESG and sustainability.\nThe combination of the upcoming Toshiba acquisition and our newly announced European heat pump design center of excellence position us favorably to enter the attractive European residential heat pump market. This will complement our leadership in global commercial heat pumps. As an example, our low GWP heat pump chiller orders in Europe were up over 30% in the first quarter.\nElectrification is equally critical in transport refrigeration, where we recently added Woolworths, Australia's largest supermarket chain. We now have more than 10 countries where our Vector eCool all-electric [reefer] units are in service.\nIn terms of digitalization, our key focus remains on rapid adoption of our Abound and Lynx platforms. We've incorporated energy monitoring and alert reporting capabilities into our Abound platform and achieved key wins across verticals, including education, retail and industrial. There are now over 750 million square feet monitored by Abound. This includes an important recent win with Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\nOur digital capabilities are receiving more widespread recognition. For example, within the Abound platform, our CORTIX solution recently won several key awards, including the 2022 Artificial Intelligence Excellence Award organized by the Business Intelligence Group; and the AI Breakthrough Award's 2021 Best Predictive Analytics platform. CORTIX offers predictive insights and autonomous actions to optimize equipment performance and building operations, and is currently connected to over 300,000 pieces of building equipment from multiple OEMs. This is a good example of how our digital platforms deliver customer value across a diverse installed base.\nWe have also expanded our Lynx capabilities, including asset tracking, prognostics and temperature alarms, and we remain on track to have 100,000 Lynx subscriptions by the end of this year. We remain confident that the increasing middle class will continue to drive demand for our products in countries such as India, where income levels are increasing and penetration levels of our portfolio of solutions remain low.\nIn addition to the tailwinds from these secular trends, we continued to accelerate growth in our core businesses through innovation and differentiation, which you can see on Slide 5 (sic) [Slide 6]. After releasing 21 new products in Q1, we remain on track for more than 125 new product introductions in 2022. Our innovation pipeline is centered around our core strategy of healthy, safe, sustainable and intelligent building and cold chain solutions.\nOne example is that we recently introduced a smoke and carbon monoxide detector with embedded indoor air quality sensors with all the data connectable to smart home ecosystems. Our R&D efforts on disruptive technologies are progressing well. One example is our traction on the Department of Energy's challenge to improve the efficacy of heat pumps at cold ambient temperatures. Our unit is currently under test at the Oak Ridge National Labs. We have demonstrated the expected performance with a better-than-required coefficient of performance at ambient temperatures of 5 degrees Fahrenheit using our forthcoming low GWP refrigerant. We are working to commercialize our solution to increase adoption of heat pumps over oil and gas fuel heating systems in colder regions.\nI am pleased to announce that we have a new Chief Technology Officer. (inaudible) recently led Honeywell Aerospace's 10,000 engineers and previously held critical roles at BorgWarner and Bosch. His experience driving customer solutions across a broad range of cutting-edge technologies at the intersection of hardware and digital position him perfectly to help take our innovation efforts to the next level.\nAnother critical growth driver for us is aftermarket and recurring revenues, which you see on Slide 6 (sic) [Slide 7]. After 11% growth in 2021, aftermarket sales were up high single digits in Q1. Across Carrier and within each segment, we have detailed KPIs across the vectors that you see here: parts capture; service coverage; digital solutions; and healthy and sustainable offerings. We remain committed to delivering on our full year KPIs, including having 70,000 chillers under long-term agreements and 20,000 connected chillers by year-end. So our growth drivers remain encouraging.\nTurning to margin expansion on Slide 7 (sic) [Slide 8]. At our Investor Day, we committed to over 50 basis points of margin expansion per year with 2022 projected to be closer to 75 basis points, and we exceeded that in the first quarter, growing adjusted operating margins by 110 basis points. We remain on track to deliver the $300 million of gross productivity savings that we committed to for 2022. Related to that productivity improvement, we are very purposeful about building a more resilient supply chain and we are tracking to our commitments around dual sourcing of critical components and increasing factory automation.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Patrick. Patrick?\n\nPatrick P. Goris\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8 (sic) [Slide 9]. As expected, reported sales were down due to the Chubb divestiture. Organic sales growth was better than our high single-digit Q1 guidance, with all segments growing organically. Residential and light commercial HVAC growth was stronger than expected, with resi up over 20% and light commercial up over 30% compared to last year. Both price and inflation were higher than we anticipated and price/cost was neutral.\nProductivity and higher JV income also contributed to strong adjusted operating profit, which was up 7% compared to last year despite lower reported sales. Core earnings conversion, excluding the impact of price/cost, was well over 50%. Adjusted EPS of $0.54 was also better than the guidance we provided in February given stronger sales, margins and a lower share count. For your reference, we added an adjusted EPS bridge in the appendix on Slide 19 (sic) [Slide 18].\nFree cash flow was a use of $258 million, [versus] than the use of $100 million we guided to on our Q4 earnings call. The primary driver was an increase in inventory. We continue to operate with higher safety stock and missing components are delaying shipments. We still expect to generate $1.65 billion in free cash flow for the full year, but this will be more back-end loaded as we expect supply chain conditions to improve in the second half.\nLet's turn to Slide 9 (sic) [Slide 10] and cover our segments performance. HVAC organic sales were up 18% driven by continued very strong growth in residential, light commercial and our ALC/Controls businesses. Resi movement and field inventories for splits and furnaces were both up low single digits. Light commercial distributor movement was up double digits in the quarter with field inventories up modestly versus prior year.\nWithin Commercial HVAC, Applied and Controls grew double digits. Adjusted operating margins were up 120 basis points compared to last year, mainly due to volume leverage and mix. Price/cost was slightly positive for this segment as better-than-expected price realization more than offset higher material and freight costs. We expect this segment to remain price/cost positive this year.\nMoving to Refrigeration on Slide 10 (sic) [Slide 11]. Organic sales were up 1% in the quarter, a bit lower than expected due to supply chain challenges mostly affecting truck and trailer. As expected, container was down mid-teens compared to a record quarter last year.\nTruck and trailer was up mid-single digits. Commercial refrigeration was up mid-single digits, driven by solid growth in EMEA, and Sensitech continues to do well and was up double digits. Adjusted operating margins were down 130 basis points compared to last year, mainly due to lower volume and price cost. Price realization is improving in this segment and is expected to be neutral in Q2.\nMoving on to Fire & Security on Slide 11 (sic) [Slide 12]. Excluding Chubb sales from the first quarter of 2021, Fire & Security segment sales were up 8% with strong broad-based growth this year. Adjusted operating margins expanded 160 basis points in the quarter, mainly as a result of the Chubb divestiture. Price/cost was neutral in this segment, better than expected.\nSlide 12 (sic) [Slide 13] provides more details on orders performance. Total company organic orders were up about 10%. As expected, Residential HVAC orders were down modestly in the quarter, with Light commercial orders about double last year's levels. Commercial HVAC orders also remained very strong, with backlogs for this business up over 30% compared to last year. Refrigeration orders were flat in the quarter. Transport orders were down modestly as we continue to actively manage our Q4 order book for the truck and trailer business. The backlog remains up about 30% in both transport and commercial refrigeration compared to last year.\nOrder intake for our Fire & Security products remain very healthy, up about 20%. Growth was widespread throughout the portfolio. As you can see on the right side, we saw continued strong orders growth in all areas of the world. Order strength continued in all regions in April, with the exception of China, which was down year-over-year.\nMoving to an update on capital deployment on Slide 13 (sic) [Slide 14]. We had quite some activity in Q1. We collected $2.9 billion from the Chubb sale, repurchased about $740 million worth of shares and paid down $1.15 billion worth of debt. In addition, we announced the acquisition of our JV with Toshiba for about $900 million. We continue to expect this acquisition to close by the end of Q3. Integration planning for the acquisition is progressing.\nOur actions continue to strengthen our credit metrics and provide plenty of flexibility for value-add capital deployment. We continue to target $1.6 billion of share repurchases for 2022 and expect to issue $400 million of yen-denominated debt prior to the TCC acquisition. Total debt reduction for 2022 remains $750 million, consistent with what we shared with you in February at our Investor Day.\nNow moving on to guidance on Slide 14 (sic) [Slide 15]. We had a good and better-than-expected start to 2022. But with just 1 quarter behind us, we are maintaining our guidance for organic sales growth, adjusted operating margin, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. From a calendarization perspective, we expect the lockdowns in Shanghai to impact Q2's sales by about $100 million, mainly in commercial HVAC and truck and trailer as both businesses have a manufacturing footprint in that area. This assumes businesses open up in the next few weeks, and we currently do not expect this to impact our full year.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Dave to Slide 15 (sic) [Slide 16].\n\nDavid L. Gitlin\n\nChairman & CEO, Carrier Global Corporation\n\nThanks, Patrick. We are pleased with a strong start to the year. Our backlog gives us confidence about continued strong growth, and the team continues to overcome unexpected macro challenges to deliver results for our customers and our investors.\nWith that, we'll open this up for questions."

We have time for questions at the end. (Operator Instructions)\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Dave Gitlin.\n\nDavid L. Gitlin\n\nCEO & Chairman, Carrier Global Corporation\n\nThank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. Before we get into our 4Q results, let me start on Slide 2.\nOn Sunday, we announced that we reached a definitive agreement to acquire Toshiba's controlling stake in Toshiba Carrier Corporation, our long-standing HVAC joint venture. This is an important and compelling deal for us that we believe will create significant value for our customers, employees and shareowners by enhancing our position in the fast-growing variable refrigerant flow and international light commercial markets.\nWe established our minority JV with Toshiba in 1999. Carrier has had distribution responsibility with Toshiba, having design and production responsibility. Together, we have successfully grown TCC to be a world leader with over $2 billion in sales. This acquisition will enable us to accelerate growth and profitability in this business by consolidating design, production and distribution under 1 roof, realizing synergies and leveraging our global scale to deliver even more differentiated products and solutions to customers globally.\nBefore we talk more about the strategy behind this deal, let me have Patrick quickly discuss the financials. Patrick?\n\nPatrick P. Goris\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave, and good morning. Under the terms of the agreement, we will acquire substantially all of Toshiba's interest in TCC for about $900 million. As you can see on the slide, Toshiba owns about 60% of TCC.\nTaking into account direct and indirect ownership structures of TCC subsidiaries, Toshiba's economic interest in TCC has fluctuated between 30% and 50% over time. Toshiba is retaining a 5% interest in TCC or less than a 5% economic interest. TCC generated 2021 calendar year sales of about $2.1 billion and approximately $250 million of EBITDA. We have been recording equity income associated with the TCC joint venture and have collected dividend payments as well. After the transaction closes, we will, of course, no longer record equity income, but instead fully consolidate TCC's financial statements.\nAdjusting for intercompany sales and for the equity income that we recognize today, we expect to add about $2 billion to consolidated sales, EBITDA of about $160 million and operating profit of approximately $90 million before purchase price adjustments, such as intangible amortization. The $90 million operating profit is a reasonable proxy for the economic EBITDA we are acquiring.\nExpected cost synergies of about $100 million will help us increase TCC's EBITDA margins. This acquisition is aligned with themes you have consistently heard from us, profitable growth, simplification, focus and improved free cash flow.\nLet me turn it back to Dave to Slide 3 and the strategic rationale behind the transaction.\n\nDavid L. Gitlin\n\nCEO & Chairman, Carrier Global Corporation\n\nThanks, Patrick. First and foremost, we have been consistent in communicating our determination to become a more significant player in the fast-growing VRF market.\nIn 2015, the global VRF market was about half the size of the applied market. Since then, VRF has grown at more than 2x the rate of the applied market, and we project VRF to continue to outpace supply growth going forward. VRF's growth is no surprise. It is highly efficient, electric, sustainable modular, has lower installation costs and enables individual zone controls and segregated billing. With the acquisition of TCC, last year's Giwee acquisition and our own VRF organic growth, our consolidated VRF sales will have increased 4x on an annualized basis since our spin less than 2 years ago.\nSecond, as you would expect from Toshiba, TCC has highly differentiated technology made possible by its impressive 750 engineers. Its proprietary inverter technology and its award-winning 3-stage rotary compressor technology provide world-class efficiency levels.\nThird, the Toshiba brand is deeply admired globally, and we have signed a long-term product license to the Toshiba name, which will align well with our multi-brand, multichannel strategy.\nAnd finally, TCC has an excellent complementary global manufacturing footprint with new facilities in China and Poland and impressive factories in India, Thailand and Japan. We are very excited about this deal and expect it to close by the end of Q3.\nNow turning to Q4 results on Slide 4. Q4 was another strong quarter, wrapping up our first full year as an independent public company. Organic sales in the quarter were up 11%, driven by continued strength in residential and light commercial HVAC and transport refrigeration. Operating profits and free cash flow came in as expected. Order strength continued and led to record backlogs, positioning us well for 2022. We also saw continued aftermarket growth, which has been a major focus area for us. And the team continues to establish a more resilient supply chain for the future.\nProgress in 2021 was very important as we target increased dual sourcing of critical components, increased automation and new direct relationships with chip manufacturers on security of supply. We have been balancing rising input costs with price increases to reach our goal of being at least price cost neutral in 2022, and our operations team has gone to tremendous lengths to support our customers. I thank all of them for their outstanding efforts. I am proud that the team finished the year well, capping a full year of strong financial performance during which we exceeded all of our expectations, as you can see on Slide 5.\nWe came into 2021 projecting organic sales to be up about 5%, and we ended up with organic sales up 15%. Adjusted operating margins grew 80 bps over 2020, despite the supply chain and inflationary challenges. And we invested an incremental $150 million to support continued growth. Adjusted EPS increased 36% year-over-year, well above our initial expectations. Finally, free cash flow of $1.9 billion converted at 114% of net income.\nIn addition to our strong financial results, we successfully executed on our strategic focus areas, as you can see on Slide 6. ESG and sustainability remain paramount for us and we made great progress last year towards reducing NetScope 1 and 2 emissions on our way to carbon neutrality in our operations by 2030.\nWe also progressed on our Scope 3 goal of reducing our customers' carbon emissions by more than 1 gigaton by 2030 by introducing a greater number of electric and heat pump technologies, lower GWP refrigerant offerings and more energy-efficient solutions for our customers.\nOn healthy buildings, we booked about 500 million in orders last year, and the pipeline has grown to about 700 million, more than triple what it was at the end of 2020. We continue to see strong traction and momentum in verticals like K-12, where orders were up high teens in 2021 and the year-end pipeline is up double digits sequentially from Q3, further validating the high demand for indoor air quality solutions that help rebuild confidence as society reenter schools, office buildings, stores, hotels and restaurants.\nProviding customers with data on air quality is one way to build that confidence, and our digital and intelligent capabilities are critical differentiators. We made strong progress on our 2 platforms of focus: Abound and Lynx.\nOn Abound, we saw adoption by customers in the sports, education and health care sectors. And on Lynx, we continued to expand our offerings with Lynx fleet and subscription activations in EMEA truck/trailer and container globally, adding more than 15,000 units in Q4 alone. We are very focused on delivering life cycle solutions and exceeded our stretch aftermarket targets.\nWe saw a double-digit aftermarket sales growth, ending the year with more than 60,000 chillers under long-term agreements. And we plan to add another 10,000 this year. We continue to take a very structured and balanced approach to capital deployment.\nWith the net proceeds from the Chubb divestiture on January 3, we have reduced our net debt from over $9 billion at spin to about $4 billion. We completed 4 exciting acquisitions, and we continue to build out our pipeline. We increased our annual dividend by 25% in December, and we continue to repurchase our shares.\nWe also drove gross cost savings through our Carrier 700 initiatives to help reduce the impact of inflationary headwinds. The entire organization remains focused on driving out discretionary costs as controlling the controllables is even more paramount in this inflationary environment.\nSlide 7 describes our overall view on 2022. Given our strong backlog, an overall constructive economic environment and our strategic positioning, we see another strong year of financial performance with organic sales up high single digits on top of the 15% that we generated in 2021. We expect continued margin expansion, despite dilution from price costs and acquisitions. We anticipate approximately $1 billion of inflationary headwinds in 2022 and are, therefore, targeting at least $1 billion or 5% of price realization this year, over 80% of which is carryover from actions taken last year and price increases that became effective in January of this year.\nExcluding Chubb from last year's results, we expect another year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth and strong free cash flow. Our focus areas heading into '22 remain the same. We will continue to drive innovation and differentiation in our pursuit to be the world leader in healthy, safe, sustainable and intelligent building and cold chain solutions. We will continue to take concrete actions to increase our already top quartile ESG performance and use sustainability solutions to drive recurring revenues and growth.\nWe are targeting another year of double-digit aftermarket growth, while not losing our progress on tenacious cost reduction. Our commitment to disciplined capital allocation remains unchanged with our strong balance sheet, enabling us to play more offense going forward.\nBefore I turn it over to Patrick, I wanted to provide an update on our upcoming Investor Day. On February 22, members of our leadership team will provide a deeper dive into our attractive growing markets and how we plan to continue to outperform in those markets.\nWith that, Patrick?\n\nPatrick P. Goris\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave. Please turn to Slide 8. Q4 benefited from solid organic growth throughout the segments. Residential and light commercial HVAC and transport refrigeration were important growth drivers in Q4, with organic sales growth well into the double digits.\nWe realized more price than expected in the quarter, but that was more than offset by continued and increased inflationary challenges. Similar to Q3, supply chain constraints impacted our factory efficiency levels and our ability to ship product, but it has left backlogs well positioned to deliver growth in 2022.\nAdjusted operating profit grew 14% year-over-year and margins were up 20 bps over last year. Increased year-over-year investments offset the absence of onetime cost items we incurred in Q4 of '20. Price cost finished about $30 million negative for the quarter versus our October estimate of about neutral. Q4 adjusted EPS of $0.44 benefited from $0.06 of discrete tax items.\nAs expected, free cash flow was $775 million in Q4 and $1.9 billion for 2021. We repurchased 4.7 million shares in the fourth quarter and about 10.4 million shares for the year, in line with what we shared with you in October.\nLet's turn to Slide 9 and cover our segment's performance. HVAC organic sales were up 14%, driven by continued very strong growth in residential, light commercial and our ALC controls business. Resi sales were up high teens and movement was up 6%. Residential and light commercial demand remains very encouraging as orders continue to grow, leading to very strong backlogs as we enter 2022.\nDistributor movement was up 15% in our light commercial business, leading to field inventories for that business being down low single digits compared to last year. Commercial HVAC was up mid-single digits in the quarter and was impacted by supply chain challenges, particularly in North America. Our aftermarket business grew mid-single digits for the quarter and was up double digits for the year. We met our goal of achieving at least 60,000 chillers in our service contracts by the end of 2021.\nPrice/cost was slightly positive in this segment, but a headwind to margin. Acquisitions increased sales by about $90 million for HVAC, but did not contribute operating profit given intangible, amortization and integration costs.\nMoving to Refrigeration on Slide 10. Organic sales were up 17% as a result of widespread growth throughout the segment. Truck/trailer was up almost 30% and container was up over 30%. Electrification capabilities are an important differentiator for us in this segment as we lead the industry with electric trailer units currently operating in 10 countries and additional capabilities being launched.\nCommercial refrigeration was up low single digits, driven by solid growth in Asia, offset by flattish EMEA sales. Sensitech and aftermarket were both up double digits. Margins were down 10 bps in the quarter compared to last year. Price realization is improving in this segment, but is not yet offsetting increased input costs. In addition, operating performance in commercial refrigeration remains a significant opportunity.\nMoving to Fire & Security on Slide 11. Organic sales were up 3%, as products grew 6%, while Chubb was down 3%. Operating margins expanded by about 60 bps in the quarter. Same as for Refrigeration, price realization is improving, but price/cost was negative. Mix was a tailwind to margin for this segment as was the absence of onetime items in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nSlide 12 provides more details on orders performance. Excluding Chubb, company organic orders were up about 20% for the quarter. As I mentioned, residential and light commercial orders remained very strong in the quarter even against difficult comps. Commercial HVAC orders remained strong as well, with backlogs for this business up over 30% compared to last year.\nRefrigeration saw a mid-single-digit decline in orders for the quarter, mostly because we worked with customers to support demand, but did not reopen the second half 2022 outlook until January of this year. In other words, timing. And we've already noticed a sequential pickup in orders in January.\nBacklog remains up about 30% in both transport and commercial refrigeration compared to last year. Order intake for our Fire & Security products remained very healthy at over 10%. Growth was led by commercial fire, industrial fire and access solutions.\nAs you can see on the right side, we saw continued strength in all regions except China. COVID-related measures implemented in China impacted order intake in late Q4. That seems to have improved since the start of the year. We've seen some delayed projects booked and commercial HVAC in China saw double-digit order growth in January.\nMoving on to Slide 13. We saw a $0.13 increase year-over-year in adjusted EPS. Within operational performance, the benefit from higher volume and the absence of 2020 onetime items was partially offset by investments. Price/cost was a $0.02 headwind compared to last year. The effective tax rate was a $0.07 year-over-year benefit and mostly relates to discrete tax items.\nFinally, we saw a slight pickup from lower interest that gave us an extra $0.01 compared to last year. For your reference, we included a full year 2021 adjusted EPS bridge in the appendix.\nMoving on to 2022 guidance on Slide 14. Note that our guidance excludes the impact of the pending TCC acquisition. We expect reported sales of about $20 billion in organic sales up high single digits on top of the 15% organic growth we generated in 2021. We expect price to contribute about 5 points of the organic growth and volume 2 to 3 points. Acquisitions are expected to add about $200 million in sales, with minimal operating profit given intangible amortization and integration costs.\nAdjusted operating profit is expected to be up compared to 2021 on about $600 million of lower reported sales. Operating margin is expected to expand by about 75 bps, helped by the sale of Chubb and despite $1 billion in price realization, offset by $1 billion of increased inflation. We expect all businesses within HVAC to have about high single digits organic growth in 2022. We expect mid- to high single-digit growth in both Refrigeration and Fire & Security. You can see expected adjusted operating margins for each segment on the bottom right.\nFor Fire & Security, this significant margin expansion reflects the higher-margin product business now that Chubb has been sold. I will cover adjusted EPS on the next slide, but just want to point out that our free cash flow guidance includes about $200 million in tax payments for the gain on the sale of Chubb and also assumes about $100 million of cash restructuring payments. Also, on Slide 21, you will find additional information about 2022 guidance.\nLet's move to Slide 15, 2022, adjusted EPS bridge at our guidance midpoint. As we've mentioned before, the Chubb sale is a $0.24 headwind to adjusted EPS next year. Operational performance is expected to deliver $0.24 of adjusted EPS growth next year. That is about $250 million of adjusted operating profits.\nAt a high level, think of about $120 million or so of volume leverage and about $300 million of productivity, partially offset by about $100 million each for investments and merit increases. As I mentioned earlier, price costs are expected to offset. Obviously, at about $300 million, productivity will be a major driver of earnings in 2022 and includes about $100 million of G&A reductions.\nInvestments in 2022 will be focused on enhancing our digital capabilities, R&D, and technologies enabling continued G&A cost reductions. Currency and net interest expense are a small headwind and tailwinds, respectively, and the benefit of share repurchases offset a higher expected adjusted effective tax rate of about 22%. That gets us to our midpoint of about $2.25 for next year.\nWe've talked a lot about Carrier 700 in our cost reduction mindset this year, so we wanted to provide more insight on that on Slide 16. The Carrier 700 program was created over 2 years ago, in a low inflation environment, which obviously does not apply today. Excluding the significant material inflation challenges we faced in 2021, we actually made great progress on Carrier 700 initiative by driving approximately $300 million of gross productivity savings.\nSince we historically included material inflation in our Carrier 700 numbers, our net savings were about neutral for the year.\nMoving forward and starting in 2022, we will measure our gross productivity efforts, excluding the impact of inflation. We plan to manage price to offset inflation. As I mentioned, we expect to drive about $300 million of cost reductions in 2022. We will provide further detail on our long-term opportunity for continued productivity at our upcoming Investor Day, but the bottom line is that cost takeout remains a key focus area at Carrier and will continue to fund investments annual merit and drive margin expansion.\nMoving on to Slide 17. Our priorities for capital deployment remained the same. As you can see on the right side of the slide, we have already committed to $3.75 billion of capital deployment for 2022 and will remain disciplined in capital allocation to maximize long-term shareowner value.\nThe last topic I wanted to quickly touch on is the outlook for Q1 of 2022. We expect to see organic sales growth in each of the 3 segments, leading to high single-digit organic growth for the company. We expect price/cost to be modestly negative in Q1 at a level similar to Q4, with an adjusted effective tax rate of about 15% based on known discrete tax items benefiting Q1. And we expect adjusted EPS to be approximately $0.45.\nFree cash flow is expected to be a use of cash in Q1 of about $100 million. Q1 is typically light and includes tax payments related to the Chubb sale and timing of the incentive compensation payout.\nIn closing, Q4 wrapped up another strong year for Carrier with double-digit organic growth and 36% adjusted EPS growth.\nThank you to all of our colleagues and partners, managing and supporting strong demand in a very challenging supply chain environment.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to you, Dave, Slide 18.\n\nDavid L. Gitlin\n\nCEO & Chairman, Carrier Global Corporation\n\nThanks, Patrick. So we are very pleased with our 2021 performance, but it is time to look forward. And as we do so, we are very bullish on the strategic and financial opportunities that lie ahead.\nWith that, we'll open this up for questions."

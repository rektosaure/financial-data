Welcome to the TJX Companies Q3 fiscal 2026 financial results conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.\nAt that time, if you have a question, you will need to press star one. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, 19 November 2025. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ernie Herrman, Chief Executive Officer and President of TJX Companies. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nThanks, Courtney. Before we begin, Deb has some opening comments.\n\nDebra McConnell\n\nGlobal SVP of Communications, TJX Companies\n\nThank you, Ernie, and good morning. Today's call is being recorded and includes forward-looking statements about our results and plans. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to vary materially from these statements, including, among others, the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review our press release for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements, as well as the full safe harbor statements included in the investor section of our website, TJX.com.\nWe have also detailed the impact of foreign exchange on our consolidated results and our international divisions in today's press release and in the investor section of TJX.com, along with reconciliations to non-GAAP measures we discussed. Thank you, and now I'll turn it back over to Ernie.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nGood morning. Joining me and Deb on the call is John. I'd like to start by thanking our global associates for working together to deliver our shoppers an exciting assortment of merchandise at excellent values every day. I truly appreciate their continued hard work and dedication to TJX. Moving to our Q3 performance, I am extremely pleased that comp sales, profitability, and earnings per share were all well above our plan.\nOur overall comp sales increase of 5% was driven by strong comp sales growth across each of our divisions. Clearly, our value proposition continued to resonate with consumers in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia, and we are confident that we gained market share across each of these geographies. With our above-planned results in the Q3, we are raising our full-year guidance for sales and profitability.\nJohn will detail our results and guidance in a few minutes. As to the Q4, we are off to a strong start, and as always, we'll strive to beat our plans. I am very excited about the initiatives we have underway for the holiday season, and we are convinced that we will keep attracting shoppers to our retail banners. Availability of quality branded merchandise has been exceptional, and we are in an excellent position to flow a fresh assortment of goods to our stores and online.\nWe feel great about the strength of our business, and are confident that our flexibility, wide customer demographic, and focus on value will continue to be a tremendous advantage. I'll talk more about our Q4 opportunities in a moment, but first, I'll turn the call over to John to cover our Q3 results in more detail.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nCFO, TJX Companies\n\nThanks, Ernie. I also want to add my gratitude to all of our associates for their continued hard work and commitment to TJX. Now I'll share some additional details on the Q3. As Ernie mentioned, our consolidated comp sales growth of 5% came in well above our plan. This was driven by a combination of a higher average basket and an increase in customer transactions.\nFurther, we saw strong comp increases in both our apparel and home categories. Q3 pre-tax profit margin of 12.7% was up 40 basis points versus last year, and well above our plan. Gross margin increased 100 basis points versus last year. This was due to an increase in merchandise margin, primarily driven by lower freight costs, expense efficiencies, and expense leverage on sales.\nImportantly, we are very pleased with our mitigation strategies, which allowed us to offset all the tariff pressure we saw in the Q3. SG&A increased 60 basis points versus last year. This was due to incremental store wage and payroll costs, a contribution to the TJX Foundation, and higher incentive compensation accruals. Net interest income negatively impacted pre-tax profit margin by 10 basis points versus last year.\nQ3 diluted earnings per share of $1.28 increased 12% versus last year, and was also well above our expectations. Lastly, we are extremely pleased with our Q3 pre-tax profit margin, it came in 60 basis points above the high end of our plan. In the Q3, merchandise margin was stronger than we expected, driven by lower freight costs, and we saw a benefit from expense leverage on the above-plan sales.\nFurther, with our above-plan results, we had higher incentive compensation accruals, and made a contribution to the TJX Foundation. Now to the Q3 divisional performance. At Marmaxx, comp sales grew by an outstanding 6%, with strong increases in both our apparel and home businesses. It was also great to see strength in our store performance across all regions and income demographics, which speaks to the broad-based appeal of our values.\nThe comp increase was driven by a higher average basket and growth in customer transactions. Marmaxx's segment profit margin was 14.9%, up 60 basis points versus last year. We were also pleased with the results at our Sierra stores and US e-commerce businesses, which we report as part of this division. We are extremely pleased with Marmaxx's momentum, and continue to see terrific opportunities for our largest division to grow its footprint and capture additional market share.\nAt HomeGoods, we continue to see very strong sales momentum, with comp sales up 5%. Segment profit margin improved to 13.5%, up 120 basis points versus last year. With our highly differentiated mix of home fashions from around the world at our HomeGoods and Homesense banners, we are confident that consumers will continue to be drawn to our stores. Further, we see a significant opportunity to further grow our store base and attract more customers, which we believe will allow us to capture a bigger piece of the US home market. TJX Canada's comp sales increased an outstanding 8%.\nSegment profit margin on a constant currency basis was 14.9%, down 20 basis points versus last year, which was driven by unfavorable transactional foreign exchange. As the leading off-price retailer in Canada, our Winners, Homesense, and Marshalls banners have excellent brand awareness and strong customer loyalty. We believe our position as a top value retailer in Canada sets us up very well to continue our growth in this country for many years to come.\nAt TJX International, comp sales grew 3%, with increases in both Europe and Australia. Segment profit margin on a constant currency basis increased to 9.2%, up a very strong 190 basis points versus last year. We are convinced that we will continue to gain market share across both Europe and Australia.\nLooking ahead, we're excited about our growth plans in our existing countries, and our planned entry into Spain in the spring of 2026. Moving to inventory, balance sheet inventory was up 12%, and inventory on a per-store basis was up 8% versus last year, as we've been buying into the excellent opportunities for quality branded merchandise we've been seeing in the marketplace.\nAvailability of quality merchandise has been terrific, and we are strongly positioned to flow fresh assortments to our stores and online this holiday season. As to capital allocation, we continue to reinvest in the growth of the business while returning $1.1 billion to shareholders through our buyback and dividend programs in the Q3. Now I'll turn it back to Ernie.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nThank you, John. Now I'd like to highlight some of the opportunities that we see to drive sales and transactions in the Q4. First, I'm convinced that our retail banners will be a shopping destination for value-conscious shoppers this holiday season. As always, we believe consumers will see compelling values throughout the store every time they visit us.\nWe see this as a major differentiator, as our customers can shop our excellent values every day and not have to wait for sales or promotional days like they do for many other retailers. Second, we believe we are strongly positioned to be a top destination for gifts. With the excellent availability of merchandise we have been seeing, we are confident that we will have a very exciting assortment of gifts this holiday season.\nImportantly, we plan to have gifting options across good, better, and best brands so our shoppers can find something for everyone on their list at prices that fit their budget. Additionally, after the holidays, we will remain focused on being a gifting destination year-round. Next, we will be flowing fresh selections to our stores and online multiple times a week throughout the holiday season. We believe this differentiates us from many other major retailers, as our ever-changing mix of merchandise allows shoppers to see a new assortment every time they visit.\nFurther, we believe this may encourage shoppers to visit our stores more frequently to see what's new. I am also excited about our post-holiday initiatives to transition our stores to the categories and trends that we believe consumers want. Lastly, we are excited about our holiday marketing campaigns.\nWe recently launched our campaigns across a variety of media channels, with an emphasis on digital. At every division, we believe our campaigns position us as a destination for holiday decor and inspiring gifts at terrific values. Further, we are targeting a wide consumer demographic to emphasize that our values are available to all our shoppers every day. We believe our campaigns will keep our retail brands top of mind, may encourage cross-shopping of our banners, and attract new customers this holiday season.\nNow I'd like to quickly summarize the key reasons why I am so confident that we are in an excellent position to continue our global growth and increase market share over the short and long term. First, we are convinced that consumers will continue to seek out value. Our value proposition of brand, fashion, quality, and price sets us apart from many other retailers and has served us extremely well through many kinds of retail and economic environments over the course of our nearly 50-year history. Second, we successfully operate stores across a very wide customer demographic. We curate each of our stores individually to appeal to shoppers across various income and age demographics.\nFurther, we continue to see our customer growth driven by attracting and retaining shoppers across age groups. Next, we are confident that the flexibility of our buying, planning, and allocation, store formats, systems, and supply chain will continue to be a key advantage. Fourth, we still see significant store growth ahead with a long-term store target of 7,000 stores just for our current countries and Spain.\nAdditionally, with our joint venture in Mexico and investment in the Middle East, we have further expanded our off-price reach around the world. All of this gives us great confidence that we have a tremendous opportunity to capture additional market share globally. Fifth, I am extremely confident that there will be more than enough quality branded inventory in the marketplace to support our growth plans.\nAs a growing retailer around the world, vendors can use our nearly 5,200 stores as a way to clear excess inventory, grow their business, and introduce their brands to new consumers. Next, we are convinced that the appeal of in-store shopping is here to stay. We see our treasure hunt shopping experience as an important advantage, and believe it will continue to resonate with consumers.\nFurther, we make it very easy for our customers to shop our banners by locating our stores in convenient, easy-to-access locations, and offering them the ability to shop multiple categories across a store very quickly. Most importantly, I truly believe the depth of off-price knowledge and expertise within TJX is unmatched. We have many leaders across the company with decades of off-price experience who are laser-focused on driving the current business at a very high level, while also teaching and developing the next generation of TJX leaders. We also have a very deep bench, which gives us the ability to rotate talent between divisions and geographies. Finally, I am so proud of our culture, which I believe has been a major contributor to our long history of strong performance.\nSumming up, we are extremely pleased with the overall performance of TJX in the Q3 and the momentum of the business entering the holiday season. I am so proud of the continued execution of our teams around the world, and their relentless focus on our value commitment to our shoppers. We remain convinced that we have significant opportunities for growth, and believe we can continue to capture market share around the world for many years to come.\nFinally, I am pleased to share that during the Q3, we published our 2025 Global Corporate Responsibility Report. The report covers our ongoing work across four key areas: workplace, communities, environmental sustainability, and responsible sourcing. We invite you to learn more by visiting our website, TJX.com. Now I'll turn the call back to John to cover our Q4 and full-year guidance, and then we'll open it up for questions. John?\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nCFO, TJX Companies\n\nThanks again, Ernie. I'll start with our Q4 guidance, where we are planning overall comp sales to increase 2% to 3%, consolidated sales to be in the range of $17.1 to 17.3 billion, pre-tax profit margin to be in the range of 11.7% to 11.8%, up 10 to 20 basis points versus last year's 11.6%, gross margin to be in the range of 30.5% to 30.6%, flat to up 10 basis points versus last year, SG&A to be in the range of 18.9%, which would be 30 basis points favorable versus last year. We're assuming net interest income of $26 million, which we expect to deliver Q4 pre-tax profit margin by 10 basis points. Our Q4guidance also assumes a tax rate of 25.4% and a weighted average share count of approximately 1.12 billion shares.\nBased on these assumptions, we expect Q4diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.33 to $1.36, up 8% to 11% versus last year's $1.23. Moving to the full year, we now expect overall comp sales to increase by 4%. We are increasing our full-year consolidated sales guidance to a range of $59.7 to 59.9 billion. This increase reflects the flow-through of the above planned sales in the Q3. We are increasing our full-year pre-tax profit margin guidance to 11.6%, up 10 basis points versus last year's 11.5%. Moving to gross margin, we now expect it to be 30.9%, up 30 basis points versus last year's 30.6%. We now expect full-year SG&A to be 19.5%, a 10 basis points unfavorable versus last year. We're assuming net interest income of $111 million, which we expect to deliver fiscal 2026 pre-tax profit margin by 10 basis points.\nOur full-year guidance assumes a tax rate of 24.5% and weighted average share count of approximately 1.13 billion shares. As a result of these assumptions, we're increasing our full-year diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.63 to 4.66, up 9% versus last year's diluted earnings per share of $4.26. In terms of tariffs, we're assuming that the current level of tariffs on imports into the US will stay in place for the remainder of the year. As such, our guidance assumes that we will be able to continue to offset the tariff pressure on our business in the Q4. In closing, I want to reiterate Ernie's confidence in our plans for the remainder of the year, and our long-term opportunities going forward.\nI want to emphasize that we remain in an excellent position to continue to invest in the growth of our company while simultaneously returning cash to our shareholders. Now we're happy to take your questions. As a reminder, please limit your questions to one per person, so we can answer as many questions as we can. Thanks, and now we'll open it up to questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. To join the queue, press star one. Our first question comes from Brooke Roach from Goldman Sachs.\n\nBrooke Roach\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning, and thank you for taking our question. Ernie, I'd love to hear a little bit more about what gives you confidence in continuing to deliver the comp momentum as we come up into a tough compare for holiday season. Can you also give a little bit of commentary on what the benefit was to comp in the quarter from AUR and pricing growth, and what your plans are for pricing and price gaps as you deliver value into the holiday season? Thank you.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nSure, Brooke. Well, in the comp momentum, you can see we've been kind of building momentum for a bit now, right? It's going back a number of months. I think when you look around the board here at the opportunity to deliver a shopping experience and merchandise that is branded at tremendous value across good, better, and best, you look at the lack of that customer mission being serviced really by anybody else around us.\nNobody's really doing that. I'm talking good, better, best, branded at tremendous value in a shopping environment, which I think over the last decade has become more important to consumers in terms of not only the merchandise, but our shopping environment is very pleasant. Our associates are very accommodating, they're happy. We're providing, I think, an overall pleasant, exciting treasure hunt shopping experience.\nEven if they're not in for a treasure hunt, our consumers, and we have data on this, really enjoy shopping us. It's a very positive experience. Contrast that with what's happening around us, and I think ultimately that's why our formula just bodes well in terms of confidence in our comp momentum. John, did you want to jump in?\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nCFO, TJX Companies\n\nYeah. I mean, just to give you some color on the cadence and the build of the comp. The cadence in the quarter was very consistent by month, which was really nice to see. As to transactions and basket, both transactions and basket were up, with basket driving a little bit more of the comp, and within basket, ticket was the driver.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nDoes that help you, Brooke, with that part of that question?\n\nBrooke Roach\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYes. Very helpful. Thank you.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nYeah. You had kind of a third part, which I believe was around the pricing gap, which I think is touching on what John is getting at. Clearly, another component is our merchants are so driven by keeping a gap on our retail against the out the door. We've talked about that many times, and I think that's what speaks to the third question you were getting at.\nWe will continue to shop aggressively. Competition, which by the way is clearly all retail, whether it's online, whether it's brick and mortar at mass market discount, department stores, or specialty. We will ensure, as we always do, that our out the door retail is below their promotional retail or promotional retails. We'll continue to do that regardless.\nThat's where it gets down to item and SKU, and our teams are so good at staying laser-focused on executing that. By the way, I guess you could argue that's another component of being confident in our continued momentum.\n\nBrooke Roach\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you, Ernie.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nYou're welcome, Brooke.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Paul Lejuez from Citi.\n\nPaul Lejuez\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nHey, thanks, guys. Just to follow up on the traffic and ticket, I'm curious if it was AUR that drove the basket when you think about the higher AUR.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nCFO, TJX Companies\n\nSorry, Paul.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nPaul, sorry, Paul, that didn't come. Could you repeat that first part?\n\nPaul Lejuez\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nSure. I'm curious if it was TJX that drove the basket in terms of higher AUR, higher ticket, or are you seeing true price increases based on what's happening in the competitive landscape? Are you seeing that opportunity to take prices higher across the assortment because others are doing the same?\nI'm also just curious if you could talk about the income demographic comment. I think you said consistent performance. I'm curious if you were referring to the United States specifically, or if you could maybe talk about income demographics in other geographies as well, any differences that you're seeing.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nSure.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nCFO, TJX Companies\n\nYeah. When you break down the ticket, it was a bit more of the price versus the mix that drove that. I don't know if Ernie, if you want to expand on that.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nYeah, sure. Yeah. Paul, I think it was a combination, but I think a little bit more was due to some of the pricing that's gone up selectively throughout as other prices have gone up around us. I think you've seen many reports about other retailers talking about having made some price adjustments on certain items, categories. Again, we in some of those cases have followed suit based on what we've had to pay in retail.\nI go back to what I had said to Brooke at the end of that question, her third question, as we are extremely diligent on making sure we're providing in some cases at least as good a value as we were prior. In fact, our value perception scores, which we are always monitoring, are extremely strong.\nOf course, one would probably guess that when you look at our sales, you would say that if the value perception wasn't strong, we probably wouldn't be doing these comp sales. I think, as John said, that was probably the chunk of the reason. Merchandise mix does certainly impact. Again, I want to emphasize we do not top down drive the retail ticket. We're insisting on the right value, and then our merchants down at the buyer and level are the ones that really determine where the retail should be.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nCFO, TJX Companies\n\nRight. There is a good part of our mix that we're not buying the same thing over and over again. When we look at ticket, we're really looking at it within the department, so sometimes it can be a little challenging to read.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nIncome demo.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nCFO, TJX Companies\n\nYeah. Getting back to your income demographic, the vast majority of our geographies, it was close. I mean, both income demographics that we kind of break it down and how we look at it were very, very close, but it was the lower income demographic that was driving the comp in the majority of our geographies.\n\nPaul Lejuez\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nGot it. Thank you, guys.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nWhich Paul brings up because I'm sure all of you have heard many different reports on, in some cases, articles about, I guess, the upper end or luxury retail driving some of the, again, I always emphasize the strength in our business model is that we have a balanced approach where we have all, we try to appeal to all ages, and all income demographics, and we never veer off that mission really for times like this, and times when things get better, or in times where people are struggling. We want to appeal to all income demographics.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nCFO, TJX Companies\n\nWhich is why we're seeing consistent.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nConsistent across everyone.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nCFO, TJX Companies\n\nAll the income demographic fans we look at.\n\nPaul Lejuez\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nAll right. Just a follow-up. Is that unusual that it would be the lower income demos that are outperforming at the same time that you're seeing ticket go higher?\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nCFO, TJX Companies\n\nNo. It's been like that for the last number of quarters. I mean, because really for quite a long time, we've been seeing strong across all income demographics that sometimes it'll tip one way or the other. That's what we're seeing is just a tipping of it rather than a trend.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nIt's not a long-term trend. Yeah. Yeah. Paul, we have, and when John says the strength, all the income demos are healthy. It's just that one's nudging a little bit. In other words, we are happy with all the different income groups. That one's just nudged up a bit in the recent past.\n\nPaul Lejuez\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nThanks, guys.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nWelcome.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Alex Straton from Morgan Stanley.\n\nAlex Straton\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thanks so much. I've got one for John and then maybe one for Ernie. John, just on the gross margin guidance for the Q4, can you talk about what changes to make that year-over-year expansion a little bit less than what we've seen in the last couple of quarters?\nFor Ernie, a bigger picture question. There's been a lot of discussion around AI disintermediation in retail, especially with the use of personal digital shoppers. I'm just wondering how you think about what these developments mean for TJ and what your broader kind of AI strategy might be more generally. Thanks so much.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nYeah.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nCFO, TJX Companies\n\nYes.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nGo ahead, John.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nCFO, TJX Companies\n\nOn the gross margin for the Q4, the reason why is it's really how we are handling our shrink accrual for the year. We had a favorable shrink come in last year, so we're up against the adjustment in the Q4 that brought the shrink rate down from our plan. We have a favorable shrink comparison to last year for Q1, Q2, Q3, and in Q4, we're up against a negative comparison last year. Does that make sense? I'm sorry.\n\nAlex Straton\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nIt does.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nCFO, TJX Companies\n\nWe're up against a positive adjustment last year this year, which creates a negative comparison.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nIs that good, Alex, on that? Yeah.\n\nAlex Straton\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nYep, it is. Thank you.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nOkay. On the, yeah, the bigger picture AI question, which of course, no topic is highlighted more than AI and the world we're in today. Our teams are all over this from a couple of perspectives, but let me emphasize that we're doing it in a TJX approach manner in terms of where would it dovetail into helping us without us swinging a pendulum and doing something that could be counterproductive.\nWe are pretty aggressively evaluating, testing, and deploying AI really across our business to help us work more efficiently and enhance and augment really the work our associates are doing. You had mentioned, I think, some example, but areas we would look at it right now, their testing is enhancing our fraud detection and security. There are aspects to that that could work out well. In-store analytics, really helping with that process, enhancing customer service.\nI'll give you another one. HR, where I think we're going to get some really big benefit, is in some HR processes where there's a lot of information that could be somewhat cumbersome. As big as we are today, I think that's going to help streamline a lot of work for some of our HR associates there. Enhancing customer service, I think I mentioned.\nMarketing, a recent discussion we just had is marketing optimization. This is something going on around us, and we are taking a look. It's really at the beginning to see what processes there would benefit from us implementing AI. We are, I can't tell you details, but we are taking a hard look and will be testing some services there to see if we can move that further.\nObviously, it goes without saying, we'd be looking at supporting buying and planning in a way, again, in a way that still allows our merchants to function with the secret sauce that we do not want to be impacted by AI if that's not appropriate. We're always very careful with that. Of course, we want to be aware of it and look at it. Then helping IT teams deliver and operate more efficiently. That was one of the first places we were looking at this a number of years ago.\nThe last thing here, Alex, I would say is we are also, the teams are really terrific, and I give our IT area credit that they're always looking at what are other people doing with AI so that we're always aware, competitively speaking, so that we don't get blindsided on something we should have been looking at and somebody else is. That's probably a little more info than you needed, but I think that kind of explains to you. We're on it.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nCFO, TJX Companies\n\nPart of that last comment that Ernie made, we have established cross-functional governance process that just ensures that we are thoughtfully proceeding on looking at AI.\n\nAlex Straton\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. Good luck.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan.\n\nMatthew Boss\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks, and congrats on a nice quarter.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nCFO, TJX Companies\n\nThanks, Matt.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nThanks, Matt.\n\nMatthew Boss\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nErnie, could you elaborate just on the overall acceleration at Marmaxx? New customer acquisition relative to expanded basket from your existing core. If you could elaborate on the strong start to the Q4, have you seen any softening in business or just opportunities that you see for Holiday this year?\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nYou're laying it up for me here, Matt.\n\nMatthew Boss\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nAlways, Ernie.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nYeah. I appreciate it. Now, the new customer acquisition, clearly, it's funny. We just talked about this a week ago, I do, with my marketing team and the analysis group there. We're clearly capturing new customers consistently at about the balance that we did before. We're getting equal momentum from that, as well as our infrequent and frequent customers spending. I think we have, I give the Marmaxx team credit on just really terrific execution.\nThey have right now, if you look in the store, a very balanced mix across all the families of business. That's one reason I think we're capturing the market share we're capturing, which is apparel has kicked in. By the way, we sometimes talk when weather has been against us. I would tell you right now, weather has helped us recently. That certainly is a plus in Marmaxx in certain categories.\nWhen you look at our apparel and non-apparel business there, it's healthy across the board. Yeah, I think you started to touch on this, Matt. There is no area that's really lagging too much. Otherwise, by the way, it's hard to have Marmaxx run a six-comp if we did have a high liability department that wasn't performing.\nThat's been really strong. Their inventory position, now you go to kind of the root of what's going on and why I have continued confidence, back a little bit to Brooke's first question, is the availability in the market is just, I've used this before, they're off the charts. I didn't use it in the script, but it's off the charts. We have so much availability across the brands in many categories, and some more availability in some of the categories that we haven't seen in a while.\nI think that is going to bode well for our next quarter. When you're a consumer right now, given the lack of excitement at retail around us, that's making them very open to trying us, which is why we have a really strong Holiday marketing campaign set up that really talks to our value leadership over the next couple of months. That's why I mentioned that in the script.\nWe're so excited about the different marketing creatives, which are really aimed at keeping us top of mind with consumers, or encouraging consumers that haven't tried us to try us for the first time. That's why I think the new customer, and infrequent customers, and customers that may have shopped us a year ago and haven't been back, that's what our marketing is aimed at taking advantage in this environment.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nCFO, TJX Companies\n\nI'll just reiterate what Ernie had said up front earlier in the call that we continue to fund payroll appropriately in the stores. We continue to invest in remodels in the stores. We've got fixtures that make it easier for customers to shop the stores. We're trying to, again, we're trying to maintain that great shopping environment when the customers do come into the store.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nIt's great color. Best of luck.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nCFO, TJX Companies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America.\n\nLorraine Hutchinson\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nThanks. Good morning. Ernie, are there any categories?\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nMorning.\n\nLorraine Hutchinson\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nMorning. Ernie, are there any categories or customer demographics where raising prices has been less successful? How quickly can you pivot if you see pushback to some of this price over the holidays?\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nYeah. Great question. We actually, I won't say what it is. We had one category, only one, and you know all the categories we have, where we weren't happy. We pivoted back and brought the retailers right back to where they were pre the adjustment. Other than that, I would say we're 95% successful on the pricing strategy. Again, we don't lead the pricing strategy.\nWe wait for the market around us. Even on that one category, my guess is our competitors on that category probably had to adjust their retails too because we only went up when their retails were going up. We found out if it wasn't good for us, there's no way it was good for them. No, other than the one I'm thinking about, we have been successful across the board.\nHaving said that, just on some, we've had a couple of items. I'll hear it from a couple of the merchants where we tried this one and this one SKU, even though it was in a category where it's worked across the board, we might have a SKU that didn't work because it might just not, it might be bumping up against something or whatever in our own mix.\nSometimes they have to compete in our own mix. Even the pricing, if it went up around us, and we try to take it up because it went up around us dramatically, it's still hanging with our other goods, and sometimes it doesn't work. Absolutely, Lorraine, 95% successful and very few. We're very careful on it, which is why not only do we judge it off the actual hard data, where we watch selling by SKU every week, we also use our value perception scores. We keep a constant pulse on that.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nCFO, TJX Companies\n\nThe speed at which we turn our inventory gives us the flexibility to react quickly.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nGreat point, John. Yep. Yep.\n\nLorraine Hutchinson\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you, guys.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nGood question, Lorraine. Yeah.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo.\n\nIke Boruchow\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Congrats. Two from me. Similar to Lorraine's question, Ernie, are there categories that you've intentionally de-emphasized or pushed harder because of tariffs, just because you look at the economics of each category? I'm just kind of curious how you think about that. Clearly your business is not seeing any issues, but very high level, I'm sure you guys have tons of KPIs or markers you look at to kind of judge the US consumer.\nIs there anything that you've seen over the past couple of months kind of going into Holiday that at all shows you that the US consumer is under some level of pressure? I think it's still a debate at this point. Just kind of curious how you guys view that at a high level.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nSure. On the first one, the de-emphasizing category, so to speak, if we were running into a tariff, we have done that to a little degree. What's happened, though, the cycle tends to come back because when they're imported like that, eventually their other accounts kind of back up. If people back off enough, again, we're not the importer, so we're able to negotiate through the third party.\nWe just might have a lag. We don't consciously de-emphasize over the long term. We just might take what's called our internal sales and inventory plans. They're called ladder plans. We might take those down for a couple of months, but then the market cycles back. We've seen that happen numerous times because we're not ready to take a big price increase if the vendors are coming to on a category if we can't show the great value.\nIt kind of works its way through the system. A great question. In those cases, and yes, we have done it in a couple of cases, we just wait for the cycle to come back to us in a couple of months. Tariffs overall, I mean, we do not really get different data than what all of you get. We can see that prices have been going up across many retailers, and many categories, and it has been talked about as either it has been done, or they are looking at doing it.\nMy barometer for our other retailers struggling a little is just the fact that the availability of merchandise across the board is so high across good, better, and best, that would lead us to believe that other retailers are struggling with some of the impact of the tariffs, I guess. Again, we do not get any outright. That's just a pulse from what we see in the market.\n\nIke Boruchow\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYep, very helpful. Thanks.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Michael Binetti from Evercore ISI.\n\nMichael Binetti\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nHey, guys. Great quarter. Thanks for taking our questions here. I had a couple on the margin. First, on the gross margin. In Q3, I think you had started the guidance at about 5 to 15 basis points of improvement on a 2 to 3 comp. You obviously beat it by a lot. Sounds like freight was a key upside driver. A couple of questions on that.\nJust since the shrink dynamic should be kind of contained to Q4, does that freight benefit roll off in Q4? Could you talk a little bit about what's driving freight, if that's something that could contribute after Q4? Secondly, I'm also curious if there was a mismatch of any kind in the quarter between tariff costs and pricing, also what that dynamic looks like in Q4.\nIt sounds like you expect to offset tariffs, but I'm wondering if the tariff headwind does get tougher in Q4. Finally, just on, I guess, the pre-tax margins more broadly, are there any early signals of margin headwinds we should keep in mind as we look at our models for next year, either across the company or at the Marmaxx or HomeGoods divisions?\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nYeah. Michael, just on the freight piece. For freight, it was a combination of favorable ocean rates and efficiencies that we implemented as far as movement of our merchandise. That's really what drove that freight piece. As far as tariffs go, I mean, look, Q2, Q3, Q4, the tariffs are pretty consistent as far as what we're seeing.\nWe have every confidence that we can do exactly what we did in the Q2 and Q3 and Q4. As I said in my closing comments, we are very confident in our ability to continue to navigate the tariff environment.\n\nMichael Binetti\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nIs that freight dynamic something that you think continues after Q4, or is that something that's just contained?\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nIt's really up to the freight, the ocean freight providers. I mean, if they start taking ships offline and try to decrease the surplus or availability, I mean, it's hard for me to answer that. It's asking me to look into the future. I can say that what we've been seeing in the Q3 is that we did see a savings in the ocean freight container rate.\n\nIke Boruchow\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nOkay. It sounds like it's more related to spot than contract, so it's a little bit less visibility. Any other new headwinds to think about as we look at the models next year?\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nNo. Yeah, I'm not prepared to talk about next year right now. We're still in the process of pulling our plans together.\n\nMichael Binetti\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay, best of luck in the holidays, guys. Thanks a lot.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Corey Tarlowe from Jefferies.\n\nCorey Tarlowe\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Thanks and good morning. Ernie, you commented on the value perception scores. Curious how you think about your value gaps today versus historically within the context of what you've seen from competitors, and then also kind of the shape of the comp throughout the year, given your comp was initially driven very much by traffic to start the year.\nThe commentary has felt in a way that it's evolved to be a little bit more driven by price, but not so much so that it's eroded your value gaps is what I think is the point. Curious to get your perspective on that. Thanks so much.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nYeah. Corey, spot on. You summed that up very balanced is the way we would look at. The value gap today, by the way, I would tell you, has improved from where it was even a couple of years ago in terms of a couple of things. I still believe part of the value equation, which has kind of evolved over the last number of years, is the shopping environment that we provide to go along with the merchandise is creating, I think, an even larger value gap between us and the other retailers.\nI think if you look at our shopping in our store versus other authorized pricers, or other specialty stores, or department stores, or larger discount stores, I think you would find a very efficient, clean, organized, and then treasure hunt all at the same time, combined with, I believe the perceptions are spot on where our values have even improved out the door retail versus others.\nThe gap has improved. Across the board, I would say we have improved there versus historic comparisons in terms of total value. I think you were asking about the shape of the comp and that being driven, it would have been a little bit more transactions you were feeling. Part of this is the retail. It was only, I think it was only HomeGoods where the right on the.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nCFO, TJX Companies\n\nHomeGoods was essentially flat.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nFlat, right? The others were still up. That's why I said your comment was spot on, where it's kind of an in-between, and we're feeling really good about it. Because again, I think there is a major value gap between us and everybody else. As John said, we've had these pricing things, but clearly it has not impacted any value perception at all.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nCFO, TJX Companies\n\nExactly. Again, driving a five-comp and being strong across every.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nEvery one.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nCFO, TJX Companies\n\nOur division.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nBanners. Yep.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nCFO, TJX Companies\n\nIt was really positive to see.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nI would throw in our biggest, now you can appreciate this hasn't come up yet, but my biggest challenge for this organization is when you have such strong sales momentum, which keeps getting better, is for us to not get over our skis and buy too much too soon. I think we've talked about that before, even a year ago. One reason we are delivering the year we're having is keeping a lot of liquidity, and our merchants are able to be very entrepreneurial, and very opportunistic on their buying.\nThat's when we provide the most exciting value-branded off-price closeout goods to the consumer. That continues to be a focus, to make sure with all this availability that's out there and combined with our strong sales, we just need to fight the urge to buy too much too soon. You know what I mean, Corey? That would probably be our biggest challenge right now because that's the number one way we still can continue to drive our sales and profitable sales.\n\nCorey Tarlowe\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nYeah. Certainly. That makes a lot of sense. I just had a quick follow-up for John. You mentioned in Q4 that SG&A was 30 basis points, I believe, favorable or expected to be. Could you just unpack that for us a little bit? Thanks so much, and best of luck.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nCFO, TJX Companies\n\nYeah, sure. It's going to be a combination of incentive accrual favorability versus last year and expense savings. Last year, we adjusted our incentive accruals in the Q3, so we're comparing to that. We have a year-over-year favorability there.\n\nCorey Tarlowe\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you, and best of luck.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nCFO, TJX Companies\n\nThanks.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Jay Sole from UBS.\n\nJay Sole\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thank you so much. Ernie, my question is, if you just take a step back and think about this has been a year with an unprecedented level of tariffs, and you're talking about availability of inventory. I think you said it was off the charts. Does it surprise you at all that in a year when you would think people would be making less product, importing less product, that you have seen so much availability? If it does, how do you explain it?\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nYeah. No, great question, Jay. I have to tell you, yeah, a little surprise on the degree to which the availability is there. Because to your point, back when I go back in the spring when all of this was just starting to evolve, we get there were some categories where, by the way, some categories back then we would not have worried about availability only because they would not have been impacted as much by the tariff.\nIt would have been a more moderate tariff. There were others where we might have expected a little less availability. Yeah, a little bit. We always thought there would be good availability.\nRemember, you're never going to hear from me a concern about not having enough goods across the board, maybe in a category, a department, but you're never going to hear a concern, even with tariffs, about us not having enough goods the way the model works. By the way, in the way we have seasoned pros in all of these areas, in merchandising and planning, that can bob and weave to the dynamics out there. Yes, to your point, I think the degree to this, how do I explain it?\nI think part of the reason you explain it is you have public companies that are retailers that still have to bring in, whether it's the e-comm players that still have to bring in goods. They're not shutting down their websites, so they're having to buy goods.\nEventually, maybe they massaged it and moved from one category or less with one brand or more with another because of the tariffs, but still creates excess inventories. There's still a down the supply chain when things slow up at retail. Again, they're public. They can't afford to have a 20% decrease in their sales. They're not cutting their spending. Do you know what I mean there, Jay?\nThey can't cut their ordering as extreme as the tariffs would maybe tell them they do. I think what happens is they might be bringing less units, but they're going to bring in the dollars that equate given the tariff. If those sales don't materialize, we still end up with the extra supply of closeouts.\nI think retail across the board has been a little choppy, and that's creating the excess inventory. Yeah, interesting dynamic. Again, this is where I'd like to give credit to our teams because, bottom up, the teams assess in each area how much, because we buy in a few different ways. They know where their core flow is coming from with certain vendors, and yet all the opportunistic side.\nIf we wouldn't be in this really good inventory position, we're still being liquidity if our teams weren't so good at executing at that level. That's where, again, very proud of what they've done in this environment. As you said, very challenging year.\n\nJay Sole\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGot it. Thank you so much.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Adrian Yee from Barclays.\n\nAdrian Yee\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nGood morning. Let me add my congratulations. Ernie, we've been in the store throughout the quarter, and I was wondering, I mean, they're extraordinarily long lines. I was wondering if you had been seeing sort of an earlier cadence to the holiday shopping behavior and/or promotionality. Obviously, Walmart pulled forward their Black Friday.\nJust wondering what you're seeing there and if you expect a shift in the holiday season. John, for you, you've done a ton of work on supply chain and transportation logistics over the past couple of years. Outside of the freight tailwind, are you expecting to see sort of a longer-term go forward positive impact? Does that change the leverage point on gross margin? Thank you.\n\nErnie Herrman",
    "content2": "CEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nGood questions, Adrian. Yeah. No, we don't believe there's necessarily a, on our part, there's no purposeful shift to thinking we're doing earlier. Again, as we've said, we're off to a strong start. We like the way we're positioned in November already, which obviously indicated we were happy with our traffic, and you've been witnessing it evidently.\nI think what's also happening is I didn't get to talk about this earlier, but every year, our Q4, as you've seen, has been one of our steadiest performing quarters where we have become more of a gift-giving destination. I think that's at the root of it. I think all of the, we've also talked about this, the social media, the coolness of shopping at TJX Store, whether it's Marshalls, Sierra, HomeGoods, or TJ Maxx. I don't know if you see them.\nA lot of our reusable bags show up with shoppers that bring them to their supermarkets because we've made such an impact on consumers, and they find us to be a desirable place to show their brand. I think as they've gotten acclimated and more desirable to shop our brand, I think that makes them think of us more for gift-giving than ever before, which is also a reason I think you're seeing that. It's nothing that we purposely did for an event per se or a timing thing. I think it's the nature of the brand equity and the coolness factor that we've developed over the last handful of years that's yielding a little bit of an earlier shop of us in November.\n\nAdrian Yee\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thanks.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nCFO, TJX Companies\n\nYeah. Getting to the second part of your question, I mean, first of all, the leverage point, we still see, again, just repeating, on a three to four comp with no outsized expense increases, we still anticipate being flat to up 10 basis points. That's not changing. We don't see that changing right now. As far as the supply chain goes, I mean, certainly with a higher ticket, we just have to be more efficient in our operational areas.\nThere's less units to move to hit the same top line. In addition to that, we're always looking for ways to increase the efficiency of our facilities and looking to, rather than open up a new facility as sales go up, which we still have to do, but where we can, if we can expand a facility to increase the capacity, that certainly is something we always look to do as well.\n\nAdrian Yee\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nFantastic. Best of luck for Holiday, and see you in December.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nCFO, TJX Companies\n\nThanks.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from Mark Altschwager from Baird.\n\nMark Altschwager\n\nAnalyst, Baird\n\nGreat. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First, on segment margins, the delta between HomeGoods and Marmaxx is the narrowest we've seen in some time. Just talk about the key drivers to narrowing that gap and whether you expect that convergence to continue. Thank you.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nCFO, TJX Companies\n\nI mean, both divisions are performing and doing an outstanding job at driving both the top and bottom line. Certainly, some of the freight benefits that we've seen over time, I mean, because of the size and nature of the product, have benefited HomeGoods a little bit more.\nLook, we're very pleased with both of our US divisions, both our US segments. Nothing more to add. It's just driving the top line. I mean, HomeGoods has been very consistent at driving that top line, and that's one of the biggest levers we have to increase the pre-tax profit.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nYeah. Mark, I think I would jump, Mark, just adding a little flavor to the merchandising to what John was saying is they've also, they're constantly creating newness of vendors there and always super fast-turning business, as you know. I think they've been, they're very flexible in terms of the merchandise vendor content, which I think has been able to help them on their merchandise margins, which probably is also a big benefit in terms of their operating income getting a little closer to Marmaxx.\n\nMark Altschwager\n\nAnalyst, Baird\n\nExcellent. Best of luck with Holiday.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nThank you.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nCFO, TJX Companies\n\nThanks.\n\nErnie Herrman\n\nCEO and President, TJX Companies\n\nI'd like to, at this point, thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to updating you again on our Q3 earnings call in February. Thank you, everybody.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time."

Welcome to the TJX Company Second Quarter Fiscal 2026 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded, August 20, 2025, and I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ernie Herrman, Chief Executive Officer and President of TJX Companies, Inc. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nErnie L. Herrman\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The TJX Cos., Inc.\n\nThanks, Courtney. Before we begin, Deb has some opening comments.\n\nDebra McConnell\n\nSenior Vice President of Global Communications\n\nThank you, Ernie, and good morning. Today's call is being recorded and includes forward-looking statements about our results and plans. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to vary materially from these statements, including, among others, the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review our press release for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements as well as the full safe harbor statements included in the Investors section of our website, tjx.com. We have also detailed the impact of foreign exchange on our consolidated results and our international divisions in today's press release and in the Investors section of tjx.com along with reconciliations to non-GAAP measures we discuss.\nThank you. And now I'll turn it back over to Ernie.\n\nErnie L. Herrman\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The TJX Cos., Inc.\n\nGood morning. Joining me and Deb on the call is John. I'll start today with our second quarter results. I am extremely pleased with our outstanding second quarter performance and our above-plan sales, profit margin and earnings per share results. Overall, comp sales for the second quarter exceeded our expectations, increasing 4% and were strong across all of our divisions. Customer transactions were up at every division and drove our overall comp sales increase. As we have seen through so many retail and economic environments, consumers were drawn to our excellent values and brands. And going forward, we continue to see market share opportunities across each of our U.S. and international divisions.\nWith our profit results in the second quarter also well exceeding our plan, we are raising our full year guidance for both pretax profit margin and earnings per share. John will talk about our results and guidance in more detail in a few minutes. I want to thank our global associates who drove these excellent results. Our teams across the company successfully executed our off-price business fundamentals to deliver an exciting assortment of merchandise at great value to our customers every day. This is a testament to the talent of our teams and the depth of their off-price expertise.\nAcross our company, we saw our associates working together as one TJX to deliver on our value mission for consumers. As we look to the second half of the year, I am very confident in our position of strength in retail. Our teams are energized by the opportunities we see to keep attracting shoppers to our retail brands and to build upon our success of prior years, being a gifting destination for consumers. We see outstanding buying opportunities in the marketplace for quality branded merchandise, which also gives me great confidence in our plans for the fall and holiday selling seasons.\nThe third quarter is off to a strong start. We are confident in our full year sales and profitability plans, and as always, we will strive to beat them. Longer term, we believe the strength and resiliency of our flexible off-price business model will continue to be a tremendous advantage. We feel great about our core businesses and the opportunities we see for growth with our newer vehicles. We are convinced we have a long runway ahead to capture additional market share worldwide and continue our successful global growth.\nI'll talk more about our second half opportunities and key strengths in a moment. But first, I'll turn the call over to John to cover our second quarter results in more detail.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Ernie. I also want to add my gratitude to all of our global associates for their continued hard work and commitment to delivering our customers great value every day. Now I'll share some additional details on the second quarter. As Ernie mentioned, our consolidated comp sales growth of 4% came in above our plan. Further, we saw comp increases in both our apparel and home categories with home outperforming apparel. Second quarter pretax profit margin of 11.4% was up 50 basis points versus last year and well above our plan.\nGross margin increased 30 basis points versus last year, primarily due to favorable hedges. Merchandise margin was flat despite higher tariff costs versus last year. Importantly, we are very pleased with our mitigation strategies, which allowed us to offset the tariff pressure we saw in the second quarter. Decreased 30 basis points versus last year. This was primarily due to operational efficiencies as well as a benefit from the timing of certain expenses, some of which we expect to reverse out in the third quarter.\nNet interest income negatively impacted pretax profit margin by 10 basis points versus last year. Second quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.10 increased 15% versus last year and was also well above our expectations. Lastly, we were extremely pleased that our second quarter pretax profit margin came in 90 basis points above the high end of our plan. This was due to a combination of items, including lower-than-expected tariff costs, expense leverage on above plant sales and the timing of certain expenses. This was also partially offset by higher incentive compensation accruals and contribution to TJX's charitable foundations.\nNow to our second quarter divisional performance. Again, this quarter, customer transactions increased at every division. We see this as an excellent indicator of the strength of our value proposition across our retail banners. At Marmaxx, comp sales grew a strong 3%, a combination of a higher average basket and an increase in customer transactions drove the comp increase. It was great to see strength in our store performance across all income demographics, which speaks to our broad-based appeal of our values. Marmaxx's segment profit margin was 14.2% and up 10 basis points versus last year.\nOur Sierra stores and U.S. e-commerce sites, which we report as part of this division also saw strong sales results. We feel great about Marmaxx's performance, the initiatives underway for the second half of the year and our long-term opportunities that we believe will allow us to drive sales and capture additional market share. At HomeGoods, comp sales grew a very strong 5% with strength at both our HomeGoods and HomeSense banners. Segment profit margin grew 10%, up 90 basis points versus last year are eclectic assortment of home fashions that we source from around the world are clearly resonating with customers. We are excited about what's in store for the back half of the year, and we're confident our customers will be, too.\nWe remain confident that we can continue to capture additional share of the U.S. home market. TJX Canada's comp sales increased an outstanding 9% and Segment profit margin on a constant currency basis grew to a very strong 16%, up 100 basis points versus last year. Our retail banners in Canada, which consists of Winners, Marshalls and HomeSense have extremely high brand awareness and customer loyalty. We see great potential for our Canadian banners for the rest of 2025 and long term and for their continued successful growth across the country.\nAt TJX International, comp sales increased a very strong 5%. Once again, we're very pleased to see sales strength in Europe and outstanding sales in Australia. Segment profit margin on a constant currency basis grew to 5.2%, up 80 basis points versus last year. With our leadership position in decades of international operating experience, we are confident we can continue to be an attractive shopping destination for value-seeking customers across Europe and Australia. Moving to inventory. Balance sheet inventory was up 14% and inventory on a per store basis was up 10% versus last year as we've been buying into the excellent opportunities for quality branded merchandise we've been seeing in the marketplace.\nWe are confident that availability of merchandise will continue to be outstanding and that we are well positioned to flow fresh assortments to our stores and online this fall and holiday season. As to capital allocation, we continue to reinvest in the growth of our business while returning $1 billion in the second quarter to shareholders through our buyback and dividend programs.\nNow I'll turn it back to Ernie.\n\nErnie L. Herrman\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The TJX Cos., Inc.\n\nThank you, John. Now I'd like to take a moment and highlight the opportunities we see to keep driving sales and traffic in the second half of the year. First, I am convinced that the consumers will continue to seek our value and that we remain a very attractive option for consumers seeking great brands, fashions and quality merchandise at compelling prices.\nOur customer surveys tell us that our value perception remains strong and we are laser-focused on keeping it that way. Again, product availability has been outstanding. Our global world-class buying organization of over 1,300 buyers sourced from an ever-changing universe of over 21,000 vendors across more than 100 countries. I'm extremely confident that our buyers will bring consumers the right assortment at the right values throughout the fall and holiday season. Next, we feel great about the product category initiatives underway for the back-to-school and holiday shopping season.\nFurther, we have made our stores a year-round shopping destination for gifts and believe we are becoming more top of mind with shoppers with our consumable offerings. We believe that shoppers will be inspired to visit us frequently to see what's new. Lastly, we are planning exciting marketing campaigns that will continue to reinforce our value leadership. We plan to continue to represent a broad range of shoppers in our advertising and leverage a wide variety of media channels to target a wide customer base.\nWe believe these campaigns will help us continue to attract new shoppers. Stay top of mind with our existing customers and encourage cross-shopping of our retail banners. Beyond this year, we have great confidence in our key success factors that have served us so well through our nearly 50-year history. We are convinced that these key characteristics of our business set us up extremely well for continued growth around the world over the long term. First, we are convinced that our position as a trusted value leader in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Australia, will continue to be a tremendous advantage.\nWe believe our value proposition of brand, fashion, price and quality will continue to resonate with consumers. Our commitment to offer great value on every item, every day to every customer will always be a top priority. Second, we aim to attract shoppers across a very wide customer demographic with our treasure hunt shopping experience. Our extensive assortments of good, better and best brands allow us to offer merchandise to a broad range of income and age groups. We believe our strategy of trading across a wide customer demographic differentiates us from many other retailers and is a tremendous advantage.\nFurther, we continue to attract younger customers to our stores, which we believe bodes well for the future. Third, we believe the flexibility of our business will continue to be a significant benefit as we operate through the ever-changing macro and retail environments. The flexibility of our buying, store formats, systems and supply chain allow us to merchandise stores individually with a rapidly changing curated mix of goods with a wide range of price points.\nNext, we see the long-term potential to open an additional 1,800-plus stores in just our current countries in Spain. We also see great growth potential with our joint venture in Mexico and investment in the Middle East. Importantly, I am extremely confident that there will be plenty of quality merchandise available to support our store growth plans. We believe we can keep delivering the best merchandise values and shopping experience to our customers around the world. Lastly and most importantly is the longevity and knowledge of our talent which I believe is unmatched. Throughout TJX, our management teams have deep decades-long off-price experience in the U.S. and internationally.\nWe take great pride in our TJX University and other teaching and training programs and are laser-focused on succession planning to ensure we develop the next generation of leaders for our company. Additionally, our deep bench gives us great flexibility to rotate talent throughout the company to further develop our future leaders. I am also very proud of our culture which I believe is a major differentiator and will continue to be another key component of our success. Summing up, we are extremely pleased to deliver another quarter of strong sales and profitability.\nWe believe our performance and momentum in the first half of the year puts us in an excellent position for continued success for the remainder of the year. We feel great about our value position in the current environment and are confident that we will have an appealing assortment of merchandise in our stores and online throughout the fall and winter seasons. We have a strategic vision for long-term success, and I am convinced that we are set up well to capitalize on the opportunities we see to grow our company and capture market share around the world for many years to come. Now I'll turn the call back to John to cover our full year and third quarter guidance, and then we'll open it up for questions.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks again, Ernie. I'll start with our full year fiscal 2016 guidance. We now expect overall comp sales to increase by 3%. We are increasing our full year consolidated sales guidance to a range of $59.3 billion to $59.6 billion. This increase now reflects a significant benefit from favorable foreign exchange rates on the translation of our foreign sales to U.S. dollars as well as the flow-through of our above-plan sales in the second quarter.\nWe're increasing our full year profitability guidance to be in the range of 11.4% to 11.5%. This would be flat to down 10 basis points versus last year's 11.5%. Moving to gross margin. We now expect it to be in the range of 30.5% to 30.6%, flat to down 10 basis points versus last year's 30.6%. We now expect full year SG&A to be 19.4%, flat versus last year. We're now assuming net interest income of about $108 million, which we expect to delever fiscal '26 pretax profit margin by 10 basis points. Our full year guidance assumes a tax rate of 24.5% and a weighted average share count of approximately 1.13 billion shares.\nAs a result of these assumptions, we're increasing our full year diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.52 to $4.57 and up 6% to 7% versus last year's diluted earnings per share of $4.26. This EPS guidance now includes our second quarter above plan sales and a negative 1% impact to EPS growth due to unfavorable foreign exchange versus a negative 3% impact on our previous guidance. Moving to the third quarter. We expect overall comp sales to increase 2% to 3%, consolidated sales to be in the range of $14.7 billion to $14.8 billion.\nPretax profit to be in the range of 12% to 12.1%, down 20 to 30 basis points versus last year's 12.3%. Gross margin to be in the range of 31.6% to 31.7%. This would be flat to up 10 basis points versus last year. SG&A to be 19.8% and 30 basis points unfavorable to last year. We're also assuming net interest income of about $25 million, which we expect to delever third quarter pretax profit margin by 10 basis points.\nOur third quarter guidance also assumes a tax rate of 24.7% and weighted average share count of approximately 1.13 billion shares. Based on these assumptions, we expect third quarter diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.17 to $1.19, up 3% to 4% versus last year's $1.14. Lastly, our implied guidance for the fourth quarter assumes that overall comp sales would be up 2% to 3% and pretax profit margin will be in the range of 11.7% to 11.8%, up 10 to 20 basis points versus last year, and diluted earnings per share would be in the range of $1.33 to $1.36 up 8% to 11% versus last year.\nAs for tariffs, our third quarter, fourth quarter and full year guidance assumes that we'll be able to offset the incremental tariff pressure on our business this year. We're making an assumption that the current level of tariffs on imports into the U.S. will stay in place for the remainder of the year. In closing, I want to reiterate earnings confidence in our plans for the second half of the year and our long-term opportunities. I also want to emphasize that we remain in an excellent position to continue to invest in the growth of the company while simultaneously returning significant cash to our shareholders.\nNow we're happy to take your questions. As a reminder, please limit your questions to one per person so we can answer as many questions as we can. Thanks, and now we'll open it up for questions.",

Welcome to The TJX Companies First Quarter Fiscal 2026 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, May 21, 2025.\nI would like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Ernie Herrman, Chief Executive Officer and President of The TJX Companies, Inc. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nErnie L. Herrman\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The TJX Cos., Inc.\n\nThank you, Fran. Before we begin, Deb has some opening comments.\n\nDebra McConnell\n\nSenior Vice President of Global Communications\n\nThank you, Ernie, and good morning. Today's call is being recorded and includes forward-looking statements about our results and plans. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to vary materially from these statements, including, among others, the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review our press release for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements as well as the full safe harbor statements included in the Investors section of our website, tjx.com. We have also detailed the impact of foreign exchange on our consolidated results and our international divisions in today's press release and in the Investors section of tjx.com, along with reconciliations to non-GAAP measures we discuss.\nThank you. And now I'll turn it back over to Ernie.\n\nErnie L. Herrman\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The TJX Cos., Inc.\n\nGood morning. Joining me and Deb on the call is John. I want to start by thanking all of our global associates for their ongoing commitment to TJX and to our customers. Our talented associates work hard to bring our business to life and deliver great value to consumers every day.\nNow to our first quarter results. I am very pleased with our performance in the quarter. Overall comp sales grew 3%, at the high end of our plan. Every division, both in the U.S. and internationally, drove increases in comp sales and customer transactions. Pretax profit margin and earnings per share both exceeded our expectations. John will talk about our first quarter results in more detail in a moment.\nDuring the quarter, our teams delivered an exciting mix of good, better and best brands across a broad range of categories and items to serve our very wide customer demographic. As always, we offered great value to our shoppers every day at each of our retail banners.\nLooking ahead, we are convinced that our value proposition and the flexibility of our business will continue to be a winning retail formula. The second quarter is off to a strong start and we are excited about the initiatives we have planned, which we believe will further drive sales and traffic. The availability of merchandise we are seeing is outstanding, and we are in a great position to take advantage of the plentiful opportunities that the marketplace is offering. We are confident in our ability to navigate the current tariff and macro environment in the short term. Importantly, our vision for long-term growth, profitability and market share opportunities remains the same.\nNow I'll turn the call over to John to cover our first quarter results in more detail.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Ernie. I also want to add my gratitude to all of our global associates for their hard work and dedication to TJX and our customers.\nNow I'll show some additional details on our first quarter versus last year. As Ernie mentioned, our consolidated comp sales growth of 3% came in at the high end of our plan. Overall comp sales growth was almost entirely driven by an increase in customer transactions. Comps in both our apparel and home categories increased with home outperforming apparel. Pretax margin of 10.3% was down 80 basis points and was above our plan. Gross margin was down 50 basis points primarily due to unfavorable inventory hedges. SG&A increased 20 basis points due to a lapping of a benefit from a reserve release last year in incremental store wage and payroll costs. Net interest income negatively impacted pretax profit margin by 20 basis points versus last year due to a lower cash balance and lower interest rates. Lastly, diluted earnings per share of $0.92 were also above our expectations.\nNow to our first quarter divisional performance. Across all of our divisions, customer transactions increased once again. We see this as an excellent indicator of the strength of our value proposition across our retail banners. At Marmaxx, comp sales increased 2% and segment profit margin was 13.7%, down 50 basis points. As we expected, Marmaxx' sales accelerated in March and April as the weather improved. Comp sales in both apparel and home categories were up.\nAlso, we were very pleased with the sales growth at our U.S. e-commerce sites and Sierra stores, which we report as part of this division. We remain confident that Marmaxx, our largest division, can capitalize on the opportunities we see to continue gaining market share and further grow our store footprint across the U.S.\nOur HomeGoods division delivered comp sales growth of 4% with strength at both the HomeGoods and HomeSense banners. Segment profit margin was 10.2%, up 70 basis points versus last year. We believe our U.S. home banners offer consumers a highly differentiated mix of home fashions from around the world. We are convinced that we can continue to grow our share of the U.S. home fashions market.\nAt TJX Canada, comp sales were up 5%. Segment profit margin on a constant currency basis was 10.6%, down 170 basis points last year primarily due to unfavorable transactional foreign exchange as we expected. TJX Canada is the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in Canada. With well-recognized retail banners, we see our Canadian business is well positioned for continued successful growth.\nAt TJX International, comp sales increased 5%. We were very pleased to see continued strength in Europe and outstanding sales in Australia. Segment profit margin on a constant currency basis was 4.2%, up 20 basis points versus last year. We continue to see plenty of opportunities to grow our T.K. Maxx banner across our existing European countries and in Australia and to bring T.K. Maxx to Spain next year.\nI also want to reiterate our excitement for our joint venture with Grupo Axo in Mexico and our investment in Brands For Less in the Middle East. While still early, we're building great relationships with these teams, and we see this as a way to participate in the growth of off-price in these geographies.\nMoving to inventory. Balance sheet inventory was up 15% and inventory on a per store basis was up 7% versus last year. We feel great about our inventory levels and have been taking advantage of the excellent deals we have been seeing in the marketplace. Availability of merchandise remains outstanding, and we are set up very well to continue to flow fresh assortments to our stores and online. As to our capital allocation, we continue to reinvest in the growth of our business while returning significant cash to shareholders through our buyback and dividend programs.\nNow I'll turn it back to Ernie.\n\nErnie L. Herrman\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The TJX Cos., Inc.\n\nThanks, John. I'd like to start with a few comments on the current environment and the reasons for our continued confidence in our business. We have a very long track record of successfully navigating through many types of challenging economic and retail markets. Each time, we have emerged as an even stronger company with greater market share opportunities. We have a very experienced leadership team that has worked together for multiple decades.\nWhile we're not immune to tariff pressure, we are laser-focused on our initiatives to offset them by remaining flexible and executing our opportunistic buying approach. Long term, we remain as confident as ever in our strategic vision for future growth.\nNow I want to reiterate the key characteristics of our business that give us confidence that we can continue to execute on our growth initiatives through the current environment and for many years to come. First is the value proposition we offer to our customers. For us, value is a combination of brand, fashion, quality and price. Our customer surveys tell us that we have an excellent reputation as a value leader in each of our geographies.\nAs a trusted value retailer, we have historically attracted new shoppers to our stores in many different types of environments. Therefore, we are convinced that we will have an opportunity to gain market share if more consumers seek out value in the current environment. We are confident that our commitment to our shoppers, great value on every item every day will continue to resonate with consumers and drive more shoppers to our stores.\nNext, our team of over 1,300 buyers source goods from an ever-changing universe of over 21,000 vendors from more than 100 countries around the world. We have a global buying infrastructure and supply chain that has been in place for multiple decades. Further, we have long-standing relationships with many of our vendors, and we can offer another avenue for them to grow their business. All of this gives us great confidence that we'll have plenty of merchandise available to support our long-term growth plans.\nThird, we successfully operate stores across a very wide customer demographic. We offer shoppers a wide breadth of good, better and best brands to appeal to shoppers across a broad range of income and age groups. We believe this is a tremendous advantage and will continue to allow us to attract a wider shopping audience than many other retailers.\nNext, all aspects of our business model are driven by flexibility. Our global buying, store operations, supply chain and systems are designed to support our flexible business model. This allows us to offer an exciting treasure hunt shopping experience with rapidly changing selections across all categories. We are confident that our flexibility will continue to help us to navigate through many types of environments and allow us to react to changing consumer preferences.\nLastly but most important is our talent. I truly believe that the depth of off-price knowledge and expertise and longevity of our management teams within TJX is unmatched. We take great pride in being a teaching organization, which is a high priority of our managers throughout the company. This is supported with our TJX University and other training programs. Further, our human resource teams are extremely focused on developing talent and succession planning to ensure we develop the next generation of leaders of TJX.\nAdditionally, I am so proud of our culture, which I believe is a major differentiator. I am convinced that our constant focus on talent and culture have been significant keys to our success and will continue to be going forward. Again, we are confident that the combination of these characteristics is why we have delivered decades of sales and profit growth and gives us great confidence that we are set up very well for long-term success.\nSumming up, we are very pleased with the overall performance of TJX in the first quarter. I truly believe we are one of the best models in retail and that it will serve us well in today's environment. Longer term, we continue to see a long runway for growth. As an off-price leader in every country that we operate in, we see plenty of opportunities to further grow our market share in the U.S. and internationally. Lastly, I have great confidence that the flexibility of our business, our relentless focus on value, and very importantly, our talented associates will continue to be major contributors to our success for many years to come.\nNow I'll turn the call back to John to cover our full year and second quarter guidance, and then we'll open it up for questions.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks again, Ernie. I'll begin with some color on how we're thinking about tariffs. Let me start by saying that we believe we can navigate through the current tariff environment. While we're not immune to tariffs, we feel great about the components of our business that we can control and remain confident in our long-term growth and profitability plans.\nWe're also realistic that in the short term, we are operating in a highly fluid macro environment. For simplicity purposes, we're making the assumption that the current level of tariffs on imports into the U.S. from China and other countries will stay in place for the remainder of the year.\nIn terms of our guidance, as we noted in our press release this morning, we are maintaining our full year comp sales growth, pretax profit margin and diluted earnings per share outlook. This guidance assumes that we can offset the significant incremental pressures we have seen and expect to see from tariffs on both our direct and indirect imports this year. We believe we can do this primarily through our buying process, our ability to adjust our ticket while maintaining our value gap and our ability to diversify our sourcing. Further, we are focused on cost efficiencies and productivity initiatives.\nNow to our detailed full year fiscal '26 guidance, which remains unchanged versus the previous full year guidance we gave in February. We expect overall comp sales to increase 2% to 3%. We're planning full year consolidated sales to be in the range of $58.1 billion to $58.6 billion, up 3% to 4%. With the volatility we've been seeing with foreign exchange rates, we are holding rates at the same level as our previous guidance. We are planning full year pretax profit margin to be in the range of 11.3% to 11.4%, down 10 to 20 basis points versus last year's 11.5%.\nMoving to gross margin. We expect it to be in the range of 30.4% to 30.5%, a 10 to 20 basis point decrease versus last year's 30.6%. We expect full year SG&A to be 19.3% versus last year's 19.4%. We're assuming net interest income of about $98 million, which we expect to delever fiscal '26 pretax profit margin by 20 basis points. Our full year guidance assumes a tax rate of 25.1% and weighted average share count of approximately 1.13 billion shares. Lastly, we expect full year diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.34 to $4.43. This would represent a 2% to 4% increase versus last year's diluted earnings per share of $4.26.\nMoving to the second quarter. We expect overall comp sales to increase 2% to 3%; consolidated sales to be in the range of $13.9 billion to $14 billion; pretax profit margin to be in the range of 10.4% to 10.5%, down 40 to 50 basis points versus last year's 10.9%; gross margin to be 30%. This would be a decrease of 40 basis points versus our last year. This includes incremental tariff costs on the directly sourced merchandise that we were committed to when the additional tariffs went into place in March and April, mostly offset by our mitigation efforts. We are also lapping a benefit from a true-up of a freight accrual last year.\nSG&A to be 19.7%, down 10 basis points versus last year. This is due to a benefit from lower incentive compensation accruals planned this year. We're also assuming net interest income of about $24 million, which we expect to delever second quarter pretax profit margin by 20 basis points. Our second quarter guidance also assumes a tax rate of 24% and a weighted average share count of approximately 1.13 billion shares. Based on these assumptions, we expect second quarter diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.97 to $1, up 1% to 4% versus last year's 96%.\nIn closing, I want to emphasize that we are in an excellent position to continue to invest in the growth of our company while simultaneously returning significant cash to our shareholders. Now we are happy to take your questions. [Operator Instructions]\nThanks, and now we'll open it up to questions.",

This was primarily due to lower freight costs, which includes a benefit from a true up of accruals and lower operational freight costs as well as stronger sales. These.\n\nThese benefits were partially offset by higher incentive compensation accruals and a contribution to the Foundation.\n\nGross margin was up 20 basis points versus last year. This increase was driven by strong mark on and a benefit from freight partially offset by higher supply chain costs.\n\nSG&A decreased 30 basis points versus last year. This decrease was primarily due to a benefit this year from lapping a reserve related to a German government Covid program receivable last year as well as expense favorability. These.\n\nThese benefits were partially offset by incremental store wage and payroll costs.\n\nLastly, we were very pleased that diluted earnings per share of 96 were up 13% versus last year and also well above our plan.\n\nNow to our second quarter Division performance again, this quarter across all of our divisions. The comp increases were entirely driven by customer transactions, which we see as a good indicator of the strength of the business.\n\nAt comp store sales increased 5% and segment profit margin was 14, 1% up 40 basis points versus last year.\n\napparel and home categories, both saw strong strong comp sales growth and we saw comp strength across all regions.\n\nWe were also happy with the strong sales performance of our U S e-commerce sites and Sierra stores, which we report as part of this division.\n\nWe're very pleased with the momentum at and continue to see numerous opportunities to keep growing our largest division.\n\nHomegoods comp store sales increased 2% segment profit margin grew to nine 1% up 40 basis points versus last year, we see home goods and home sense as highly differentiated from other retailers in the home fashion space, we focus everyday on bringing customers .\n\nassortments sourced around the world at exciting values, we continue to see significant opportunity to open new stores and capture additional traditional share of the U S home market.\n\nMoving to our international divisions.\n\nAt , Canada comp store sales were up.\n\nUp 2% segment profit margin on a constant currency basis was 15% down 70 basis points versus last year.\n\nAt International comp store sales increased 1% and were up in both Europe and Australia.\n\nSegment profit margin on a constant currency basis was four 3% up 230 basis points versus last year.\n\nWith our leadership position in decades of international operating experience. We are confident we will continue to be an attractive shopping destination for value seeking customers around the world.\n\nMoving to inventory balance sheet inventory and inventory on a per store basis were both down 2% and driven by lower inventory at our distribution centers, we feel great about our inventory levels and believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the outstanding availability, we're seeing in the .\n\nMarketplace and flow fresh assortments to our stores and online this fall and holiday season.\n\nAs to our capital allocation, we were pleased to generate another quarter of strong cash flow. While also reinvesting in the growth of our business and returning cash to shareholders through our buyback and dividend programs now ill turn it back to Ernie.\n\nThanks, John.\n\nNow I will highlight the opportunities we see that give us confidence that we can continue to drive sales and customer transactions in the second half of the year.\n\nFirst we are convinced that consumers will keep seeking value.\n\nWe believe our strategy of trading across a broad range of income and age demographics differentiates us from other retailers and remains a tremendous advantage.\n\nIm confident that our value proposition will continue to resonate with shoppers when they visit any one of our retail banners.\n\nSecond we feel great about our product category plans and have exciting initiatives planned for the fall and holiday selling seasons.\n\nFurther we have made our stores a year round shopping destination for gifts and believe we are becoming more top of mind with shoppers with our consumable offerings.\n\nWe believe that all of this will create an even more exciting shopping experience and encourage consumers to visit our stores more frequently.\n\nThird as I said earlier availability of quality branded merchandise is outstanding.\n\nI want to emphasize that we consistently have access to more goods than we could ever buy.\n\nOverall, I believe our vendor relationships are as good as ever.\n\nSome have been getting even stronger as vendors see us as an attractive way to grow their business.\n\nThis gives me great confidence that we can bring shoppers the right assortment at the right values throughout the remainder of the year and for many years to come.\n\nNext the flexibility of our buying and planning and allocation teams.\n\nAllows us to go after the hottest categories and trends that drive customer excitement.\n\nWith the flexibility of our supply chain.\n\nI am confident that we can merchandise each of our stores with a curated assortment of good better and best brands that will excite and inspire our shoppers.\n\nYes.\n\nLastly, we feel great about our marketing plans.\n\nOur campaigns will reinforce our value leadership and focus on capturing additional visits from our existing customers, attracting new shoppers and encouraging cross shopping of our.\n\nOur retail banners.\n\nAdditionally, we plan to showcase a wide selection of products to highlight that there is something for everyone.\n\nAnd demonstrate that our great values are available or available to every shopper everyday.\n\nFurther we plan to continue to represent a broad range of shoppers in our advertising and leverage a wide variety of media channels to target a wide customer base.\n\nAlso giving us confidence is that our customer surveys continue to tell us that our value perception and overall satisfaction scores remained strong.\n\nFurther each of our divisions continue to attract an outsized number of younger customers to our stores.\n\nWhich we believe bodes well for the future.\n\nOkay.\n\nBeyond this year I am confident that T. J X has significant opportunities to capture additional market share over the long term.\n\nLet me quickly reiterate why we believe we are so well positioned.\n\nFirst is our reputation as a value leader in the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia.\n\nSecond we believe we are the only global brick and mortar off price retailer, that's able to take brand fashion and quality and put it all together in a differentiated treasure hunt shopping experience for consumers across a wide demographic.\n\nWe also offer a wide fashion assortment, which we believe will appeal to a broad range of shoppers.\n\nThird all aspects of our business model are driven by flexibility, which allows us to constantly pivot to take advantage of market trends.\n\nNext we see the opportunity to grow our store base to nearly 6300 stores with our current retail banners in just our current geographies.\n\nAgain, I am extremely confident there will always be plenty of quality merchandise available to us to meet our store growth plans.\n\nLastly, I truly believe the depth of off price knowledge and expertise within T. J X is unmatched.\n\nWe are laser focused on teaching and training to develop the next generation of leaders.\n\nFinally, I am so proud of our company culture, which I believe.\n\nAs a strong contributor to our success and a major differentiator.\n\nNow moving to our investment in branch for less which we detailed in our press release as we continue to pursue our global growth vision.\n\nWe are excited for our plans to have a minority ownership position in a profitable off price retailer baked in Dubai.\n\nAs with our planned joint venture in Mexico, which we announced last quarter.\n\nThis investment represents another opportunity for our company to expand our global reach with an established off price retailer.\n\nIn addition to strong financial profile I have personally met with their management team and feel really good about our investment and the strong business. They have built to date.\n\nWe are always looking for ways to increase value for shareholders and we see this transaction as a good use of cash that we expect to be slightly accretive to earnings per share beginning in fiscal 'twenty six.\n\nMoving to corporate responsibility, we are looking forward to the annual release of our global corporate responsibility report this fall.\n\nOur teams have been hard at work on our corporate responsibility initiatives. For example in fiscal 2024, we helped to provide more than 2 million young people in our communities with access to educational opportunities.\n\nAdditionally, and supportive career development, we continue to create learning opportunities for our associates, including formal training classes online in person learning opportunities and formal mentoring and direct training.\n\nWe are also continuing to make progress against our global environmental sustainability goals.\n\nFurther we remain focused on our social compliance program and operating responsibly as a business.\n\nYou can read about our progress in our upcoming report.\n\nI am proud of the work our teams across the globe continue to do on corporate responsibility and I Hope you will take some time to learn more about what we are doing in this area.\n\nSumming up.\n\nWe are extremely pleased with our sales and profitability performance in the second quarter.\n\nThe third quarter is off to a strong start and we are excited about the initiatives. We have planned during the second half of the year.\n\nAs an off price leader in every country. We operate in we believe we are in an excellent position to take advantage of the market share opportunities, we see over the long term in those geographies.\n\nAdditionally.\n\nWant to reiterate that we will not be complacent and we remain laser focused on increasing the overall profitability of T. J Maxx.\n\nI truly believe we have one of the best retail models in the world with the best Associates in retail.\n\nGoing forward I have confidence that the flexibility of our business the talent of our associates and our relentless focus on value. We will continue to serve us well and allow us to navigate through the ever changing retail and economic landscapes.\n\nNow I'll turn the call back to John to cover our full year and third quarter guidance and then we'll open it up for questions.\n\nJeremy Thanks again Ernie.\n\nI'll start with our full year fiscal 'twenty five guidance, we now expect overall comp store sales to increase approximately 3%.\n\nWe are increasing our consolidated sales guidance to a range of 55 eight to $56 1 billion.\n\nThis change reflects the flow through of the stronger sales in Q2.\n\nWe're increasing our pre tax profit margin guidance to be approximately 11, 2%.\n\nThis would be up 30 basis points versus last year's adjusted 10, 9%.\n\nWe now expect gross margin to be approximately 32%, a 30 basis point increase versus last year's adjusted 29, 9%.\n\nWe expect this increase to be driven by a higher merchandise margin, which includes favorable mark on as well as a benefit from lower freight costs, partially offset by higher supply chain costs. We continue to plan shrink to be flat versus last year.\n\nWe continue to expect SG&A to be approximately 19, 3% flat versus last year's 19, 3%.\n\nWe're planning incremental store wage and payroll costs to be offset by lower incentive compensation costs and a benefit from items that negatively impacted us last year.\n\nWe're now assuming net interest income of about $160 million, which would have a neutral impact on our year over year pre tax profit margin.\n\nOur full year, our full year guidance assumes a tax rate of 25, 2%.\n\nOur weighted average share count of approximately 114 billion shares.\n\nAs a result of these assumptions, we now expect full year diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4 nine to $4 13.\n\nThis would represent an increase of 9% to 10% versus last year's adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3 76.\n\nIt is important to note that we are not flowing through the entire second quarter earnings per share beat of to the full year, because we're now planning higher incentive compensation accruals and higher freight expenses for the second half of the year versus our previous guidance.\n\nMoving to our third quarter guidance, we are expecting overall comp store sales growth to be up 2% to 3% consolidated sales to be in the range of 13, 9% to $14 billion.\n\nPre tax profit margin to be in the range of 11, 8% to 11, 9% down 10 to 20 basis points versus last year's 12%.\n\nGross margin to be in the range of 31, 1% to 31, 2%.\n\nThis would be flat to up 10 basis points versus last year.\n\nG&A to be approximately 19, 5% an increase of 10 basis points versus last year.\n\nNet interest income of about $34 million, which would delever third quarter fiscal 2025 pre tax profit margin by approximately 10 basis points.\n\nOur third quarter guidance also assumes a tax rate of 26% and a weighted average share count of approximately 114 billion shares.\n\nBased on these assumptions, we expect third quarter diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1 six to $1 eight up 3% to 5% versus last year's $1 three.\n\nLastly, our implied guidance for the fourth quarter assumes that overall comp store sales would be up 2% to 3% pretax profit margin will be in the range of 11% to 11, 1%.\n\nAnd earnings per share will be in the range of $1 14 to $1 16 per share.\n\nWhen comparing this implied guidance to last year's results. It is important to remember that last year, we had an extra week in the fiscal fourth quarter that benefited pre tax margin by 30 basis points and earnings per share by 10 cents.\n\nWe plan to provide more detailed guidance for the fourth quarter on our third quarter earnings call.\n\nIn closing we are confident in our full year plans and as always we will strive to beat them. We have a very strong balance sheet and continue that continues to allow us to invest in the growth of , while simultaneously returning significant cash to our shareholders now.\n\nNow we're happy to take your questions. As a reminder, please limit your questions to one per person. So we can answer as many questions as we can.\n\nThanks, and now we'll open it up for questions.\n\nThank you. Thank you I would like to ask a question. Please press star one.\n\nFirst question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nThank you. Good morning can you talk about AUR in the quarter the balance between categories.\n\nLike for like price increases and then also any changes you might be seeing in customer behavior around value.\n\nYes, so lorraine.\n\nGood talking to you AUR is Ben.\n\nPretty pretty consistent right John through the it has been yes, it didn't move much.\n\nI think.\n\nWent up a little slight it's slightly up yes.\n\nAnd obviously the comp was driven mostly by transactions right, because it's not up as much as the comp.\n\nThe balance in like for like goods, we're still continuing Lorraine youre getting at what are we doing as far as pricing on goods.\n\nWe still have been selectively throughout the business again bottom up we do not manage this top down.\n\nWe have been bottom up still.\n\nAdjusting retails, where appropriate I think if you look at our merchandize margin, though the story is becoming more and more about the buying back.\n\nNot not just the retailers and I think that's more of a combination of those things as well.\n\nEven though I'm sure you've been seeing all the time.\n\nAs inflation subsides.\n\nWe'll be and I'll get right to it I'm sure there'll be a question going with that in terms of AUR and the balance on the line items.\n\nWhat could happen in the market, if if retails come down on certain categories et cetera, we always and our merchants are excellent at this our retails are dictated by whats happening around us.\n\nThat's in the current and in the future what we predict so we're always retailing the goods.\n\nBased on the out the door a retailer that we see out the competition. So we feel as though we will have that coverage could that have retail come down too soon to say on which categories. A lot of those discussions by the way have been kind of grocery oriented and not necessarily marrying up with our business. So right now we haven't been seeing.\n\nAnything significant like that at all which is why our AUR is where John had just said slightly up.\n\nSo I think theres still exists opportunity as we move forward to address retail's internally based on more of a significant.\n\nBetween our retail and the out the door, which is still going to create opportunities. There having said that we're always extremely aware of what's going on around us we don't know the timing of when.\n\nThat could start to moderate a little but.\n\nI think we're in a really healthy position, especially when you go to point number three is the availability of goods is creating an unusual ability to buy goods.\n\nAnd retail goods extremely profitably.\n\nAs you can see from this quarter.\n\nThen as far as the customer.\n\nWe.\n\nWe see we see positive.\n\nPositive results from all of the income demographics, we look at and again that speaks to the good better best.\n\nProduct mix buying close to need so if if a certain customer category as is.\n\nAs is driving the comp we can easily go back and repurchase those goods and get them back into the store quickly so for us.\n\nIt's about making sure that we're appealing to all customer demographics, which this quarter. It appears we have.\n\nOne thing Lorraine and I know we have a.\n\nA lot of questions, we need to get to .\n\nYou're asking one that touches on so much.\n\nThe marketing if you noticed in my script I talked about our marketing how.\n\nAligning up with what John just said as far as how we treat the merchandise mix, which we've talked about for years I don't think ive given as much airtime. The fact that we market so appropriately to the good better best spectrum, ensuring that and I mentioned it in the script is that.\n\nWe are if you look at who we use in our marketing.\n\nWe're trying to more channels to apply to all again all age groups.\n\nWe try to go to all the different channels to evolve with where the consumer is going.\n\nWe have different media channels.\n\nEach brand's campaign has a differentiated in a broad broad invitational message really that expresses the benefits of our business model to every customer. So also in my script you heard heard me, saying, we want to sell everybody.\n\nEvery day and our marketing is lined up with that same is consistent with that strategy. So I'll just say, we haven't talked about the marketing as much but when you watch our spots, whether it's homegoods marshalls or Max or Crs is aimed at not being narrow. It is it is a wide wide audience that we're going after.\n\nThanks, so much.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Alex with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nPerfect.\n\nfor me just first on the Grupo OXXO.\n\nAnd then now that that's in our brands for line can you just elaborate a little bit more on the strategic rationale between those two and what that uniquely.\n\nAnd then just just honing in on the international business came in a little bit.\n\nAnd then consensus is expecting even though more of axiom capital.\n\nTom.\n\nI was wondering if you can talk about what youre seeing in the international business any additional color there would be super helpful. Thanks, a lot.\n\nYes, very much Alex.\n\nAgain, good questions group so.\n\nThese two opportunities here.\n\nHere's the big strategic.\n\nThing that we're trying to do here. So we have this great at a high level you can picture. This happening we have this great business model.\n\nAnd as I've also emphasized and everyone on the team knows that we have long tenured some of the best certainly in off price.\n\nOf course, I'm not objective, but I would say the best talent.\n\nIn retail and certainly in off price and what happens is we have a seasoned very seasoned management group that you get to a point we have some bench strength. So we're able to now more readily than we would have a number of years ago, where I would've been reticent to pull from the core business, we are able to take advantage.\n\nof expanding globally.\n\nIn EMEA that has really no risk.\n\nTo the core and at the same time takes advantage of additional geographies. So thats why youre seeing.\n\nWe really are realized and we're able to orchestrate. These from a couple of years ago. We started to say this is a good mission for us to take advantage of a great business model now that we have the talent where and John does this in his role in the finance World. We do it in every whether it's operations or merchandize, we want to make sure.\n\nIf we're going to give up a few people that we have the right replacement, So Mexico, obviously as a market.\n\nWe've looked at for a while and we know this business to be done there. We felt that was right to do it as a private.\n\nAs I'm, sorry, as a joint venture and that we also now have the talent to.\n\nWe have people get involved to do that.\n\nIt's a very appropriate one we own almost half the business.\n\ndid a little different but same idea where we can.\n\nTerrific by the way, we have really enjoyed our meetings with them. They are culturally very similar.\n\nThey are also.\n\nThey have a lot of retail experience a little younger in the off price side, but we have that secret sauce merchandising talent that now again back to the original point, we can afford to have people be involved to help them, which helps them and it helps our investment and so we're excited because.\n\nIn terms of going to new geographies and new markets with a model we have the talent now to do that under the big picture of the growth growing continuing to grow T. J X does that make sense or.\n\nYeah, that's great. Thank you.\n\nAnd then the other question was on the international.\n\nSergeant International do you want to say is I'm, John I'll jump in or enrolment.\n\nSo let me explain what we're seeing here so.\n\nObviously, you had a we're lapping the the German write off.\n\nThe receivable write off that we had last year.\n\nBut the other thing that's affecting us the other way is that last year. We also had a transactional FX gain that we're up against so.\n\nThat's what's driving the margin it's up.\n\nIt's up to 230 basis points versus last year, which we're we're pleased with given those two those two things.\n\nFrom a Alex from a sales perspective, we were a little disappointing.\n\n.\n\nIn our Europe business, specifically on the international piece and that was more from.\n\nA combination of the environment, a little bit of weather, but I would tell you. There was a decent size of that's our own execution and what's good with this company culturally in every division and we're in that team has really done a good job. We started talking about this two or three months ago.\n\nAnd we are already seeing the benefit.\n\nAnd the numbers over there.\n\nOver the last few weeks of the adjustments we've made in some of the merchandise mix and the way we have shipped the stores specifically in the UK I would tell you it was not really a Germany.\n\nThe issue is more of a U K issue and so we would we would tell you we were disappointed in the performance in Europe and Thats what was.\n\nAffecting that international number and specifically the U K, but we believe we're on the right path going forward.\n\nThanks, a lot good luck.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Boss with Jpmorgan. Your line is open.\n\nThanks, and congrats on another nice quarter.\n\nThank you. Thank you.\n\nSo Ernie could you speak to the cadence of same store sales that you saw during the second quarter.\n\nMaybe elaborate on recent trends supporting the strong start that you cited for the third quarter and just maybe what youre seeing across categories or divisions, and if you see this as a positive lead indicator for holiday.\n\nYes, great.\n\nGreat.\n\nPart three.\n\nNancy.\n\nSorry, good Matt.\n\nYes, Matt I should start off John we'll start with the case, obviously, we saw positive comps across all of our divisions. The other important thing to note is that on a two year stack basis, we did see an improvement each month of the quarter.\n\nWhich is also important to note.\n\nAnd and and then dovetailing into that Youre asking about the strong start to Q2 with whats been nice about that is we're happy.\n\nWith our strong start to Q2 on the sales line and it seems to be.\n\nHealthy across the board so that is something that we're feeling good about and do we think that is.\n\nOf course first of all Q3 is for many retailers that have an apparel.\n\nComponent to their business can often be with the transition of .\n\nComing out of spring summer goods and going into the fall goods can be a little treacherous.\n\nYou have weather dependency et cetera, we have strategies, we try to mitigate that as well as the way we plan and shipped by regions within the United States.\n\nNot as much of an issue in Canada and Europe.\n\nBut our team's planning and allocation and buying have done a great job I think on buying in the right transitional goods. So we feel really this is another indicator on mentioning that makes us feel good about where we're heading in and in the apparel lines of the business.\n\nAs we head into Q3 in addition to what we've been seeing in sales for the last couple of weeks.\n\nWe started the quarter.\n\nAnd then last thing I'll say, which I did mentioned in the script.\n\nAlso John and I talk about this all the time is since we have year after year, our store experience as you know has gotten better and better with that our merchandise mix good better best but a lot of more giftable brands that we carry.\n\nThink bodes well because we're always more gift to.\n\nTo a wider range of customers year after year I feel as though we improve on that year after year and so I am bullish on Q4 upside.\n\nBecause my first comments were really oriented to the Q3 Q4, I believe we're going to be well positioned for gift, giving across many of the families of business in the store.\n\nJust to add onto that.\n\nOur strategy with consumables in the stores.\n\nDefinitely it gives customers a reason to shop, if the weather is not compliant.\n\nAnd that goes both with the apparel businesses in the home businesses.\n\nThat's great color best of luck.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Paul with Citigroup. Your line is open.\n\nThanks, guys.\n\nTalk a little bit more about.\n\nWhom within the business I think you said boat, where we're up but I'm curious how the home business within more mass perform relative to home goods and the drivers a little bit.\n\nYes.\n\nYes.\n\nDifferent at all and then just.\n\nOr is it very high level.\n\nWhat surprised you the most.\n\nFirst half of the year and how that might influence how you are thinking about the second half.\n\nOkay.\n\nIll, let some so on the part about the home versus the apparel.\n\nThis won't be really a surprise when you think about it so the home really outpace I'm not going to give you the exact numbers, but outpaced the homegoods home.\n\nLarge really what he is somewhat up to I would sum it up to like Big Big ticket that we stand for at Homegoods as an industry as you know furniture.\n\nAnd that business industry wide is slower and also that would apply and home goods.\n\nSo their business, even though the slightly outpaced it wasn't by a lot.\n\nAnd but that was the driver of the difference.\n\nHappy with.\n\nThe way I can specifically say very happy with.\n\nThe continued improvement in home goods across the store and where we're seeing homegoods going.\n\nFor the start of Q3.\n\nJohn did you have yes, I would just add that we see departments that line up between and home goods, we saw similar very similar trends.\n\n.\n\nThat's a good point it was really when you get to the big ticket that made the difference.\n\nYour other question Paul is about that I want to make sure I got this right was that on the any surprises in the first half.\n\nIs that way.\n\nYes.\n\nHow does that impact the way, we look at the back half.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nAnd how does that improve back thank you.\n\nYeah, I guess the only.\n\nThe surprise a little bit of a surprise to us as we know there is always going to be a lot of availability of goods and.\n\nThe amount of tough environment surprised us is even a little and I think I alluded to this.\n\nTheres, even more we're a little surprised by the amount of goods that is off the charts, even a little bit more than we would've.\n\nThought so that's caught us so how does that affect your back half. So what we do is we look at what categories is there even a.\n\nBeyond the normal phenomenon all about whatever the word we always use different words about of availability and we actually what that effects how we.\n\nHow much we leave open in those categories core and more of the closeout hand to mouth buying in the back half and so as you can imagine it had us for the back half and even through Q1 to leave more liquidity because clearly.\n\n.\n\nThere is no lack of availability if anything it surprised us on the amount of increased availability.\n\nSo.\n\nThat's probably the biggest.\n\nSurprise.\n\nThank you good luck.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nHi, Good morning. Thank you for taking my question My question's on margin can you elaborate on your view for further margin expansion opportunity on a multiyear basis and then on near term trends can you speak to what's changed in your freight forecast versus your prior thinking and any other puts and takes that we should be thinking through on supply chain.\n\nIn merchandize margin into the back half of the year.\n\nYes.\n\nSure to start or you want me to start with I can start with the , yes, yes.\n\nThe freight forecast that we're seeing so.\n\nWe did add some expense to our forecast in the back half of the year or two.\n\nTwo.\n\nTake care of some additional ocean freight increases that we're seeing we're seeing ocean freight.\n\nPer container arise. So we did we did take that step to add something in our forecast there.\n\nOn.\n\nBrooklyn, looking looking forward to it.\n\nI think you are asking.\n\nMark do we see margin opportunities is at it.\n\nAs we look out yes.\n\nYes.\n\nSure.\n\nYeah, Okay. So.\n\nWell that's.\n\nWhen you say are you talking merchandize margin.\n\nSure we can talk merchandize margin.\n\nOkay.\n\nI mean, the bottom bottom line margin.\n\nWith what we've said in the fall right at the bottom line.\n\nOn a on a three to four comp we could be flat to up 10 basis points again, assuming no outsized expense headwinds.\n\nThat message is still consistent.\n\nObviously this year, we have raised that now where our margin for the year is going up.\n\nFrom where we plan for a lot of reasons, but one of the reasons I think if I go to the merchandize margin, which.\n\nWe are starting to talk about is the situation of all these the stars keep aligning with our opportunities and gaining market share, we mean more to vendors than ever before our relationships.\n\nShould continue to bode well in terms of us continuing to buy goods.\n\nMore favorably as we move forward.\n\nAnother place, where I think our merchandize margins have upside as we are the way we manage our flow every division has gotten continues to get even better. This is why in the last couple of which helps our markdowns and our merchandize margin directly when you put the right goods into the right.\n\nClusters of stores, you, obviously end up with a reduced markdown rate in an increased sales because youre are planning systems over the last couple of years and are planning our associates are getting better and better at this and other place in , specifically and in home goods domestically.\n\nWe are able to now tailor the mix and we've done a better job at putting together sunbelt strategies in different regions strategies across the different climate zones in the United States, which also has a huge benefit to our merchandize margin.\n\nI think what we're going to also see is when you. When you look at total margin we've talked about this before is our Europe business.\n\nJohn and I have talked about this for a few years now we're seeing that.\n\nOur goal layers to get to an 8% bottom line versus where we were and we're doing that in pretty short order over a few years and I think that is also going to bode well for the obviously that's going to help our total T J X margin.\n\nAnd then we still see in different markets.\n\nCanada is obviously continuing to be very profitable, but I think we're going to see our home business, specifically, which is big throughout T. J X.\n\nWe're feeling good about the margin opportunities there beyond just the freight savings because of our fashion component, where we are able to still provide great value. Our sourcing is excellent and we can still value and make good margins at our business. So as that business continues to grow.\n\nJust failing big upside and excited about the opportunities for year after year on the margin side great questions.\n\nThanks, So much I'll pass it on.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Adrian with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nGreat. Thank you very much and let me add my congratulations well done.\n\nArnie. Thank you Adrian question.\n\nYoure welcome.\n\nThe first question is can you talk about for the macro consumer health backdrop today versus when we were at the last quarterly call in both the U S. Canada, and then Europe obviously.\n\nOverall sentiment is the consumer backdrop has worsened.\n\nObviously your model is prepared for that.\n\nNumber one and then John can you just talk about where are those store payroll investments Sterling when do you expect to get in terms of the return in the hours.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nAdrian Great.\n\nQuick question on the landscape and what's happening to kind of get at where the trends could be going the macro health situations. It does vary I think by country also a little bit we see.\n\nI would say the U S versus in the first quarter as similar macro environment lease for us for our experience.\n\nI know everything you read is we always wait we have some of the same information that you have so we wait for a lot of reports that come out to kind of adjust all all I know is the availability.\n\nIt seems to keep growing which makes me wonder if certainly at our supply of the brands that we deal with are they running into a little tougher.\n\nSituations, so that could be again tough for me to answer that versus just a quarter ago. We also don't tend to see the movement by quarter. It teams seems to be over six months or 12 months.\n\nCanada pretty challenging out there Europe more challenging I would say both are challenging environments from maybe six months ago.\n\nThe difference in our on our comps there.\n\nAs we've had we've had weather in both those areas, Canada was hit with some weather situations can do a little better than Europe and is up against tougher numbers Europe I would say again.\n\nOur performance probably had half of that was due to our own execution, which.\n\nNot that we like it but we like it because we can we can adjust that and we know what to do in a you've followed us for years, you know that whenever we identify execution issues, we address it and that team has been great and they already have.\n\nReally addressed a lot of the things that we think we could improve on which is why we're already seeing that improvement as we start.\n\nQ3, I would say the environment there is challenging though.\n\nEconomically and.\n\nIn Europe. So I can understand why you would ask the question and probably a little bit more. So then again six months ago. John did you want to talk about so on the wage we continue to see wage.\n\nIncreases across all of our geographies.\n\nYoull remember, we talked I think on the first quarter call.\n\nEurope announced a or excuse me.\n\nUK announced a 10% increase in wage we've seen.\n\nSome of the provinces I think most recently, Ontario announced a minimum wage increase and of course.\n\nWe've seen that as well in the U S.\n\nOur strategy is still holds that.\n\nWe are increasing obviously, where the legislative increases.\n\nHave gone, but also where we have competitive.\n\nReasons to increase our wage we also keep something in our budget for that as well so if we see.\n\nEither higher attrition rates or.\n\nSome challenges hiring we have the ability to go in pointedly and increased wages.\n\nYes.\n\nVery helpful Best of luck for back to school holiday.\n\nThanks, Thank you Adrian.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Michael Binetti with Evercore. Your line is open.\n\nCongrats on a great quarter.\n\nThank you you mentioned.\n\nYou mentioned earlier, the two year stacks accelerating through I was kind of wondering looking at the model here Homegoods has very tough compares coming up in the third quarter in the back half I guess is there is there a scenario where the 2% to 3% total company comp for third quarter allows for a negative comp in home goods like the stacks might imply just against that big plus nine.\n\nA year ago, and then on the margins you spoke a little bit about flow through and the normal framework.\n\nThree to four comp and flat to 10 basis points of.\n\nLeverage you've been outpacing that for a while.\n\nIs there anything on the horizon that would cause that to slow back down to the normal framework, we should think about.\n\nWell, so two things I'll jump on the Homegoods. So yes, we don't we don't feel Homegoods would run a negative.\n\nI would anticipate we're not anticipating that so good question that is not what we would be planning yes.\n\nOn the margin. So obviously, we've been pretty consistent about the three to four comp being flat to up 10 basis points.\n\nBut what we saw in this year is that we had a number of onetime items that allowed us this year to leverage.\n\nOn a two to three versus that three to four and Thats really the reason.\n\nOkay is it does that change as you look out.\n\nNext year or is it the same framework.\n\nNext year.\n\nI would place it.\n\n.\n\nAgain that model of a three to four comp being flat to up 10 basis points. At this point is what we would be would be consistent with we're not giving F.\n\nFY 'twenty six guidance just yet.\n\nBut that's what.\n\nThat's what we've said and that's what still holds.\n\nOkay, guys best of luck into the holidays. Thank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nOkay.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Mark.\n\nMark with Baird. Your line is open.\n\nGood morning, Thank you for taking my question.\n\nMaybe first for Ernie I was hoping to get some perspective on the market share gains mix comps, obviously compare very nicely to what we've seen.\n\nThe Department store channel and others, thus far but at the same time, we are seeing some of the mass retailers reports.\n\nResults in general merchandise, including some more positive commentary on apparel. So could you just speak to how you're protecting your flank. When it comes to some of the mass discounters that are also competing for that trade down consumer.\n\nYes, Great question, Mark we've been by the way to your point, we've been looking at the same numbers. We track all of this as we as we continue to monitor our market share gains and by the way we as best we can some some countries that werent don't have but in the U S. As you just.\n\nStated, there's a lot of good information out there. So we track while when you look at the total so first thing. We do is we look at the total with new stores and you can see clearly we're gaining market share in total now as to where it is.\n\nWe have some information that shows in the apparel and home that would say were picking up market share in both.\n\nIt depends on how you slice off some of the discounters that have home in it.\n\nBecause if they're not if they have general home and you throw all of the families of business in there. It can look at one number but if it's more home furnishings, driven which is what we are.\n\nWith some.\n\nOther things that make it a little fuzzy for example, we have a pet business in our home area we have.\n\nA lot of consumables that John talked about like the gourmet food that we carry where does not thats in our home business, writing cards reading cards wearing paper wrap.\n\nRap, whereas that in those businesses, so that's where it gets really funky.\n\nSo as best we can in some of the reports that are written in your industry.\n\nOn the sell side will show us that where it will show that we're picking up home business clearly against the direct competition.\n\nBut I do like your wording on protecting your flank because what we look for is any sign of in total on those groups that we look at for competition are they getting close are there promotional retails are we feeling.\n\nThat their sales comp sales are any healthier than ours, where right now we haven't seen it and we're clearly gaining market share in home as well.\n\nBut to your point, we're always trying to protect our flank by being aware of where they are and then one of the things our merchants do is who average doing better business when their business, we shop them very aggressively to look at our values and the categories from a fashion perspective that they carry.\n\nshould we have more of it are we selling it shall we be retailing it differently because again, our first priority has to offer.\n\nValue thats better than everyone else around us.\n\nSo that's kind of all of that goes into kind of protecting the flag so to speak.\n\nLove the terminology we use.\n\nI guess just being on top of it every day.\n\nThank you.\n\nYes. Thank you.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Cory with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Good morning, Ernie I was wondering if I could one perspective on opening price point. So other retailers have talked about cutting prices.\n\nAlso highlighted more promotions.\n\nAnd you also I think mentioned in your prepared remarks that.\n\nYoure seeing I think flattish ticket, maybe it has a little bit of a plus sign on it how do you think about the trajectory for AUR and opening price points going forward within the context of the.\n\nA broader environment.\n\nYes, great Great question Corey.\n\nStart with that we won't top down manage it so which is why were always reluctant on a top down average ticket.\n\nAverage unit retail, giving a projection too far out because we can.\n\nSometimes the market moves fast we go after oftentimes and John off it talks about this it's the mix of our departments. So we could have.\n\nIn accessories area, our gourmet food area, that's at a low ticket, but we're driving sales are hot there.\n\nJust by the fact that we're going to drive that a little disproportionately than something else that could lower our ticket temporarily normally see units go up when we see right. We see the units in the basket go out right right. So.\n\nBut on opening price point, specifically, which is at the beginning we.\n\nSo.\n\nAnd if you look at what we've talked about really more in depth. The last few calls and meetings. We've had is we believe strongly in having opening price point goods, ensuring they're at the right value. But this is why we are all over having a balanced good better best.\n\nMix throughout all of our brands and banners in all of our markets. So we are always passionate about opening price point.\n\nGoods in balance, though and we're always up against there being balanced which is why youre not seeing our ticket move around that much because as much as we're passionate about we have it in ratio to our better brands and better retails and our best brands and that Hasnt moved a lot.\n\n.\n\nAgain, we don't top down tell the merchants that we let nature take its course level. The only thing we insist on is that every merchant have a balanced mix of good better best and we let that fluctuate a little bit, but we never get away from it. So I hope that answers that opening price point question.\n\nCutting prices.\n\nAgain that back to the original thing at the beginning of this call is we don't we don't cut.\n\nWe did cut prices when we see the price on an item is coming down around us because we're going to ensure that our value was proportionately significantly better going out the door than their out the door.\n\nBut that's when we would cut the price or we cut the price if we're not selling something.\n\nAs well, regardless of what's happening around because that happens as well and we do that through the markdown process right.\n\nWhich is very.\n\nAutomated and the merchants initiate and we.\n\nWe continue to slash, we can take a markdown we can take a price adjustment, where we just adjusted to what we think is the new REIT retail.\n\nAgain, remember, we will never ever be undersold. So.\n\nBut that's what drives us cutting prices one when we do cut prices.\n\nHope that answers that.\n\nYes welcome.\n\nThank you. Our final question comes from Jay sole with UBS you May proceed.\n\nGreat. Thank you so much I just wanted to ask another one more question about brands with us or are you talking about the strategic rationale can you just help us understand sort of the financial rationale why to get 35% stake why not more why not less.\n\nVery good.\n\n.\n\nYes.\n\nWell some of that John and I will both jump in on this but.\n\nSo these that goes yes, I wont get into specifics, but sometimes when you start with these negotiations one site.\n\nOne.\n\nOne site could be looking for a couple of investors and they actually might be looking for us to be less of an investor than 35.\n\nSometimes after you start exploring you see a good number sometimes.",
    "content2": "I would say, it's kind of a meeting of the minds to sum it up that we don't always.\n\nYou have to come out with their proportional amount that the . The owners that are great and us where we all feel we're at the right level and there isn't there isn't as much I mean, there is some science, but then there is a bit of the.\n\nQualitative discussion about how much we think they want us to own how much. We think we should note and we ended up in what we thought was a sweet spot given their feelings at our failings, John they weren't looking for a complete buyout right.\n\nThey were looking for a minority investor they weren't looking for a 50% rate Ethernet that are 35%. It gives us enough skin in the game that it makes us it makes it worthwhile.\n\nYup.\n\nAnd Jay what is need about it though at the same time, the 35% the way it works with us it stays a very it's a healthy investment as you can see based on the number that we put in.\n\nWe believe it's accretive in a couple of years.\n\nNext last year next year, and if we plan to add the value that we think we can we still have a DC we own 35%. So if it grows like we think it can.\n\nAnd we at our secret sauce, so to speak in terms of the buying in.\n\nAnd they are excellent at they really want to collaborate and we're very impressed with what they've done I think it's a great marriage.\n\nYet they didn't they didn't want a buyout and we wanted to own a decent chunk. So you end up kind of in that Middle zone.\n\nMakes sense all right. Thank you so much.\n\nYou're welcome Jay that.\n\nThat was our last call.\n\nI would like to thank you all for joining US today, we look forward to updating you again on our third quarter earnings call in November.\n\nTake care everybody.\n\nLadies and gentlemen that concludes your conference call for today you may all disconnect. Thank you for participating."

Welcome to the TJX Companies First Quarter Fiscal 2025 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, May 22, 2024. The I would like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Ernie Herrman, Chief Executive Officer and President of TJX Companies, Inc. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nErnie L. Herrman\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The TJX Cos., Inc.\n\nThanks, Cordi. Before we begin, Deb has some opening comments.\n\nDebra McConnell\n\nSenior Vice President of Global Communications\n\nThank you, Ernie, and good morning. Today's call is being recorded and includes forward-looking statements about our results and plans. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to vary materially from these statements, including, among others, the factors identified in our filings with the SEC.\nPlease review our press release for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements as well as the full safe harbor statements included in the Investors section of our website, tjx.com. We have also detailed the impact of foreign exchange on our consolidated results and our international divisions in today's press release and in the Investors section of tjx.com along with reconciliations to non-GAAP measures we discuss.\nThank you. And now I'll turn it back over to Ernie.\n\nErnie L. Herrman\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The TJX Cos., Inc.\n\nGood morning. Joining me and Deb on the call is John. I want to start by thanking all of our global associates for their ongoing commitment to TJX and for delivering great value to our customers. I especially want to recognize the hard work of our store distribution and fulfillment center associates across the company. Now to our business update and first quarter results.\nI am very pleased with our first quarter performance. Overall, comp store sales were up 3%, which was at the high end of our plan. Again, this quarter, the comp increase was entirely driven by customer transactions. We see this as an excellent indicator of the strength of our business. As to first quarter profitability, both pretax profit margin and earnings per share came in well above our plans, which was terrific to see.\nJohn will talk to the drivers of this profit outperformance in a moment. Our first quarter results are a testament to the sharp execution of our teams who focused on offering our shoppers excellent value on every item every day. Our results also highlight the benefits of our flexible business model. Throughout the quarter, we flexed our store assortments and leaned into categories that many consumers were looking for.\nFurther, we remain disciplined in managing our buying, inventory and expenses and remain focused on driving profitability. Looking ahead, our value leadership in retail gives us great confidence in TJX. The second quarter is off to a good start, and we are excited about the opportunities we see for our business. We are very happy with our inventory levels and are in great position to capitalize on the outstanding buying opportunities that we see in the marketplace.\nWe plan to flow fresh assortments to our stores and online, the spring and summer and throughout the year. Longer term, we remain convinced that we are well positioned to grow our global footprint, gain market share in our geographies around the world and increase the profitability of TJX. Before I continue, I'll turn the call over to John to cover our first quarter results in more detail.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Ernie. I also want to add my gratitude to all of our global associates for their continued hard work. Now I'll share some additional details on the first quarter versus last year. As Ernie mentioned, our consolidated comp was at the high end of our plan and entirely driven by customer transactions. Comps in both our apparel and home categories increased with home outperforming apparel. Pretax profit margin was 11.1%, was up 80 basis points.\nThis was 50 basis points above our plan, primarily due to a larger-than-expected benefit from lower freight costs, a reserve release and higher net interest income. Gross margin was up 110 basis points. This was driven by a benefit from lower freight costs and favorable mark-on, partially offset by the timing of capitalized inventory cost and supply chain investments. SG&A increased 20 basis points due to incremental store wage and payroll costs, partially offset by the reserve release.\nNet interest income benefited pretax profit margin by 10 basis points. Lastly, we were very pleased that diluted earnings per share were up 22%. This was well above our plan due to our pretax profitability outperformance and a lower-than-expected tax rate that benefited first quarter diluted earnings per share by $0.03. Now to our first quarter divisional performance. Across all our divisions, our comp increases were entirely driven by customer transactions, which again is such a great indicator of the strength of our value proposition.\nAt Marmaxx, comp store sales increased 2% and segment profit margin was 14.2%, up 20 basis points. Despite some periods of unfavorable weather, both Marmaxx's apparel and home categories saw positive comp store sales with home outperforming apparel. Further, we were very pleased to see comp sales increases at stores in demographic areas with average household incomes above and below $100,000.\nAt our U.S. e-commerce sites and at Sierra, which we report as part of this division, we were happy with their strong sales performance. HomeGoods comp store sales increased 4% and segment profit margin grew significantly to 9.5%. This was a 220 basis point improvement versus last year. HomeGoods and HomeSense offer customers a differentiated shopping experience for home fashions.\nOur buyers source products from around the world to bring customers eclectic selections and affordable ways to upgrade their home decor. Moving to our international divisions. At TJX Canada, comp store sales were up 4% and segment profit margin on a constant currency basis was 12.4%, up 110 basis points. At TJX International, comp store sales increased 2% and were up in both Europe and Australia. Segment profit margin on a constant currency basis improved significantly to 3.9%, up 120 basis points.\nWe believe we are performing better than most other major retailers in Canada and Europe. We are confident we will continue to be a leading shopping destination for value-seeking customers in Canada, Europe and Australia. Moving to inventory. Balance sheet inventory was down 3% versus the first quarter of last year. Inventory on a per-store basis was down 5% and driven by the lower inventory at our distribution centers.\nImportantly, in-store inventory was in line with last year's levels. We feel great about our inventory levels and are in a great position to take advantage of the outstanding availability we are seeing in the marketplace. As to our capital allocation, we were very pleased to start another year generating strong cash flow, reinvesting in the growth of our business and returning cash to shareholders through our buyback and dividend programs. Now I'll return it back to Ernie.\n\nErnie L. Herrman\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The TJX Cos., Inc.\n\nThanks, John. I'd like to highlight the reasons we have great confidence in the near- and long-term growth opportunities for TJX. We have a long track record of success through many kinds of retail and macro environments, and our value proposition has always served us well. Our off-price business model is extremely flexible and resilient and I believe we are set up for a long runway of exciting growth in our geographies around the world.\nFirst is our wide customer demographic reach. We want to sell everyone. With our flexibility and opportunistic buying, we offer expansive assortments of good, better and best merchandise for shoppers across a broad range of income and age groups. We continue to attract new Gen Z and millennial shoppers to our stores, which we believe bodes well for our future growth. It's really great when we see multiple generations shopping our stores together.\nSecond, we are convinced that significant market share opportunities remain across the U.S., Canada, Europe and Australia. Over the long term, we see potential to further expand our store footprint by at least another 1,300-plus stores with our current retail banners in our existing countries alone. Third, with our more than 1,300 global buyers sourcing from a universe of more than 21,000 vendors and from over 100 countries, we are confident that there will be plenty of quality branded merchandise available to us to support our growth plans.\nThroughout our history, availability of inventory has never been an issue. In fact, in recent years, we have seen availability become even better as vendors look for additional ways to grow their businesses. We've opened thousands of new vendors, which keeps our store assortment fresh and fuels the differentiated treasure hunt shopping experience for our customers.\nOur stores receive multiple deliveries each week of fresh branded merchandise to surprise and excite our customers. With our rapidly changing assortment, shoppers are inspired to visit us frequently to see what's new. Lastly and most importantly, are the talented associates who do an exceptional job executing on our initiatives.\nI truly believe the level of off-price knowledge and expertise within our organization is unmatched. We have a highly differentiated global business, and we have developed the specialized talent and teams to support it. We have many leaders across TJX with decades of off-price experience. Additionally, we focus on developing newer associates and the next generation of leaders within our organization.\nWe take great pride in our TJX University and other training programs. Our very deep bench gives us the ability to rotate talent between divisions and geographies and to deploy teams where needed. All of this strengthens our company as we pursue our goals for growth and is a tremendous advantage for TJX. I am also very proud of our culture, which I believe is another key differentiator and a major component of our success.\nFor our corporate responsibility update, I'll share more about our culture, which includes supporting our associates and making TJX a terrific place to work. Our associates bring our business to life and we strive to foster workplace where they feel welcome, valued and engaged. A key priority is helping our associates grow and develop at TJX, which we support both through formal and informal training.\nOur associate resource groups, or ARGs, and our inclusion and diversity committees have played an important role in creating an inclusive workplace. Within the last year, both the number of ARGs and the number of associates participating in them have continued to grow. As always, you can read more about our corporate responsibility work on tjx.com.\nSumming up, we are very pleased with the overall performance of TJX in the first quarter and that the second quarter is off to a good start. We feel great about our positioning in today's consumer environment and we'll continue to emphasize our value proposition to consumers through our marketing initiatives. Longer term, I am confident that the characteristics of our business set us up extremely well to capitalize on the market share opportunities that we see out there.\nLastly, I want to reiterate that we will not be complacent and are committed to looking at ways to further increase the profitability of TJX over the long term. Now I'll turn the call back to John to cover our full year and second quarter guidance, and then we'll open it up for questions.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks again, Ernie. I'll start with our full year fiscal '25 guidance. We're now planning consolidated sales to be in the range of $55.5 billion to $55.9 billion. This is about $200 million lower than our previous guidance due to the impact of foreign exchange. We continue to expect overall comp store sales to increase 2% to 3%. We're increasing our pretax profit margin guidance to a range of 11% to 11.1%.\nThis would be up 10 to 20 basis points versus last year's adjusted 10.9%. We continue to expect gross margin to be in the range of 30% to 30.1%, a 10 to 20 basis point increase versus last year's adjusted to 29.9%. We expect this increase to be driven by a higher merchandise margin, which includes a small benefit from freight, partially offset by our supply chain investments, we continue to plan shrink to be flat versus last year.\nWe continue to expect SG&A to be approximately 19.3%, flat to last year's adjusted SG&A. We're planning incremental store wage and payroll costs to be offset by lower incentive compensation costs and a benefit from items that negatively impacted us last year. We're now assuming net interest income of about $156 million, which will have a neutral impact on our year-over-year pretax profit margin.\nOur full year guidance assumes a tax rate of 25.4% and a weighted average share count of approximately 1.14 billion shares. As a result of all these assumptions, we now expect full year diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.03 to $4.09. And we would represent -- this would represent an increase of 7% to 9% versus last year's adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.76.\nMoving to our second quarter guidance. We're expecting overall comp store sales to be up 2% to 3%, consolidated sales to be in the range of $13.2 billion to $13.3 billion pretax profit margin to be in the range of 10.4% to 10.5%, flat to up 10 basis points versus last year. Gross margin to be approximately 29.8%. This would be a decrease of 40 basis points versus last year. This is primarily due to the lapping of a significant freight accrual benefit last year in supply chain investments, partially offset by an increase in merchandise margin.\nSG&A to be approximately 19.6%, a decrease of 50 basis points versus last year. This is primarily due to a benefit from lapping higher incentive accruals and a reserve related to the write-off of a German COVID program receivable last year. Partially offset by incremental store wage and payroll costs.\nOur second quarter guidance also assumes net interest income of about $42 million, a tax rate of 26.3% and a weighted average share count of approximately 1.14 billion shares. Based on these assumptions, we're expecting second quarter diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.88 to $0.90, up 4% to 6% versus last year's $0.85.\nLastly, our implied guidance for the second half of the year assumes that overall comp store sales will be up 2% to 3%. Pretax profit margin will be in the range of 11.3% to 11.5% and earnings per share will be in the range of $2.22 to $2.26. In closing, I want to emphasize that we are in an excellent financial position to continue to invest in the growth of our company while simultaneously returning significant cash to our shareholders.\nNow we are happy to take your questions. As a reminder, please limit your questions to one per person so we can answer as many questions as we can. Thanks, and now we'll open it up to questions.",

Welcome to The TJX Companies Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded as of today, February 28, 2024.\nI would now like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Ernie Herrman, Chief Executive Officer and President of The TJX Companies, Inc.

I especially want to thank our store, distribution and fulfillment center associates for their hard work and dedication to our company every day.\nNow to an overview of our results beginning with the fourth quarter. I am extremely pleased with our very strong finish to 2023. Our fourth quarter sales profitability and earnings per share all exceeded our expectations. Overall comp sales were up a strong 5% and were entirely driven by growth in customer transactions. This is great to see as it underscores our ability to continue gaining market share in all of our geographies.\nI am particularly pleased that our U.S. businesses, Marmaxx and HomeGoods, continued their very strong sales momentum. Also, it was great to see comp sales growth accelerate versus the third quarter at our Canadian and international divisions. We are confident that our exciting assortments and excellent values resonated with shoppers across all of our retail banners this holiday season. We believe our gift-giving selections offer customers something for everyone on their list, and we see being a gift-giving destination as a year-round opportunity for our business.\nFor the full year, overall sales surpassed $50 billion, marking a milestone for our company. Even more exciting, we still see plenty of opportunities to continue our growth in our markets around the world. For the full year, consolidated comp sales increased 5%. Profitability increased significantly and earnings per share grew double digits, all well above our initial guidance for the year.\nImportantly, we saw comp sales growth across each of our divisions, again, all driven by increases in customer transactions. We are confident that we gain market share in every geography that we operate in. Our outstanding performance in 2023 is a testament to the sharp execution of our talented associates around the world and their relentless focus on delivering excellent value to our customers every day.\nLooking ahead, the first quarter is off to a good start. In 2024, we have many initiatives planned that we believe will keep driving sales and to attract more shoppers to our stores. Availability of quality branded merchandise in the marketplace continues to be outstanding. We are in a terrific position to continue flowing a fresh assortment of goods to our stores and online this spring and throughout the year.\nLonger term, we see many opportunities to capture additional market share across our geographies, and we are laser focused on increasing the profitability of TJX. We are convinced that our flexibility and commitment to value will continue to be a winning retail formula for many years to come. Before I continue, I'll turn the call over to John to cover our fourth quarter and full year financial results in more detail.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Ernie. I also want to add my gratitude to all of our global associates for their continued hard work. Now I'll share some additional details on the fourth quarter. As I recap the fourth quarter results, I'm going to speak to everything on a 13-week basis, which excludes the extra week in the quarter. Reconciliations detailing the impact of the extra week on our results and other adjustments can be found in today's press release and on the Investors section of our website.\nAdjusted net sales grew to $15.5 billion, a 7% increase versus last year. As Ernie mentioned, consolidated comp store sales increased 5%, above the high end of our plan and were entirely driven by an increase in customer transactions. A quick note that on prior calls, we have referred to customer transactions as customer traffic. But for the sake of clarity, we'll use the term customer transactions going forward.\nBack to the results. In the fourth quarter, our consolidated comp sales increased in both our apparel and home businesses. In terms of divisional sales performance for the fourth quarter, we were pleased to see strong comp sales increases at every division, all driven entirely by customer transactions. At Marmaxx, I also note that we saw comp increases in both our apparel and home categories.\nFourth quarter adjusted pretax profit margin of 10.9% was up 170 basis points versus last year. Our adjusted pretax profit margin came in well above our plan primarily due to a higher merchandise margin. This includes a larger-than-expected benefit from shrink and freight, lower markdowns and better mark on. We also saw some expense leverage on our above-plan sales.\nAdjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was up 340 basis points versus last year. This was driven by a higher merchandise margin, including a significant benefit from lower freight costs and shrink strong mark-on and lower markdowns. Fourth quarter adjusted SG&A increased 190 basis points versus last year, primarily due to higher incentive accruals and incremental store wage and payroll costs.\nAdjusted net interest income benefited fourth quarter adjusted pretax profit margin by 10 basis points versus last year. Lastly, we were very pleased that adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.12 were well above our expectations and up 26% versus last year.\nNow to our fiscal '24 results. Once again, for the full -- for our full year financial results, I'm going to speak to everything on a 52-week basis, which excludes the extra week in the fiscal year. Adjusted net sales grew to $53.3 billion, a 7% increase versus last year. Full year consolidated comp store sales were up 5%, entirely driven by customer transactions. We were very pleased to see mid-single-digit comp sales increases in both our apparel and home businesses.\nAdjusted pretax profit margin of 10.9% was up 120 basis points versus last year's adjusted 9.7%. Adjusted gross margin for the full year was 29.9%, up 230 basis points versus last year's 27.6%, primarily driven by a significant benefit from lower freight costs as well as strong mark-on and 10 basis points of shrink favorability. Shrink was an area that we were laser focused on as an organization all year long. I want to recognize and thank all the associates who worked extremely hard on our initiatives throughout the year.\nImportantly, we managed our in-store initiatives while delivering a very strong top line and providing a pleasant shopping experience for our customers. We remain focused on shrink and continue to look for ways to improve this area going forward.\nFull year adjusted SG&A was 19.3%, up 140 basis points versus last year's 17.9%. This was primarily due to incremental store wage and payroll costs and higher incentive accruals. Adjusted net interest income benefited full year adjusted pretax profit margin by 30 basis points versus last year. Lastly, full year adjusted earnings per share were $3.76, up 21% versus last year's adjusted $3.11.\nMoving to inventory. Balance sheet inventory was up 3% versus fiscal '23. We are happy with our inventory levels and the plentiful availability we see in the marketplace. We are well positioned to flow fresh assortments to our stores and online this spring. I'll finish with our liquidity and shareholder distributions. For the full 53-week year, we generated $6.1 billion in operating cash flow and ended the year with $5.6 billion in cash. In fiscal '24, we returned $4 billion to shareholders through our buyback and dividend programs.\nNow I'll turn it back to Ernie.\n\nErnie L. Herrman\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The TJX Cos., Inc.\n\nThanks, John. I'll pick it up with some full year divisional highlights. As we saw with our strong fourth quarter sales, every division delivered comp increases for the full year, with customer transactions driving the increases across the businesses. Again, we believe this is a strong indicator of our ability to continue gaining market share and it underscores our wide customer demographic.\nBeginning with Marmaxx. Overall sales well exceeded $30 billion. Comp store sales increased a very strong 6%. We also surpassed 2,500 total T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores. Marmaxx's apparel and home categories, both comped up for the year. Further, we saw consistently strong comp sales increases across regions and income demographics. As to Marmaxx's profitability, we were extremely pleased to see full year adjusted segment profit margin improved significantly to 13.7%.\nAs we look ahead, we are very excited about the opportunities to see -- that we see to grow our customer base, drive sales, open new stores and increase the profitability of our largest division. At Sierra, which is reported with Marmaxx, we were pleased with the continued sales growth. At our online businesses, we added new categories and brands throughout the year to deliver the same freshness and excitement online as we do in our stores.\nAt HomeGoods, annual sales grew to nearly $9 billion and comps grew 3%. It was great to see the home business return to positive comp sales trends. We are particularly pleased with the acceleration we saw in the second half of the year, with comp sales increasing high single digits. Similar to Marmaxx, we saw consistent performance across regions and income demographics. HomeGoods adjusted profitability also improved significantly to 9.4% and getting closer to our goal of returning this division to a double-digit profit margin.\nDuring the year, we opened a combined 34 HomeGoods and HomeSense stores. Long term, we see exciting potential to bring our eclectic mix of home fashions to even more consumers across the United States.\nMoving to TJX Canada. Full year sales were $5 billion and comp store sales increased 3%. Adjusted segment profit margin on a constant currency basis was 14%. With more than 550 stores across Canada, we are one of the largest apparel and home retailers in the country. We are a top destination for consumers seeking branded merchandise at amazing value. We continue to see opportunities to expand our footprint across Canada and attract new shoppers to all 3 of our banners.\nAt TJX International. Full year sales approached $7 billion and comp store sales were up 3%. Adjusted segment profit margin on a constant currency basis was 4.6%. As a reminder, in the second quarter, this division's profitability was significantly impacted by a reserve related to a German government COVID receivable. In Europe, we believe our sales growth outperformed many other major brick-and-mortar apparel retailers in a difficult economy. Australia delivered very strong sales growth, and we continue to open stores in new markets.\nGoing forward, we are confident that we can grow our retail banners in each country that we operate in and are highly focused on improving this division's profitability. Going forward, I am confident that we are well positioned to continue our growth around the world and in many kinds of economic and retail environments. Let me briefly remind you of the key characteristics of our business that we believe are tremendous advantage.\nFirst is our relentless focus on offering our shoppers great value on every item every day. For us, value means delivering consumers the right combination of brand, fashion, price and quality as always. Second is the flexibility of our business model that allows us to shift our buying, distribution and store mix to quickly react to the hottest trends in the marketplace and changing consumer preferences. Further, the globalness of our business allows us to create a differentiated treasure hunt shopping experience in every country that we operate in.\nThird, we successfully operate stores across a wide customer demographic. Our ability to offer a differentiated mix of good, better and best merchandise at each of our stores allows us to appeal to value-conscious shoppers across a broad range of income demographics. Further, each of our divisions continue to affect an outsized number of younger customers to its stores, attract an outsized number of younger customers to our stores, which we believe bodes well for the future.\nNext, we are extremely confident that there is more than enough inventory available in the marketplace to support our growth plans. In 2023, our more than 1,300 buyers source goods from a universe of more than 21,000 vendors, including thousands of new ones. As we continue to grow our top line, we believe we become even more appealing to vendors as we offer them an attractive way to grow their business. Fifth, we continue to see opportunities for store growth around the world. We believe we can grow our global store base by at least another 1,300-plus stores over the long term with just our existing banners in our current countries.\nLast, but certainly not least, is our exceptional talent and strong culture. I truly believe the depth of off-price knowledge and expertise and the longevity of our talent within TJX is unmatched. We continue to invest in teaching and training our associates to develop the next generation of leaders within our company. Finally, I am so proud of our culture, which I believe is a major differentiator and another key component of our success.\nTurning to corporate responsibility. Our teams across the company did great work on our initiatives in each of our 4 pillars: workplace, communities, environment and responsible business. Our 2023 global corporate responsibility report summarizes our efforts and progress within this work, as I shared last quarter. Our value mission extends to our corporate responsibility efforts, including supporting our associates, giving back in our communities, helping mitigate our impact on the environment and operating our business ethically.\nI'm pleased to share that in fiscal 2024, we supported more than 2,000 nonprofit organizations globally through our TJX foundations including nonprofit partners in all 50 states within the United States. Through our grant funding and in partnership with our generous customers, we provided more than 30 million meals through our nonprofit partners that people experiencing food and security. And our associates across the globe continue to be engaged in this work, running give a dollar campaigns in our stores, participating in our associate nominated grants program, helping to build homes for those in need, serving his career coaches for students and more.\nThese are just some examples of work our teams are doing in our communities, and we invite you to visit tjx.com to learn more.\nSumming up, we are very proud of our team's performance in 2023 and are in a great position as we enter 2024. We are confident in our plans this year, and as always, we'll strive to beat them. We remain committed to investing in our business to support our future growth. Longer term, we believe that the combination of our key strengths and history of strong execution sets us up extremely well to continue our successful growth around the world. I am convinced that plenty of opportunities remain to drive sales increased profitability and capture additional market share going forward.\nNow I'll turn the call back to John to cover our full year and first quarter guidance. And then we'll open it up for questions.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks again, Ernie. Now to our fiscal '25 guidance beginning with the full year. We are planning overall comp store sales growth to be up 2% to 3% in fiscal '25 over a 5% comp increase in fiscal '24. For the full year, we expect consolidated sales to be in the range of $55.6 million to $56.1 billion. We're planning full year pretax profit margin to be in the range of 10.9% to 11%. This would be flat to up 10 basis points versus fiscal '24 adjusted pretax profit margin of 10.9%.\nMoving to full year gross margin. We expect it to be in the range of 30% to 30.1%, a 10 to 20 basis point increase versus fiscal '24 as adjusted gross margin of 29.9%. We expect this increase to be driven by a higher merchandise margin partially offset by our supply chain investments. We're planning for both freight and shrink to be flat versus fiscal '24. For full year SG&A, we're expecting it to be approximately 19.3% and flat to last year's adjusted SG&A.\nWe're planning incremental store wage and payroll costs to be offset by lower incentive compensation costs and a benefit from items that negatively impacted us last year. We're planning full year net interest income of about $118 million, which would delever fiscal '25 pretax profit by about 10 basis points. For modeling purposes, we're currently assuming a full year tax rate of 26.0% and a weighted average share count of approximately 1.14 billion shares.\nAs a result of these assumptions, we're -- we expect full year earnings per share to be in the range of $3.94 to $4.02. This would represent an increase of 5% to 7% versus last year's adjusted earnings per share of $3.76.\nMoving to our first quarter guidance. We are planning overall comp store sales growth to be up 2% to 3%. We expect first quarter consolidated sales to be in the range of $12.4 billion to $12.5 billion. We're planning first quarter pretax profit margin to be in the range of 10.5% to 10.6%, an increase of 20 to 30 basis points versus last year.\nNext, we expect first quarter gross margin to be approximately 29.8%. This would be an increase of 90 basis points versus last year's -- last year primarily due to a higher merchandise margin which includes the annualization of lower freight costs from last year and favorable mark-on, partially offset by supply chain investments. We're expecting first quarter SG&A to be approximately 19.5%, up 50 basis points versus last year. We expect this increase to be primarily driven by incremental store wage and payroll costs.\nFor modeling purposes, we're currently assuming a first quarter tax rate of 25.8%, net interest income of about $37 million and a weighted average share count of approximately 1.14 billion shares. As a result of these assumptions, we expect for our first quarter earnings to be -- earnings per share to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.86, up 11% to 13% versus last year's $0.76.\nMoving on to our fiscal '25 capital plans. We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.1 billion. This includes opening new stores, remodels and relocations as well as investments in our distribution network and infrastructure to support our growth. For new stores, we plan to add about 141 net new stores, which would bring our year-end total to almost 5,100 stores. This would represent a store growth of about 3%.\nIn the U.S., our plans call for us to add about 45 net new stores in Marmaxx and 40 stores at HomeGoods, including 17 HomeSense stores. At Sierra, we plan to add 26 stores. In Canada, we plan to add 10 stores. And at TJX International, we plan to add 15 net stores, in Europe and 5 net stores in Australia.\nLastly, we also plan to remodel about 480 stores and relocate approximately 40 stores in fiscal '25. As to our fiscal '25 cash distribution plans, we remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders. As we outlined in today's press release, we expect our Board of Directors will increase our quarterly dividend by 13% to [ $0.375 ] per share. Additionally, in fiscal '25, we currently expect to buy back $2 billion to $2.5 billion of TJX stock.\nLooking beyond FY '25, we continue to believe that on a 3 to 4 comp increase, our pretax profit margin can be flat to up 10 basis points. As I've said before, this assumes no outsized expense headwinds. Also, our plans do not contemplate assumptions for macro factors such as geopolitical events, foreign exchange volatility or consumer behavior.\nIn closing, I want to emphasize that we are laser-focused on growing our top line, increasing profitability and will strive to exceed our plans. We are in an excellent position, both operationally and financially to take advantage of the opportunities we see to further grow our business while simultaneously returning significant cash to our shareholders.\nNow we are happy to take your questions. As we do every quarter, we're going to ask that you please limit your questions to 1 per person so we can keep the call on schedule and answer as many questions as we can. Thanks, and now we'll open up for questions.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded as of today, November 15, 2023.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ernie Herman, Chief Executive Officer and President of The TJX Companies, Inc. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nErnie L. Herrman\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The TJX Cos., Inc.\n\nThanks, Ivy. Before we begin, Deb has some opening comments.\n\nDebra McConnell\n\nSenior Vice President of Global Communications\n\nThank you, Ernie, and good morning. The forward-looking statements we make today about the company's results and plans are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results and the implementation of the company's plans to vary materially. These risks are discussed in the company's SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Form 10-K filed March 29, 2023.

Reconciliations of other non-GAAP measures we discuss today to GAAP measures are also posted on our website, tjx.com, in the Investors section. Thank you.\nAnd now I'll turn it back over to Ernie.\n\nErnie L. Herrman\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The TJX Cos., Inc.\n\nGood morning. Joining me and Deb on the call is John. I want to start by recognizing our global associates for their continued hard work and dedication to TJX. Again, I want to give special recognition to our store, distribution and fulfillment center associates for their commitment to our company.\nNow to our business update and third quarter results. I am extremely pleased with our third quarter performance of sales, profitability and earnings per share all exceeded our expectations. Our 6% overall comp sales increase was entirely driven by customer traffic, which was up at all of our divisions.\nMarmaxx, our largest division, continued its strong momentum by once again delivering terrific increases in both comp sales and customer traffic. In the third quarter, our apparel sales remained very strong, and sales for overall Home were outstanding, accelerating sequentially versus the second quarter, particularly at HomeGoods. We also saw comp sales and traffic increases at our Canadian and international divisions.\nImportantly, overall merchandise margin remains very healthy. Our excellent third quarter results are a testament to the strong execution of our teams across the company and their continued focus on growing both our top and bottom lines. With our above-plan results in the third quarter, we are raising our full year outlook for comp sales and earnings per share. John will talk to this in a moment.\nThe fourth quarter is off to a strong start, and we continue to see outstanding availability of merchandise across a wide range of brands in the marketplace. This gives us great confidence that we can keep flowing a fresh assortment to our stores and online throughout the holiday season and beyond.\nLonger term, I am convinced that the flexibility of our business model, our wide demographic reach and our differentiated treasure hunt shopping experience will continue to serve us well and allow us to keep growing successfully in the United States and internationally.\nOkay. Before I continue, I'll turn the call over to John to cover our third quarter financial results in more detail.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Ernie, and good morning, everyone. I also want to add my gratitude to all of our global associates for their continued hard work. I'll start with some additional details on the third quarter.\nAs Ernie mentioned, our overall comp store sales increased 6%, well above the high end of our plan and were entirely driven by an increase in customer traffic. We saw continued momentum with our apparel comp sales, which includes accessories with a mid-digit -- with a mid-single-digit increase. Overall, Home-comp sales accelerated and were up high single digits. TJX net sales grew to $13.3 billion, a 9% increase versus the third quarter of fiscal '23.\nThe third quarter consolidated pretax margin of 12% was up 80 basis points versus last year. Our pretax profit margin came in above our plan, primarily due to expense leverage on our stronger-than-expected sales and a benefit of approximately 40 basis points from the timing of expenses. As we stated in our press release this morning, we expect this benefit from the timing of expenses will reverse out in the fourth quarter.\nThird quarter pretax profit margin was negatively impacted by approximately 30 basis points of cost from the closing of our HomeGoods online business, which was not contemplated in our previous guidance. All the costs associated with the closing of our HomeGoods e-commerce business are reflected in our Q3 results and there are no further write-downs expected going forward. Third quarter gross margin was up 200 basis points versus last year. This increase was driven by a higher merchandise margin due to the significant benefit from lower freight costs.\nGross margin also benefited from expense leverage on the 6% comp sales increase. Supply chain investments and our year-over-year shrink accrual were headwinds to gross margin in the third quarter. Third quarter SG&A increased 140 basis points, primarily due to incremental store wage and payroll costs, higher incentive accruals due to above-plan results and approximately 30 basis points of costs related to the closing of our HomeGoods online business.\nNet interest income benefited pretax profit margin by 30 basis points versus last year. Lastly, we were very pleased that diluted earnings per share of $1.03 were also above our expectations and up 20% versus last year's adjusted $0.86. This includes an approximately $0.03 negative impact due to the closing of our HomeGoods online business, which was not contemplated in our previous guidance. This also includes approximately $0.03 of unplanned benefit from the timing of expenses that we expect will reverse out in the fourth quarter.\nMoving to our third quarter divisional performance. At Marmaxx, third quarter comp store sales increased a very strong 7%, entirely driven by customer traffic. Marmaxx' apparel and home categories both saw significant comp sales increases. Further, comp sales increases were very consistent across low-, mid- and high-income demographic areas and was strong across all regions. Marmaxx's third quarter segment profit margin was 14% and up 50 basis points versus last year. This was driven by a benefit from lower freight costs as well as expense leverage on the strong sales, partially offset by incremental store wage and payroll costs and higher incentive accruals.\nWe are convinced that T.J. Maxx and Marshalls will continue to be gift-giving destinations this holiday season. Long term, we remain confident in our ability to capture additional market share in the U.S.\nAt HomeGoods, third quarter comp store sales accelerated to an outstanding 9% increase entirely driven by customer traffic. Comp performance was very strong across each region in the U.S. and across stores in different income demographic areas. We were very pleased to see HomeGoods third quarter segment profit margin returned to double-digits increasing 140 basis points to 10.3%. This increase was due to a benefit from lower freight costs and expense leverage on stronger sales partially offset by costs related to closing our HomeGoods online business. With more than 900 stores today, we continue to see a significant opportunity to open up more HomeGoods and HomeSense stores around the country. We're excited about our market share opportunities and bringing our eclectic home assortment and great values to even more shoppers.\nAt TJX Canada, comp store sales growth was 3% and was also driven by an increase in customer traffic. Segment profit margin on a constant currency basis was 17%, up 120 basis points. We have a very loyal shopper base in Canada and are convinced that we can capture additional market share through all 3 of our Canadian banners.\nAt TJX International, comp store sales were up 1% and customer traffic was up. Comp sales and traffic increased both in both Europe and Australia. In Europe, we were pleased with our performance given the high inflation impacting customer discretionary spend in the unseasonably warm weather. Segment profit margin for TJX International on a constant currency basis was 5.3%, down 140 basis points. We are confident that we can keep growing our footprint across our existing European countries in Australia and improve the overall profitability of this division.\nAs to e-commerce, overall, it's a very small percentage of our business and remains complementary to our very successful brick-and-mortar business. As to homegoods.com online business, when we looked at our long-term projections, we did not see a path to profitability over the long term like we do for our other banners. In terms of our other e-commerce sites, we were very pleased with their sales trends in the third quarter.\nMoving to inventory. Balance sheet inventory was essentially flat versus the third quarter of fiscal '23. We feel great about our inventory levels and the outstanding availability in the marketplace. We are very we are well positioned to flow fresh assortments to our stores and online this holiday season.\nI'll finish with our liquidity and shareholder distributions. For the third quarter, we generated $1.2 billion in operating cash flow and ended the quarter with $4.3 billion in cash. In the third quarter, we returned $1 billion to shareholders through our buyback and dividend programs.\nNow I'll turn it back to Ernie.\n\nErnie L. Herrman\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The TJX Cos., Inc.\n\nAll right. Thanks, John. Now I'd like to highlight the key opportunities we see to keep driving sales and traffic in the fourth quarter.\nFirst, as always, offering outstanding value is our top priority for the holiday selling season, especially in an environment where consumers' wallets are stretched. The marketplace continues to be loaded with quality merchandise and we are set up extremely well to offer a wide range of good, better and best brands to consumers.\nSecond, we believe our strongly position -- we are strongly positioned to be a top destination for gifts this holiday season. Our buyers have done a terrific job selecting the best merchandise available for our global vendor base to surprise from our global vendor base to surprise and excite our customers. We are confident that shoppers will find an eclectic assortment of guests to choose from for everyone on their list. In addition, we will remain focused on being a gifting destination throughout the year.\nNext, we will be following fresh product to our stores and online multiple times a week throughout the holiday season, which we believe differentiates us from many other major retailers. With our ever-changing mix of merchandise, shoppers can see something new every time they visit. Further, we feel great about our plans to transition our stores post-holiday and offer consumers the categories and trends they want to start the year.\nLastly, we feel great about our holiday marketing campaigns across all of our brands, which launched earlier this month. Each of our brands are emphasizing our value leadership and our great assortment of quality gifts for the whole family. We believe we are set up very well to be top of mind for consumers and drive shoppers to our stores this holiday season. Additionally, we feel great about our in-store shopping experience as our customer satisfaction scores remain very strong.\nMoving on. I'd like to spend a moment and list off the key characteristics of TJX that give us confidence that we can continue our successful growth around the world for many years to come. First, we have the largest brick-and-mortar off-price retailer in the world. We leverage our global infrastructure and share best practices across all of our divisions so that we can deliver the best merchandise values and shopping experience to our customers.\nSecond, we have one of the most flexible business models in retail. This allows us to buy close to need and quickly adjust our store assortment to meet changing consumer preferences and offer the hottest trends.\nThird, we successfully operate stores across a very wide demographic and we curate our store mix to appeal to shoppers across all income demographics. Importantly, we continue to attract an outsized number of Gen Z and millennial shoppers to our stores, which we believe bodes well for the future.\nNext, we source from an ever-changing universe of approximately 21,000 vendors in more than 100 countries. As a growing retailer with almost 5,000 stores, we believe many vendors want to work with TJX because we offer them a very attractive way to grow their business. All of this gives us great confidence that there will be plenty of quality branded merchandise available for us.\nFifth, we believe our best-in-class buying organization is a tremendous advantage. Many of our more than 1,300 buyers have multiple decades of off-price buying experience. which we believe has allowed us to establish some of the best mutually beneficial vendor relationships and all of retail. Next, we continue to have a significant opportunity to grow our global store base. Long term, we see the potential to open an additional 1,300-plus stores with just our current banners in just our current countries.\nLastly, but most important is our talent. Throughout TJX, our management teams have deep decades-long off-price expertise in the U.S. and internationally, which we believe is unmatched. Additionally, we are laser focused on teaching and training to develop the next generation of leaders for our company.\nFinally, I am so proud of our culture, which I believe is a major differentiator and another key component of our success. We believe that the combination of all these characteristics is why we have such a long history of successful growth in many types of economic and retail environments. We are convinced that these aspects of our business are a tremendous advantage and will allow us to continue offering shoppers inspiring merchandise, outstanding value and an exciting treasure hunt shopping experience every day.\nTurning to corporate responsibility. I am pleased to share with you that we recently published our 2023 Global Corporate Responsibility Report. The report summarizes our fiscal 2023 initiatives and progress within the 4 areas we focus on: workplace, communities, environmental sustainability and responsible business. We are proud to continue to make progress in our programs and initiatives, and we aim to provide our stakeholders with relevant information through our report and website.\nI'm grateful to our teams around the globe for the work that they do to support our global priorities. As always, we invite you to visit tjx.com to read our full report and our updates throughout the year. Summing up, we were very pleased to deliver another quarter of strong sales and profitability. The fourth quarter is off to a strong start, and we are excited about the initiatives we have planned to drive sales and traffic this holiday season. Going forward, I want to assure you that we are laser-focused on further improving the profitability of TJX over the long term. Further, I am convinced that the key characteristics of our business have set us up extremely well to take advantage of the market share opportunities we see ahead in the United States and internationally.\nNow I'll turn the call back to John to cover our fourth quarter and full year guidance, and then we'll go on to open it up for questions.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks again, Ernie. Before I start, I want to remind you that our fiscal '24 calendar includes an extra week in the fourth quarter. Now starting with our fourth quarter guidance. We will continue to expect overall comp store sales growth to be up 3% to 4%. As a reminder, our comp guidance for the fourth quarter excludes our expected sales from the extra week in the quarter.\nFor the fourth quarter, we expect consolidated sales to be in the range of $15.9 million to $16.1 billion, which includes approximately $800 million of revenue expected from the extra week. We now expect fourth quarter pretax profit margin to be in the range of 10.4% to 10.6%, and excluding an expected benefit of approximately 40 basis points from the extra week, we expect adjusted pretax profit margin to be in the range of 10.0% to 10.2%, on a 13-week basis, this would represent an increase of 80 to 100 basis points versus last year's pretax profit margin of 9.2%. The decrease in the fourth quarter pretax profit margin guidance is due to the expected reversal of the approximately 40 basis point benefit we saw in the third quarter from the timing of expenses.\nNext, we expect fourth quarter gross margin on a 13-week basis to be in the range of 28.2% to 28.4%, up 210 to 230 basis points versus last year. We're planning a significant benefit from lower freight costs as well as a benefit from our year-over-year shrink accrual, partially offset from our ongoing supply chain investments.\nOn a 13-week basis, we're planning fourth quarter SG&A to be approximately 18.5%, up 150 basis points versus last year. This expected increase is primarily driven by incremental store wage and payroll costs and higher incentive accruals. For modeling purposes, we're currently assuming a fourth quarter tax rate of 26%, net interest income on a 13-week basis of about $49 million, and a weighted average share count of approximately 1.5 billion shares.\nAs a result of these assumptions, we are now -- we now expect fourth quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $1.07 to $1.10, excluding an expected benefit of approximately $0.10 from the extra week, we expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.97 to $1. On a 13-week basis, this will represent an increase of 9% to 12% versus last year's earnings per share of $0.89. I want to be clear that our assumptions for comp sales, pretax profit margin and earnings per share for the fourth quarter are unchanged versus our previous guidance. The decrease in the fourth quarter pretax profit margin and earnings per share guidance is due to the expected reversal of the approximately 40 basis points and $0.03 benefit from the timing of expenses that we saw in the third quarter.\nNow to the full year. We are now expecting overall comp store sales increase of 4% to 5%. As a reminder, our comp guidance excludes our expected sales from the 53rd week. For the full year, we now expect consolidated sales to be in the range of $53.7 million to $53.9 billion, which includes approximately $800 million of revenue expected from the 53rd week.\nWe expect full year pretax profit margin to be approximately 10.8%, excluding an expected benefit of approximately 10 basis points from the 53rd week, we expect adjusted pretax profit margin to be approximately 10.7%. On a 52-week basis, this would represent an increase of 100 basis points versus fiscal '23 pretax profit margin of 9.7%.\nRegarding shrink, our indicators are still leading us to believe that we can continue to plan shrink flat for fiscal '24. As a reminder, we will not know the full effect of our shrink initiatives or the accuracy of our indicators until we do a full annual inventory count in January.\nMoving to full year adjusted gross margin on a 52-week basis, we now expect it to be approximately 29.6%, a 200 basis point increase versus last year. We expect virtually all of this increase to be driven by a benefit from lower freight costs. This guidance also assumes a continuation of headwinds from our supply chain investments. We are very pleased with the level of fleet recapture we've seen so far this year and remain focused on looking for ways to reduce our freight costs going forward.\nFor the full year, adjusted SG&A on a 52-week basis, we are now expecting it to be approximately 19.2%, a 130 basis point increase versus last year. This is expected -- this expected increase is primarily driven by incremental store wage and payroll costs and higher incentive accruals. For modeling purposes, we're currently assuming a full year tax rate of 25.7%, net interest income on a 52-week basis of about $165 million, and a weighted average share count of approximately 1.16 billion shares.\nAs a result of our above planned third quarter earnings performance, we are increasing our full year earnings per share guidance to a range of $3.71 to $3.74, excluding an expected benefit of approximately $0.10 from the 53rd week, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.61 to $3.64. On a 52-week basis, this would represent an increase of 16% to 17% versus fiscal '23's adjusted earnings per share of $3.11.\nIt's important to understand that we did not flow through the entire third quarter earnings per share beat to the fourth quarter because of the $0.03 of costs related to closing of the e-commerce business.\nIn closing, I want to reiterate that we are very pleased with the execution of our teams across the company in the third quarter and are confident in our plans for the fourth quarter. Long term, I want to reiterate that we will not be complacent when it comes to looking at ways to improve our profitability. We have a very strong balance sheet and are in an excellent financial position to invest in the growth of our business and simultaneously return significant cash to our shareholders.\nNow we are happy to take your questions. As we do every quarter, we're going to ask that you please limit your questions to one per person, so we can keep the call on schedule and answer as many questions as we can. Thanks.\nAnd now we'll open it up for questions.",

Welcome to the TJX Companies Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Call is being recorded, August 16, 2023.\nI would like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Ernie Herman, Chief Executive Officer and President of the TJX Companies, Inc. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nErnie L. Herrman\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The TJX Cos., Inc.\n\nThanks, Sheila. Before we begin, Deb has some opening comments.\n\nDebra McConnell\n\nSenior Vice President of Global Communications\n\nThank you, Ernie, and good morning. The forward-looking statements we make today about the company's results and plans are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results and the implementation of the company's financial results [indiscernible] materially. These risks are discussed in the company's SEC filings, including, without limitation, Form 10-K filed March 29, 2023. .\nFurther, these comments and the Q&A that follows are copyrighted today by the TJX Companies, Inc.

Additionally, while we have approved the publishing of a transcript of this call by a third party, we take no responsibility for inaccuracies that may appear in that transcript.\nWe have detailed the impact of foreign exchange on our consolidated results and our international divisions in today's press release and the Investors section of our website, tjx.com. Reconciliations of other non-GAAP measures we discuss today to GAAP measures are also posted on our website, tjx.com, in the Investors section. Thank you.\nAnd now I'll turn it back over to Ernie.\n\nErnie L. Herrman\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The TJX Cos., Inc.\n\nGood morning. Joining me and Deb on the call is John Klinger. I'd like to begin today by once again recognizing our global associates for their dedication to TJX. It is their hard work that brings our business to life every day for our customers. I want to extend a special thank you to our store, distribution and fulfillment center associates for their continued very hard work and commitment to our company.\nI want to comment on the wildfires in Maui. We are grateful that our associates in Maui and the rest of Hawaii are safe. and at the same time, are deeply saddened by the devastation and loss. To help with the relief efforts on the ground, we have made a donation to the Maui Food Bank and our local teams are donating essential supplies.\nNow to our business update and second quarter results. I am extremely pleased with our second quarter performance as sales, profitability and earnings per share were all well above our plans. I want to highlight that customer traffic drove our 6% overall comp sales increase, and it increased at all of our divisions. As a reminder, for us, customer traffic represents the number of customer transactions.\nI am particularly pleased with the performance of our largest division, Marmaxx, which delivered high single-digit increases in both comp sales and customer traffic. Our overall apparel and accessories sales were very strong. and our overall home sales significantly improved and returned to positive comp sales growth. Clearly, our terrific mix of branded, fashionable merchandise and great values resonated with shoppers when they visited our stores.\nIn terms of profitability, both pretax profit margin and earnings per share increased significantly versus last year. Importantly, merchandise margin continues to be very healthy with our above-plan sales and profitability performance in the second quarter, we are raising our full year outlook for comp sales, pretax profit margin and earnings per share. John will talk to this in a moment.\nWe are very pleased with the continued momentum of our business and the excellent execution of our teams across the company. They have been laser-focused on driving sales and traffic and improving profitability. The third quarter is off to a very strong start, and we feel great about our plans for the remainder of the year.\nThe marketplace is loaded with outstanding buying opportunities and we are confident that we will continue to offer a terrific mix of brands and an outstanding assortment of gifts to our shoppers during the fall and holiday selling seasons. We are convinced that our differentiated treasure hunt shopping experience and excellent values will continue to serve us well and allow us to capture additional market share across our geographies for many years to come.\nBefore I continue, I'll turn the call over to John to cover our second quarter financial results in more detail.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Ernie, and good morning, everyone. I also want to add my gratitude to all of our global associates for their continued hard work. I'll start with some additional details on the second quarter. As Ernie mentioned, our overall comp store sales well above the high end of our plan and were entirely driven by an increase in customer traffic. We were very pleased to see that both comp store sales growth and customer traffic improved sequentially each month of the quarter.\nAs we expected, average ticket was down due to merchandise mix, the impact of the lower ticket on sales was largely offset by an increase in units with shoppers putting more items into their cart. This is in line with what we have seen in our business historically. Our overall apparel business, including accessories, continued its momentum with high single-digit comp increase. Overall, home comp sales were up mid-single digits.\nTJX net sales grew to $12.8 billion, an 8% increase versus the second quarter of fiscal '23. Second quarter consolidated pretax margin of 10.4% was up 120 basis points versus last year. This was well above our plan due to a bigger benefit than we expected from lower freight costs as well as expense leverage on our above-plan sales.\nGross margin was up 260 basis points. This increase was driven by a higher merchandise margin due to the significant benefit from lower freight costs. This year-over-year freight benefit was primarily driven by lower rates as well as a benefit from our freight initiatives and the remainder of our year -- in the remainder of our year-end accrual adjustment. Gross margin also benefited from our inventory and fuel hedges in expense leverage on a 6% comp increase. Our year-over-year shrink accrual and supply chain investments were headwinds to gross margin in the second quarter.\nSecond quarter SG&A increased 170 basis points due to a combination of factors. These include higher incentive accruals and due to above planned results, a reserve related to a German government COVID program receivable, incremental store wage and payroll costs and a contribution to the TJX Foundation. Net interest income benefited pretax profit margin by 40 basis points versus last year. Lastly, we were very pleased that earnings per share of $0.85 were up 23% versus last year and also well above our expectations.\nNow moving to our second quarter divisional performance. At Marmaxx, second quarter comp store sales increased an outstanding 8%, entirely driven by customer traffic. Marmaxx's apparel and home categories both saw high single-digit comp increases. Further, it was great to see comp sales and traffic increases accelerate every month throughout the quarter. Comp sales were very strong across each of Marmaxx's region. We also saw consistent performance across low, mid- and high-income store demographics.\nMarmaxx's second quarter segment profit margin was 13.7%, up 80 basis points versus last year, primarily driven by a benefit from lower freight costs as well as expense leverage on the strong sales and strong mark on. We continue to be pleased with the momentum at Marmaxx and are excited about the initiatives we have planned to help us drive sales and traffic for the remainder of the year and beyond.\nAt HomeGoods, we were very pleased to see second quarter comp store sales increased 4% and a significant increase in our end customer traffic. HomeGoods comp sales and traffic increases also accelerated every month throughout the quarter. I also want to note that our full year plans assume that HomeGoods will continue to comp positively for the second half of the year. HomeGoods second quarter segment profit margin was 8.7%, up 600 basis points and entirely due to benefit -- a benefit from lower freight costs. We remain confident in the long-term opportunities we see to grow both our HomeGoods and HomeSense banners and capture additional share of the U.S. home market.\nAt Canada, Comp store sales were up 1% and customer traffic increased. Segment profit margin was 15%. As the only major brick-and-mortar off-price retailer in Canada, we have a very loyal shopper base in many value-conscious shop customers. We are confident that we are set up well to continue growing our footprint across Canada and attract more customers to our banners.\nAt TJX International, comp store sales increased 3% and customer traffic was also up. It was great to see comp sales and traffic increases at both our European and Australian businesses. During the quarter, we also launched online shopping in Germany and Austria. Segment profit margin for TJX International on a constant currency basis was 2.1%, which was negatively impacted by over 300 basis points due to the reserve related to the German receivable I spoke to earlier. We are very happy with our overall performance in this division and are confident we can continue to grow our banners in our existing countries and improve profitability.\nAs to e-commerce, overall, it remains a very small percentage of our business. We continue to add new merchandise to our sites so that shoppers can see something new every time they visit.\nMoving to inventory. Balance sheet inventory was down 7% versus the second quarter of fiscal '23. Similar to the first quarter, the year-over-year decline was primarily due to the elevated levels we saw last year from the early arrival of merchandise and a larger in-transit balance as a result of supply chain delays at that time. We feel great about inventory levels in the outstanding buying environment. As Ernie said, the marketplace is loaded with merchandise, and we are well positioned to flow fresh assortments to our stores and online this fall and holiday season.\nI'll finish with our liquidity and shareholder distributions. For the second quarter, we generated $1.3 billion in operating cash flow and ended the quarter with $4.6 billion in cash. In the second quarter, we paid down $500 million of maturing debt and returned $932 million to shareholders through our buyback and dividend programs.\nNow I'll turn it back to Ernie.\n\nErnie L. Herrman\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The TJX Cos., Inc.\n\n[indiscernible] I think the key strengths that have allowed TJX to grow successfully through many kinds of retail and economic cycles for nearly 5 decades. I'm convinced that these core strengths set us apart from many other retailers and will continue to be a tremendous advantage going forward. First is our value leadership. Our goal has always been to offer great value on every item, every day to every customer. At TJX, value is more than just offering consumers a great price. For us, value also means delivering desirable brands, fashionable merchandise and great quality to our shoppers. We believe our value proposition is 1 of the best in all of retail, and we'll continue to attract consumers to our retail banners all around the world.\nSecond, we have developed 1 of the most flexible brick-and-mortar retail models in the world. The flexibility of our close to need opportunistic buying allows our merchants to quickly react to the hottest trends in the marketplace and adapt to changing consumer preferences. The flexibility of our supply chain and store formats allows us to ship to our stores multiple times a week, merchandise stores individually and flex our floor space to support our ever-changing assortment.\nThird, we successfully operate stores across a wide customer demographic. We want to sell to everyone, and we aim to appeal to all value-conscious shoppers and inspire and excite them every time they visit us. The flexibility of our business allows us to curate an assortment of good, better and best merchandise across our stores, and to appeal to shoppers across all income demographic areas.\nNext, we have built an expansive vendor universe over many decades and believe we have some of the best relationships in all of retail. This vast network of changing vendors, which numbered approximately 21,000 over the last year is the reason why we are so confident that there will always be more than enough inventory in the marketplace for us to buy. Our best-in-class buying organization of 1,200-plus merchants does a terrific job selecting the right mix of categories and brands for the right stores to create our fun treasure hunt shopping experience.\nWe also see the globalness of our business as a tremendous strength. We have built a highly integrated global infrastructure, supply chain and buying organization that we believe would be difficult to replicate. This allows us to leverage our global presence to create a differentiated treasure hunt shopping experience in each country we operate in.\nLast, but certainly not least, is our talent. Teaching and talent development have always been priorities at TJX. Through our organization and management teams, we have deep decades-long off-price experience in the U.S. and internationally. I believe that our global talent base will continue to be a tremendous advantage as we continue our growth around the world. I truly believe that the combination of these key strengths and the execution of them, is why we are 1 of the strongest companies in all of retail and have a very long history of successful performance.\nNow I'll briefly highlight the opportunities we see to keep driving sales and traffic in the second half of the year. First, as I said earlier, we are seeing phenomenal product availability across all categories and a wide range of brands. This gives us great confidence that we can bring consumers the right assortment at the right values throughout the fall and holiday season.\nSecond, we feel great about our store merchandising initiatives that we have planned. We are particularly excited about our gifting initiatives as we continue to focus on being a destination for gifts throughout the year. With our rapidly changing assortment, we believe shoppers will be inspired to visit us frequently to see what's new.\nAnd third, we have very strong marketing campaigns planned. Each of our brands will continue to reinforce our value leadership position through a combination of channels, including digital, television and social media. We believe our compelling campaigns will capture the attention of new consumers while keeping us top of mind with our existing customers.\nMoving to profitability. We are extremely pleased that the high end of our adjusted pretax profit margin plan for fiscal 2024 now exceeds our previously announced target of 10.6% for fiscal 2025. This is a testament to the hard work and commitment of the entire organization. I want to assure you that we did not be that we will not be complacent and we'll strive to continue improving our profitability over the long term.\nBefore I close, I'd also like to reinforce our deep commitment to acting as a responsible corporate citizen, and I am proud of the work our teams across the globe continue to do. We expect to publish our annual global corporate responsibility report this fall. And I hope you'll take some time to look at our website to learn more about what we are doing.\nSumming up, we are very pleased with the momentum we are seeing across the business and the very strong start to the third quarter. We've had excellent performance in the first half of the year, and our teams have put us in a great position for continued success for the remainder of the year. I'm convinced that the characteristics of our flexible off-price business model and the operating expertise within our organization are unmatched.\nI am so proud of our culture, which I believe is a major differentiator and a key component of our success. I am extremely confident about the future of TJX and I'm excited about the opportunities we see to capture additional market share and improve profitability in the long term.\nNow I'll turn the call back to John to cover our full year and third quarter guidance, and then we'll open it up for questions.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, again, Ernie. Before I start, I want to remind you that fiscal '24 calendar includes a 53rd week. Also, as we stated in our press release this morning, we have offered eligible former TJX associates who have not yet commenced their pension benefit, an opportunity to receive a lump sum payout of their vested pension benefit. We anticipate that the impact of this pension payout offer, primarily a noncash settlement charge, could negatively impact fiscal '24 EPS by approximately $0.01 to $0.02, but could be higher or lower depending on participation rates and other factors.\nTo be clear, any of the guidance we are providing today does not include the potential impact of this pension payout offer. We expect to exclude the impact of this potential settlement charge from our adjusted pretax profit margin and EPS results in the third quarter.\nNow to our full year guidance. We are now planning an overall comp store sales increase of 3% to 4%. As a reminder, our comp guidance excludes our expected sales from the 53rd week. For the full year, we now expect consolidated sales to be in the range of $53.5 billion to $53.8 billion. This guidance includes approximately $800 million of additional revenue expected from the 53rd week.\nAs Ernie said, we're increasing our full year profitability guidance. We're now planning full year pretax profit margin to be in the range of 10.7% to 10.8%, excluding an expected benefit of approximately 10 basis points from the 53rd week, we now expect adjusted pretax profit margin to be in the range of 10.6% to 10.7%. On a 52-week basis, this would represent an increase of 90 to 100 basis points versus fiscal '23's adjusted pretax profit margin of 9.7%.\nRegarding shrink, we continue to be laser-focused on our in-store initiatives while making sure we maintain an enjoyable shopping experience for our customers. At this time, our shrink indicators are leading us to believe that we can continue to plan shrink flat in fiscal '24. As a reminder, we will not know the full effect of our shrink initiatives or the accuracy of our indicators until we do a full annual inventory count at the end of the year.\nMoving on, we're planning full year adjusted gross margin on a 52-week basis in the range of 29.4% to 29.5%, a 180 to 190 basis point increase versus last year. we expect virtually all of this increase to be driven by a benefit from lower freight costs. We are also planning a benefit from merchandise margin. This guidance also assumes a continuation of headwinds from our supply chain investments and incremental distribution center wages.\nWe are very pleased with the level of freight recapture we are seeing given the significant pressure we saw over the prior 3 years. Our expected freight benefit this year includes a pull forward of most of the benefit we were expecting in fiscal '25. We remain laser-focused and looking at ways to reduce our freight costs. Moving on, we're expecting full year SG&A on a 52-week basis to be approximately 19.1%, a 120 basis point increase versus last year. This expected increase is primarily driven by incremental store wage and payroll costs and higher incentive accruals.\nFor modeling purposes, we're currently assuming a full year tax rate of 26% and Net interest income on a 52-week basis of about $157 million, and a weighted average share count of approximately 1.16 billion shares. As a result of these assumptions, we're increasing our full year earnings per share guidance to a range of $3.66 to $3.72. Excluding an expected benefit of approximately $0.10 from the 53rd week, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.56 to $3.62. On a 52-week basis, this would represent an increase of 10 -- excuse me, 14% to 16% versus fiscal '23's adjusted earnings per share of $3.11. Lastly, we now expect to open about 125 net new stores in fiscal 2024, an increase of approximately 3%. This reflects a shift of some of our planned fall openings into next year.\nMoving to the third quarter. We're planning overall comp store sales growth to be up 3% to 4%. Similar to the second quarter, we expect the comp increase to be driven by customer traffic. We're planning for average ticket to be down less than it was in the second quarter, again, due to merchandise mix. We're also expecting an increase in units sold. We expect third quarter consolidated sales to be in the range of $12.9 billion to $13.1 billion, a 6% to 7% increase over the prior year.\nWe're planning third quarter pretax profit margin to be in the range of 11.3% to 11.5%. We're expecting third quarter gross margin in the range of 30.3% to 30.5%, up 120 to 140 basis points versus last year. We're planning a significant benefit from lower freight costs partially offset by headwinds from supply chain investments, inventory cap and our year-over-year shrink accrual.\nWe're planning third quarter SG&A of approximately 19.3%, up 130 basis points versus last year. This expected increase is driven by incremental store wage and payroll costs and higher incentive accruals. For modeling purposes, we're currently assuming a third quarter tax rate of 25.3% and net interest income of about $40 million and a weighted average share count of approximately 1.15 billion shares. We expect third quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.95 to $0.98, up 10% to 14% versus last year's adjusted $0.86. For the fourth quarter, on a 13-week basis, we're planning comp store sales to be up 3% to 4%, adjusted pretax margin in the range of 10.3% to 10.5% and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $1 to $1.03. We will provide more detailed guidance for the fourth quarter on our third quarter earnings call.\nBefore I close, I want to echo Ernie's comments that we continue to see opportunities to further improve profitability over the long term. As always, the best way for us to drive profitability is with outsized sales. We continue to see opportunities to grow sales and traffic and capture additional market share. Further, we remain laser-focused on being even better on buying and retail and driving merchandise margin.\nAt the same time, we're expecting [indiscernible] to face headwinds from incremental wage costs and supply chain investments. As usual, we'll give you a detailed annual guidance beyond this year on our February -- on our call in February.\nIn closing, I want to reiterate that we are very pleased with our -- with the execution of our teams across the company and are confident in our sales and profitability plans. Further, we have a strong balance sheet and are in an excellent financial position to simultaneously invest in the growth of our business and return significant cash to our shareholders. Now we are happy to take your questions as we do every quarter. [Operator Instructions]\nThanks, and now we'll open it up for questions.",

We are very pleased that TJX will continue to benefit from both John and Scott's expertise and leadership.\nI'll start today by thanking all of our global associates for their hard work and commitment to TJX. We truly appreciate their collective efforts to deliver great merchandise and values to our shoppers every day.\nNow to our results. I am very pleased with our third quarter performance. Once again, we delivered strong profitability and a terrific merchandise margin. On the top line, our better-than-expected U.S. comp sales were driven by the excellent performance at Marmaxx, particularly its apparel business, where sales were strong. Our third quarter results once again highlight the outstanding execution of our flexible business model by our very talented associates. While our business is not immune to macro factors, I am convinced that the flexibility of our off-price retail model and the depth of our expertise and experience, especially within our merchant organization, will remain an important advantage for us.\nAs we enter the fourth quarter, we're in a terrific position to take advantage of the tremendous buying environment and to flow fresh exciting assortments to our stores and online this holiday season. We have many initiatives planned to drive sales and our value proposition remains very strong. Further, we are convinced that our great values will continue to resonate with consumers whose wallets remain stretched. Medium and longer term, we remain extremely confident that TJX is well positioned to gain market share and become an even more profitable company.\nI'll talk more about our holiday plans and our opportunities beyond 2022 in a moment. Before I continue, though, I'll turn the call over to Scott to cover our third quarter financial results in more detail. Scott?\n\nScott Goldenberg\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, The TJX Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ernie, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with some additional details on the third quarter. Third quarter consolidated pretax margin of 11.2%, was up 20 basis points versus last year. Third quarter pretax margin exceeded the high end of our guidance, largely due to the timing of some expenses. Our plans for the fourth quarter assume that most of this benefit will reverse out. Aside from the timing of expenses, the other components of our pretax margin were essentially in line with the high end of our plan.\nMerchandise margin was flat, despite 120 basis points of incremental freight pressure. Within merchandise margin, we saw a significant benefit from mark-on mostly due to better buying. Incremental wage costs continued to be a headwind to pretax margin with a negative impact of 80 basis points this quarter. Third quarter U.S. comp store sales decreased 2% and exceeded our expectations. As a reminder, we were anniversary-ing an outsized 16% U.S. open-only comp increase last year, which was versus fiscal '20. When added together, our comp would represent a 14% increase on a 3-year stack basis. Further, U.S. comp sales improved each month of the quarter on that same 3-year stack basis. Excluding foreign exchange, third quarter total sales would have been at the high end of our guidance.\nFor the third quarter, U.S. average basket was up U.S. customer traffic was down, but strengthened as the quarter progressed and improved versus the second quarter. Lastly, adjusted earnings per share were $0.86. Again, this was above the high end of our guidance, largely due to a benefit from the timing of some expenses, and our plans for the fourth quarter assume that most of this benefit will reverse out.\nNow to our divisional results. At Marmaxx, third quarter segment profit margin was 13.5%. Comp store sales increased 3% versus an 11% open-only comp increase last year. Marmaxx's comp sales were positive each month and improved throughout the quarter. Again, it was great to see a strong comp increase in Marmaxx's apparel business. Once again, Marmaxx's average basket increased as it has throughout the year. While customer traffic was down, Marmaxx will improvement each month of the quarter and versus the second quarter.\nAt HomeGoods, third quarter segment profit margin was 8.9%. The segment profit margin improvement versus the first half of this year was mostly due to a significant moderation of the year-over-year impact of incremental freight costs. Comp store sales decreased 16% versus a 34% open-only comp increase last year when we saw an outsized -- when we saw outsized spending in home-related categories. HomeGoods' average basket increased slightly.\nAt TJX Canada, we are pleased with the overall -- with their overall performance, particularly their strong profitability. Third quarter segment profit margin was 15.8%, exceeding their fiscal '20 margin. Overall sales on a constant currency basis were up 4% in the third quarter. Further, third quarter Canadian sales growth also improved each month of the quarter when compared to fiscal '20.\nAt TJX International, third quarter segment profit margin was 6.7%, despite some deleverage from lower sales, pretax margin was essentially in line versus fiscal '20, due to better buying and expense management, which mostly offset incremental freight wage and other expense pressures. Overall sales on a constant currency basis were down 1% from the third quarter.\nMoving to inventory. Our balance sheet inventory was up 26% versus the third quarter last year. This is higher than we expected due to early receipts of merchandise as the supply chain continued to improve. On a per-store basis, inventory was up 31% on a constant currency basis. We are very comfortable with our balance sheet and store inventory levels when compared to fiscal '20. Importantly, overall store inventory turns and markdowns are in line with our fiscal '20 levels. We still have plenty of liquidity and under an excellent position to take advantage of the great buying environment, including packaway opportunities.\nI'll finish with our liquidity and shareholder distributions. During the third quarter, we generated $1.1 billion of operating cash flow and ended the quarter with $3.4 billion in cash. In the third quarter, we returned $843 million to shareholders through our buyback and dividend programs.\nNow I will turn it back to Ernie.\n\nErnie L. Herrman\n\nCEO, President & Director, The TJX Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Scott. Now I'd like to highlight the opportunities we see to drive traffic and sales in the fourth quarter.\nFirst, in this inflationary environment, we believe it is important as ever to deliver shoppers excellent value throughout the store and online every time they visit. This is our top priority, and I am confident that our banners will be a destination for consumers seeking great value this holiday season. Second, as I've been saying all year long, the marketplace is absolutely loaded with quality branded merchandise across good, better and best brands. Importantly, this has set us up very well to offer an excellent assortment of branded gifts this holiday season that we believe will excite and inspire our shoppers. Third, I want to highlight that we plan to flow fresh product to our stores and online multiple times a week, which is a key differentiator of our business compared to many other retailers. With a rapidly changing merchandise mix, I am confident that shoppers are going to be very satisfied with the gift assortments they see every time they visit. Our stored teams are excellent at managing this flow and creating fresh organized shopping presentations throughout our stores.\nNext, we feel great about our holiday marketing campaigns that just launched. We believe these campaigns can help drive traffic from both new and existing shoppers across each of our banners. This year, each of our divisions will reinforce our value leadership and emphasize that shoppers can get more for their money when they visit. We are also highlighting the fresh flow of merchandise throughout the holiday season. with messaging such as spend less, get more all season long.\nIn the U.S. and Canada, we are leveraging the strengths of our retail brand portfolio in multi-banner campaigns, helping to drive efficiencies and building awareness. Further, for all our retail banners, we have strong comprehensive marketing plans in place to help us stand out. Lastly, the flexibility of our business model has allowed us to successfully operate our business against some level of retail promotion every year for the past 46 years. I really want to emphasize that we are extremely confident that we can manage through any type of promotional environment that we may see from other retailers in the fourth quarter and beyond. Looking beyond this year, we are convinced that we are set up very well to capitalize on the growth opportunities we see for our business in the medium and long term.\nOn the top line, we believe we are well positioned to capture additional market share. We see many opportunities to drive sales and traffic as we attract a wide range of customers across many income demographics, which we believe is a key advantage of our business. Further, we have substantial store growth potential remaining in our current geographies around the world. In a retail environment where overall pricing has been reset higher, we believe our value proposition will be even more compelling and visible to consumers and that our treasure hunt shopping experience will hold tremendous appeal.\nI want to reiterate our continued confidence in product availability to support our long-term growth plans. Throughout our history, availability of quality-branded inventory has never been an issue for us. Our more than 1,200 buyers source from a universe of approximately 21,000 vendors in from over 100 countries. There has always been significantly more merchandise in the marketplace than we could buy, and we expect that to continue.\nAs to our profitability outlook, we remain committed to returning to our fiscal 2020 pretax margin level. To be clear, that would be a 10.6% pretax margin by fiscal 2025. Over the next 2 years, our plans assume additional merchandise margin opportunities across all of our divisions. We also expect our overall expense headwinds to moderate and that freight will be a tailwind next year. Lastly, this outlook assumes that our overall comp store sales will return to a low single-digit increase in each of the next 2 years.\nTurning to corporate responsibility. I am pleased to share with you that our 2022 Global Corporate Responsibility Report was published this past quarter and is available on tjx.com. This report summarizes our fiscal 2022 initiatives and progress within our 4 areas of focus, which are workplace, communities, environmental sustainability and responsible business. The report includes an appendix of ESG data and maps our work and disclosures to a variety of ESG standards and frameworks, including the global reporting initiative United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board. We're proud to continue to make progress in our programs and initiatives and I'm grateful to our teams around the globe for the work they do to support our global priorities. As always, we invite you to visit tjx.com to read our full report, and we'll continue to update the site over the next year.\nIn closing, I want to again thank all of our associates around the world for their hard work that led to our strong results in the third quarter. Our teams have put us in an excellent position in this holiday season. I am convinced that we have some of the best talent in all of retail and across all areas of the business. Further, I believe their depth of off-price knowledge and expertise is unmatched and has driven our strong execution. I truly believe our associates will continue to be a major advantage for TJX going forward. I'm convinced that the flexibility of our off-price model and our commitment to value set us apart and have allowed us to successfully operate in many different economic, retail and promotional environments.\nWhile we are impacted by macro factors, we have historically outperformed in both good and bad environments throughout our 45-plus-year history. We are confident that we can execute on our short- and long-term growth plans to build TJX into an increasingly profitable $60 billion plus revenue company.\nNow I'll turn the call back to Scott to cover our full year and fourth quarter guidance. And then we'll open it up for questions. Scott?\n\nScott Goldenberg\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, The TJX Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks again, Ernie. I'll start with the full year. We increased our outlook for full year U.S. comp sales and now expect them to be down 1% to down 2% versus our previous guidance of down 2% to down 3%. This guidance now reflects the flow-through of our above-plan third quarter U.S. comp sales and our increased expectations for the fourth quarter. For the full year, we're now planning total TJX sales in the range of $49.3 billion to $49.5 billion. The change versus our previous guidance is due to our forecast at unfavorable foreign exchange rates will negatively impact our fourth quarter reported sales.\nFor full year adjusted pretax margins, we're anticipating a range of 9.8% to 9.9%, maintaining the high end of our full year margin guidance. For full year adjusted earnings per share, we now expect a range of $3.07 to $3.11 million, which is up 8% to 9% over last year's adjusted $2.85. The change to the high end versus our previous guidance is due to an incremental $0.02 negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange rates.\nExcluding this foreign exchange -- incremental foreign exchange impact, the high end of our adjusted EPS guidance would be unchanged. For modeling purposes, for the full year, we're currently anticipating approximately 130 basis points of incremental freight expense and 70 basis points of incremental wage costs. Also, we're assuming an adjusted tax rate of 25.3%, net interest expense of approximately $10 million and a weighted average share count of approximately 1.18 billion. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through our dividend and stock repurchase programs. In fiscal '23, we continue to expect to buy back $2.25 billion to $2.50 billion of TJX stock.\nNow to the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter, we are increasing our plan for U.S. comp store sales to be flat to up 1% over an outsized 13% U.S. open-only comp store sales increase last year. Next, we are planning total fourth quarter TJX sales in the range of $13.9 billion to $14.1 billion. In the fourth quarter, we're now assuming -- in the fourth quarter, we're now planning pretax margin in the range of 9.5% to 9.8%. This outlook now assumes that most of our third -- the third quarter timing of expenses -- the expense benefit will reverse out in the fourth quarter. For modeling purposes, in the fourth quarter, we're currently expecting a headwind from incremental wage costs and for freight to be flat. We're also anticipating a tax rate of 24.9%, net interest income of approximately $19 million and a weighted average share count of approximately 1.17 billion.\nAs a result of all of these assumptions, we're planning fourth quarter EPS of $0.85 to $0.89 per share. This outlook now assumes that most of the third quarter timing of benefit -- of expense benefits will reverse out in the fourth quarter and also reflects an expected unfavorable impact due to foreign exchange rates. In closing, I want to highlight that we are in great position operationally and financially to grow our business. We have a very strong balance sheet and continue to generate outstanding cash flow. Further, we are set up extremely well to continue making important investments to support the growth of our business while simultaneously returning significant cash to our shareholders.\nNow we're happy to take your questions. (Operator Instructions) Thanks, and now we will open it up for questions.",

Welcome to The TJX Companies Second Quarter Fiscal 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, August 17, 2022.\nI would like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Ernie Herrman, Chief Executive Officer and President of The TJX Companies, Inc. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nErnie L. Herrman\n\nCEO, President & Director, The TJX Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sheila. Before we begin, Deb has some opening comments.\n\nDebra McConnell\n\nSVP of Global Communications, The TJX Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ernie, and good morning. The forward-looking statements we make today about the company's results and plans are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results and the implementation of the company's plans to vary materially. These risks are discussed in the company's SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Form 10-K filed March 30, 2022.

We have detailed the impact of foreign exchange on our consolidated results and our international divisions in today's press release and the Investors section of our website, tjx.com. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures we discuss today to GAAP measures are posted on our website, tjx.com, in the Investors section.\nThank you. And now I'll turn it back over to Ernie.\n\nErnie L. Herrman\n\nCEO, President & Director, The TJX Companies, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Joining me and Deb on the call is Scott Goldenberg. I'll start today by once again thanking each of our global associates for their hard work. I truly appreciate their commitment to bringing our customers excellent value every day.\nNow to our results. I am very pleased with our second quarter pretax profit margin, which was above our plan and our earnings per share, which are at the high end of our plan. This is despite U.S. comp sales coming in lighter than we expected as we believe historically high inflation impacted consumer discretionary spending. We achieved the strong profitability through better-than-expected merchandise margin and disciplined expense management.\nI can't emphasize enough how this quarter is a testament to how great our business model is. Our teams executed our off-price fundamentals extremely well, and our merchants did an excellent job buying the right merchandise in the right categories. Across the company, our talented associates all played a part in delivering great value to our customers every day and helped our company drive strong profitability in the quarter.\nAs we enter the second half of the year, we see the flexibility of our business and our value proposition as key advantages in the current retail landscape. While we're not immune to macro factors, over our 46-year history, the flexibility of our off-price model and our commitment to value have served us very well in different kinds of macro environments. We attract a wide range of customers, which we believe is a key advantage in today's environment. Long term, we remain very confident in our plans to capture market share and improve the profitability profile of TJX.\nI'll talk more about our opportunities for the remainder of 2022 and beyond in a moment. But before I continue, I'll turn the call over to Scott to cover our second quarter financial results in more detail.\n\nScott Goldenberg\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, The TJX Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ernie, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to echo Ernie's comments and thank all of our global associates for their continued dedication to TJX.\nI'll start with some additional details on the second quarter. Second quarter consolidated pretax margin of 9.2% was above our plan. We are very pleased with our strong flow-through despite our softer sales. Our pretax margin outperformance was primarily driven by merchandise margin and effective expense management, which were both better than we planned. Pretax margin was down 150 basis points versus last year's adjusted 10.7%. Merchandise margin had a significant benefit from a combination of strong mark-on and our pricing initiative, but was down due to 240 basis points of incremental freight pressure.\nIncremental wage costs were 80 basis points. Second quarter U.S. comp store sales decreased 5% over an outsized 21% open-only comp increase last year versus fiscal '20, which when summed together would be a 16% comp increase on a 3-year stack basis.\nMoving on, we are very pleased that our comp sales in our overall apparel business at Marmaxx were slightly positive every month of the quarter. U.S. home comp sales were down low teens versus a 37% U.S. home open-only comp increase last year and were the primary driver of the U.S. softer -- of the softer U.S. sales trends we saw.\nFor the second quarter, U.S. average basket was up driven by a higher average ticket, and U.S. customer traffic was down. Lastly, earnings per share of $0.69 were at the high end of our plan.\nNow to our divisional results. At Marmaxx, second quarter segment profit was 12.9%. Comp store sales decreased 2% versus an 18% open-only comp increase last year. Again, it was great to see their overall apparel comps slightly positive. While customer traffic was down, we saw an increase in Marmaxx's average basket driven by a higher average ticket.\nAt HomeGoods, second quarter segment profit of 2.7% was hurt by nearly 800 basis points of incremental freight costs. Comp store sales decreased 13% versus a 36% open-only comp increase last year when we saw outsized spending in home-related categories. HomeGoods average basket increased significantly driven by a higher average ticket, and customer traffic decreased.\nWe were very pleased with the improvement in profitability we saw at our international divisions. At TJX Canada, second quarter segment profit margin of 15.8% exceeded their pre-COVID Q2 fiscal '20 level. Overall sales increased 22% and benefited from having stores open all quarter this year. On a constant currency basis, TJX Canada sales were up 28% in the second quarter.\nAt TJX International, second quarter segment margin up 7% was significantly higher than the first quarter and also exceeded their pre-COVID Q2 fiscal '20 level. Overall sales decreased 7%. This sales decline is entirely due to the impact of foreign exchange. On a constant currency basis, TJX International sales were up 6% in the second quarter.\nAs to e-commerce, it remains a very small percentage of our overall sales. We continue to add new brands and categories to our sites so shoppers can see something every -- something new every time they visit.\nMoving to inventory. Our balance sheet inventory was up 39% versus the second quarter last year. On a per-store basis, inventory is up 35% on a constant currency basis. We are very comfortable with our balance sheet and store inventory levels. Importantly, overall store inventory turns are better than our pre-pandemic levels.\nI'll finish with our liquidity and shareholder distributions. During the second quarter, we generated $641 million of operating cash flow and ended the quarter with $3.5 billion in cash. In the second quarter, we returned over $1 billion to shareholders through our buyback and dividend programs.\nNow I will turn it back to Ernie.\n\nErnie L. Herrman\n\nCEO, President & Director, The TJX Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Scott. I'd like to start by sharing the key traffic, sales and profitability opportunities we see for the remainder of the year.\nStarting with the top line. First, we are excited about our merchandising plans for the fall and holiday season. Again, this year, we will be flowing eclectic assortments to our stores and online multiple times a week. This is a strategy that has worked well for many years and sets us apart from other retailers during the busy holiday season as shoppers can see something new every time they visit us. We are confident that we can execute on our merchandising initiatives and manage our supply chain to keep our shelves fully stocked.\nSecond, availability of merchandise across good, better and best brands is exceptional. We have plenty of open-to-buy, and I have great confidence that our buying team of more than 1,200 buyers will bring the right brands, fashions and values to our consumers throughout the years.\nNext, we are laser-focused on driving traffic and sales with our marketing initiatives. This year, we have sharpened our messaging to reinforce our value leadership position. Each of our banners are communicating that we offer shoppers more for their money, and at the same time, deliver great brands and quality. In an environment where consumer wallets are stretched, we believe it is as important as ever to amplify our value messaging across television, digital and social media platforms.\nI also want to highlight that our customer satisfaction scores remain very strong. Further, we continue to attract a significant number of millennial and Gen Z shoppers, which we believe bodes well for the future.\nMoving to profitability. We are extremely pleased that we are able to increase our full year pretax margin guidance in this environment, giving us confidence of the merchandise margin opportunities we see. The buying environment is very attractive, and we believe we can continue to benefit from buying better.\nFurther, our pricing initiative is working very well. Our teams have done an outstanding job implementing this initiative over the past year, and we are very pleased that our value perception scores remain very strong. Again, we are seeing extraordinary off-price buying opportunities in the marketplace and have no issues with overall availability. We are in a terrific inventory position, and we have plenty of open-to-buy to take advantage of the current environment. This allows us to offer even more exciting merchandise and value to our shoppers, which is our top priority every day. Lastly, we remain focused on managing expenses and continue to look at ways to operate our business more efficiently.\nNow I'd like to remind you of the characteristics of our business that we believe strongly position us to continue our successful growth around the world over the medium and long term. First and foremost is the strong appeal of our great values, outstanding merchandise and differentiated treasure hunt shopping experience. Further, we believe the ability to touch and feel merchandise and take it home the same day is very important to consumers.\nSecond, we see an excellent opportunity to grow our global store base by at least another 1,500 stores in our current geographies. We are extremely confident that there will be more than enough real estate locations and merchandise available to support our store growth plans. Again, being one of the most flexible retailers in the world is a tremendous advantage. The flexibility of our opportunistic buying, supply chain and store format enable us to change up our floor space to expand to hot categories and trends that shoppers are looking for.\nAs to profitability beyond this year, we remain committed to returning to our pre-COVID pretax margin level of 10.6% within 3 years. We expect that across all of our divisions, our merchandise margin opportunities, the moderation of expense headwinds, particularly freight, and our focus on expense management will contribute to our improved profitability. As always, we believe driving outsized sales is our best opportunity to improve pretax margin over the long term.\nTurning to corporate responsibility. I'd like to update you on our commitment to building a more inclusive and diverse workplace. Last year, we completed our global associate inclusion and diversity survey. This was an important step, and we used the findings to help to find 3 global inclusion and diversity priorities for the company: increase the representation of diverse associates throughout all levels of our talent pipeline; equip leaders with the tools to support difference with awareness, fairness, sensitivity and transparency; and empower all associates to integrate inclusive behaviors, language and practices and how we work together and understand our role and responsibility and inclusion.\nWe have a number of initiatives underway to help support these priorities. For example, we have introduced a new leadership, competency and cultural factor focused on inclusion. In addition, associate resource groups similar to those we have in the U.S. have launched and are now active in both Canada and Europe. Also, teams throughout the organization have set up committees to better incorporate inclusion/diversity into our everyday work.\nIn our communities, we continue to support a number of organizations that work with Black communities and other communities of color. In addition, we have deepened relationships with some nonprofit partners in the U.S. to expand our reach to diverse students for recruitment efforts. We appreciate that this is a work in progress, and we remain committed to our global priorities and helping associates feel welcome, valued and engaged.\nIn closing, I want to emphasize my confidence in the future of TJX. We have a long track record of successfully operating through many different types of economic and retail environments. We believe value is as important as ever to consumers, and delivering great value has been our mission for over 45 years. We are very confident in the power of our off-price buying and pricing initiative while maintaining our value gap with other retailers, as always.\nWe continue to invest in our stores and shopping experience, which we believe positions us strongly, and we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders. Further, we have a management team with decades of off-price expertise at TJX and a very deep bench of talent who have successfully navigated through the unprecedented COVID environment. I am convinced that we are set up well to grow our top and bottom lines over the medium and long term and am confident in our plans to grow TJX into an increasingly profitable $60 billion-plus revenue company.\nNow I'll turn the call back to Scott for some additional comments, and then we'll open it up for questions. Scott?\n\nScott Goldenberg\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, The TJX Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks again, Ernie. I'll start with the full year. We now expect full year U.S. comp sales to be down 2% to 3% versus an outsized 17% U.S. open-only comp increase last year. This guidance now reflects the flow-through of our second quarter U.S. comp sales and our expectations for the second half of the year, which assumes our 3-year stacked U.S. comp continues at levels similar to recent trends.\nFor the full year, we are now planning total TJX sales in the range of $49.6 billion to $49.9 billion. The lower sales guidance includes our lower-than-planned second quarter sales and our updated sales expectation for the second half of the year. Despite the reduction in our sales plan, we are pleased to be raising our guidance for the full year adjusted pretax margin to 9.7% to 9.9%. This is 10 basis points higher than our previous guidance due to our assumption for even stronger flow-through for the back half of the year.\nOur improved profitability outlook versus our prior guidelines is due to stronger merchandise margin, better expense management and less incremental freight and wage pressure expected in the second half of the year. For modeling purposes, we are now assuming 140 basis points of incremental freight expense and 70 basis points of incremental wage costs.\nFor full year adjusted earnings per share, we are now planning a range of $3.05 to $3.13, which is up 7% to 10% over last year's adjusted $2.85. This guidance now includes a $0.03 negative impact from FX that was not contemplated in our original full year plan. Excluding this impact, the high end of our earnings per share guidance would be the same as our original plan.\nFor modeling purposes, for the full year, we are currently anticipating an adjusted tax rate of 25.5%, net interest expense of approximately $20 million and a weighted average share count of approximately 1.17 billion. We remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders through our dividend and stock repurchase programs. In fiscal '23, we continue to expect to buy back $2.25 billion to $2.5 billion of TJX stock.\nNow to our third quarter guidance. For the third quarter, we're planning pretax margin in the range of 10.1% to 10.4%. This guidance assumes approximately 100 basis points of incremental freight expense and about 80 basis points of incremental wage costs. In the third quarter, we are planning U.S. comp store sales to be down 3% to 5% over an outsized 16% U.S. open-only comp store increase last year.\nNext, we are planning third quarter TJX sales in the range of $12.1 billion to $12.3 billion. For modeling purposes, in the third quarter, we're currently anticipating a tax rate of 25.8%, net interest expense of approximately $2 million and a weighted average share count of 1.17 billion. As a result of these assumptions, we're planning third quarter EPS of $0.77 to $0.81 per share.\nOur third quarter and full year guidance implies that for the fourth quarter, pretax margin will be in the range of 10.1% to 10.4%. U.S. comp stores will be in the range of flat to down 1%, and earnings per share will be in the range of $0.92 to $0.96.\nIn closing, I want to reiterate that we are confident with our medium- and long-term growth and profitability plans. Further, we have a strong balance sheet and are in excellent financial position to navigate the current environment while simultaneously investing in the growth of our business and returning significant cash to our shareholders.\nNow we are happy to take your questions. (Operator Instructions) Thanks. And now we will open it up to questions.",

Welcome to the TJX Companies First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded as of today, May 17, 2023.\nI would now like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Ernie Herrman, Chief Executive Officer and President of the TJX Companies, Inc. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nErnie L. Herrman\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The TJX Cos., Inc.\n\nThank you, Ivy.\nBefore we begin, Deb has some opening comments.\n\nDebra McConnell\n\nSenior Vice President of Global Communications\n\nThank you, Ernie, and good morning.\nThe forward-looking statements we make today about the company's results and plans are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results and the implementation of the company's plans to vary materially. These risks are discussed in the company's SEC filings including, without limitation, the Form 10-K filed March 29, 2023.\nFurther, these comments and the Q&A that follows are copyrighted today by the TJX Companies, Inc. Any recording, retransmission, reproduction or other use of the same for profit or otherwise without prior consent of TJX is prohibited in the violation of United States copyright and other laws. Additionally, while we have approved the publishing of a transcript of this call by a third party, we take no responsibility for inaccuracies that may appear in that transcript.\nWe have detailed the impact of foreign exchange on our consolidated results and our international divisions in today's press release and the Investors section of our website, TJX.com. Reconciliations of other non-GAAP measures we discuss today to GAAP measures are also posted on our website, TJX.com, in the Investors section.\nThank you. And now, I'll turn it back over to Ernie.\n\nErnie L. Herrman\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The TJX Cos., Inc.\n\nGood morning. Joining me and Deb on the call is John Klinger.\nI'd like to begin today by recognizing our global associates for their continued hard work and dedication. It is our associates who bring our business to life every day for our customers, and I want to thank them for their strong commitment to our business especially our store, distribution and fulfillment center associates.\nNow to our first quarter results. I am very pleased with our strong sales and our well above planned profitability. Our 3% overall comp sales growth was at the high end of our plan and driven by an increase in customer traffic. I am particularly pleased with the performance at Marmaxx, which delivered mid-single-digit increases in both comp store sales and customer traffic. Further, we saw comp sales and traffic increases at both of our international divisions. I also want to highlight the continued strength of our apparel and accessories businesses across the company.\nIn terms of profitability, both pretax profit margin and earnings per share increased versus last year and well exceeded our expectations. Importantly, merchandise margin was very healthy. With our strong profitability performance in the first quarter, we are raising both our full year pretax profit margin and earnings per share guidance. John will talk to this in a moment.\nOur first quarter results are a testament to the strength and resiliency of our flexible off-price business model. I am very pleased with the excellent execution of our teams across the company whose collective efforts brought our shoppers great values and a compelling treasure hunt shopping experience every day. Our buyers took advantage of amazing deals in the marketplace, and the organization flowed product to the right stores at the right time and did a great job of merchandising the product, delivering on customer satisfaction and marketing. We're happy with our good start to the second quarter and are in a great position to take advantage of the phenomenal buying environment and ship fresh selections to our stores and online. Going forward, we are excited about the opportunities we see to gain market share in the U.S. and internationally, and continue to improve the profitability of TJX.\nBefore I continue, I'll turn the call over to John to cover our first quarter financial results in more detail.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Ernie, and good morning, everyone. I also want to add my gratitude to all of our global associates for their continued hard work.\nI'll start with some additional details on the first quarter. As Ernie mentioned, our overall comp store sales increased 3% at the high end of our plan. This comp sales increase was driven by customer traffic, with average ticket up for the quarter. Again, our overall apparel business, including accessories, continued its momentum with comp growth up mid-single digits. Overall, home sales were down as we continue to cycle the outsized sales we saw during the pandemic.\nTJX net sales grew to $11.8 billion, a 3% increase versus the first quarter of fiscal '23. On a constant currency basis, first quarter sales were up 5%. First quarter consolidated pretax profit margin of 10.3% was up 90 basis points versus last year's adjusted 9.4% and well above our plan. Gross margin was up 100 basis points and driven by an increase in merchandise margin. The benefit from lower freight costs was significantly more than we expected. Once again, [ mark-on ] was strong due to better buying.\nUnfavorable hedges, our year-over-year shrink accrual and supply chain investments were headwinds to the gross margin in the first quarter. As a reminder, we are planning to shrink flat in fiscal '24 versus fiscal '23. Our plans this year assume an expected headwind in the first, second and third quarters and an expected benefit in the fourth quarter.\nSG&A increased 60 basis points. Less than half of this increase was due to incremental store wage costs. And net interest income benefited pretax profit margin by 50 basis points. I want to note that our above-plan pretax profit margin performance was primarily driven by an unanticipated benefit from a freight accrual adjustment, better-than-expected freight rates in our freight initiatives as well as the timing of some expenses.\nLastly, we are very pleased that earnings per share of $0.76 were up 12% versus last year's adjusted $0.68 and also well above our expectations.\nMoving to our first quarter divisional performance. At Marmaxx, first quarter comp store sales increased a very strong 5% over a 3% increase last year. We are very pleased to see a mid-single-digit increase in Marmaxx's customer traffic. Once again, Marmaxx's apparel business, including accessories, had a high single-digit comp increase. Marmaxx's first quarter segment profit margin was 14%, up 80 basis points versus last year. We are extremely pleased with the momentum of our largest division as sales and traffic were consistent across each of Marmaxx's regions. We continue to see an excellent opportunity for Marmaxx to capture additional market share across the U.S.\nHomeGoods' first quarter comp store sales decreased 7% as it continues to cycle the outsized sales we saw during the pandemic, specifically fiscal 2022's first quarter 40% comp sales increase. HomeGoods' first quarter segment profit margin was 7.3%, up 130 basis points. We expect HomeGoods' year-over-year comp sales to improve for the remainder of fiscal '24. We continue to see a terrific opportunity to capture additional share of the U.S. home market. In the first quarter, we opened our 900th HomeGoods store and continue to see excellent opportunities to grow both our HomeGoods and Homesense banners.\nAt TJX Canada, comp store sales were up 1% and driven by customer traffic. Segment profit margin on a constant currency basis was 11.2%. As the only major brick-and-mortar off-price retailer in Canada, we benefit from excellent customer awareness of our brands. We continue -- we are confident that we are set up extremely well to continue our growth plans and attract even more shoppers to our banners.\nAt TJX International, comp store sales increased 4% and customer traffic was also up. It was great to see strong sales in our European business especially in a challenging macroeconomic environment. In Australia, comp store sales were outstanding and continue to grow, and we continue to grow our footprint in that country. Segment profit margin for TJX International on a constant currency basis was 2.7%. Going forward, we continue to see a path to improve profitability for this division as we plan to grow our footprint in our existing countries and leverage our infrastructure.\nAs to e-commerce, overall, it remains a very small percentage of our business. We continue to add new brands and categories to our sites [indiscernible] so that shoppers can see something new every time they visit.\nMoving to inventory. Balance sheet inventory was down 8% versus first quarter of fiscal '23. Importantly, this year-over-year decline is primarily due to the elevated levels we saw last year from a larger in-transit balance as a result of supply chain delays. We feel great about our balance sheet and store inventory levels. We are confident that we are strongly positioned to take advantage of the outstanding buying environment and flow fresh assortments to our stores and online this summer.\nI'll finish with our liquidity and shareholder distributions. For the first quarter, we generated $745 million in operating cash flow and ended the quarter with $5 billion in cash. After the quarter ended, we paid down $500 million of maturing debt. In the first quarter, we returned $841 million to shareholders through our buyback and dividend programs.\nNow I'll turn it back to Ernie.\n\nErnie L. Herrman\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The TJX Cos., Inc.\n\nThanks, John.\nToday, I'd like to highlight our confidence in our growth plans and why we are convinced that we are in a great position to capture additional market share in the U.S. and internationally.\nFirst, we are confident that the appeal of our value proposition will continue to resonate with consumers. Over the past 46 plus years, our continued focus on value has served us extremely well through many kinds of economic environments, including periods of inflation and through recessionary times. In an ever-evolving retail landscape, we believe our commitment to offer great value every day will continue to attract shoppers to each of our retail banners.\nSecond, we see our differentiated treasure hunt shopping experience as a tremendous advantage. Our stores receive multiple deliveries each week of fresh, branded merchandise to surprise and excite our customers. With our rapidly changing assortment, shoppers are inspired to visit us frequently to see what's new.\nThird, we see ourselves as leaders in flexibility. The flexibility of our buying allows us to seek out the best opportunities and hottest trends in the marketplace. Our store formats and fixtures allow us to flex our floor space to support our opportunistic buying. Further, our systems and the flexibility of our supply chain allow us to merchandise stores individually with a curated mix of good, better and best brands with a wide span of price points.\nAll of this allows us to attract consumers across wide income and age demographics in each of the countries that we operate in. Our broad demographic reach across income levels can open up even more opportunities for us in the product marketplace. Further, we continue to attract an outsized number of younger customers to our stores including many Gen Z and millennial shoppers, which we believe bodes well for the future. We believe our ability to flex our product offerings across a vast array of category brands helps us attract a wider shopping audience than many other retailers.\nNext, we see the potential to grow our global store base by more than 1,400 additional stores over the long term with just our current banners in our current countries. Giving us confidence are the opportunities we see for real estate and our disciplined approach to selecting locations.\nNext, and I can't emphasize this enough, we are extremely confident that there will be more than enough inventory available in the marketplace to support our growth plans. Over the last year, our more than 1,200 global buyers have sourced merchandise from a universe of approximately 21,000 vendors, including many new ones. Overall availability of quality branded merchandise has never been an issue for us throughout our history as vendors and brands continue to produce goods from multiple channels, including in-store, online and direct-to-consumer. In fact, many vendors want to work with TJX due to our size, scale and buying power. As a growing global retailer with nearly 5,000 stores, we offer vendors a very attractive way to grow their business and clear their excess inventory quickly and discretely.\nLastly, I truly believe that the depth of our off-price knowledge and expertise within TJX is unmatched. We have a highly differentiated global business and have developed a specialized talent and teams to support it. We have many leaders with decades of off-price experience and remain focused on developing newer associates and the next generation of leaders within our organization. We take great pride in our TJX University and other training programs. Our deep bench allows us to deploy teams where needed and rotate talent between divisions and geographies, all of which strengthens our company as we continue to pursue our goals for growth. As I look at the retail industry today, I believe our best-in-class organization is a major advantage.\nMoving to profitability. Again, we are extremely pleased with our well above planned first quarter performance and have increased our pretax profit margin expectations for fiscal 2024. We are confident about our ability to achieve our 10.6% pretax profit margin target by fiscal '25 and we'll continue to strive to exceed it over the long term.\nTurning to corporate responsibility. We continue to focus our global corporate responsibility reporting under 4 key pillars: Workplace, communities, environmental sustainability and responsible business. We recently updated our corporate website, TJX.com, with our 2022 efforts across several of these areas. We encourage you to look more on our website, and we expect to release our updated global corporate responsibility report later this year.\nI'm also proud to share that TJX was recently named to Newsweek's list of America's Greatest Workplaces for Diversity for 2023 as well as Forbes Magazine's list of America's Best Employers for Diversity. As always, I'm grateful to our teams around the globe for the work they do to support our global corporate responsibility efforts.\nSumming up, our strong first quarter results highlight the continued appeal of our branded merchandise, terrific values and the excellent execution across the organization. I want to again recognize and thank all of our global associates whose collective efforts drove our strong performance. We feel great about our plans for the remainder of the year. While our business is not immune to macro factors, I am convinced that the characteristics and flexibility of our off-price business model and the depth of our organization's expertise will remain important advantages. Looking ahead, I am convinced that we have a long runway for growth and are set up well to capitalize on the opportunities we see to drive sales and traffic, improve profitability and capture market share going forward.\nNow, I'll turn the call back to John to cover our full year and second quarter guidance, and then we'll open it up for questions.\n\nJohn Klinger\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks again, Ernie.\nBefore I start, I want to remind you that fiscal '24 calendar includes a 53rd week. Also, as we stated in our press releasing, we will be offering eligible former TJX associates who have not yet commenced their pension benefit an opportunity to receive a lump sum payout of their vested pension benefit. We anticipate that the impact of this pension payout offer, primarily a noncash settlement charge, could negatively impact fiscal '24 EPS by approximately $0.01 to $0.02, but could be higher or lower depending on participation rates and other factors. To be clear, all of the guidance we are providing today does not include the potential impact of this pension payout offer. We expect to exclude the impact of this potential settlement charge from our adjusted pretax profit margin and EPS results in the third quarter.\nNow to our full year guidance. We continue to expect an overall comp store sales increase of 2% to 3%. As a reminder, our comp guidance will exclude expected sales from the 53rd week. For the full year, we expect consolidated sales to be in the range of $52.7 billion to $53.2 billion, a 6% to 7% increase over the prior year. This guidance assumes approximately $800 million of additional revenue expected from the 53rd week. As Ernie said, we are increasing our full year profitability guidance. We're now planning full year pretax profit margin to be in the range of 10.3% to 10.5%. Excluding an expected benefit of approximately 10 basis points from the 53rd week, we now expect adjusted pretax profit margin to be in the range of 10.2% to 10.4%. On a 52-week basis, this would represent an increase of 50 to 70 basis points versus fiscal '23 adjusted pretax profit margin of 9.7%.\nOur full year pretax profit margin guidance assumes that we will now see a benefit of more than 100 basis points from lower freight expenses. Our current freight assumption includes a pull forward of some of the benefit we previously -- we expected in FY '25. This includes favorable freight rates and benefits from some of our freight initiatives. These, along with the freight accrual favorability in the first quarter that I mentioned earlier, is driving the increase in our full year freight benefit assumption. Our full year pretax profit margin guidance also assumes that we will see a continued benefit from better buying and that we continue to have in that we will continue to have headwinds from incremental store and distribution center wages and supply chain investments.\nFurther, this pretax profit margin guidance continues to assume that shrink will remain similar to last year. In the first quarter, we took actions to secure more of our store merchandise through tagging, tethering and casing. We also increased our loss prevention presence more broadly across our banners. We are laser-focused on our shrink initiatives and continue to look for additional ways to mitigate the impact. As a reminder, we won't know the full effect of these actions until we do a full annual inventory count at the end of the year.\nFor modeling purposes, we're currently assuming a full year tax rate of 26%, net interest income of about $135 million and a weighted average share count of approximately $1.16 billion. As a result of these assumptions, we're increasing our full year earnings per share guidance to a range of $3.49 to $3.58. Excluding an expected benefit of approximately $0.10 from the 53rd week, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.39 to $3.48. On a 52-week basis, this would represent an increase of 9% to 12% versus fiscal '23 adjusted earnings per share of $3.11.\nMoving to the second quarter. We are planning overall comp store sales growth to be up 2% to 3%. We expect second quarter consolidated sales to be in the range of $12.3 billion to $12.4 billion, a 4% to 5% increase over the prior year. We are planning second quarter pretax profit margin to be in the range of 9.3% to 9.5%. This guidance assumes a significant benefit from lower freight costs as well as a benefit from better buying. It also includes ongoing headwinds from incremental wage costs and supply chain investments.\nWhen looking at our second quarter pretax profit margin guidance sequentially versus the first quarter, I want to remind you that our first quarter pretax profit margin benefited from a favorable freight accrual adjustment that won't repeat in the second quarter. Further, in the second quarter, we are expecting a reversal of most of the first quarter timing of expense benefit that -- as well as a bigger impact from wage costs and supply chain investments.\nFor modeling purposes, we are currently assuming a second quarter tax rate of 26.2%, net interest income of about $37 million and a weighted average share count of approximately $1.16 billion. We expect second quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.72 to $0.75, up 4% to 9% versus last year.\nLastly, on a 52-week basis, our implied guidance for the second half of the year assumes that pretax profit margin will be in the range of 10.6% to 10.8%. Our outlook also implies that overall comp store sales growth will be up 2% to 3%, and on a 52-week basis, earnings per share will be in the range of $1.91 to $1.97 for the second half of the year.\nIn closing, I want to emphasize that we are in a great position, both operationally and financially to take advantage of the opportunities we see to grow our business. We plan to continue making important investments in our business while simultaneously returning significant cash to our shareholders.\nNow we are happy to take your questions. As we do every quarter, we ask that you please limit your questions to one per person so we can keep the call on schedule and answer as many questions as we can. Thanks, and now we'll open it up for questions.",

Welcome to The TJX Companies Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, February 23, 2022. I would like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Ernie Herrman, Chief Executive Officer and President of The TJX Companies, Inc. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nErnie L. Herrman\n\nCEO, President & Director, The TJX Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Missy. Before we begin, Deb has some opening comments.\n\nDebra McConnell\n\nSVP of Global Communications, The TJX Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ernie, and good morning.\nThe forward-looking statements we make today about the company's results and plans are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results and the implementation of the company's plans to vary materially. These risks are discussed in the company's SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Form 10-K filed March 31, 2021. Further, these comments and the Q&A that follows are copyrighted today by The TJX Companies, Inc. Any recording, retransmission, reproduction or other use of the same for profit or otherwise without prior consent of TJX is prohibited and a violation of United States copyright and other laws.\nAdditionally, while we have approved the publishing of a transcript of this call by a third party, we take no responsibility for inaccuracies that may appear in that transcript.\nThank you. And now I'll turn it back over to Ernie.\n\nErnie L. Herrman\n\nCEO, President & Director, The TJX Companies, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Joining me and Deb on the call is Scott Goldenberg.\nI'd like to start the call today by expressing my gratitude to all of our global associates for their continued hard work and dedication to TJX. For the past 2 years, our associates have gone above and beyond to operate our business through unprecedented times while also adapting to the constantly changing retail environment. I want to give special recognition to those associates who have been physically coming into work in our stores and distribution centers. In recognition of their efforts, we awarded a vast majority of them a discretionary appreciation bonus again this quarter.\nNow to an overview of our fourth quarter and full year results. I want to emphasize in the areas we directly control, like buying, store and distribution operations, our pricing strategy and our initiatives to drive traffic and sales, our execution was excellent due to the monumental efforts of our associates across the company.\nMoving to the details. I am extremely pleased with our top line performance in the fourth quarter. U.S. open-only comp store sales increased a very strong 13% when compared to fiscal 2020 or calendar year 2019. U.S. comp sales were trending higher than this before the surge in Omicron cases. This quarter represents the fourth consecutive quarter that U.S. open-only comp sales increased low teens or better.\nComps at our U.S. home banners and in our home categories were excellent, and our Marmaxx apparel comp was up high single digits. Clearly, consumers continue to seek out our retail banners for exciting gifts and amazing values this holiday season.\nFor the full year, U.S. open-only comp store sales increased an outstanding 17%. Overall, TJX sales of $48.5 billion were almost $7 billion more than in fiscal 2020. We are convinced that we captured significant market share, particularly in the U.S. where our stores were open the entire year, and we leveraged the strength and flexibility of our off-price business model.\nI want to highlight the excellent execution and collaboration of our buying, planning, distribution, logistics and store operations teams. They work together strategically to strategically buy goods earlier than we typically do to ensure the consistent flow of exciting merchandise to our stores and online to support our outstanding sales throughout the year.\nAs a result, we offer consumers a great selection of branded quality merchandise at excellent values all year long.\nGoing forward, we are laser-focused on our sales and profitability initiatives and remain committed to corporate responsibility. Again, we feel great about the areas of our business that we directly control and we'll continue to look for ways to mitigate the expense pressures currently impacting our business.\nFurther, in an inflationary environment, we believe more consumers will be seeking out our values. Importantly, I am as confident as ever in the medium- and long-term outlook for TJX. We are the off-price leader in every country we operate in and believe we are in an excellent position to capture additional market share in these regions for many years to come.\nBefore I continue, I'll turn the call over to Scott to go over and cover our fourth quarter and full year results in more detail.\n\nScott Goldenberg\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, The TJX Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ernie, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to echo Ernie's comments and express our sincere gratitude to all of our global associates for their continued hard work.\nI'll start today with some additional details on our fourth quarter results. As Ernie mentioned, U.S. open-only comp store sales grew 13% over a strong 6% increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. Overall, open-only comp store sales increased 10%, also over a 6% increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. Open-only comp store sales growth was strongest in November and December. As COVID cases began to surge worldwide, we saw sales trends soften with the largest impact in January. The impact was greatest in our apparel businesses, which is consistent with what we have seen during previous COVID spikes.\nAdditionally, sales were impacted by government-mandated shopping restrictions that were put in place internationally. Overall, TJX sales increased by more than $1.6 billion to $13.9 billion, a 14% increase versus the fourth quarter of fiscal '20.\nIn the fourth quarter, we once again saw a very strong increase in our average basket across all our divisions, driven by customers putting more items into their cards. Overall, average ticket was up and improved for the fifth consecutive quarter. I also want to highlight that our U.S. customer traffic was up slightly.\nFourth quarter pretax margin was 9%, down 190 basis points versus fiscal '20. Similar to the third quarter, we saw extremely strong mark-on and significantly lower markdowns which include the benefit from our retail pricing strategy. However, merchandise margin in the fourth quarter was down primarily due to the 280 basis points of incremental freight, which was slightly higher than anticipated. We had an 80 basis point negative impact from full year -- from a full year true-up of shrink expense, which was significantly higher than we expected.\nPretax margin includes strong buying and occupancy leverage on our excellent sales, which was more than offset by approximately 160 basis points from the combination of incremental investments to expand distribution capacity and higher wage costs. In addition, net COVID costs negatively impacted pretax margin by an additional 50 basis points similar to the third quarter. Finishing up on the fourth quarter, earnings per share were $0.78.\nNow to our full year consolidated fiscal '22 results. U.S. open-only comp store sales grew 17% and overall open-only comp store sales increased 15% versus fiscal '20. Overall, TJX sales grew 16% compared to fiscal '20. Full year fiscal '22 pretax margins was 9.1%. Excluding a 50 basis point negative impact from a debt extinguishment charge, adjusted pretax margin was 9.6%.\nFull year pretax margin benefited from buying and occupancy leverage due to our outsized open-only comp store sales. We were very pleased that our full year merchandise margin was up despite 200 basis points of incremental freight. Our merchandise margin increase was driven by strong -- by strong mark-on and lower markdowns, which include the benefit from our retail pricing strategy.\nFull year pretax margin was negatively impacted by approximately 140 basis points from the combination of incremental investments to expand distribution capacity and higher wages and 80 basis points of net COVID costs. Full year GAAP earnings per share were $2.70, adjusted earnings per share were $2.85 which excludes a $0.15 debt extinguishment charge.\nMoving to inventory. Our balance sheet inventory was up 22% on a constant currency basis versus the fourth quarter of fiscal '20, primarily driven by higher in-transit inventory. We are very pleased with our per store inventory levels as they once again improved sequentially and were up versus fiscal '20. Availability of inventory is excellent and we are well positioned to flow fresh spring merchandise to our stores and online.\nI'll finish with our liquidity and shareholder distributions. For the full year, we generated $3.1 billion in operating cash flow, driven by record net income. We ended this year with $6.2 billion in cash. In fiscal '22, we returned $3.4 billion to shareholders through our buyback and dividend programs, which is the most we've returned to shareholders on an annual basis in our history.\nNow I will turn it back to Ernie.\n\nErnie L. Herrman\n\nCEO, President & Director, The TJX Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Scott.\nI'll pick it up with our fourth quarter and full year divisional performance. At Marmaxx, fourth quarter open-only comp store sales increased a very strong 10%. For November and December combined, Marmaxx comp sales increased low teens. For the full year, Marmaxx delivered an outstanding 13 open-only comp store sales increase and segment profit dollars increased more than $340 million or 10% versus fiscal '20. For the year, Marmaxx's home business posted a comp increase in line with HomeGoods and apparel comps were up high single digits.\nAverage basket was up significantly throughout the year and customer traffic was up as well. We are very pleased with the performance of our largest division, which delivered double-digit comp sales increases every quarter of the year and offer shoppers an excellent assortment of apparel and home merchandise throughout the year.\nAt HomeGoods, open-only comp store sales increased a remarkable 22% in the fourth quarter and were up high teens or better every month of the quarter. For the full year, HomeGoods delivered a phenomenal 32% open-only comp store sales increase and segment profit dollars increased more than $225 million or 33% versus fiscal '20.\nDuring the year, we saw consistent strength across all major categories and geographic regions for both HomeGoods and HomeSense. Further, both customer traffic and average basket increases were outstanding throughout the year. We are convinced that we captured additional share of the home market in 2021 as our eclectic mix of merchandise and great values continue to resonate with consumers.\nIn Canada, open-only comp store sales increased 1% in the fourth quarter and were up 8% for the full year. At TJX International, open-only comp sales were down 2% in the fourth quarter but up 6% for the year -- for the full year. Fourth quarter and full year sales and open-only comp sales at both divisions were negatively impacted by significant government-mandated shopping restrictions throughout the year.\nFor the full year, similar to the U.S., TJX Canada and TJX International's home businesses outperformed apparel and both divisions saw strong increases in their average basket. We remain confident that our International divisions are well positioned to capture additional market share over the long term.\nAs to our e-commerce businesses, we are very pleased with our overall sales growth in 2021. During the year, we added new categories and brands to each of our online banners and launched shopping on homegoods.com. While e-commerce only represents a very small percentage of our overall sales, we are very pleased to offer the U.S. and U.K. shoppers 24/7 access to our great brands and values.\nNow to some additional highlights from 2021. First, we took steps to improve our profitability and offset some of the persistent cost pressures we've been facing. Our primary initiative to raise retails on our merchandise is working very well. We are in the early stages of this initiative and believe there will be a multiyear opportunity for our business. Importantly, our customers tell us that our value proposition in the marketplace remains very strong and shoppers continue to see amazing values every time they visit.\nSecond, we opened thousands of new vendors in 2021 and continue to source from a universe of approximately 21,000 vendors around the globe. Our global buying presence continues to be a tremendous advantage. Further, we have strengthened our relationships with many of our existing vendors. With many retailers continuing to close stores and ongoing congestion in the supply chain, we offer vendors an attractive solution to clear excess product. Importantly, and I can't emphasize this enough, availability of quality branded merchandise is excellent across good, better and best brands.\nNext, we are confident that our marketing continues to help drive new and existing customers into our stores and online. The team has done an excellent job allocating our advertising dollars to the right mix of media channels and a constantly changing digital environment. Further, our customer satisfaction is strong, and we continue to attract new shoppers of all ages, including a large number of Gen Z and millennial shoppers which we believe bodes very well for the future.\nIn 2022, we are launching many new marketing campaigns across the globe that will continue to focus on our exceptional value and an inspirational shopping experience. Lastly, we made important investments to support the growth of the company. In 2021, we opened 117 new -- net new stores, relocated an additional 50 stores and remodeled over 300 stores. We also made necessary investments to expand our distribution capacity and productivity to support our rapidly growing top line and future growth.\nOur 2021 performance gives us great confidence in the outlook for our business, especially when we get back to a normalized environment. Once stores were open with no restrictions, each division saw very strong sales, attracted new shoppers and captured more spend per customer. Further, we see a path to improve profitability once the retail environment stabilizes and some of the expense headwinds begin to moderate. All of this tells us that we have an excellent opportunity to significantly grow our top and bottom lines over the medium and long term.\nI want to reiterate that we remain highly focused on improving our pretax margin profile. We continue to believe that our initiatives to drive sales are the best way to offset the current level of cost pressures we're facing. Further, we're very optimistic about our strategy to adjust retails while maintaining our value proposition to consumers. To be clear, our goal is to approach a double-digit pretax margin in the medium term and to return to our fiscal 2020 pretax margin level in the long term.\nTurning to corporate responsibility and ESG. I'll start by saying that the health and well-being of our associates and our customers remains a top priority as it has throughout the pandemic. I am so proud that while navigating the ongoing pandemic, our team hasn't skipped a beat in our other areas of corporate responsibility. Let me highlight a few initiatives from Q4.\nOne of the many ways we support the thousands of communities where we operate is through contributions to organizations focused on emergency relief efforts. This past quarter, we supported an organizations providing relief for people impacted by the Colorado and British Columbia wildfires and the Kentucky tornado. These contributions are in addition to our annual donations to Save The Children and Red Cross disaster relief.\nIn terms of inclusion and diversity, we launched our new mentoring program pilot and our new I&D advisory boards have begun meeting regularly. We also continued further our direct support to Black communities. This includes making donations to organizations committed to providing professional development for diverse leaders.\nFinally, as we continue to pursue initiatives that are both environmentally responsible and smart for our business, we are excited to share that we are making progress with plans to pursue additional even more aggressive environmental goals in several of our priority areas. I plan to discuss these in more detail on our next call. As always, we have more information on corporate responsibility at tjx.com.\nIn closing, I want to again thank each of our associates around the globe who helped us achieve our very strong results. I truly believe the depth of our off-price expertise and knowledge of our teams is unmatched. Going forward, we are excited about the sales and profitability opportunities we see for the business. We are confident in our plans for fiscal '23 and that our value proposition and the flexibility of our business will continue to be tremendous advantages.\nOur balance sheet is very strong, and we are in a great position to invest in the growth of our business and to take advantage of the excellent inventory in the marketplace and return significant cash to our shareholders. We feel great about our market share opportunities and our goal of becoming an increasingly profitable $60 billion plus revenue company.\nNow I'll turn the call back to Scott for a few additional comments, and then we'll open it up for questions. Scott?\n\nScott Goldenberg\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, The TJX Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ernie.\nMoving to guidance. First, in fiscal '23, we plan to report comp store sales growth versus fiscal '22 for our U.S. divisions only. As a reminder, we had temporary store closures and numerous shopping restrictions internationally during fiscal '22. Therefore, we do not have a reasonable baseline to report year-over-year comp store sales for our TJX Canada and TJX International divisions in fiscal '23.\nAs for the first quarter, we are planning U.S. comp store sales to be up 1% to 3% over an outside 17% U.S. open-only comp store sales increase last year. For the start of the first quarter, we are very pleased that our U.S. comp sales growth is strong as we are seeing excellent consumer demand for both our apparel and home categories. It's important to note that our guidance takes into account the acceleration of comp sales we saw during the first quarter last year. To start the first quarter, we are currently cycling U.S. open-only comp store sales increases of low to mid-single digits versus the 20% plus increase we'll soon be anniversarying for the March and April period combined.\nNext, we are planning total first quarter TJX sales in the range of $11.5 billion to $11.7 billion. In the first quarter, we're planning pretax margin in the range of 8.1% to 8.4%. We feel great about our merchandising margin opportunity and retail pricing strategy. However, we continue to expect elevated expense headwinds versus fiscal '22. We currently expect that level of incremental freight expense in fiscal '23 will be the highest in the first quarter at approximately 220 basis points. We're also expecting incremental wage costs to significantly impact our Q1 pretax margin.\nFor modeling purposes in the first quarter, we're currently anticipating a tax rate of 25.4%, net interest expense of about $19 million and a weighted average share count of approximately 1.2 billion.\nAs a result of these assumptions, we're planning first quarter EPS of $0.58 to $0.61 per share. As to the full year, we are planning a 3% to 4% U.S. comp sales increase over a 17% U.S. open-only comp increase last year. For the full year, we are planning total TJX sales in the range of $52.6 billion to $53.1 billion.\nIn regards to full year pretax margin, we're currently planning it to be close to fiscal '22's adjusted 9.6% margin. I want to highlight that this estimate implies that pretax margin in the last 9 months of the year will be close to double digits.\nWe feel great about our merchandise margin opportunity and retail pricing initiative. However, similar to other retailers, we continue to see cost increases from freight and wage. We now expect these costs to be higher than we had anticipated when we spoke to you last quarter. Currently, we are planning incremental freight expense of approximately 150 basis points and the incremental wage cost of about 100 basis points.\nThat said, our retail strategy is working very well and now expect a bigger benefit this year than we had anticipated. Currently, we expect it to offset a majority of these incremental freight and wage costs in fiscal '23. Importantly, I want to reiterate what Ernie said a few minutes ago, that our goal is to approach a double-digit pretax margin in the medium term. Further, on an annual basis, we believe we can deliver flat to increased margins on a 3% to 4% comp once expenses moderate significantly from these elevated levels.\nLastly, for modeling purposes for the full year, we're currently anticipating a tax rate of 25.8%, net interest expense of about $50 million and a weighted average share count of approximately 1.2 million -- billion. We are not providing EPS guidance for the full year at this time given the uncertainty around the expense [sales], but hope the mix we are sharing will be helpful for modeling purposes.\nMoving on to our fiscal '23 capital plans. We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. These include opening new stores, remodels, relocations and investments in our distribution, network and infrastructure.\nFor new stores, we plan to add about 170 new stores which would bring our year-end total to 4,850 stores. This would represent a store growth of about 3%. In the U.S., our plans call for -- to add about 55 stores at Marmaxx, 60 stores at HomeGoods, including 10 HomeSense stores and 20 Sierra stores. In Canada, we plan to add about 10 new stores. And at TJX International, we plan to open approximately 15 stores in Europe and approximately 10 stores in Australia.\nWe continue to feel great about our opportunity to grow our global store base. Long term, we believe we can grow our store base to 6,275 stores, which is nearly 1,600 more stores than today with our current retail banners in our current geographies.\nLastly, we plan to remodel 400-plus stores and relocate 50-plus stores in fiscal '23.\nAnd as to our fiscal '23 cash distribution plans, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders. As outlined in today's press release, we expect our Board of Directors will increase our current quarterly dividend by 13% to $0.295 per share. Additionally, in fiscal '23, we currently expect to buy that $2.25 billion to $2.5 billion of TJX stock.\nIn closing, over the last 2 years, we have successfully navigated our business through an unprecedented retail landscape and an increasingly inflationary environment. We believe the actions we've taken and the initiatives we put in place set us up extremely well to drive both top and bottom line growth for many years to come.\nI want to emphasize that we are confident about the opportunities for our business going forward. We have a strong balance sheet and continue to generate a tremendous amount of cash flow. We are in a great position to continue to investing and to support the growth of our business while simultaneously returning significant cash to our shareholders.\nNow we're going to -- we are happy to take your questions. (Operator Instructions) Thanks, and now we will open it up for questions.",

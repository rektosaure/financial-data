[Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to Sean Meakim, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nSean Christopher Meakim\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\n\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Vimal Kapur; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Stepniak. This webcast and the presentation materials, including non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our Investor Relations website.\nFrom time to time, we post new information that may be of interest or material to our investors on this website. Our discussion today includes forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the ones described in our SEC filings. This morning, we will review our financial results for the third quarter, share our guidance for the fourth quarter and provide an update on full year 2025.\nAs always, we'll leave time for your questions at the end. I'll turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Vimal Kapur.\n\nVimal M. Kapur\n\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer-Building Technologies, Honeywell International, Inc.\n\nThank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. Honeywell continued its strong 2025 performance in third quarter. Growth in organic sales took another step up and finished ahead of expectations driven by our commitment to developing new solutions that solve our customers' most challenging problems. Better top line results translated into earnings well above our guided range, while strong orders across the portfolio demonstrate early results of our focus on innovation.\nOur excellent third quarter performance is powering another increase in our full year guidance. We are raising our 2025 EPS guide for the third time this year even as we incorporate the impact of embedding spin-off of Solstice Advanced Materials. Barely 1 year since we announced our intent to separate Advanced Materials today, we are a week out from Solstice's first day of trading as an independent company. Our swift progress to this point demonstrate our ability to diligently execute carefully crafted work plans with speed and efficacy. We have the right resources in place to deliver on both our portfolio transformation and our businesses, financial and operational targets. We will carry the learnings and momentum from Solstice to next year's separation of Aerospace.\nAs we look to our future as 3 independent companies in 2026, we are proactively planning to realign the structure of our Automation business at the beginning of next year to reflect how we will operate going forward. This move is another significant step in our simplification of Honeywell, which will provide the strategic focus, organizational agility and tailored capital allocation to grow faster and drive value for all our stakeholders.\nPlease turn to Slide 3 for the latest update of our separation. A couple of weeks ago, Solstice held a well-attended Investor Day in New York, where David Swell and his new management team presented a compelling vision for the new Specialty Materials company and how its history and new independent strategy will unleash its growth potential and unlock long-term stakeholder value.\nA week from today on October 30, Honeywell shareholders will receive new shares of Solstice, which will begin trading as a separate public company. I want to thank the team to achieve this important milestone well ahead of the original schedule to complete by early 2026. I'm extremely excited for the opportunities in front of Solstice, and I will be cheering on the success in the years ahead.\nAs our planned separation of Aerospace in the second half of 2026 approaches, our Board has been intently focused on assembling a Honeywell Aerospace leadership team with a right mix of industry, company and capital market experiences to maximize value for our customers partners, employees and our shareowners. [indiscernible] to make an aerospace leadership and headquarter announcement later this year. The separation of Aerospace brings the opportunity to further simplify Honeywell Automation. As a result, we have proactively designed a new, simpler structure aligned to the future of the business, which I will discuss in more detail in the next slide.\nAs we seek to better position the future independent Aerospace and Automation companies for success, we have opportunistically completed transaction to simplify the legacy liabilities left on our balance sheet. During the third quarter, we entered into an agreement to divest all our Bendix [indiscernible] liability on attractive terms for all parties. We also terminated an indemnification and reimbursement agreement with Resideo in exchange for $1.6 billion in cash. In combination, these transactions resulted in net cash inflow and to simplify and derisk balance sheet, providing the company with fewer administrative burdens and greater financial flexibility to focus on creating value for our core business.\nOn Slide 4, I will go over segment realignment in more details. We announced yesterday that we are planning to reorganize the Honeywell Automation segment into a simplified structure focused on cohesive synergetic business models. I'm pleased to take this next step in evolving Honeywell's streamline portfolio with the aim of unlocking incremental value and driving long-term growth and margin expansion. As such, effective beginning of first quarter of 2026, we plan to report 4 business segments. Aerospace Technologies, Building Automation, Process Automation and Technology and Industrial Automation. Ahead of upcoming Aerospace separation, this new structure serve as an elegant way to continue simplifying the RemainCo portfolio and align our external segment to the way we are increasingly driving our operations through consistent business models.\nOur differentiated approach underscores our ability to grow our installed base in two ways. By selling mission-critical products through channels and by delivering strategic projects for our customers. We then mine this installed base by providing customers with high-value outcome-based solution with a combination of software and services. The three RemainCo reporting segment will be organized into 6 strategic business units with each of our businesses aligned to our unified automation strategy, enabling us to solve enterprise level challenges and help our customers achieve a new level of optimization with the Honeywell Forge platform.\nAerospace reporting is unchanged ahead of separation in the second half of the next year. The new structure will allow us to better prioritize R&D efforts, capital expenditure and go-to-market strategy with a growth mindset. Building Automation will continue to be a leading provider of Unified Building Automation Solution, delivering safer more sustainable, integrated buildings and infrastructure assets and [indiscernible] in its Products and Solutions business unit structure.\nProcess Automation and Technology is a combination of core Honeywell Process Solutions and UOP, the global leader in process technology. These businesses have developed powerful commercial synergies, enjoy a leading position in process market globally with vast installed base and share very similar business model characteristics. PA&T will report projects and aftermarket business units. Industrial Automations portfolio of products and Solutions businesses include mission-critical offering with proven reliability and tenured channel relationship positioning us to benefit from ongoing global re-shoring thematics.\nWith this realignment following the separation of Aerospace next year, Honeywell will be a premier pure-play automation company, leading the future of automation through high ROI outcome-based solution for customers, across a large addressable set of markets. And as we continue our journey of transforming the portfolio, I would like to highlight another lever of value creation with the recently announced Quantinuum capital raise on Slide 5.\nFour years ago, we formed the world's most advanced full stack quantum computing company. It has rapidly progressed quantum technology along the path to universal for tolerant computing, a more than 2-decade pursuits than it is soon to be realized. Technological progress has driven fundraising momentum. Less than 2 years after completing an equity capital raise at a $5 billion pre-money valuation, the company announced in September a second raise at double the prior valuation. As important as the capital contributions will be to advancing the development of quantum computing at scale, the collaboration with new shareholders such as Quanta and NVIDIA in addition to others like JPMorgan, Amgen and Mitsui may prove even more critical. Quantinuum's fundraising efforts have led to new partnership that will support the development of critical applications for improving drug discovery, garment and military cyber security and encryption for large financial institutions.\nWhile we are tremendously excited about the future of the business, we recognize we are not the best long-term owner, and it will eventually need its own capital structure to fully exploit its growth potential. As a result, Honeywell will seek to begin monetizing its stake in the company at the appropriate time in a manner that will create meaningful value for Honeywell shareowners. The most recent capital raise will sustain Quantinuum through that point in time.\nI will now turn the call over to Mike to go through our third quarter results beginning on Slide 6.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nVice President of Corporate Finance\n\nThank you, Vimal, and good morning. Honeywell delivered exceptional third quarter results, again, meeting the high end of organic growth and adjusted earnings per share [indiscernible] quarter this year. Organic sales accelerated to 6% year-over-year, led by return to double-digit growth in Aerospace and fourth straight quarter of high single-digit growth in Building Automation. Orders grew 22% organically from the previous year to $11.9 billion. While wins for long-cycle Aerospace and Energy projects led the way, the increase was broad-based with order growth accelerating each of our 4 segments and an overall book-to-bill above 1.\nThe results are encouraging and an early demonstration of our focus on growth through innovative new products and the impact of our increased R&D investments. This impressive commercial performance pushed our backlog up to yet another record which positions us well for future growth. Segment profit increased 5% from the prior year, with segment margin meeting the high end of our guidance range, led by ongoing margin expansion in Building Automation. Earnings per share in the third quarter was $2.86, up 32% from the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share was $2.82, up 9% year-over-year. As strong segment profit growth and lower effective tax rate more than offset higher interest expense.\nYou can find additional information on the year-over-year changes in the third quarter adjusted earnings per share in the appendix of our presentation. Third quarter free cash flow was $1.5 billion, down 16% from the prior year because of a capital expenditures timing and modestly higher working capital to support our sales growth. We maintain our disciplined capital allocation approach in the quarter, returning $800 million to shareholders while committing $400 million to high-return capital projects and completing 2 technology tuck-in acquisitions.\nNow let's move to Slide 7 for a discussion of our third quarter segment performance. I will provide a brief overview of results with additional commentary included on the right-hand side of the slide. Aerospace Technologies grew 12% organically led by strength in both commercial aftermarket and defense space. Commercial OE returned to growth as expected as our sales recoupled to the delivery rates of our large customers. Orders momentum continued with strong double-digit orders growth across all three end markets, and book-to-bill of 1.2. On a year-over-year basis, segment margin decreased 160 basis points to 26.1% as commercial excellence and volume leverage were more than offset by cost inflation and acquisition-related headwinds.\nHowever, sequentially, margin improved 60 basis points on strong quarter-over-quarter volumes supported by improved supply chain performance. Industrial Automation sales returned to growth in the third quarter, increasing 1% organically and exceeding our guidance range led by continued strength in our Sensing business. Segment margin in [indiscernible] Automation declined 150 basis points from the prior year, to 18.8% as commercial excellence and productivity benefits were more than offset by inflationary pressures. Building Automation again delivered high single-digit growth for the quarter. Organic sales increased 7% from the previous year, driven by strength in both building solutions and building products.\nRegionally, North America and the Middle East led while Europe grew organically for a fourth consecutive quarter. Margin expanded 80 basis points year-over-year as we leverage our strong volume performance. Energy and Sustainability solutions performed in line with expectations in the third quarter, down 2% organically. Strong [indiscernible] performance Advanced Materials was offset by licensing and catalyst delivery delays in UOP. Segment margin was flat versus the prior year at 24.5% as one-time government reimbursement for past legal cost and the lift from margin-accretive acquisition [indiscernible] cost and volume headwinds. Let's turn now to Slide 8 to discuss our updated outlook for the year.\nOur guidance for the year now incorporates the impact of Solstice separation from Honeywell at the end of October. The spin is expected to reduce 2025 sales by $700 million. Adjusted earnings per share by approximately $0.21 and free cash flow by $200 million. Even with this impact, we're again raising our 2025 organic sales and adjusted earnings per share guidance as we fully pass through our strong third quarter segment profit and net income growth into our improved outlook. On a like-for-like basis, our free cash flow expectations for the year remain unchanged.\nNow I'll turn to Slide 9 to provide more deals on fourth quarter and full year guidance. We're taking up full year organic sales growth guidance by 150 basis points from the midpoint of our previous range. We now expect growth of approximately 6% for the year or 5% when excluding the prior year impact from the Bombardier agreement. This new outlook built upon our strong sales momentum in recent quarters, while maintaining a pragmatic approach in the face of elevated geopolitical tensions and macro uncertainty. Full year sales are now projected to be $40.7 billion to $40.9 billion. We anticipate a fourth quarter organic sales growth of 8% to 10% or 4% to 6%, excluding Bombardier, which translates to sales of $10.1 billion to $10.3 billion. For the full year, we now expect our [indiscernible] segment margin to be up 30 to 40 basis points or to be down 40 to 30 points, excluding Bombardier. We're anticipating modestly lower margins versus prior guidance, a result of reduced expectations for project licensing, Catalyst shipments and [indiscernible] short-cycle Industrial Automation products, which kept high incremental margins.\nWe are offsetting most of these headwinds by leveraging our strong volume growth and utilizing our accelerator operating model to implement productivity actions. In the fourth quarter, we expect segment margin to be in the range of 22.5% to 22.8%, up 160 to 190 basis points or down 120 to 90 basis points, excluding Bombardier. We now anticipate full year earnings per share of $10.60 to $10.70, up 7% to 8% or up 5% to 6%, excluding the impact of both the 2024 Bombardier agreement and the impending Solstice spin-off.\nEarnings per share in the fourth quarter is expected to be $2.52 to $2.62, up 2% to 6% from the prior year or down 6% to 3%, excluding the effects of Bombardier and Solstice. I will give additional details on changes to the full year EPS guidance later in my prepared remarks. We expect cash flow between $5.2 billion and $5.6 billion, down 2% to up 5% excluding the effects of Bombardier and Solstice. We provide additional information on the changes in the year-over-year free cash flow in the appendix of the presentation.\nFor the first 3 quarters of the year, we have deployed $9 billion for share repurchases, acquisitions, dividends and capital projects. Going forward, we will continue to be opportunistic in allocating additional capital beyond that already committed to the highest return opportunities. Please turn to Slide 10 for details on our segment level outlook for the year.\nIn Aerospace Technologies, we are raising our expectation for full year sales growth to be low double-digit range, or high single digits when excluding the impact of the 2024 Bombardier agreement. We expect robust defense and space growth to continue as our supply chain is moving and our global demand is benefiting from ramping national defense budgets. Commercial aftermarket sale should expand at a healthy rate with [indiscernible] growth outpacing business aviation. We anticipate commercial OE sales growth to accelerate for the remainder of the year as our shipments progressively realign to build schedules. For the fourth quarter, we expect Aero organic sales to be up double digits or high single digits, excluding Bombardier, led by Defense and Space. Commercial aftermarket growth should moderate from third quarter levels towards the longer-term trend. Excluding the year-over-year impact of Bombardier, Commercial OE should grow faster than the prior quarter. We anticipate the second quarter marked the low point of Aerospace margins and fourth quarter margins will be comparable to deferred.\nFor the full year, margins are expected to be approximately 26% as volume leverage is more than offset by transitory integration headwinds from the case acquisition and cost inflation from tariff pressures temporarily outpacing pricing. In 2026 as pricing aligns with tariff costs. OE shipments of Electronic Solutions recoupled with build rates and integration costs from the Case acquisition subside, Aerospace margins are well positioned to increase from 2025 levels. For Industrial Automation, third quarter outperformance is compelling us to raise our full year top line expectations for a second consecutive quarter from down low to mid-single digits to down only low single digits. Positive order growth in the third quarter was encouraging. So it was uneven within both long- and short-cycle businesses, such that it would not yet be prudent to confirm a sustainable upward trend.\nAs a result of these mix dynamics and a more challenging prior year comparison, we expect fourth quarter sales to be down low single digits. Continued momentum in smart energy and steady performance in Sensing and Warehouse automation should offset modest demand headwinds in Productivity Solutions and Services and short-term project pushouts in core process solutions. We now expect to see margin contraction in Industrial Automation for the full year on increasingly unfavorable mix with similar margin performance in the fourth quarter.\nIn Building Automation, we continue to anticipate full year organic sales growth in the mid-single-digit to high single-digit range, supported by strength in the U.S., Middle East and India, and highlighted by robust demand in data centers, healthcare and hospitality. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be up mid-single digits with momentum from strong order across both products and solutions. Anticipate a fifth consecutive quarter of organic growth for products to be broad-based across 5 BMS and security. Solutions should continue to drive solid year-over-year growth in both projects and services. We expect margins for the full year and the fourth quarter to expand meaningfully as tailwinds from volume leverage and probability actions continue.\nIn Energy and Sustainability Solutions, we will limit our guidance commentary on Advanced Materials, given its pending separation as an independent company. We are maintaining our full year ESS sales growth guidance of flat to up slightly and anticipate fourth quarter sales to be down low single digits year-over-year. A difficult macro backdrop for Energy has weighed on our near-term guidance, but the long-term outlook remains strong. A third quarter increase in UOP orders of 9% is a signal of growing underlying demand from our customers, and we have good visibility into projects order strength continuing. On segment margin, we anticipate a meaningful fourth quarter contraction, resulting in a roughly 1 point reduction for the full year. Lower high-margin [indiscernible] in licensing sales are offsetting commercial excellence and uplift from the LNG and [indiscernible] acquisitions. While cost inflation market headwinds have presented a margin challenge in 2025, we're taking meaningful steps to address ESS cost structure and expect to return to margin expansion in 2026.\nLet's move to Slide 11 to go through updates on our 2025 EPS walk. Our earnings growth attribution comment separate out the year-over-year impact of Solstice spin-off at the end of the month, which is anticipated to reduce adjusted earnings per share by $0.21. We now expect segment profit growth, both organic and contribution from acquisitions to add $0.63 to adjusted EPS for the full year. $ 0.10 better than our previous view as we fully flow through better-than-anticipated third quarter operating results. Third quarter out-performance versus the point of our guidance range benefited from a lower effective tax rate and reduced below-the-line expenses, which were also benefiting the full year. Fourth quarter segment profit contributions to earnings are in line with our prior expectations as better Aerospace growth offsets margin headwinds in Energy and Sustainability Solutions and Industrial Automation, as discussed earlier.\nWe anticipate reduced year-over-year below-the-line headwinds of $0.39 per share as repositioning will be at the low end of our prior range. Additional below-the-line details are available in the appendix of the presentation. We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be 19% compared to 20% previously, adding $0.30 to adjusted earnings per share.\nTo summarize, we anticipate 2025 adjusted EPS grew at a mid-single-digit rate when excluding the impact of the Solstice spin and Bombardier agreement. Now I'll hand the call over to Vimal to finish our prepared comments on Slide 12.\n\nVimal M. Kapur\n\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer-Building Technologies, Honeywell International, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike. Honeywell again exceeded its financial commitment in the third quarter as Aerospace execution returned that business to double-digit year-over-year growth, with orders increasing in each of our 4 segments, we are getting good returns from dedicating the right level of resources to creating new solutions to sell into our large global customer base. As just one example of our recent commercial success, Gulfstream recently announced that Honeywell's engines and avionics will power its new super midsized G300 business jet platform, which will offer superior range, efficiency and safety to [indiscernible] comparable aircraft. This win is a testament of our ability to stay at the forefront of leading-edge technologies that matter most to our customers. We are heading into the final quarter of 2025 from a position of strength with operating momentum leading us to raise our guidance for the third time this year, even as a shifting micro environment requires a high level of agility to deliver these results.\nWe are pleased by the performance of our acquisitions since 2023, which continue to help us shape our portfolio and deliver higher growth and margins. Our commercial and operational momentum are building into 2026, which will be a historic one for Honeywell. At the same time, we are operating with the same commitment to operational excellence that has defined Honeywell for decades.\nWhile 2025 was affected by a number of headwinds, including heightened economic uncertainty, incremental tariffs and significant cost inflation, we have already begun taking action to position our Aerospace and Automation businesses to return to underlying margin expansion in 2026, as we prepare Aerospace to begin a journey as a leading independent company next year, we expect to begin 2026 operating under a new structure that aligns to how we will deliver the future of automation, giving us a running start post separation. Increasingly, customers across end markets faced similar structural challenges such as skilled labor shortages, aging infrastructure operational inefficiencies and elevated energy and maintenance as value creation shifts showers harnessing the part of data to solve enterprise scale challenges and achieve new level of [indiscernible], we are streamlining our business unit centered around cohesive business model for addressing these issues.\nThis segment realignment exemplifies our ability to simplify our whole organization to focus on actions that creates the highest value for our stakeholders, reducing distraction from legacy liabilities, reviewing strategic alternative for parts of our portfolio that do not fit our business model and acquiring complementary technology through bolt-on and tuck-in acquisitions all demonstrate our commitment to optimizing our business for future growth and value creation.\nAnd finally, Quantinuum's recent capital raise and technological leap forward delivering the promise of quantum computing, which the company will demonstrate in coming weeks, move Honeywell closer to realizing the value of its pioneering investment in the space. With that, Sean, let's take questions.\n\nSean Christopher Meakim\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\n\nThank you, Vimal. Vimal and Mike are now available to answer your questions. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, please open the lines for Q&A.",

At this time, all participants are on a listen only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a Q&A session. Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to Sean Meakim, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nSean Meakim\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Honeywell\n\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's Q2 2025 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Vimal Kapur and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Mike Stepniak. This webcast and the presentation materials, including non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our Investor Relations website. From time to time, we post new information that may be of interest or material to our investors on this website. Our discussion today includes forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the ones described in our SEC filings. This morning, we will review our financial results for the Q2, share our guidance for Q3, and provide an update on full-year 2025.\nAs always, we'll leave time for your questions at the end. With that, I'll turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, then look for.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. Honeywell again delivered solid results in the Q2, meeting or exceeding all our financial commitments in a time of significant global economic change. Our organic sales and orders growth both accelerated during this quarter as we are seeing the benefit of our consistent spending and execution on new product development across our businesses. Given the strong first half performance, we are raising sales and earnings guidance for the full year while incorporating into our outlook all currently known tariffs and the uncertain business conditions going forward. Our proactive, multi-pronged mitigation efforts, coordinating closely with suppliers and customers on productivity and pricing initiatives, have been working as planned, and because of our systemic approach, we are in a position to deliver strong sales, profit, and cash flow growth in 2025.\nAs our business leaders have been solely focused on meeting and exceeding our financial commitment, management and the Board have been fulfilling our promise to transform our portfolio ahead of our upcoming separation to best position each of the future independent companies for success. Throughout the comprehensive portfolio review I initiated shortly after becoming CEO, we have diligently analyzed how to further simplify and optimize Honeywell. Earlier this month we entered the final stage of this process, announcing our intention to pursue strategic alternative for our Productivity Solutions and Services and Warehouse and Workflow Solutions businesses. The results of this pursuit, whatever they may be, will clarify the standalone automation company's go forward strategy and value proposition. With many changes in flight, our dedicated separation management office have kept us right on track to execute our spin off transaction both on time and without commercial disruption.\nLet's now turn to slide 3 for further update on our formation of three industry-leading public companies. We continue to make great progress along with the path to separate into three independent companies which we believe will maximize long-term value for all Honeywell stakeholders. As independent entities with clear alignment and purpose, increase organization agility and customized capital allocation priorities, each will be better positioned to accelerate future growth opportunities. Given the pace of our progress, we can now narrow the timing for the spinoff Solstice Advanced Materials to Honeywell shareholders to Q4 of this year. Solstice shares will trade under the ticker SOLS on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange. A few weeks prior to the spin, the Solstice leadership team will host an Investor Day in New York.\nThey will lay out in detail the powerful investment case for this innovative market leader in secularly growing advanced material market that will carry on Honeywell's legacy of operational excellence. We hope you will join CEO David Sewell and his team at this event. We're also making great progress on aerospace spin which is planned for the second half of next year. Last month Aerospace President Jim Currier and I presented an investor reception ahead of Paris Air Show. Jim highlighted Aerospace's industry-leading position as a mission critical supplier of systems across aerospace verticals and platforms. In addition, he provided insights into drivers for our strong growth profile underpinned by a broad aerospace and defense upcycle which we enhanced with a powerful decoupled sales initiative, ongoing supply chain transformation effort, and robust research and development investments over time.\nWe look forward to providing you with more details on standalone Honeywell Aerospace in coming quarters. Yet we are not waiting for the separation to reshape our portfolio for future growth. We continue to selectively deploy capital towards acquisitions, announcing two new deals in the past couple of months. We are also looking to recycle capital as I discussed earlier by pursuing alternatives for businesses that do not fit our future. The combination of these actions will drive value creation, and as we await becoming separately publicly traded vehicles. If you turn to slide 4, I will discuss our recent portfolio announcement in more detail. In June, we agreed to a GBP 1.8 billion bolt-on purchase of Johnson Matthey's Catalyst technology business.\nWe have long identified our UOP process technology business as a natural owner of this highly complementary business because it gives us additional capabilities in sustainable methanol, sustainable aviation fuel, hydrogen, and ammonia to better serve our extensive customer base. It also brings attractive sales from Catalysts, which fit very well with our existing offerings. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2026 and will enhance our growth and margin profile over time while providing a strong financial return. In early July, we also announced a technology tuck-in acquisition of Linetimer that enhances our building automation capability in high-growth energy storage and data center end markets. While such smaller deals do not often get much investment attention, in aggregate, they can accelerate our strategic roadmap and boost growth with a lower risk profile.\nWe recently announced our intent to evaluate strategic alternatives for our PSS and warehouse automation businesses. Just as we want to acquire businesses such as Catalyst Technologies and Linetimer where we believe we are the natural owner, we must also acknowledge when the time comes that there is a better owner for parts of our portfolio. We're looking to create a pure play automation company with a consistent business model and focused set of end markets in which we have durable competitive advantages. Both PSS and Intelligrated have strong customer bases, a long history of innovation, and best-in-class operations, and we will evaluate options for them from a position of strength to avoid interfering with the review process. We will withhold further updates until it's completed. I will now turn it over to Mike to provide more details on our excellent Q2 results.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nThank you, Vimal, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on slide 5 in Q2. We built upon a strong start to the year as we again exceeded our guidance for organic sales growth and adjusted EPS . Our results demonstrate the resilience of our accelerator operating system to adapt to changes in the environment quickly and deliver on our financial commitments. At the same time, we remain committed not to compromise on our investment in growth initiatives as we are beginning to see evidence of our progress. Q2 sales grew 5% organically with three out of our four segments. Above this level, Defense and Space, and UOP led growth with double digit performances. Segment profit expanded 8% from the prior year in line with sales, and segment margin finished nearly flat and within our guidance range.\nMargin expansion in Building Automation and Industrial Automation, and lower corporate costs, were slightly more than offset by margin pressure in Aerospace Technologies and Energy and Sustainability Solutions. An increase in Research and Development expense, up 60 basis points as percentage of sales from the previous year to 4.6%, push down current period margin at the segment level, but will enhance future period growth. EPS in the Q2 was $2.45 per share, up 4% from the prior year, while adjusted EPS was $2.75 per share, up 10% year over year. Organic and inorganic segment profit growth, as well as the lower tax rate, more than offset headwinds from higher interest expense and lower pension income. You can find a bridge for Adjusted EPS from Q2 2024 to Q2 2025 in the appendix of this presentation.\nOrders were $10.5 billion in the quarter, up 6% year over year excluding the effect of acquisitions and divestitures, led by strong double-digit increase in aerospace orders. Backlog grew 10% organically from the prior year to a new record of $36.6 billion. Q2 free cash flow was $1 billion, down roughly $100 million from the previous year, as tariff-related cost inflation pushed up inventory levels and capital project spending expanded as planned. We continue to dynamically allocate our excess cash flow and balance sheet capacity based upon the best opportunities the market presents to us. During Q2, our capital deployment was well balanced with $2.2 billion used to complete the accretive acquisition of Sundyne and over $2.4 billion returned to shareholders, roughly $1.7 billion of share repurchases, and $700 million of dividends. We also allocated $300 million for capital projects.\nNow let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss our Q2 performance by segment. I will give a high-level view of results and with additional commentary provided on the right-hand side of the slide. In the Q2 Aerospace Technologies grew 6% organically, highlighted by another strong quarter of our Defense and Space and commercial OEM and aftermarket businesses. Segment margin contracted 170 basis points to 25.5% as 11% output growth, commercial excellence, and productivity actions were more than offset by higher cost inflation and the impact of CAES acquisition in industrial automation.\nSales were above our guidance range, coming in flat on an organic basis. Segment margin expanded 20 basis points to 19.2% driven by productivity actions and commercial excellence which more than compensated for cost pressures. In May we completed the sale of the PPE business which will be accretive to organic growth and margins in the second half of the year.\nBuilding Automation delivered another quarter that surpassed our expectations with sales increasing 8% organically from the previous year. Q2 margin expanded 90 basis points year over year, led by volume leverage and full quarter benefit from Access Solutions, Energy and Sustainability Solutions. Sales grew 6% organically in the Q2, exceeding our expectations driven by double-digit growth in UOP. Segment margin contracted 110 basis points to 24.1% as volume leverage and benefit from the margin-accretive LNG acquisitions were more than offset by impact from a customer settlement as well as cost inflation. Now move to Slide 7 to discuss our Q3 and full year guidance. Our first half outperformance has given us confidence to increase our outlook for the year even as we remain cautious regarding the lagging effect on business demand from tariffs announced in recent months.\nDespite this, our framework for the year remains largely unchanged. We're factoring in known tariffs as they are written, assuming any moratorium means a later revision to higher rates net of all of our mitigation options. Keeping in close communication with our customers and suppliers, we remain committed to fully offsetting the effect of these tariffs with a combination of productivity pricing and alternative sourcing. As we balance protecting both margins and demand, we are raising the lower end of our full year organic sales growth guidance range by 200 basis points. Factoring in our first half performance and recent short cycle order trends, we now project growth of 4% to 5% for the year or 3% to 4% when excluding the prior year impact from the Bombardier agreement. While year to date results have exceeded previous expectations, we're maintaining a pragmatic approach to the back half.\nWe have increasingly seen large energy projects and catalyst spend, which can carry attractive incremental margins in our European process solution business, pushed out into 2026 because of macroeconomic and legislative uncertainty. Full year sales are now projected to $40.8 billion to 41.3 billion, driven primarily higher by better organic growth, tailwinds from foreign currency translation, and the additional revenue from the Sundyne acquisition in June. We expect year over year organic sales improvement to be similar in both the third and Q4. When excluding the impact of the Bombardier agreement in the Q4 of last year, we anticipate a Q3 organic sales growth of 2% to 4% which equates to $10 billion to $10.3 billion for the full year. We now expect our overall segment margin to be up 40 to 60 basis points or be down 30 to basis points.\nBombardier reduced margin expectations from the prior guidance stem from the high decrementals of delayed energy project work and the lag effect of pricing relative to tariff-related cost pressures in our Aerospace business. In the Q3, segment margin is anticipated to be in the range of 22.7% to 23.1%, down 90 basis points to down 50 basis points from the prior year. With VA margins expanding, ESAS margin roughly flat, IA margin contracting modestly, and Aero margin similar to its Q2 level. We now expect full year EPS of $10.45 to $10.65, up 6% to 8%, or up 1% to 3%. Excluding the 2024 impact of the Bombardier agreement, EPS in the Q3 is anticipated to be $2.50 to $2.00, down 3% to up 1% from the prior year.\nI will provide further details on changes to our full year EPS guidance later in the presentation. We continue to expect free cash flow for the year between $5.4 billion to $5.8 billion, down 2% to up 5% ex Bombardier, which remains approximately in line with adjusted EPS growth. We give additional information on changes in free cash flow from the prior year in the Appendix. Having deployed $7.8 billion in the first half of the year for share repurchases, acquisitions, dividends, and capital projects, we remain opportunistic in allocating additional capital beyond that already committed for the rest of the year. To summarize, our strong execution in the first half has raised the bar for the year. Even as we prioritize setting prudent expectations in a highly dynamic environment, focusing on what we can control, our company remains poised for strong performance ahead of our pending separations.\nI'll now turn to slide 8 to give a high-level overview of our outlook by segment, with further details by business unit provided in the commentary portion of the slide. In Aerospace Technologies, we continue to anticipate full-year sales growth in the high single-digit range, or mid single-digit to high single-digit. When excluding the impact of the 2024 Bombardier Agreement, supported by supply chain unlock and elevated global demand amid geopolitical conflicts, our Defense and Space business should lead segment growth for the year. Commercial aftermarket growth remains consistent, with air transport currently stronger than business aviation. We still expect commercial OE sales to recover and grow in the back half of the year as customers work down existing inventories, allowing our sales to better align with OE build rates.\nFor the Q3, organic sales are expected to be up mid single digits to high single digits, led by Defense and Space, with continued solid growth in commercial aftermarket and commercial OE. No longer address margins for the Q3 should be consistent with the prior quarter. For the full year, margins are expected to approach 26% as volume leverage is more than offset by the impact of acquisitions and the tariff-driven cost inflation temporarily outpaces pricing. In Industrial Automation, we are increasing our 2025 sales outlook to down low single digits to down mid single digits, given Q2 top line result and short cycle orders holding up better to date than initially feared in April. Though still down year over year, order declines are not contained to IEA short cycle businesses.\nGiven long cycle pressures from delayed energy customer CapEx decisions, we expect full year IEA margin to be roughly flat versus 2024 as incremental tariff-related cost inflation and volume deleverage are offset by commercial excellence, improved productivity, and second half accretion from the PPE sale for the Q3. We also anticipate a similar sales performance as full year, as growth in sensing, thermal solutions, and warehouse and workflow solutions is offset by muted demand in PSS and project timing delays in core process solutions.\nMargins are expected to contract modestly from the previous year but increase sequentially. In building automation, we are raising our 2025 sales outlook for the second consecutive quarter as Q2 sales exceeded expectations, and second half prospects have improved from our view in April given solid order trends. As a result, we now expect mid single digit to high single digit organic sales growth.\nProducts and solutions should grow at similar rates through the second half, driven by software-led new product introductions, momentum in the US and high-growth regions, and customer wins in focus verticals. For the Q3, we anticipate sales to be up mid-single digits as comps from the prior year become modestly more difficult in the back half. We expect Building Automation to expand margins meaningfully for the Q3 and for the year, supported by volume leverage and productivity actions in Energy and Sustainability Solutions. We're slightly reducing our organic sales growth outlook to reflect a more cautious capital spending posture from Europe's energy customers. We now expect full-year sales to be flat to up slightly. Advanced Materials should lead growth in the second half on improving demand tailwinds and the uplift from easing priority comps in fluorine products.\nWe anticipate full year ESS margin to remain roughly flat as commercial excellence and uplift from the LNG acquisition are offset by less favorable mix from reduced high margin project and catalyst sell and cost inflation. In the Q3, we expect ESS sales to decline low single digits, with growth in advanced materials offset by lower EOP projects and a headwind from the timing of catalyst shipments shifting forward into the Q2. Just as for the full year, margin is anticipated to be around flat to 2024. Now let's move to Slide 9 to walk through our 2025 EPS spreadsheet.\nWe see organic segment growth contributing an additional $0.13 per share for the full year, in line with our view in the prior quarter, while Q2 results finished above our guided range. The performance included a couple cents of benefit above the line from the Sundyne acquisition and a few extra weeks of owning PPE. It also included some UOP Catalyst shipments that were expected to occur later in the year. As a result, we are largely maintaining our outlook for the second half of the year, with some pluses and minuses under the surface. Organic sales should be better both in Building Automation and Industrial Automation, which we do not anticipate being down as much as contemplated in April.\nHowever, segment margin will be pressured some in IA because of negative mix from reduced demand for energy projects, and in Aerospace because of pricing increases lagging behind tariff related costs. Inflation acquisitions are now expected to add roughly $0.40 per share to 2025 EPS with Sundyne being added into the mix. The impact of FFX, quarterly tax rates, and below the line items are fairly straightforward in the bridge as the company focuses its transformational efforts on completing two spinoff transactions. Repositioning projects have slowed. However, we anticipate more spending in the second half of the year and return to a normalized level post separation. Additional details on these items are available in the appendix of this presentation. I'll now hand the call back over to Vimal to conclude our prepared remarks.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you, Mike. Unevale performed admirably in the first half of 2025 with back-to-back quarters that delivered earnings above the high end of our target ranges. Our investment in innovation is gaining traction, driving improved sales growth, and yet another record quarter for our backlog. On the back of this operational momentum, we are raising our Organic sales growth and Adjusted EPS guide for the year, while being mindful that we may not yet have felt the full impact of escalation of global tariff rates in recent months. Business demand has remained resilient in most sectors and geographic regions thus far, yet we are well prepared for potential changes ahead in the macro, regulatory, and geopolitical environment, utilizing a playbook that has served us well over many cycles as our businesses focus on delivering our financial targets.\nWe have also made substantial progress in transforming our portfolio to maximize their value through separation, acquisition, and divestitures. We are simplifying Honeywell for investors, customers, and our future shapers. All our transactions are proceeding according to plan even as the first chapter of my tenure as CEO comes closer to an end with the conclusion of the comprehensive portfolio review. Our dynamic approach to capital allocation and portfolio optimization remains evergreen. We are confident that the combination of our accelerating growth and high return capital deployment will compound the value of Honeywell going forward. With that, Sean, let's take questions.\n\nSean Meakim\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Honeywell\n\nThank you. Vimal and Mike are now available to answer your questions. We ask that you please be mindful of others in the queue by only asking one question and one related follow-up. Operator, please open the line for Q and A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question and answer session. If you'd like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you'd like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. One moment, please, while we poll for questions.\nOur first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning. Just maybe wanted to start off with aerospace to try and understand kind of the moving parts there. I suppose it sounded in Paris as if there was a bit more confidence around sort of supply chain issues and getting those resolved, and that might help the commercial OE top line. It seems something sort of moved the other way. Just trying to understand, is that BGA or large commercial, you know, what's the pace at which commercial OE sales improve? On the margin front, you know, should we think about this sort of 25% to 26% margin being the new sort of baseline for the next 12 or 18 months?\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning, Julian, how are you? I would say first, orders in Aerospace, extremely strong, continue to be strong on all fronts, Defense and Space, commercial, we, et cetera. What do we see in our commercial OE in the Q2? It's really a transitory item. I would say we experienced some destocking with one of our OEMs, and we expect.\nOur shipments to normalize to OE build rates in the second half. I feel very confident that you will see better OE profile from us in the second half. Like I said, we feel quite bullish on aero performance for the year from a margin standpoint. As we talked earlier, we were integrating CAES, and that's about 100 basis points drag for us year over year. That's going to start to normalize in the next year. CAES, by the way, is growing revenue this year at high double digits, so it's ahead of our pro forma, really encouraged by that. We also year over year are putting about $200 million of incremental R&D into the aerospace business to help support our NPI growth and new revenue next year.\nI think in the second half, margin profile for Aero will be better than what you've seen this quarter. Like I said, I'm quite confident about the high single digit growth on revenue for the rest of the year.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nThe only thing, Julian, I'll add is everything what Mike said is all transitionary issue items. If you see the margin related discussions we have, the OE mix is a transition because of the destocking. R&D is we evaluated to a level we can perform for the future, so that's going to become new normal, and then CAES acquisition is only going to become tailwind in the future. These are not, your other question, is it a new baseline? Answer is no, because these issues are transitionary, and we have very high confidence on the Aero margin projections we have laid out.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGot it. Just following up on that, Vimal. The sort of R&D hike you think by the end of this year, kind of R&D to sales in Aero, should not be a headwind next year, and then case margins start to improve over the next year or so.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nBoth statements are true. The OE destocking issue also goes away because the rates will converge to the normal baseline. That's why I mentioned these are all transitionary issues. By the way, on the R&D spend, the R&D spend rises not only in Aerospace, it's across all four segments of Honeywell. We feel continued confidence in our ability to accelerate organic growth through new products. We see part of that happening in Building Automation, pockets of Industrial Automation, Aerospace. We talked about wind, but overall we have a meaningful acceleration of R&D spend for the right projects. This is going to set up a new baseline for Honeywell for the future. This is again a transitionary for the overall company. We don't expect that to repeat in the year ahead at the same level.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is now live, I guess.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nGood morning.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nMorning, Andrew.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nYeah, can we just talk a little bit about UOP? You know, my question is very strong growth this quarter, but you're seemingly talking it down for the second half of the year. Can we just understand what verticals drove the upside and what verticals are driving the downside? If we could disaggregate it. Thank you.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nI would say, Andrew, for Q2 we had two favorable items. We had a big licensing agreement with a customer, which gave us strong growth, and also catalyst sales were much stronger in Q2. Some of the catalysts got pulled through from the second half to the first half. That is more of a cycle of this long cycle business. To the second part of your question, the impact we see is energy project spend is moving more to the right.\nPart of it is, I would say, economic uncertainty, which got settled in, and some of the regulatory items, which got clarified with OB3 regulations. We do believe they will settle, but clearly we saw pressure on that for the rest of the year, which we have reflected in our guide for ESS business and, to a certain degree, also in IEA for process automation.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nI would just add that just looking at the OB3 and the IRA, that's mostly preserved for us, so it's not really a headwind for us into next year.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nGotcha. On industrial automation, just to follow up. HPS, similar dynamics. Is it fair to say that when you say weakened demand and price cost deleverage in the second half in the slide, that it mostly relates to HBS and that's what's driving sort of slightly lower margin outlook there? Is that the key driver?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nYes, primarily I would say in case of HPS, the same energy projects, the projects part of the business will see the similar pressure.\nThe services side remains strong.\nMike, anything you want to add on the.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nI would just say, well, I continue to be prudent about the second half, a lot of moving parts. I feel confident we'll be able to deliver on the guide that we put upon, but just continue to be prudent on the second half, especially around the short cycle orders. You don't have one specific industry vertical region to call out other than this big tariff uncertainty.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nThat's correct. No, absolutely right. I mean, in fact we see much more balanced growth across the world now. Of course, US remains the leading growth, no doubt about it. The headwinds we saw a couple of quarters last year in particular on Europe and China have subsided now. The growth is more normalized across the globe, with the US being the leading growth.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nThank you very much.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning, everyone. Just want to pick up on maybe the first couple of questions just on the energy project.\nTiming, I guess. Is that mainly on the clean energy project? Is it just large process projects in general? Maybe just a final point on error margins, it seems like tariff inflation should be better news today than it was back in April. I'm just curious what additional inflationary pressure you're seeing in Aero.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nNice level energy project. Just to kind of dig into little details you're asking for, I'll provide into a couple of buckets. LNG remains very strong. The business we acquired is performing extremely well, and we remain very bullish on LNG. That's going to benefit ESS, that's going to benefit process automation because our two in a box strategy is sustainable.\nFuels projects are the ones which are most impacted. Moving to the right, I think they were primarily policy around the Inflation Reduction Act. How will they fold out with OB3 now things have got cleared up in the last 10 days. We do believe that should bring up the positive momentum on the traditional refining, petrochemical side. I would say that we saw higher catalyst spend in Q2. In fact, few got accelerated, which led to strong performance for Q2. We do see some weakening demand there. I think customers are more cautious on making large catalyst spend in certain segments. Overall, I think the performance.\nWe had a chance to attend the OPEC meeting a couple of days back, and the outlook for the energy segment remains extremely bullish across the core gas refining, biomass-based product coming in the future. Our outlook remains extremely bullish.\nI think we're just going through a typical cycle in energy right now.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nOn the arrow question, what I would tell you is that if you look at tariffs, when we incur tariffs, we pay them in 10 days. It's easy to pass tariffs as far as timing on short cycle businesses. When it comes to aerospace and our OE contracts, these matters take a longer time because you have to open the contract. These contracts usually are set for 10 years and prescribed by certain frameworks. The team is working through it, and it will take them a little bit longer to get that price aligned with the cost, as we obviously keep in mind how we impact our customers.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nMike, could you maybe just touch on the changes to the R&D tax expensing for tax purposes? You've got about $1 billion of deferred tax assets balance sheet. How does that unwind over the next couple years?\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah, I would say it's obviously net positive for us, and right now we're just evaluating it with our tax team, thinking through, given we have all those things going on and the separation, on how to unwind in the best way. I would say it's a tailwind for us for 2026 and 2027, but we'll have more to say about it as we go into next year. You are correct, this is a tailwind for us.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good morning,\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nSteve. Morning\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nJust trying to like get to the margin guide for the year. You guys given some good detail, I guess, for I think to get into the range. Is Building Automation like close to 28 this year? Is that roughly the right ballpark?\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nI would say it really depends how you look at it and where you look at it. On the product side, obviously the incrementals are extremely high for us right now. Projects is a bit lower, but I would say incrementals are quite high.\n\nSean Meakim\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Honeywell\n\nYes, Steve, this is Sean. I would say thinking about the full year, that's probably a little bit aggressive. In terms of is that business capable of delivering a number like that, it has the capability of doing so.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nIt's fair to say, Steve, that GA will be the highest margin business in our portfolio in 2025. That will be a fair statement.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Just one follow up on the hedge, I guess the contingency you guys had put into place last quarter. What's kind of the status of the contingency? Obviously better visibility now, but just curious as to where that went.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah, so I would say we learned a lot over the last 90 days when we were talking last time. We're evaluating the results live. I think if you look at the guide that we just gave, I feel a high level of confidence we can deliver that. Q3 obviously is a very important quarter for us. Like we said earlier, some of the long-cycle project milestones have moved out on us, and then we had some of the demand on capital is softer than expected. But on the other hand, Building Automation and IA short-cycle orders are better. So I think net net, we're kind of in the very similar spot that we were last quarter.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nOkay, great. Thanks a lot.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is now open.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nHey, good morning. Vimal, Mike, and Sean.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nGuys, can we talk a little bit about Quantinuum? It looks like it's still bleeding a little bit of cash for you guys. But what are the hurdles specifically? What are you guys looking for to be able to get that to an IPO-ready situation?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nScott, I would say. In principle, we are committed to deconsolidate. So that plan is not changing. And actually, as we speak, we are doing the fundraise so that we could capitalize the company between now and the IPO time. To your specific question, I think we are looking at more commercial evidence which can prove the revenue stream for it. We had a big win in Qatar. When president was visiting there, there was a big announcement that Qatar is going to invest for quantum infrastructure. So wins like that give the investor confidence in the future revenue stream. And the way I see timeline today is.\nEnd of 27 is, I would say, the.\nOutline at the most. Can we pull it forward by a couple of months or quarter? Yeah, that possibility always remains. We're working with that kind of timeline, and we do have good visibility on commercial progress between now and then to execute that. We also expect to unveil the plans of Quantinuum in the Q4 time frame. So we'll keep all our shareowners informed on some of the progress we are making, and we'll share that on a more broader basis.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay, that's helpful, Vimal. And just to switch to the R&D, you know that it's. And we don't have to make a big deal out of this, but the timing. I don't think I've ever seen a company prior to a breakup increase R&D spend. So I'm just kind of curious, is that. Is that some. Is that a message coming from the businesses that they felt like they were behind, or is there just a. Is it just happened to be a little bit of just a. You know, is what it is. You know, I'll just stop there. I don't want to make.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nYeah, look, this is, this is part of the message I've been saying since last year that Honeywell organic growth with the strength of improving our fundamentals. So the two fundamentals we were focused on improving our processes. Are we investing at the right spot? Do we have the right talent? The basics, and then we made decision sometime in last year to accelerate R&D where we think we have opportunity to grow. And you can imagine hiring people in the domains we play like aerospace, energy is very, very long cycle. So I can't make a decision in June and people show up in July. This is much, much longer than that. So principally across the board we investing R&D escalation, acceleration; it's higher than normal compared to others. But we are also growing.\nR&D spend across the board. My strong conviction is that it's really preparing Honeywell for the future, for the better organic growth because we are putting bets in the right spots. Some evidences are already seen in some segments with our acceleration of our organic growth. More to come as we go along. It's really not linked to Spain. I would say I treat those two as two separate events. We are just getting better prepared as an organic growth driver company compared to what it was historically.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nScott, I see it as a good thing for us given where we want to go from a top line growth standpoint, migration to higher growth verticals. This investment is good for us and has a high ROI for us in 2026.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nIt actually puts out, I mean, indeed. Should have mentioned to you we were always at the median or R&D spend. So I think this is going to push us more towards upper quartile now as the year closes, and I'm sure as you observe the number, we'll start differentiating ourselves on the money we invest for growth.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nGood morning, guys, and thank you. If I could ask two aerospace questions, please. The first one on aftermarket, you know, the 7% growth decelerating from 15% in Q1 and lagging some of the early reports from peers. You know, how do we think about what weighed on that growth? Was it air transport, business, aviation? How are you thinking about the full year there?\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nI would say, Sheila, that the aftermarket is normalizing for us, and I think you should. The range they receive in the Q2, that's kind of the range we expect. We're expecting in the second half. We see as we're catching up with demand, et cetera.\nWe see this as a kind of more normal go forward rate for us. As you see, the hours are fairly stable both on ATR and business and I think that's kind of a new normal for us going forward.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nOkay. And then if I could maybe hone in on the Aerospace OE decline once again, if that's possible. Why the destocking now when it seems like deliveries are actually increasing? Was it related to one specific platform or is it inventory across multiple platforms?\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nIt's predominantly has the impact from North America platforms on OE side. And if you think about last year, etcetera, we were shipping a lot into our OE inventories, and now they're depleting these inventories. They have better visibility in terms of how much safety stock they need. So we're working ourselves through this blip, and I think that's going, at least based on everything I know today. It's going to normalize some in Q3, and then we should be back to normal in the, in the Q4.\n\nSean Meakim\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Honeywell\n\nThen, Sheila, I would just add the nuance is not everything is the same inside of OE. Electromechanical is where we've had the supply chain challenges and continue to work towards making sequential improvement, whereas Electronic Solutions have been caught up for quite a while. You can see a little bit of a difference in terms of what those needs look like for customers between those two businesses.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Chris Snyder with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. I wanted to ask about portfolio actions. Vimal, you guys have remained quite busy here in the Q1 after you announced the separation in Q4 of last year. Should we assume that everything on the table has been completed or announced at this point? And then just on some of the strategic reviews, I understand why PSS doesn't fit aftermarket business, but warehouse is both automation and aftermarket driven. So it does fit the characteristics that Honeywell is looking for. Can you just talk why that one doesn't fit in the future portfolio?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nYeah, thanks Chris. I must say, the first part of your question. Yeah, we are complete on the portfolio review what I started two years back. So from this point onward, we do not expect any major portfolio.\nExits, if I can use the word normal way, could we do things? I mean, we are a large company, so there could be something's always happening, but fundamentally we have completed the process.\nThe decision on Intelligrated and PSS was more of a sectoral decision to look at the end markets. We want to participate, and one of them in automation is a very large market. You know, it's a $500 billion TAM. So we have very large opportunity in those swim lanes of the three verticals we have now built for ourselves: industrial, process, and buildings. So within that now we are making choices, and we obviously want to bias towards verticals which are higher growth so that we could, you know, deliver high growth to our share owners. Our belief playing in this segment of logistics and warehouse and transport; these are very good segments, but they also have demonstrated certain rates of growth and lumpiness which we believe are lesser fit into our portfolio in the future. So it's choices to be made.\nWe are making some addition, some subtraction.\nThe warehouse automation does bring very strong aftermarket, but I think it's more of the end market participation choices we are making, and that was the driver of the decision.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you, I appreciate that. Then I just want to follow up on Building Automation. Just been a really impressive turnaround here over the last year, and it seems like the global non-residential backdrop has not been too accommodative. So can you just maybe talk to company-specific actions that is driving the turnaround in growth, and are we seeing revenue synergies from the big security acquisition you guys did last year? Thank you.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nI think there are three strategies which are, by the way, going to be the strategy for New Honeywell as we unveil that in late 2026. First is how we make our mix towards higher growth verticals. So in case of buildings we are focused on three or four markets, hospitals, hotels, data centers, and airports in high growth regions. So one is pivoting more towards that. That's action one. Action two is mining install base. We have large install base, how we mine it higher and deliver high single digit growth in services that's certainly working in building automation. And finally the new product acceleration. The comment I mentioned to the Scott's question, we have elevated R&D even in building automation and they are the most ahead in delivering higher growth with new products.\nSo when you pull all three things together, we are participating in high growth markets, we are mining our installed base better, we are turning more new products. That's becoming the driver for high growth. The final point there is we had some pressure in some geographies, like there was a drag in China, there was a drag in Europe in some pockets, those have normalized now. So the Building Automation growth is double-digit in North America but like low-single to mid-single in other different parts of the world. So that also helps because we don't have any pullbacks from some other geographies, which normalizes our results here.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you, Vimal.\nAppreciate that.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is now open.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nSenior Analyst, Citigroup\n\nGood morning everyone.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nMorning Andy.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nSenior Analyst, Citigroup\n\nVimal, can you give a little more color into what you're seeing in Defense and Space as it continues to accelerate here? I think the growth you've talked about in the past has been pretty balanced between the US and international. But I think international defense funding is just starting to accelerate. So could you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nYeah, I think the Defense and Space growth is driven by both on the supply chain healing because it was last to heal. We have much more mechanical content in Defense and Space compared to commercial. So that's certainly seen as part of our results. And on the demand side, the orders remain very strong both domestically and internationally. Defense, which is our strength, is growing double-digit and it will remain so for many years to come. We see strength in Europe, we see strength in parts of Asia like Korea, etc. So I think it's a combination of accelerated demand with the geopolitical circumstances in the world and the supply chain healing which is giving us a performance in Defense and Space as we are demonstrating.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nSenior Analyst, Citigroup\n\nVimal, I want to ask you about a couple other initiatives you've been working on. Direct material productivity and harnessing AI. You seem to mention quite a bit today. Cost inflation you're facing across the portfolio, but I imagine a lot of that should have been expected. So update us on your ability to offset that with your initiative here around direct materials. And then maybe how sticky have your price increases been that you've made here this year?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell",
    "content2": "I think the pricing initiative have been quite sticky. I think we have been very thoughtful to build a strategy now which protects our earnings, but also protects our volume. That has been a playbook we have been doing for 2025, and it's a tough balance because you don't want to raise the price to a point that you destroy demand. And we have been able to execute that with the minor exception of the aerospace OE, which Mike mentioned earlier, because there's a lag, given the nature of the contract. But across Honeywell, we have been able to execute our pricing quite successfully. What's also helping is productivity is very meaningful, which is also giving us more optionality to what extent we want to go pricing in a certain segment versus the margins. We can drive margins through productivity.\nValue engineering in particular is performing extremely well, and that's where AI is playing a role. We have been deploying use of AI to self determine design of the boards versus engineers taking months and months to figure out that they want to do this design or some other design. So that gives you time. So something which was used to take two or three months, not take a week, so that accelerates the net saving we can drive in a given year. And what gives me and my confidence is that value engineering is becoming a meaningful lever for Honeywell now. We can count on it, we can financially plan it, and that can become a lever for us to think about price versus volume, not only for 2025 but in the years to come.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nAndy, from a financial framework and we talked a little bit about it before in terms of looking at our 6/4 rolling forecast, etc. What I'm really focused with the team is on demonstrating growth over longer period of time, consistent growth and, like Vimal said, really focusing on the top line growth and then on the bottom line growth and then within that, whether it's price, volume, mix, teams have a little bit more leeway in terms of managing based on the verticals they're in, customer set, et cetera. But really just setting the framework on.\nDelivering over a longer period of time on a consistent basis.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nSenior Analyst, Citigroup\n\nAppreciate the color guys.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you.\nGood morning everyone.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning, [Crosstalk].\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nI was hoping to get some color on free cash flow. You boosted the EPS guide but kept free cash flow guidance the same, just are there any puts and takes related to Free Cash Flow for the second half that you'd like to highlight?\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nSure. We have a pretty broad range on cash flow, the $5.4 to 5.8 billion. If you look at the moving pieces, I would say our inventory got a little bit worse just because of what we are facing right now in Aero that hopefully will normalize in the second half. On the other hand, have a little bit of tailwind from stronger collections, and higher sales and pricing. Net net, we're the same. We're really focusing on moving towards that 90+% conversion in 2026.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat. And then, just related question, anything in the second half on price cost that you'd particularly want to highlight here?\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nSo I think generally if you think about our guide, our price probably vis-à-vis the last time we talked, we probably 100 basis points better. So if you thought about price of 1 to 2, now it's 2 to 3. Volume is probably going to be 1% to 2%, and then from a cost price standpoint, short cycle businesses will offset, and then Aero, like I said earlier, it's still working through their, through their OE contracts, and that should normalize going towards year end and early half of next year.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nThank you, Deane.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning, guys.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nI just want to make sure I understand the relationship between the tariffs and the demand contingency. It seems like the moratorium is you kind of kept the kind of tariff rates at a higher rate. If the moratorium were to become permanent, I'd assume that maybe the demand contingency gets released to some degree. Just trying to make sure that I understand that correctly. Are there any specific segments that you could see benefiting in the second half of the year if in fact tariffs come in at lower rates permanently?\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nSure. The way I look at the second half, if you think about the short cycle businesses, they're managing through it quite well. We haven't seen any pre-buy or demand destruction there. Building Automation is doing well. IA is doing better than what we thought it was going to do. It's really about our energy business and these orders and how they convert into revenue, because we're at the point now of the year where if we get an order on an energy project, it takes a while to engineer it, so revenue might fall out of the year. We're just managing that piece, looking in the first half of next year, and then also monitoring our catalyst orders, which have been a little bit softer from a forecast standpoint. Vis a vis, what do we expect it?\nThat's really just a behavior that our customers can exhibit when they have sometimes a choice. They might delay those catalyst orders for a quarter or two and still operate their refineries and their facilities with just at the lower output.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it, Mike. That's helpful. Maybe just my quick follow on the strategic alternative announcement on PSS and warehouse. Kind of looks like the demand environment there is getting a little bit worse again, kind of bouncing along a bottom, I guess. Vimal, I know that we can't bank on any, you know, on any outcome here, but I guess how are you thinking about the timeline for a decision to be made on that piece of the business?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nWe kicked off the process, Joe, just last week. Now after we made the announcement, I think we get better clarity by end of the year on the strategic options which are available. As you can imagine, there are multiple choices. We do expect to have the first part of it, that what choice we're going to execute. Time is hard to put a timeline here. If it was, then we would have stated in more certainty. That's why we are putting strategic options. I would say before end of the year we should be able to provide more clarity on the specific timeline.\nNow my desire list, if I want to talk here, we want to have as clean a portfolio when the spin gets completed. That's one of the reasons we initiated the strategic review now, so that we could somehow converge the timing.As you can imagine, these processes are, you know, you can't put a certainty of timeline around it at this point.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay, thank you guys.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\n\nNicole DeBlase\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah, thanks. Good morning, guys.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning.\n\nNicole DeBlase\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nMaybe just starting with some of the order trends that you guys saw throughout the quarter. How would you say that orders progressed each month and then into July? It sounds like maybe energy was the only area where you saw a discernible difference. If you talk a little bit about IABI more on the short cycle side through the quarter, that would be helpful.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nSure. I would tell you overall orders are 6% up. Really pleased with that. Better orders than in the Q1. Aerospace let the orders grow for us once again. Very strong orders on both defense and space and commercial. Building automation was low single digits, but it had tougher comps, so we did not see anything there. For IEA and ESS, I would say we saw strong first two months, and June was a little bit softer going into July. On the other hand, orders are continuing to be strong, so June might have been kind of a false positive. In general, I feel like orders are sticking, and the Q2 was better than the Q1. In terms of what the team showed us for the Q3 and the forecast, we do not see a lot of concern in our order rates slowing down.\n\nNicole DeBlase\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay, got it. Thanks, Mike. That's really helpful. There's a lot of discussion around what you guys are doing from a portfolio perspective. I don't think we talked much about future M&A plans, and you guys have clearly been a lot more active recently. How does the M&A pipeline look for today, and what is your appetite for doing more deals before the spin happens?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nNicole, we absolutely are building our pipeline. We are going to be slightly slowing down given the activity. We have other spins in motion, and some acquisition integration work we are doing. We are not slowing down on building the pipeline. The pipeline remains strong, and will execute opportunities as they become available. I think what gives me more confidence is that we're getting much more comfortable not only doing the normal deal, but also acting like a sponsor to do carve out deals.\nWe have demonstrated that capability repeatably now over the last two years, and that additional skill increases our optionality now because we are willing to go to other partners, suggest an optionality for them to create value for both sides, and that gives me confidence that we can remain active in the portfolio side in the years ahead. More to come. We'll continue to build our portfolio as a higher priority item under my leadership.\n\nNicole DeBlase\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nThanks, Vimal. I'll pass it on.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have reached the end of the question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Vimal Kapur for closing remarks.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you. I want to again once thank, express my deep appreciation to our share owners, our Honeywell team, and our customers for the continued support during the transition time for the company. We are excited for the future and look forward to sharing more of our progress as we deliver on our commitment. Before we close out today's call, I want to take a moment to remember a pivotal former leader of Honeywell that we lost this week, Larry Bossidy. Larry was the Chairman and CEO of AlliedSignal and led the company's acquisition of Honeywell in 1999. He was a forefather of operational excellence that Honeywell is known for today and served as the combined company's Chairman and CEO until his planned retirement in 2000. He then came out of retirement briefly to offer his leadership again as Chairman and CEO.\nDuring a challenging period of our company and under leadership, the board hired Dave Cote as Honeywell's new CEO, setting up the company for the next two decades of tremendous value creation. He was a remarkable leader, a committed family man, and our thoughts are with his family and friends at this point of time. Thank you again everyone for listening, and please stay safe and healthy.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect from the conference. Thank you.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. After the speaker's presentation there will be a question and answer session. Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to Sean Meakim, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nSean Meakim\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Honeywell International Inc\n\nThank you. Good morning and welcome to Honeywell's first quarter 2025 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Vimal Kapur and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Mike Stepniak. This webcast and the presentation materials, including non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our Investor Relations website. From time to time we post new information that may be of interest or material to our investors on this website. Our discussion today includes forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the ones described in our SEC filings.\nThis morning we will review our financial results for the first quarter, share our guidance for the second quarter, and provide an update on full year 2025. As always, we'll leave time for your questions at the end. With that, I'll turn the call over to Chairman and CEO Vimal Kapur.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nThank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. Honeywell saw its strong finish to last year's carry into 2025 as we exceeded the high end of our guidance on all metrics in the first quarter, and this performance translated into substantial free cash flow growth as well. Overall demand was strong with a book-to-bill above one. Although our business has solid momentum heading into second quarter, the economic climate has become increasingly uncertain in recent weeks. Global trade patterns are shifting because of increasing tariffs and duties, making customer planning more difficult. Weaker sentiments combined with higher price expectation warrants incremental caution regarding end market demand in the coming quarters.\nDespite these headwinds, we remain on track to deliver on our 2025 outlook as we are maintaining our full-year organic growth guidance and raising our Adjusted EPS guidance. Our outlook now incorporates the impact of current tariffs and macroeconomic uncertainty, fully offset by our ongoing mitigation efforts, local for local strategy, accelerated operating system, and resilient market position. As you can see, we are taking decisive actions during this uncertain time to not only protect but grow earnings, invest for future, and position Honeywell for long-term success. Regardless of the operating environment we face, Honeywell has a team across functions and businesses meeting daily to review and respond to tariff announcements. This team analyzes a number of levers to optimally respond to changing conditions. We're also closely monitoring bilateral negotiations and engaging with key stakeholders.\nFrom our perspective, there are three very important considerations for supporting American competitiveness and manufacturing: Maintain the principle of USMCA, strike the right kind of trade agreement with our major trading partners, and continue the global framework that has made the US the world leader in aerospace. As external environment has become more unpredictable, we remain focused on what we can control, and we have made significant progress in planning and executing our separation into three industry-leading public companies. This preparation has included key leadership appointments to ensure that we have the right people in place to continue our portfolio transformation. Let's turn to slide three to discuss a few important changes announced earlier this month. Su Ping Lu will succeed Anne Madden as Senior Vice President and General Counsel while retaining her role as Corporate Secretary. Su's more than 15 years of legal experience with Honeywell across many of our business lines and geographies will further strengthen our executive leadership team. Anne will transition into a new role as Senior Vice President of Portfolio Transformation and Senior Advisor where her experience leading over 100 acquisitions as Honeywell's Global Head of M&A will prove invaluable during our continued portfolio optimization.\nAlso, our Board of Directors has elected Stephen Williamson to join us as an Independent Director and Audit Committee member. Stephen served as CFO of Thermo Fisher Scientific will broaden and deepen the expertise of our Board. I want to personally congratulate these three individuals on their new roles, and I look forward to working closely with each one of them. Let's turn to slide four to discuss update on separation. We hold strong conviction that separating automation, aerospace, and advanced materials that unlock significant value for all Honeywell stakeholders by best positioning each standalone public company for long-term profitable growth. Following our announcement in February, Honeywell has taken many steps forward in preparation for these transactions.\nFirst, we determined a tax-free spin of Honeywell Aerospace will be most efficient way to separate our automation and aerospace businesses. Second, the board confirmed that I will lead the automation company going forward and it's where I've spent bulk of my career and where I have a specific vision for the future. At the right time, the board will evaluate the future leadership of Honeywell Aerospace as well. Third, we established dedicated separation management office run by experts in corporate transformation. These entities have empowerment to maintain the value of our businesses, minimize separation costs, and achieve our communicated timelines. Most importantly, they will ensure that our operation leaders are focused solely on serving our customers and achieving our financial targets.\nFourth, we appointed an accomplished leadership team that will be called Solstice Advanced Materials. Collectively, they bring years of experience leading public companies operating specialty chemical businesses and utilizing Honeywell Accelerator operating system. Solstice will be headquartered in New Jersey where the current leadership team for the business sits. Fifth, we continue deploying capital as an active buyer of our own shares, which offer tremendous value at recent levels. We have repurchased about $3 billion of our shares already this year and will continue to repurchase our stock opportunistically. Lastly, in March we announced the acquisition of Sundyne as we continue to optimize our portfolio.\nIf you turn to slide five, I'll discuss how this deal fits into our portfolio transformation. As you can see, Sundyne will be the fifth strategic bolt-on acquisition since I became Honeywell CEO along with a couple of strategically important technology tuck-ins. Sundyne meets each of the common sense criteria we have set. It's the right size, it exceeds our financial return hurdles, it improves our business profile by boosting both organic growth and segment margins, and Honeywell is a natural owner of the business as Sundyne addresses a closely adjacent market to our existing ESS offering which will allow us to sell a more robust and complementary portfolio of solutions to our customers, particularly in LNG. We have meticulously built a pipeline of acquisition targets with compelling financial characteristics over the past several years and will continue to pursue them if they become available to us. Given everything we have in flight, only the deals that are time sensitive will be pursued.\nFor now, buying these differentiated businesses with strong aftermarket content and secular growth drivers at a reasonable price is a powerful use of capital. Our 2024 acquisitions are now increasingly incorporated into our operations and performing admirably well, with the bulk of integration work behind us, reinforcing that we have the right M&A process in place to create incremental value. While we continue to evaluate acquisitions, we also look forward to opportunistically exit businesses such as personal protective equipment that do not fit into our business model or strategic priorities. The PPE sale will improve margins and organic growth. I will now move to slide six to address how we view the present global uncertainty. As a company, we remain confident in our ability to navigate the current trade environment.\nFor decades, we have positioned each of our business lines to serve their local markets. This local for local strategy reduces our overall exposure to international trade and geopolitical tensions. Based on tariffs in place today, our approximate 2025 exposure is about $500 million. Before taking any mitigation measures, our better-tested accelerated operating system can quickly identify areas of concern and implement mitigation efforts. Then we pursue consistent and clear communication with our suppliers, customers, and partners to maximize operational stability for all parties. Through this well-developed operational systems and our established local for local footprint, we are confident we can fully offset the impact of current tariffs and are well-positioned to manage future trade uncertainty.\nThis is evident in today's results and our confidence in maintaining and raising guidance in spite of these offsetting headwinds. Most importantly, whenever elevated global tensions do subside, we remain in an excellent position to capitalize on our record backlog and continue our growth trajectory. Now let me turn over to Mike to discuss our excellent Q1 results.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nThank you Vimal and good morning to everyone joining us. Let me begin on slide seven. We had a very strong start to the year in Q1 exceeding the high end of our organic sales segment margin and adjusted earnings per share guidance. Our results demonstrate tremendous effort from our commercial teams, successful productivity initiatives, and excellent supply chain coordination with our partners in a rapidly changing marketplace. Q1 sales grew 4% organically led by Aerospace Technologies where both our commercial aftermarket and defense and space businesses experienced double digit growth. Building solutions remains a significant contributor as well.\nSegment margin remained flat from the prior year at 23% with improvement in Building Automation and Energy and Sustainability Solutions offset by pressure in Aerospace Technologies and Industrial Automation. I would like to highlight that this margin performance includes an increase in our research and development spend of 50 basis points from the previous year to 4.5% of sales. We continue to balance current period profitability with our organic growth initiatives. Segment profit for the quarter grew 8% year-over-year aided by the inclusion of our 2024 acquisitions, which are performing ahead of the initial expectations. Earnings per share for the first quarter was $2.22 per share flat from a previous year, while adjusted earnings per share was $2.51 per share, up 7% year-over-year. Segment profit more than offset headwinds from interest rate expense, foreign exchange, and taxes.\nYou'll find a bridge of adjusted EPS from Q1 2024 to Q1 2025 in the appendix of this presentation. Orders were $10.6 billion in the quarter, up 3% year-over-year, excluding the effect of acquisitions, both supported by organic backlog growth of 8% to a new record of $36.1 billion. For this growth was led by longer cycle Building Automation and Aerospace businesses. Q1 cash flow was more than $300 million, over $100 million above the prior year, driven primarily by better adjusted earnings. We're utilizing our cash flow and strong balance sheet to dynamically allocate capital, including returning capital to shareholders. In Q1, we repurchased nearly $2 billion of our own shares at prices we find highly compelling, and we bought back roughly another $1 billion during the month of April, representing about 2% of our shares outstanding in 2025.\nWe also paid more than $700 million of dividends in Q1. We are investing in our business both organically and inorganically as we allocated approximately $250 million to capital projects and announced the acquisition of Sundyne. Now let's spend some time discussing our first quarter performance by business in Aerospace Technologies. Sales in the first quarter were up 9% organically year-over-year, exceeding our prior expectations. Better output as a result of supply chain improvements and robust demand from air transport customers to support increased flight activity drove 15% sales growth in the commercial aftermarket business. Defense and space, aided by increased output and elevated global defense spending in a world of ongoing geopolitical uncertainty, delivered a fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.\nDespite challenging comps and expiring government programs a year ago, aerospace industry demand continues to outpace supplies, supporting our orders growth of 9% and a book-to-bill of 1.1. Q1 segment margin contracted 190 basis points to 26.3%, but matched our expectations as mix shift and acquisition integration costs from CAES were partially offset by productivity actions. Industrial Automation sales declined 2% organically in Q1, led by lower demand in personal protective equipment, particularly in China and Europe. Warehouse and Workflow Solutions returned to growth in the quarter, up 5%. As demand for warehouse automation continues to stabilize, prior year comparisons get easier. Our Sensing business demonstrated recovery in the second consecutive quarter with double-digit growth in both healthcare, and aerospace and defense end markets.\nProcess Solutions sales were flat as continued strength in Lifecycle Solutions and Services and Compressor Controls was offset by modest declines in Smart Energy and Thermal Solutions. In Productivity Solutions and Services, weakness in Europe led to a sales decline of 1% year-over-year when excluding the impact of the prior-year license and settlement payments. Segment margin, Industrial Automation, contracted 130 basis points to 17.8%, driven by receivables write-downs and volume deleverage, partially offset by productivity actions. Building Automation delivered another solid quarter and outpaced our expectations, up 8% organically, led by a second consecutive quarter of both double-digit growth in Building Solutions and mid-single-digit growth in Building Products. Solutions continue to benefit from its robust backlog, up 11% in the quarter, led by over 30% growth in the Middle East and mid-teens growth in North America. Building Products growth of 6% was driven by double-digit organic growth in fire and sustained strength in security.\nOverall orders continue to be encouraging indicator for Building Automation with Q1 marking a fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Building Automation margin expanded 150 basis points driven by volume leverage, productivity actions, and accretion from Access Solutions, Energy and Sustainability Solutions. Sales declined 2% organically in Q1. Strong quarter in petrochemical and refining projects as well as sustainability projects helped UOP deliver 2% organic sales growth year-over-year. Advanced Materials sales declined 4% as challenging prior year comps in fluorine products offset broad-based strength in specialty chemicals and materials highlighted by over 20% growth in Spectra. Orders were the bright spot for Advanced Materials up 7% year-over-year driven by double-digit growth in fluorine products.\nThis quarter marked a second full quarter of ownership of the LNG business acquired from Air Products, which continues to grow at accretive sales and margin rates. ESS segment margin expanded 230 basis points in the quarter led by productivity actions and the year-over-year benefit from the LNG acquisition partially offset by cost inflation. Taken altogether, we still see long-cycle businesses outperforming short-cycle ones, while record backlog levels and best-in-class operating system position us well for future periods. I'll now move to slide eight to talk about our second quarter and full-year guidance. Although a strong first quarter like we delivered would typically indicate improved expectations for the remainder of the year, we cannot ignore changes in the geopolitical environment that Vimal mentioned in his earlier remarks, and believe that continuing to take a pragmatic approach to our guidance is appropriate given the increasing global uncertainty. Rest assured, Honeywell is actively and successfully addressing both potential cost and demand challenges to mitigate their impact on our business.\nWe have a playbook of rapid implementation of sourcing, pricing, and productivity changes. As a reminder, our local for local approach to maintaining supply chain has been our strategy for more than two decades and is a very mature part of our operating system. This structure and our leading market positions will help mitigate much of our recent tariff changes across the portfolio. But we're not immune. We'll continue to balance protective margins and sustaining volume across our end markets. Now let's discuss what this means for 2025 guidance.\nFor clarity, our guidance now assumes the impact of announcing tariffs net of mitigation actions as well as additional contingency for potential end market demand weakness triggered by this uncertainty, we are maintaining our prior outlook calling for organic sales growth of 2% to 5% for the year or 1% to 4% when excluding the prior year impact from the Bombardier agreement, with better Q1 performance being offset by a prudent guidance posture given greater uncertainty for the rest of the year. As we contemplate the potential influence of uncertainty on our customers activity, we are assuming an impact to organic sales for the remainder of the year approaching 1%, to segment profit of about 2%, and to EPS of about $0.18. Comparing to the guidance we laid out in February, full year sales are now projected to be $39.6 to 40.5 billion as favorable movements in foreign exchange rates since year end are being offset by two fewer months of revenue from our PPE business given an early May exit rather than end of June. Our guidance does not yet incorporate the acquisition of Sundyne, which is still expected to close in the second quarter. We anticipate year-over-year organic sales improvement to be relatively balanced across the next three quarters when excluding the impact of last year's Bombardier agreement, which will only influence the fourth quarter comparison. Consequently, we also see second quarter sales growing 1% to 4% organically, which translates into sales of $9.8 to 10.1 billion with one more month of PPE operations included or a $200 million impact compared to a full quarter.\nWe now anticipate our overall segment margin to exceed 230 basis points this year or to be down 10 basis points to up 20 basis points ex-Bombardier. Changes to our margin outlook from prior expectations are focused in IA and ESS given their relatively higher exposure to China trade. For the second quarter, segment margin is expected to be in the range of 22.8% to 23.2%, down 20 basis points to up 20 basis points from a prior year as margin improvement in IA and BA is offset by contraction in AERO and ESS. For the year we now expect earnings per share of $10.20 to $10.50, up 3% to 6% or down 1% to up 2% excluding the prior year Bombardier agreement impact. Earnings per share in the second quarter is anticipated to be in the range of $2.60 to $2.70, up 4% to up 8% year-over-year. I will provide additional details for full year EPS in a few minutes.\nFree cash flow for the year is still expected to be $5.4 to $5.8 billion, down 2% to up 5% ex bond year and roughly in line with EAR. You can reference the 2025 free cash flow bridge in the appendix. Beyond our CapEx and dividend commitments, we plan to continue to deploy capital diligently over the course of the year, funding both attractive time-sensitive acquisitions such as Sundyne, as well as being opportunistic on the repurchase of our shares. Year to date, we have already bought back $3 billion worth of our stock, including $1 billion in April, putting us on the path to reduce our net share count for the year by 2%, far exceeding our 1% annual commitment. In summary, we're taking a clear-eyed look at the remainder of 2025 to set appropriate expectations for our business given all the information available to us today. We are also not pausing the investment needed to fuel the future of innovation growth.\nI'll now turn to slide nine to spend few minutes on our Outlook by Business discussing high-level expectations by segment with additional details by SBU covered in the commentary portion of the slide. For Aerospace Technologies, we are holding our 2025 full year outlook for organic sales growth in the high single digit range or mid single digit to high single digit when excluding the impact of last year's Bombardier agreement. Aero's is expected to maintain its position as the growth leader for Honeywell, driven by ongoing ramp in flight activity and global defense spending. For the second quarter, organic sales are expected to be up in the mid-single-digit to high-single-digit range, led by strength in our commercial aftermarket business, as supply chain outlook continues to support our outlook. Margins for the quarter and the year should be roughly 26%, as CAES integration headwinds temporarily bring the segment below the run-rate levels. We are lowering the 2025 sales outlook for Industrial Automation to down mid-single-digits year-over-year, as a trajectory of short-cycle orders and customer CapEx decisions has become increasingly uncertain.\nIn the current environment, we expect IA margins to be up modestly versus the prior year, as we work to mitigate a potentially weaker demand environment and incremental costs related to tariffs with additional commercial excellence and productivity actions. We also anticipate Q2 sales to be down mid-single digits year-over-year as strong end-market tailwinds in sensing and continued growth in warehouse automation offset by muted demand growth in productivity solutions, services, and personal protective equipment. Industrial Automation margin is expected to expand as the PPE exit, commercial excellence, and productivity more than offset volume deleverage and cost inflation. For Building Automation, we are raising our 2025 sales outlook to mid-single-digit growth given standout performance in both long- and short-cycle businesses in Q1. Our sales outlook for the remainder of the year remains largely unchanged as momentum from new product innovation and robust demand in high-growth regions is partially tempered by global uncertainty. For our business segment with the most international exposure in the second quarter, we expect sales to be up low mid single digits with sequential and year-over-year growth in both solutions and products.\nMargins for the quarter and for the year should expand as volume leverage, accretion from Access Solutions, and productivity actions more than offset cost inflation in Energy and Sustainability Solutions. We expect 2025 organic sales growth to remain in our previously guided low single digit range year-over-year led by strength in UOP and ongoing momentum in STS. We continue to build on our robust pipeline from sustained global demand in projects despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. We anticipate ESS margin to remain flat as cost inflation is offset by productivity actions and the full year benefit from the LNG acquisition. For the second quarter, organic sales should be up sequentially with flat to up year-over-year growth as backlog conversion is partially offset by the final quarter of difficult foreign comps for the year. Margin is expected to contract from the prior year as a result of timing impacts but remain in line with the first quarter.\nNow let's turn to slide 10 to go over our 2025 EPS bridge. Walking from 2024 adjusted EPS from last year to the midpoint of our 2025 EPS guidance range involves a few moving pieces. We see organic segment profit growth adding $0.13 per share to 2025 earnings, down from our prior guide. The first quarter surpassed our outlook, but that will be more than offset by our more prudent posture towards guidance for the remainder of the year. Driven by geopolitical changes seen over the past few weeks and their possible impact on customer demand, particularly in the back half of the year. Contributions from our 2024 acquisitions are still expected to add approximately $0.33 per share to 2025 EPS.\nNotably, expectations for these businesses have shown stability at levels ahead of our initial plans at the time of purchase. Again, I remind everyone that the Sundyne acquisition is not yet included in guidance for the year. The sale of our PPE business, for which we now model an early May close, will drag down earnings by $0.07 for the year, so it will prove beneficial to segment margin and organic sales growth. Foreign exchange movements since February have modestly reduced the expected currency headwind to earnings for the year to $0.05 per share. Please see the appendix of this presentation for a bridge with the sales impact of effects below the line items. The difference between segment profit and income before tax remains the largest headwind to year-over-year earnings growth at $0.52 per share.\nPension income for the year is still expected to be $550 million, $50 million. Less than 2024 because of one-time item in Europe. The related transaction ended up closing early in the second quarter rather than the first quarter as anticipated previously, which shifted the negative income effect. Repositioning expenses are now expected to be $125 to 225 million, as roughly half of the lower first quarter spending assumed to occur later in the year. Lastly, other below the line expenses anticipate to be modestly higher at $1.35 to 1.4 billion, increasing from 2024 on account of higher interest expense from last year's acquisitions and the first quarter's accelerating share repurchase. Full year tax rate expectations have not changed, though we anticipate a lower rate in the second quarter offset by higher third quarter rate.\nFinally, our full year average share count expectation has been reduced by 12 million shares, increasing the tailwind to EPS to $0.19. Now I'll turn the call back over to Vimal.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nThanks Mike. In closing, our performance in the first quarter exceeded all our communicated targets on the strength of our business model and the dedication of our more than 100,000 Future Shapers around the globe. Our VAS installed base continues to provide stable demand for our solutions in this time of uncertainty. Simultaneously, we are investing substantial resources to expand further into high growth verticals, to develop innovative new products and services, and to grow our supply capabilities to fulfill our record backlog even as we maintain promised level of profitability. In updating our 2025 outlook, we sought to prudently balance the strength of our first quarter results with the unfolding economic uncertainty in the global economy. Taking both into account, we are raising the midpoint of our 2025 EPS guidance.\nThe work to separate Honeywell into three standalone public companies has begun in earnest and the value creation opportunity from greater strategic focus, financial flexibility, and tailored capital priorities for each of the business are becoming clearer each day. Our separation teams kicked off the process with a preparatory spins to lay out clearly the road ahead and the large obstacles to overcome. Such planning will allow us to move both quickly and effectively in the months ahead while ensuring our businesses do not miss a beat. In this way we'll be certain to deliver our commitment to our shareholders, customers, and our employees. One way in which we can further maximize our value as we work through our spin-off transaction is to continue to selectively utilize our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation for accretive bolt-on acquisitions in lieu of the availability of such deals, we believe our shares offer tremendous value at recent levels. With that, Sean, let's take questions.\n\nSean Meakim\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Honeywell International Inc\n\nThank you. Vimal, Vimal and Mike are now available to answer your questions. We ask that you please be mindful of others in the queue by only asking one question and one related follow-up. Operator, please open the line for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you'd like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you'd like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. Our first question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Capital Goods Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. Maybe just a bit more details on the tariff impact. The way that flows through obviously $5 million. I just want to confirm that's the hit.\nI'm assuming that's second half. So the annualized would be closer to a billion dollars. But maybe just talk about kind of the offset strategies there, any pricing versus supply chain measures. Anything there would be helpful.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nHey Nigel. So first of all, I would say if you see the chart in our deck, you know, our local for local strategy is a foundation for, you know, counting the impact of the tariffs. We are largely localized in each regions in United States, and Europe, and so on. So our impact that is, you know, informed by that local footprint. Now to your question. The countermeasures are going to be some pricing.\nWe are going to do pricing where we have the opportunity. At the same time, we have substantial direct material productivity option available this year. With a combination of the two, we are going to offset the impact of this $500 million of tariff. I do believe that if we look at our business mix, it's largely a large part of it is aftermarket, which give us resilience to allow pricing execution there. At the same time, we operate in very rational markets. Most of our competition are public companies which are projecting very similar strategies.\nOur confidence to execute mitigating this $500 million tariff is very high.\n\nSean Meakim\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Honeywell International Inc\n\nJust a clarifying point on the $1 billion estimate. As you put it, keep in mind tariffs in the first half are not zero. So I think as you annualize a full year impact to be something a bit lower than what you suggested, but not too far off.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Capital Goods Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay, thanks Sean, that's helpful. And then Mike, you mentioned contingency in the guide, like macro. So I'm curious, you know, is that more of a top down, you know, reading all the stuff in the press that we were reading, is that more the top down contingency or are you starting to see unusual behavior or anything to kind of inform a weaker second half?\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nThat's correct. That's more a top down view. If we look at our first quarter orders, very strong April strength in orders also continued. So we feel good about that. That said, just looking at our end markets, especially in industrial automation, our exposure to China there, we took a little bit more, I would say. Prudent view in terms of what contingency we want to have just to make sure we protect our total year.\nSo, yes, this is demand contingency for the second half. I don't have any data that would suggest that demand is falling, falling out. But we'll continue to take a prudent stance on our guide. I want to make sure that the guide I give you, I have a high level of confidence the team can deliver on it.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Capital Goods Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nMorning, Steve,\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nCan you guys just parse out what your volume assumption is? I think coming into this year you've talked about like three points of price, maybe what's the volume assumption? Just in the context of this contingency? Just trying to kind of gauge what, you know, what's kind of in the base case and what's just a hedge on that front.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nSure. So just to clarify one more time, our total year framework is unchanged. Everything holds. If you look at our price volume going into the year, we're assuming about, I think, 2% price. That's what we communicated.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nExcluding Bombardier.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nExcluding Bombardier. Then the volume was minus 1 to 2% up. In this current guide, I'm assuming about 3% of price, and I'm assuming about minus 2% of volume to 1% of volume. So that's the conservatism, is there?\n\nSean Meakim\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Honeywell International Inc\n\nWhether you include Lombardi or not, either way, one more point of price, one less of volume would align to the same guide.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nYep, that makes a ton of sense. And then just related to the tariffs, can you maybe talk about how much is roughly coming from China? And I know this may be kind of old news at this stage, but any other Mexico, any other kind of hotspots that we should be watching when it comes to other regions, or is this mostly like a China thing? The $500 million.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nSteve, if you peel out our tariffs. I would say that going into China, exports from US into China is a big part of impact as we've always shared. We are net exporter to China for many years aerospace and ESS business UOP, we ship it from US. So clearly a part of our tariff impact is China-related tariffs on incoming side into US. The impact is not big because we're largely localized, but at the same time there's impact of some products coming from impacted by reciprocal tariffs because we do impact parts from all over the world. And then there is a tail off impact from China both in, you know, specifically in industrial automation business.\nSo that's the construct of it. And as we said before, we have factored all known tariff rates which are known today both coming into US and coming into China.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nAnd Steve, I would just add, so for China it's about 60% to 70% of our overall tariff exposure. Rest of it is reciprocal. Mexico is 100% offset.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nYeah,\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, JPMorgan\n\n100% what? Sorry, Mexico.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nYeah, Mexico is, it's not material to us.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOh, immaterial. Yep, got it. Yeah, 100% covered. Okay, got it. Great, thanks a lot.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good morning. Maybe just wanted to start with the Industrial Automation segment so maybe help us understand, you know, you have that big drop off in the PSS top line in Q1 kind of. How are you thinking about that playing out for the balance of the year? Anything odd going on sort of share wise and on the margin front I suppose those IA margins were down in Q1. I think they guided to be up slightly for the year. So, maybe any help around the sort of cadence of that margin swinging from down to up as we go through the year.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nYeah. So Julian, the PSS Q1 was roughly flattish. If you take out the royalty we get from Zebra, that was the last quarter we had the comps, so it was a flattish revenue. We did extremely well in North America, Europe. There was some pressure. I think it's too early for us to see any comps relative to competition.\nSo I think as our competition will declare results, we'll observe if there any specific puts and takes to share. I would say in our guide when we talked about contingency, there are two drivers of that contingency from the future demand. If I can use the word unknown. One is definitely China. Mike talked about uncertainty. We see there, we have a business exposure, and then second part is the uncertainty around our businesses that touches the retail markets. So PSS being one of them.\nI cannot tell you an absolute number because we are not trying to drill down a number business by business. We have taken an overall broader view. So we do expect some pressure to a certain degree on PSS business in our assumption for rest of the year on the margins in first quarter. The large part of the margin contraction in IA was receivables write off. We had some past receivable write off and based upon the progress of that, we wrote them off. You know, the year as we progress, we don't have the similar event for rest of the year.\nAlso as a PPE business retires from our portfolio, that gives us a favorable tailwind. So fundamentally I think all those factors play out help us margin expansion for rest of the year.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nI would add PPE is obviously accretive to our segment margin and accretive to our organic.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nRight, the PPE. Exactly.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nManaging Director and U.S. Industrials Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThat's helpful. Thank you. And then just my follow up on the capital deployment. Last year you had under $2 billion of buyback and close to $9 billion committed to M&A. This year, year to date you're running a sort of $3 billion buyback and a couple of billion of M&A. Any way you could frame for us sort of the buyback scope for the year?\nAnd I understand it depends on share price action and other uses of cash potentially, but just trying to gauge sort of how aggressive or large could that buyback be assuming the share price stays around current levels?\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nJulian, I would just say at this stage that we will continue to be opportunistic. We obviously view our share price as very attractive at this stage for buybacks. But at the same time we want to. Balance our capital deployment with M&A, and we obviously M&A machine has been now in play for us for a couple of years. So if deals, there are specific deals that we've been working for a while and then attractive to us will not pass them on.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nYeah. So it'll be a balanced approach, Julian. I mean, we do expect opportunistic approach on share buyback to continue, but at the same time, if there's a time-bound M&A deal we have been working for a couple of years, we also don't want to miss the window, you know, at this point of time. So it will be a balanced approach.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nManaging Director and U.S. Industrials Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nPerfect. Thank you.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nThank you.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nHey, good morning. Vimal, Mike, and Sean. Hey, I hate to beat the dead horse. But still on tariffs, I just wanted to clarify kind of the cadence of, you know, you got the cost side of tariffs and you have price. I imagine they don't match up kind of perfectly unless you're doing surcharges, I suppose. But is the intent to match up price and mitigation efforts with tariffs by, say, the end of the year and have it be neutral by then, or do you think you can do it sooner than that?\nOh, I would, I would say it will be much sooner than that. I mean, we have a, we stood up a large team of people that can understand tariffs by HTS code and know it essentially to a dollar. And the teams have been quite active in terms of understanding what, how to offset it, and what are the mitigation actions.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nI would say it's not 100% price. I mean, like Vimal said earlier, we have other options and our direct material productivity has been really good. So we're trying to manage, I would say, demand with cost and demand destruction vis-à-vis price. So we feel very confident. And in the second half, we'll be, I would say, on par. And definitely by fourth quarter we'll be in a stable operating mode, assuming things don't change materially for us here.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nYeah, that's good color. Hey, I'm not asking for specific numbers, but let's just say that it's $800 million ballpark of total tariff impacts. If there was a way to kind of rank it by segment or give us a little color by segment of where the bigger impacts are. Just be helpful if you want to give numbers. That would be great, but I don't expect it.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nSo Vimal mentioned earlier, but our largest exposure on tariffs is in industrial automation, just because of the supply chain there and also in aerospace, which aero is exported to China. So those are two largest segments. They have exposure. Building automation is largely protected. They're almost 100% local for local in their geographies. And then ESS, we don't see a lot of tariff exposure, maybe a little bit of a demand risk in China, given they sell to China as well. But that's something that I think is all of it is contained in our guide.\nAnd I feel at this stage is de-risk assuming things stay the way they are.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay, good comment. I appreciate it. Thank you guys. I'll pass it on.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nThank you, Scott.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nHi, yes, good morning.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nGood morning. Morning. Andrew,\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell International Inc.\n\nGood morning.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nSo looking at Aerospace, I think on aero OE, you know, I think we were sort of indicating that OE was going to be better than I think what happened. And then on the aftermarket I think it came in quite a bit stronger. And I appreciate that your numbers seem to be in line with what other folks are reporting in the Aerospace. But can you give us more color as to what's happening on the OE? What's happening on the aftermarket? Is there a destock going on?\nWould be greatly appreciated. Thank you.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nSo Andrew, at the first outset I would say, you know. The aero volume manufacturing volumes are growing. Why you don't see that showing up in the OE revenue is, there are two drivers for that. The first is the mix of our products. We have, you know, when we ship specifically mechanical products, we have cost oversell. So even though we are shipping more volume due to cost oversell, our revenue growth actually goes towards opposite direction, goes negative due to, due to that.\nSo when you have a higher mix of cost oversell products in a given quarter, that has its impact. And the second driver is the timing. When we recognize we ship the revenue and customer recognizes revenue, that does also have a driver on our overall revenue recognition process. So the combination of the two really drives the OE growth numbers. What you see, as the year progresses, we do expect these numbers to improve. Overall as we reconfirm the Aerospace guidance for the year, we continue to remain very bullish.\nI think these are the puts and takes in the business with more than $2 billion of backlog. We remain very confident on delivering Aerospace.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nExcellent. Just to follow up, I mean, I guess there are a lot of headlines out there about all this traffic, all this shipping traffic out of China collapsing over the next four to six weeks. How should we think about it? I would imagine is that in parts of IA the supply chain is exposed to China. Can you just tell us because you're so diversified, you've been in China for a long, long time, how is that going to play out? Because there's this doom and gloom scenario how everything is going to come to grinding halt in about four to six weeks.\nDoesn't seem we see that in your guidance appreciate different manufacturing footprint, longer cycle exposure. But as I said, I would greatly appreciate any color you can give us. How you guys going to deal with sort of, you know, effectively trade embargo between the US and China. Thank you.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nSo I would say. Products coming in from China into the US, the biggest impact of that is in the Industrial Automation business. So to that degree, there will be a tariff pressure which is already into our guide. It's already factored in. On the opposite side, when we ship products from US into China, that's primarily a driver in aerospace and in ESS business. So again, the impact of those tariffs are again factored into our guide.\nOverall, we also have factored the demand destruction on either side of the fence due to the known facts, what we know today, and that's how we have guided at this point of time. Any view for us, I would say we are really looking at potential reduction in volume in our short cycle in our automation business or reduction of demand of catalysts for UOP. Those are the kind of assumptions we have made. But it's to be seen if they really play out depending on how economic situation plays out.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nBut it's actually it's demand destruction; it's not ability to access the actual components and parts. Right. Because I think the headlines indicate like this massive shortage of parts. But it seems for you it's under control.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nYes. I don't see, we don't foresee any shortage of parts. I think it's just the tariffs coming in and the business demand destruction. I haven't seen or heard any lack of product availability for Honeywell so far.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nReally appreciate it. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director in Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nGood morning, guys, and thank you. Maybe two more on aerospace. First, if I could, just following up on Andrew's comments on aftermarket. 15% commercial aftermarket growth versus the guidance of mid- to high-single-digits. How was price a contributor, and how do you think about overall price in aero versus the 3% for the total company, and any color regionally you could provide on aftermarket behavior.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nSheila, I would say on the aftermarket, as Vimal mentioned, we still have over $2 billion of positive backlog. So whenever our, I would say, our shops have capacity, we ship to whoever we can to satisfy that demand. So our, I would say, results for the next couple of quarters will still be, I would say, lumpy in terms of OE aftermarket mix. Generally our price is in line with what we guided at the beginning of the year. So there's no change there for aftermarket. And I know what the hours, I would say flight hours moderated a little bit here going to the second year, but we still see good hours, 4+% hours.\nAnd we, as you know, we have exposure to ATR and business aviation, and those business aviation hours are more and more stable. And defense also has aftermarket in there, and defense is growing extremely strong, especially in the aftermarket. So I would say overall, I know it's a little bit lumpy, but I would say our construct for the year is not changing vis-à-vis what's happening in the commercial aviation.",
    "content2": "Sheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director in Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nOkay. Maybe if commercial OE still set to outperform aftermarket for the year, and any color on commercial OE production rates you could provide?\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nSo commercial OE will. Normalize in the second half. Right now what I see is we have a little bit of mix within a mix issue. It's not even an issue, just a reality of how our OEMs take product between mechanical and electronics. That said, like Vimal said, our supply chain output, our factory output for the quarter again was double-digit. So we're really, really confident that this OE demand is continuing to stay with us for the remainder of the year going to next year.\nAnd within that $2 billion, we OE is about $1 billion of positive backlog, if not more.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director in Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nAmit Mehrotra\n\nManaging Director and the Industrial Sector Head, UBS\n\nOkay, thanks. Congrats on the quarter. Just maybe a couple quick ones. One, can you just update us on the timing of the spin if you think it could happen sooner than what you noted earlier? And then if aerospace margins, I get the CAES and there's some mixed dilution. Is there an but, you know, but is there an opportunity to kind of build on the Q1 margin as we progress through, just given the higher revenue, or do we think first quarter is kind of the right run rate for the rest of the year?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nSo, timing of the spin, Amit, as we've indicated for advanced materials, it's Q4 this year/Q1 of next year. I think we are far along the way. As we'll come to the Q2 earnings call, we'll be able to provide you a specific date. I think we have some external elements which are not entirely our control. So because that's only variable, if you ask me, our own execution that is progressing extremely well. You know, we are on schedule to execute all the tasks, but I cannot control anything which are not in Honeywell control, specifically regulatory agency approvals.\nWe cannot control the timing of that and aerospace spin dates. I think it's early days. We started work just about two months back. But we are working to, you know, make it on schedule. And as the schedule progresses, we'll provide you more specific color. What will be the specific date?\nBecause right now I fully appreciate the date is bit wide H2 and our goal is to refine the date and provide more specific outcome on that. On aerospace margins, as we had provided the guide during start of the year, I think there are two specific drivers for the aero margins for 2025. One is the mix of, you know, mix or mix within the mix of the products we are shipping. The second is the CAES acquisition integration is going to be part of the P&L. There's integration-related cost. The business also gets onboarded with a lower margin, which on a longer term is good news because we can expand those margins.\nBut the combination of those two factors, the aero margin, I would say that the aero margins will remain on a similar pace. As you've seen in Q1, we don't expect any substantial shift. But on an overall year basis, I think the guidance that we provided at start of the year, that still holds good.\n\nAmit Mehrotra\n\nManaging Director and the Industrial Sector Head, UBS\n\nOkay, that's helpful. Just as a follow-up, you know the Building Automation we've now had two straight quarters of high single-digit growth. I know last quarter you didn't necessarily want to extrapolate the goodness into this year, but now we've had another quarter of high single-digit growth. As we think about the guidance over, I mean comps get a little bit more difficult. So maybe that explains it. But is the guidance still reflective of kind of not extrapolating what we've been seeing over the last couple quarters or do you think now it's kind of more realistic based on the trend?\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nSo as you saw in our guide, we raised the Building Automation guidance from low single-digits to mid single-digits to mid single-digits. Then part of our demand contingency, we think in the second half is related to us just taking a prudent stance on. Potential demand destruction in the H2. Building Automation projects I would say continue to be strong. We're just watching our short-cycle demand, product demand, and if Building Automation continues at this pace, I think they have a chance to beat that. But we're just being prudent as far as Q2, the rest of the Q2, and the Q3, given everything going on in the market.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nI think the overall strategy in Building Automation is really playing out. We focused on pivoting our business to higher growth verticals. Like data center, like hospitality. And those segments are growing regardless of the current conditions. So certainly that's helping. But also, at the same time, the business has the largest global footprint exposure.\nThis business is like literally 1/3 in US, 1/3 in Europe, 1/3 in Asia. So given the uncertainty in the global trade environment, we are therefore being conscious of the fact that it can hit on the headwinds on the economic side, economic uncertainty. So we have factored that. But if you ask me on the strategy side, the business is executing extremely well, and if things don't change, the business will continue to deliver the numbers you've seen over the last few quarters.\n\nAmit Mehrotra\n\nManaging Director and the Industrial Sector Head, UBS\n\nWonderful. Okay, thank you very much.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nThank you.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes to the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning guys. Maybe just following up on that, on. That last point and just relating it. To the demand contingency that you've baked into the guide. So is it fair to say then you've got some good visibility on your long cycle businesses, but it's really just on the short cycle side, maybe in IA, maybe in BA that you're most concerned and you're building in as contingency, just any color that you can kind of parse out for what's baked into that demand contingency number.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nSure, sure. So I would say we have very good line of sight to the long cycle for the year. With respect to short cycle, if we look at industrial automation, that's the business that's the most exposure to China. We're watching that, especially the products part of the business. And then building automation, I mean Building Automation has been doing extremely well for the last three quarters and continues. We have really no reason to worry at this stage.\nBut like I said, we're just taking a prudent approach to the second half. So I'm feeling confident about the second half. But like I said at the beginning, we want to continue to make sure that we give a guide that we have high level of confidence we can deliver.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThat's helpful. And then, just my quick follow-up, [it's] helpful to get some color on the separations. I'm just wondering, has there been any update on either the one-time cost or the stranded cost that you can give us any more information on either of those two options?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nSo, I think they are the one-time cost we had indicated between the band of $1.5 to $2 billion. We are on plan to stay in the same range given the large part of that one-time cost related to aerospace, and we are early innings of execution of that. Therefore, it's hard to refine that number at this point of time. Stranded cost. We already started doing the work to look at stranded cost, starting with Advanced Materials spin happening end of the year, our confidence that stranded cost will be, you know, eliminated between 18, 24 months time is very high post spin. So, working on that front and we will make sure that we execute on the same.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes in line of Chris Snyder with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nExecutive Director in Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. Maybe for my first one, just on Q2 margins, you know, guided flat quarter on quarter despite, you know, volumes going higher and the PPE divestiture, which should have some level of margin tailwinds, I guess. Is this kind of saying that there's some margin pressure in Q2 on the tariffs, and then as we go into the back half, we will get neutral per some of the earlier comments? Thank you.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nI don't see any. I would say margin compression right now incremental to everything that we saw in the first quarter. Second quarter, to me, looks benign in terms of any new information. It feels more like first quarter. And the 260, 270 that we guided, we feel is appropriate given, given everything that's going on. And our mix holds, our pricing is holding.\nSo I don't see any structural issues.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nOne item I'll add to Mike's point is, I think, quarter to quarter, if you really want to look at quarter to quarter differences, ESS margins were substantially up in Q1. That won't be the case in Q2. It's just the mix of shipments of catalyst catalyst shipment by product by product. Some are high margin, some are moderate margin. So depending on Q2 has a different shipment levels or shipment mix compared to Q1. But that doesn't concern us at all.\nI think it's just a very normal course of this event. And overall the guidance, what we did for the ESS margin, that still holds very good.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nExecutive Director in Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nNo. Yeah, thank you. I appreciate that. And then maybe Vimal, just maybe a bigger picture question on Industrial Automation portfolio. The business has leading positions in process, building, and warehouse. You know, there's not much of a discrete presence for sales into, you know, a factory.\nYou talked earlier about willingness to do M&A. So I guess my question, my question is do you think it's important for Honeywell Automation standalone entity to have discrete exposure in the portfolio? Thank you,\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nChris. You know, as we're looking at the equity story of Honeywell Automation, the way we are looking at it is our exposure to the end markets. We want to build a portfolio which is exposed to high growth and verticals. So examples of that would be LNG. Example of that will be data center. Example of that will be semiconductor.\nSo rather than looking at the business with a lens of process, hybrid, and discrete, we are looking at the business with the lens of end markets and how much exposure you can have, and we'll share more with you when we are ready. They have nothing for or against discrete automation. It's not that we like or don't like it. I think it's a factor of our exposure in that segment is low, that's a fact. But if it's any attractive opportunity which is exposed to higher growth markets as we have demonstrated in our acquisition profile, we'll absolutely execute that. We are looking for an acquisition which are accretive to our growth rates and if possible also accretive to our margin rates.\nWe don't want to build onboard something which then we are being defensive on our growth profile. So more to come there. We remain active in our M&A portfolio and continue to outlook for good opportunities.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nExecutive Director in Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nAppreciate that. Thank you.\n\nSean Meakim\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Honeywell International Inc\n\nWe'll take one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question this morning will come from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director and U.S. Industrial Sector Head, Citigroup\n\nGood morning everyone. Thanks for sending me in. You mentioned that HPS is expected to lead Industrial Automation's growth in 2025. I think in the presentation, but it didn't lead growth in Q1. I think warehouse automation did. So can you talk about the visibility you have in HBS going forward, and while you're having conversations with your customers, are you seeing any hints of CapEx delays or project deferrals, and what end markets or regions are driving HBS's growth?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nYes, HBS numbers. Andy, if you see on a reported basis, as we've said in our prepared comments, we saw strength in our aftermarket services. That certainly drove a lot. There are other businesses which are reported as part of HPS, Thermal Solutions, and Smart Energy. They saw minor pressure, so net net the whole segment was reported as flat. But if you look at the projects and services in HPS, they are performing as expected.\nIn light of your question, are we seeing any pressure on projects? I think with a combination of the lens we have on both the UOP side of the projects and HPS side, I certainly see some push out on projects which were sustainability related. I think customers' willingness to spend money on sustainability related investments, energy companies are becoming more cautious, and certainly we expect that factor to persist. On the other side, we see very strong trends on growth in gas processing and LNG. So kind of one offsets the other, and that's why we have a portfolio which is very diversified. We cover all these end markets.\nSo net net, we do believe that, you know, we will have a normal year for HBS in 2025.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director and U.S. Industrial Sector Head, Citigroup\n\nHelpful. Just back to Aero and Defense in space. You have difficult comps essentially all year in defense, but you delivered double-digit growth in Q1. Are you seeing more strength in international defense now or is it growth relatively balanced, and then doesn't seem like you have or expect to see any impact from DOGE, but maybe you can elaborate on that.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nYeah, so I think first maybe just answer the DOGE question. We don't see an impact. Majority of our programs are funded or have been funded, and those are multi-year programs. So we don't see an issue there. And like I said earlier, international defense is continuing to show strength and strong demand and interest out there. So I don't think the team will have any issue in terms of managing the comps on the defense and space side this year.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director and U.S. Industrial Sector Head, Citigroup\n\nThanks guys.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nThank you, Andy.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our time allowed for questions. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Kapur for any final comments.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International Inc\n\nI want to express my sincere appreciation to our shareholders, our Future Shapers, and our customers for the unwavering support during this transformational time for Honeywell. Our future is bright and we're excited to share more with you as we make progress in delivering with our commitments. Thank you very much for listening and please stay safe and healthy.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to Sean Meakim, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nSean Meakim\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Honeywell International\n\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's Q4 2024 Earnings and 2025 Outlook Conference Call. On the call with me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Vimal Kapur, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Greg Lewis, and incoming CFO Mike Stepniak. This webcast and the presentation materials, including non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our Investor Relations website.\nFrom time to time, we post new information that may be of interest or material to our investors on this website. Our discussion today includes forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today, and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the ones described in our SEC filings.\nThis morning, we will review our financial results for the Q4 and full year 2024, discuss our outlook for the year, share our guidance for the Q1 and full year 2025, and provide an update on the comprehensive portfolio evaluation. As always, we'll leave time for your questions at the end. With that, I'll turn the call over to Chairman and CEO Vimal Kapur.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International\n\nThank you, Sean, and good morning to everyone joining us today. We finished 2024 on a positive note, exceeding or meeting the high end of our guidance for organic sales growth and adjusted earnings growth in the Q4 while navigating an uneven operating environment. During 2024, we deployed over $14 billion of capital, including four closed acquisitions for approximately $9 billion, remaining on track to surpass our commitment to deploy at least $25 billion of capital through 2025.\nWe also delivered on a promise to exit non-core lines of business with a planned spin-off of Advanced Materials and the sale of our personal protective equipment business in the quarter. Turning to 2025, we're excited by our progress from our future-shaping innovations to growing our global installed base. That said, we are aware that the evolving geopolitical situation, challenging global macroeconomic conditions, and tempered demand expectations in some end markets may pressure our near-term momentum.\nAs a result, we are offering a realistic baseline for 2025 performance based on current end market conditions and without assuming a recovery in short-cycle demand. While the current operating environment presents some near-term challenges, we continue to believe in the strong through-cycle growth potential of our best-in-class businesses. Now, let's zoom out from the near-term dynamic to discuss an important step in our journey to transform Honeywell.\nFollowing our year-long comprehensive business portfolio evaluation, we have decided to pursue a full separation of automation and aerospace technologies. We believe the results of our strategic assessment provide clear direction for the future of Honeywell. Let's turn to slide three to discuss today's portfolio announcement in more detail.\nAs many of you know, Honeywell has performed portfolio evaluations systematically for many years, evaluating various ways to potentially unlock value as conditions evolve. About a year ago, I initiated a process to look even deeper at different structures, including full separation of our largest businesses. Following the completion of this in-depth internal portfolio review, I'm prepared to share with you today that the Honeywell Board of Directors has concluded that the separation of automation and aerospace is in the best interest of Honeywell shareholders.\nThis step, coupled with the previously announced plan to spin advanced materials, will result in three industry-leading public companies with tailored strategies and growth drivers. The formation of these three distinct companies will enable greater strategic focus, operational independence, and financial flexibility to pursue growth opportunities, unlocking significant value for our stakeholders, including shareholders, customers, and employees.\nFrom a timeline perspective, we expect to complete the separation in second half of 2026 and in a manner that is tax-free to Honeywell shareholders. In between, we remain very focused on delivering on our commitment and will continue to identify ways to further shape our portfolio and create shareholder value. Now, let's turn to the next slide to discuss why we think this is the right time to separate into three publicly traded companies.\nThe decisions build on the operational and digital foundation we have created over the past two decades and the series of strategic actions we have taken over the past year to dramatically simplify Honeywell. Our accelerator operating system is mature and will be a source of strength for each company. Looking ahead, we see increasing divergent strategic pathways for automation and aerospace.\nThis is a logical next step to bring the portfolio to the next phase of transformation and unlock incremental value. With that, let's turn to slide five to talk about the strategic rationale behind today's announcement. We believe the planned separation of automation, aerospace, and advanced materials will benefit all stakeholders and position all three standalone companies for long-term profitable growth. The path will enable three pure-play companies to pursue simplified go-forward strategies that are clearly aligned to the unique purpose of each business and to address the specific needs of their end markets.\nWith this clarity of strategy and incentives, and the enhanced financial flexibility that comes with being an independent public company, Honeywell Automation, Honeywell Aerospace, and Advanced Materials will be able to meaningfully drive innovation throughout investment cycles. The distinct investment profile of each company and an improved ability to customize capital allocation strategy will unleash the full potential of each company's strong balance sheet, creating the best path forward for enhanced commercial success, faster-paced technological innovation, and increased customer intimacy.\nEach business will be able to build on their existing powerful foundation with the guidance of a focused Board of Directors and management teams that have deep domain expertise and a clear vision for their future. We are committed to strong investment-grade credit rating for both Automation and Aerospace and a strong non-investment-grade credit rating for Advanced Materials, positioning all three to successfully compete for capital among their respective peer sets. Now, let's turn to page six to talk about what it means for each of these three standalone companies.\nWe are creating three scaled pure-play public companies that have leading positions in their specific categories with a distinct competitive advantage and compelling long-term and market growth drivers. Each has a strong set of competitive advantages built and sustained over decades, coupled with cohesive strategic direction and compelling secular growth drivers to support attractive top and bottom-line growth. Honeywell Automation will be a pure-play automation leader driving digital transformation, energy security, and increased industrial autonomy globally.\nHoneywell Aerospace will be a diversified premier aerospace technology and system provider to all forms of aircraft, with some of the most compelling financial metrics in all of the aerospace. Advanced Materials will be sustainability-focused specialty chemicals and materials pure-play with a strong IP portfolio and set of unique growth investment opportunities. Let's turn to the next page to talk through the value proposition of Honeywell Automation.\nCutting-edge controls and automation technology have been the foundation for Honeywell for a century. We have been leading market position across process, industrial, energy, and building end markets that go back decades, creating a vast install base globally. Honeywell technology is used in over 10 million buildings, 17,000 process plants, providing a powerful platform to enable growth through our services and software. Honeywell Automation brands are highly valued and well-recognized across the globe, and we have numerous long-lasting customer relationships.\nAs a standalone $18 billion business, Honeywell Automation's global scale, deep domain expertise, and long-lasting technology leadership positions can tackle the world's most complex problem and power digital transformation on a global level. Honeywell Automation's current segment margin of 23% is supported by a track record of driving continuous improvement in operating efficiency through our accelerator operating system.\nWe anticipate that the secular growth, such as chronic labor scarcity, increased funding for capital projects, both public and private, energy security, and supply chain resiliency will all stimulate further growth. The rapid advancement in automation technologies is enabling the manufacturing sector to unlock valuable new sources of efficiency through cloud connectivity and advanced analytics. These trends are compounding as we speak with the progression of industrial AI evolving from theory into reality, transforming automated facilities into autonomous facilities.\nIn an automated facility, machines with pre-programmed instructions and deterministic outcomes govern the industrial process. In an autonomous facility, systems or machines can analyze years of historical data and make recommendations and decisions that adapt to new conditions, changing environments, or unanticipated problems.\nWe believe this momentum will only accelerate in coming years and continue to drive increased demand for high-quality sensors, controls, process, and software technology, all of which are right in Honeywell's wheelhouse. In fact, our leading software-based Honeywell Forge IoT platform is already improving asset performance, enhancing labor productivity, and increasing cybersecurity for our customers, as well as driving valuable recurring revenue streams for Honeywell.\nIncreasing energy demand, the requirement to reduce emissions, and heightened energy security concerns are driving the need for significant investment in emerging energy verticals, infrastructure, as well as for fortifying traditional energy sources. Honeywell Automation is uniquely positioned to help meet world's needs on both fronts, with leading innovations from renewable fuel technology to LNG, building our largest installed base of process technology for the energy sector.\nAs an independent automation pure-play, Honeywell Automation will be able to anchor the direction of the company to build on a powerful foundation and focus capital allocation strategies on deepening presence in high-growth verticals. We believe this will drive differentiated performance for both customers and shareholders. On the next page, we'll talk about Honeywell Aerospace in more detail. Moving to aerospace, Honeywell has a 100-plus year heritage as a crucial innovator in aerospace and defense, with a diverse portfolio of technology and systems that spans nearly every major commercial, defense, and space platform worldwide.\nAs a standalone business, Honeywell Aerospace will be one of the largest publicly traded pure-play aerospace suppliers with a global scale in the highest value and most critical areas across the value chain. For example, aerospace has delivered over 100,000 auxiliary power units, a technology we invented, and 72,000 engines since 1969, and it's staggering, 90% of global aircraft use Honeywell avionics. On its own, Honeywell will pursue tailored capital deployment priorities to position the business to continue driving growth, delivering reliability to customers, and positioning the business for the future of aviation through increasing electrification and autonomy of flight.\nWith an annual sale of $15 billion and a streamlined cost structure yielding best-in-class segment margin of 26%, Honeywell Aerospace has a solid financial profile which can support continued growth in investment in new innovations while maintaining industry-leading profitability. Aerospace also has significant expanding high-margin revenue streams from retrofits, modifications, and upgrades, or RMUs.\nThese new value propositions are purpose-driven to serve customer needs within our install base and offer a source of growth that is decoupled from OEM build rates or flight hours, another key source of differentiated financial performance. Aerospace technology has deep end market penetration and global scale in aircraft propulsion, cockpit and navigation systems, and auxiliary power units. With a robust Honeywell-funded R&D investment profile of approximately 4% of sales and a customer-funded R&D of approximately 7% of the sales, our business is well-positioned to benefit from multiple years ahead of unprecedented demand within traditional aerospace and defense.\nAging fleets with a lengthy backlog for replacement, increasing defense budgets given geopolitical uncertainty and higher flight activity in high-growth regions provide support for healthy commercial and defense OE investment upcycle alongside aftermarket strength. At the same time, the industry is in a dire need for new electrification and sustainability offerings to meet steep global carbon reduction initiatives.\nAlready now integrated electric propulsion systems combine motor, controller, power, and cooling system with Honeywell's unrivaled expertise in fly-by-wire avionics, including the next-generation Anthem Flight Deck, making the future of aviation safe, quiet, and efficient. Honeywell Aerospace electrification and autonomous-driven technology is also leading innovation that will transform travel and delivery services as well as how countries defend themselves. This is creating a significant new source of revenue for Aero in the decades ahead, as evidenced by over $10 billion in advanced air mobility wins.\nAn independent aerospace company of this scale and global presence will benefit from a focused strategy, a well-capitalized public company structure, a dedicated board with a deep domain expertise, and targeted high-return investment, both organic and inorganic, to deliver the future of aviation. Let's turn to slide nine to talk about Advanced Materials. Finally, for Advanced Materials, as we discussed last October, we announced the spin. We are very excited about the opportunity to create a leading sustainability-focused specialty chemicals and materials pure-play.\nWe believe that as a standalone specialty chemicals and materials business, the company will benefit from greater financial flexibility to pursue its own growth agenda and associated investment choices. This includes distinct opportunities in next-gen sustainable refrigerant, specialty electronic materials, and highly engineered solutions for healthcare applications.\nThe business generated approximately $4 billion of sales in 2024, with sector-leading EBITDA margins of about 25% on an estimated standalone cost basis. With over $1 billion invested over the past eight years, AM has built a robust economic moat with an efficient supply chain and a global customer base in a highly regulated vertical. AM's solid competitive positioning stems from a differentiated IP portfolio made up of over 5,000 active patents and applications created by a deep bench of more than 400 highly specialized technologists and engineers.\nA standalone AM will be able to continue to focus on developing new, more sustainable solutions through next-gen chemistry, and this pure-play business with a compelling investment profile is uniquely positioned to benefit from strong macro trends. Now, let's turn to slide 10 to talk about progress on transforming our portfolio. In a little over a year, we have made tremendous progress on optimizing and simplifying the portfolio. In the fall of 2023, we announced a plan to reorganize our business around three mega trends.\nDuring 2024, we announced a total of four strategic bolt-on acquisitions, plus a handful of smaller but strategically important technology tokens, committing $10 billion of capital and adding about $2 billion of runway revenue, growing at accretive rates. In addition to these adds, we also are executing on simplification of portfolio with the pending sale of PPE business. Today's announcement to separate automation and aerospace, coupled with the planned spin of AM, marks the beginning of the next phase of our transformation. We remain committed to and excited about the prospect of Quantinuum.\nLast week, SoftBank announced a partnership with Quantinuum to explore ways to unlock innovative quantum computing solutions that will overcome the limitation of classical AI and explore quantum data center business models, just the latest validation of our technical progress. Quantinuum continues to make great strides in both technical and commercial progression, and we look forward to an eventual IPO for this business. We will continue to make M&A a consistent part of our operational rhythm, seeking to acquire a creative bolt-on that further shapes the portfolio and enhances the value proposition of each business during the pendency of the separation process.\nWe are confident that our dynamic capital deployment strategy, including acquisitions, further share repurchases, and optimizing our operation will lead to an enhanced financial profile for Honeywell that is more attractive to investors.Finally, we are committed to reducing our share count by at least 1% this year net of dilution, which equates to more than $3 billion of capital deployed over the next 12 months. This reflects our conviction in the future value creation of our strategic plan, near to momentum in the business performance, and what we believe to be a stock trading at an attractive valuation.\nLet's turn to slide 11 to talk about the next steps. In terms of path forward, we remain on track to complete the spin of Advanced Materials by the end of 2025 or in early 2026. The planned separation of Automation and Aerospace we announced today is expected to be achieved in a manner that is tax-free to Honeywell shareholders and targeted for completion in second half 2026.\nWe will leverage the rigorous operating principles underpinning our accelerating operating system to prevent business disruption and manage the one-time cost of $1.5 to 2 billion associated with the separation of both automation and aerospace, as well as advanced materials spins. This operating playbook is a deeply ingrained part of Honeywell culture and will carry on inside each of these three powerful franchises. We will provide you with updates on progress towards completing these separations.\nImportantly, we'll maintain a steadfast approach to executing on our commitment to our customers, shareholders, and employees as we enter this next phase of portfolio transformation. Now, before I turn it over to Greg on slide eight to discuss our Q4 and full year 2024 results in more detail, I want to thank him personally for his leadership and partnership in my first two years as CEO. Greg Lewis's effort as CFO over the past seven years has been instrumental in transforming Honeywell. Greg, I wish you all the best in your next chapter.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell International\n\nThank you for those kind words, Vimal. It's been a privilege to lead this iconic company alongside you and Darius. Good morning, everyone. Honeywell finished 2024 on a strong note, meeting the high end of our organic growth and adjusted EPS guidance in Q4 despite a still challenging macroeconomic environment. Cash flow is also a positive, coming in at the high end of guidance in Q4. Importantly, during the quarter, we announced the landmark agreement with Bombardier, one of the largest business jet OEMs globally, to provide the next generation of technology for current and future aircraft in avionics, propulsion, and satellite communications.\nThis includes the first deployment of our next-gen Anthem avionics at scale and comes with a lifetime value of the partnership of $17 billion. While the related investments lowered our reported performance in the Q4, the long-term economics are compelling, and there is no impact on 2025 performance. We're proud of the enhanced partnership we're building with Bombardier and excited for the opportunity to lead the industry into the future of aviation. Turning to the Q4, we ended the year positively with sales and earnings per share exceeding our prior guidance range.\nOverall sales increased 2% organically or 6% excluding Bombardier, with year-over-year organic growth improving five points sequentially in both IA and BA from the Q3. Segment margins declined 70 basis points from the previous year when excluding the Bombardier impact of 280 basis points. Adjusted earnings per share improved 9% excluding Bombardier, with segment profit growth more than offsetting higher below-the-line costs. Q4 free cash flow declined 27%, mostly due to the cash contributions related to the Bombardier agreement.\nHoneywell's backlog reached a record level of $35.3 billion in the quarter, growing 11% year-over-year. Excluding acquisitions, backlog was up 6% year-over-year and 1% sequentially, with particular strength in ESS. Q4 orders increased 11% organically from the prior year, growing in all four segments. For more details on the drivers of our Q4 and 2024 results, including year-over-year bridges, please look in the appendix of today's presentation.\nTo wrap 2024, Honeywell's full year organic sales increased 3%, or 4% excluding the impact of the Bombardier agreement, as double-digit organic growth in our longer-cycle aerospace and building solutions businesses more than offsets softness in the products businesses in industrial and building automation. 2024 acquisitions contributed over $800 million to sales at accretive growth rates, while integration efforts are proceeding well. Full year segment profit grew 1%, with margin contraction of 90 basis points in 2024. Excluding Bombardier, segment profit grew 6%, with 20 basis points of margin contraction.\nMargin pressure in the year was driven by contraction in Industrial Automation, with Aero roughly flat, excluding Bombardier, ESS roughly flat, and BA up. We believe our Accelerator operating system will continue to enable us to expand margins over time, but the pace of expansion can be uneven, especially when coming off 150 basis points of combined improvement in 2022 and 2023. 2024 adjusted earnings per share grew 4%, or 9% excluding Bombardier. We also generated $4.9 billion of free cash flow, $5.5 billion excluding Bombardier, at the high end of our most recent guidance range.\nWe deployed $8.9 billion towards M&A, closing four acquisitions this year. In total, we allocated $14.6 billion of total capital, including $1.7 billion to repurchase eight million shares, $1.2 billion to capital expenditures, and $2.9 billion to dividends, which we raised again for the 15th time in 14 years. So before I hand it off to Mike to discuss our outlook for the year, I want to thank Vimal, all of my fellow Honeywell future shapers, and my family for supporting me during the past seven years as CFO.\nI'm proud of the transformation Honeywell has undergone, optimizing our portfolio and greatly increasing our digital capabilities. I also want to reaffirm my confidence in Mike as the next CFO of Honeywell. Working with him on this transition over the past five months has only confirmed the decision we made was a great one. He has all the skills and commitment needed to bring Honeywell into the next phase of growth, and I'm excited for the future. So Mike, over to you.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nVP of Finance and Incoming CFO, Honeywell International\n\nThank you for the support, Greg, and all your contributions to Honeywell. Let's turn to the next slide. Looking at our major end market exposures entering 2025, we see underlying long-term secular strength being met with near-term challenges in the macroeconomic backdrop and heightened geopolitical tensions. In aerospace, commercial fleet growth and replenishment continue, and defense investments remain elevated, with some natural moderation from the double-digit growth rates seen for the past three years.\nWe benefit from public and private spending on infrastructure projects, and the ongoing push for more automation investment addressing chronic labor shortages and inflation, but demand for short-cycle products remains muted in the near term. Energy investments in a number of verticals will continue to support our sustained backlog, while growing demand for digitalization of processes across many end markets enables the potential for increasingly AI-enabled offerings to boost our customers' productivity.\nBreaking down our 2025 market view geographically, high-growth regions in the US will be drivers for ongoing growth, partially offset by weaker demand for automation products in Europe and China. The end market and regional views, combined with the headwind from the strengthening US dollar, temper our outlook for 2025. We are working to determine the magnitude of the pending impact on our business from new tariffs, which are not currently included in our guidance. Overall, Honeywell is well-positioned to navigate the near-term challenges, and our Accelerator operating system will help alleviate margin pressures from business mix and integration costs.\nNow, let's turn to the next slide to discuss specifics of the Q1 and full year 2025 guidance. For 2025, we anticipate sales of $39.6 to 40.6 billion, which represents organic growth of 2% to 5%, or 1% to 4% when excluding the prior year impact of the Bombardier agreement. Our sales guide assumes a mid-year exit of our PPE business but does not include the spin-off of Advanced Materials, which we remain on track to complete by the end of 2025 or in early 2026.\nOur baseline outlook for 2025 assumes a continuation of current industrial demand environment throughout the year and does not assume a recovery in our end markets. Aerospace will once again lead growth for the company, followed by BA and ESS. Our acquisitions from 2024 will contribute approximately $2 billion in sales this year, growing accretive rates and becoming part of the organic growth towards the end of the year. For the Q1, we expect sales of $9.5 to 9.7 billion, flat to up 2% organically.\nIn addition to the normal seasonal step-down in revenue from Q4 to Q1, we will see some headwind in product businesses from fewer comparable selling days. Segment margin for the year is expected to be up 60 to 100 basis points, or down 10 to up 30 basis points excluding Bombardier, as productivity actions and commercial excellence are partially offset by cost inflation, business mix. The automation businesses will lead margin expansion for the year as BA sees volume leverage from recovery in building product sales and IA benefits from mid-year sales of PPE.\nAerospace margin declines, primarily driven by the impact of the lower margin CAES acquisition and its integration, will mostly offset improvements in other three segments. Excluding Aero, the remaining portfolio will experience margin expansion in products, projects, and aftermarket services and software, but materially faster growth in projects will create a margin headwind. We expect this dynamic to hold until we see a broader acceleration in higher margin, short-cycle product end markets. For Q1, segment margin is anticipated to be in the range of 22.5% to 22.9%, down 10 to 50 basis points year-over-year.\nWe assume a modest acceleration in organic sales growth through the year as 2024 acquisitions reach their anniversary, aerospace supply improves to unlock additional sales, and the selling days pressure reverses in products. However, the quarterly progression will look similar to historical patterns, and growth rates are not expected to deviate materially from the full year range. Let's turn to the next slide to walk through our 2025 outlook by business. I will walk through our expectations by segment at a high level. However, additional details by SBU are covered in the commentary section of our slide.\nAerospace Technologies will remain the predominant top-line driver for Honeywell in 2025 as supply chain outlook continues and we work through our robust backlog. We expect organic sales growth in the mid-single-digit to high-single-digit range for 2025 when excluding Bombardier. Our acquisition of CAES will drive accretive sales and segment profit growth but generate margin headwind due to integration in the full year of ownership.\nWe expect core Aero margins to remain in their recent neighborhood around 27%, but a roughly 100 basis points decline in 2025, when excluding Bombardier, to around 26% due to the impact of the CAES acquisition. In Q1, we expect to see mid-single-digit growth in sales year-over-year as we continue to improve our output with particular strength in commercial aftermarket. In industrial automation, the 2025 sales outlook remains largely dependent on the timing of recovery in products and customer CapEx decisions, but we are seeing green shoots in some end markets.\nWe expect IA sales to be down low single digits compared to 2024. Margins should expand as we benefit from commercial excellence and favorable mix impacts, including from our expected sale of PPE. Q1 sales will be down low single digits year-over-year as growth in our core process and sensing business is offset by demand softness in safety, smart energy, and thermal solutions. For building automation, we expect to see growth led by our solutions business as we capitalize on strong project order rates in 2025, with particular strength in data center, airports, and hospitality.\nWe expect overall BA sales growth in low mid-single digits on a year-over-year organic basis. We anticipate BA margins to continue to grow in 2025, driven by productivity actions and the benefit from our access solutions acquisition. In the Q1, we expect sales growth to be up low single digits for building solutions outpacing building products. In 2025, energy and sustainability solutions will be supported by a robust pipeline and strong global demand for energy projects.\nWe expect ESS organic sales growth in a low single-digit range for the year. Margin will expand as improved volume leverage and meaningful accretion from the LNG acquisition offsets inflation. In Q1, we expect sales to be down low single digits as we work through challenging comps in fluorine products. However, we expect solid growth in UOPs supported by strength in equipment projects, as well as conversion of our robust backlog in SPS. For the year, we expect earnings per share of $10.10 to $10.50, up 2% to 6%, or down 2% to up 2% excluding Bombardier.\nWe walk through the puts and takes for EPS in regular detail in a few minutes. Moving to free cash flow, we expect growth at least in line with earnings when excluding the impact of Bombardier. Capital expenditures anticipate to increase by roughly $100 million as we seek to invest in high-return projects, notably Advanced Materials as it prepares to operate as a standalone company. This increase in spending will be funded by improvements in working capital efficiency, with a strong focus on aerospace inventory. Putting all this together, free cash flow is expected to be between $5.4 to 5.8 billion, down 2% to up 5% ex-Bombardier.\nYou can find a 2025 free cash flow bridge in the appendix of this presentation. In addition to CapEx and dividends, we'll continue to deploy additional capital in a manner that is both disciplined and dynamic in 2025, balancing a promising acquisition pipeline with our desired repurchase of our shares at attractive levels, with more than $3 billion planned to reduce our share count by at least 1%.\nIn summary, we're setting a realistic outlook taking into consideration macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. Now, let's turn to the next slide to walk through our EPS bridge to 2025. Starting from our adjusted EPS excluding Bombardier, 2025 has a number of puts and takes leading to EPS down slightly year-over-year at the midpoint of our guidance. Organic segment profit growth is expected to add $0.22 per share at the midpoint of guidance, driven by higher volumes and productivity net of inflation. We expect the segment profit from 2024 acquisitions to contribute roughly $0.33 per share in 2025.\nThis benefit includes some integration expenses as we utilize our accelerator playbook to set a stage for future growth and margin expansion in these businesses, and we are pleased with their performance thus far. Our exit from PPE business will reduce 2025 earnings by $0.05, assuming a 30 June closing date, while the divestiture will be accretive to growth and margins. The rise in the value of the US dollar versus global currencies in recent months is forecasted to reduce reported sales and adjusted earnings per share by approximately $400 million and $0.12 respectively, utilizing year-end 2024 exchange rates.\nWe anticipate below-the-line items, which are the differences between segment profit and income before tax, to create $0.52 of negative pressure on earnings versus the previous year at the midpoint of guidance. First, we expect pension income to be approximately $550 million in 2025, down approximately $50 million year-over-year because of a previously communicated one-time item in Europe. Next, we see repositioning expenses increasing to a range of $150 to 250 million as we return closer to our long-term target repositioning range after late 2024.\nFinally, our below-the-line expenses are expected to be between $1.325 to 1.375 billion, up $275 to 325 million year-over-year, primarily because of higher net interest expense. We expect our 2025 effective tax rate to be 20% in line with 2024 and our Q1 rate to be 22%. Average shares outstanding anticipated to decline from 655 million to around 649 million, adding $0.10 to 2025 EPS. In the Q1, we expect shares outstanding of approximately 654 million. Combining all the puts and takes, we anticipate the full year adjusted earnings per share to be between $10.10 and 10.50, up 2% to 6% year-over-year, or down 2% to up 2% excluding Bombardier. Now, I'll return the call back over to Vimal for closing thoughts.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International\n\n2024 was a productive year for Honeywell as our portfolio optimization efforts kicked into high gear, and we kept our focus on executing on our commitment and delivering for our customers. While we may have come into last year with too much optimism for a recovery in our short-cycle businesses, we have adapted, demonstrated resilience, and ended the year by delivering organic growth and adjusted EPS results above our targets. We'll continue to do so in 2025.\nRecognizing the uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop in front of us, we will spur growth with innovation and relentless dedication to productivity, and we are focused on delivering on our commitments. While we face an uncertain operating environment, we have incorporated that into our outlook for 2025. Our guidance will serve as a prudent baseline for performance that we have a strong conviction we can achieve with potential upside if underlying demand improves.\nFurther, with today's portfolio announcement, we believe the planned separation of automation, aerospace, and advanced materials will position all three standalone pure-play companies for long-term profitable growth and generate significant value for all stakeholders, including shareholders, customers, and employees. With that, Sean, let's move to Q&A.\n\nSean Meakim\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Honeywell International\n\nThank you, Vimal. Vimal, Greg, and Mike are now available to answer your questions. We ask that you please be mindful of others in the queue by only asking one question and one related follow-up. Operator, please open the line for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you'd like to ask a question, please press Star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press Star two if you'd like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the Star keys. Our first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nManaging Director and US Industrials Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning, and congrats on getting the strategic review completed. Thanks, Greg, for all the help, and wish you well.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell International\n\nThanks, Julian.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nManaging Director and US Industrials Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nMaybe just the first question around the separation news. If you could give us any help around the stranded and stand-up costs that might be needed for aerospace and automation initially out of the gate. Also, if you could give us any help on the free cash flow conversion or margin profile of the pieces. We can see the segment margin color, but wondered if there was anything on the free cash flow differences.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nVP of Finance and Incoming CFO, Honeywell International\n\nSure. So maybe I'll start with the free cash flow. So aerospace should be around 100% free cash flow conversion. That's the business that should be operating at that level. For our automation businesses, that free cash flow is also expected to be at around 100% free cash flow conversion. So that's what we're aiming for as far as going through this year and then next year.\nAnd on your question, Julian, on the stranded cost and one-time cost, you've indicated one-time cost, $1.5 to 2 billion. Obviously, that's dependent upon the structuring we do. So it's our initial estimate. As we do work, as it gets more refined, we'll update you. The stranded cost, I mean, I'm going to offer a precise number at this point of time. We have to do more work, and that's why we have offered a second half 2026 because we won't have ample time to understand it and execute it.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell International\n\nYeah, the only thing I would just add to that, Julian, is we expect to grow into that between the growth of the company and taking those stranded costs over time inside of probably two years. That should certainly normalize itself.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nVP of Finance and Incoming CFO, Honeywell International\n\nThat's right. Just based on our prior experience and everything that we see with Advanced Materials, that is quite doable, and we see those costs leaving us within 18 to 24 months post-spin.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nManaging Director and US Industrials Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThanks a lot. Think it was down slightly, 20 basis points underlying in 2024. Wondered if that had made you think about maybe doing a more aggressive repositioning cost-out program in 2025. If not, kind of why?\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nVP of Finance and Incoming CFO, Honeywell International\n\nRight, Julian. So I would say a couple of things. First of all, I think what we saw in the Q4 and the second half; we're quite encouraged by the margin projections and what we expect to see over the next 24 months. If I look at repositioning costs, we're expecting to add about $100 million of repositioning costs this year, year-over-year, which will help fund margin expansion.\nBut the bigger point here is really if you look at our segments, three segments with exceptional aerospace will expand segment margins this year, which is quite encouraging, and acquisitions are helping with that, especially in the second half. With respect to aerospace, we're getting a lot of leverage from volume, and that's helping us expand margins. In the short term, meaning 2025, the thing that puts aero on the back foot as far as margin expansions is really the CAES acquisition.\nIn the CAES acquisition, from a margin standpoint, it's dilutive, and this is the first year of acquisition, and we have a lot of integration costs that we have to absorb and move out. So really, it's a story of Aero not expanding margins, but really staying flat on core and then CAES pressuring, and all other three segments will expand margins.\n\nSean Meakim\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Honeywell International\n\nAnd Julian, this is Sean. Just to remind you, we've said many times that the CAES acquisition, while diluted the margin profile in 2025, is going to grow very nicely at accretive rates to aerospace, and therefore will be accretive to segment profit growth in 2025 and beyond.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nManaging Director and US Industrials Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nScott Davis\n\nFounding Partner, Chairman, and CEO, Melius Research\n\nHey, good morning, guys.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International\n\nGood morning.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell International\n\nGood morning.\n\nScott Davis\n\nFounding Partner, Chairman, and CEO, Melius Research\n\nThere's a lot of puts and takes here, but the first question, just a cleanup item. When are you thinking timing to name the management teams of the different pieces, and will there be an external search for aerospace, or will you fill that internally?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International\n\nScott, I would say that we will announce the management teams as the time progresses, but we expect the current Honeywell leadership team to continue. We'll let the board decide the leadership of RemainCo Honeywell and Honeywell Aerospace. So more to come as we do more work here over the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nScott Davis\n\nFounding Partner, Chairman, and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay. All right. I'm just looking at slide 16. So you've got $0.52 of below-the-line items, and you've got $0.33 of profit contribution from M&A. I think your comment was most of that $0.52 is actually higher interest expenses. A, did I hear that right? I'm sorry. Go ahead.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nVP of Finance and Incoming CFO, Honeywell International\n\nI can break it down for you. So if you look at the $0.52, $0.33 of it is interest expense, which is predominantly driven by the M&A interest expense. We have $0.10 of incremental repositioning, and then we have a couple of other items. One item which is really weighing on us in the Q1 is the reduced pension income, which relates to a co-payment of a pension plan in Europe that we communicated last year. Then we have a couple of about $0.04 of corporate costs that we're working our way through. So that's the $0.52.\n\nScott Davis\n\nFounding Partner, Chairman, and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay. So the M&A is a net neutral in 2025 then,\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nVP of Finance and Incoming CFO, Honeywell International\n\ncorrect?\n\nSean Meakim\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Honeywell International\n\nWe talked about just about 1 to 2% accretion for the businesses in 2025, and that still holds in this guidance.\n\nScott Davis\n\nFounding Partner, Chairman, and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay. Okay. Fair enough. Thank you, guys. Good luck. Pass it on. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good morning, and congrats. Echoing Julian's congrats to you all.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International\n\nThank you. Thank you. Appreciate it.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nSo I'm just doing the math on cash. I mean, this year, I think you have like $850 a share in free cash as per your guidance, I believe. That's like 83% conversion. Can you just help me bridge to the 100% you just talked about for automation and aerospace? And then I'm just curious, which one of those is going to be the RemainCo?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International\n\nGoing on to the RemainCo question. Look, at this point, the specific legal structuring we haven't really determined. There, both options exist legally, so we'll have to do more work to be more precise. Between the two, we are going to spin aerospace or automation, but they will be separate companies. That's a firm decision. Mike, you want to answer?\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nVP of Finance and Incoming CFO, Honeywell International\n\nSure. So on cash, Steve, we're guiding 5.4 to 5.8, which is not going to be 100%. We're going to work ourselves to the 100% over the next 24 months. The big unlock in our cash is really working capital, and that's predominantly driven by us being able to reduce and move our WIP and finished goods inventory in aerospace. That's the biggest unlock for our cash as far as getting to 100% over the next 24 months.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nYeah. Got it. Then what happens to these below-the-line items, like pension income? Does that kind of stay with whatever the RemainCo is and any of those other environmental liability costs, etc.? What happens particularly to pension income?\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nVP of Finance and Incoming CFO, Honeywell International\n\nSo we were working our way through it. It's really too early to comment through it, but we obviously have advisors and working through those particularities, and we'll communicate that as we go through the process and are ready to share this news with you.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nAll right. Great. Thanks for the color.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nVP of Finance and Incoming CFO, Honeywell International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nGood morning, everyone, and congrats, Greg. Vimal, Mike, whoever wants to take this. Two questions on Aero. First, I guess, if you could provide some end-market color, particularly on the aftermarket mid-teens aftermarket growth in 2024. Some of your peers have called out a deceleration to high single digits to low double digits in 2025. How are you thinking about your OE versus aftermarket assumptions for commercial Aero in 2025?\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nVP of Finance and Incoming CFO, Honeywell International\n\nSure. So Sheila, I would say, as you know, the hours have stabilized, and from an aftermarket standpoint, we just expect similar profile as last year. Probably it's going to be decelerating just because the hours stabilizing and supply chain is catching up. As far as OE mix to aftermarket mix, if we look at our backlog, and especially if we look at our OEM backlog, we have a much higher OEM backlog in OE. So we continue to essentially expand on our OE and installed base growth. So I would expect on a year basis that OE to outgrow aftermarket. So I think not very different than our peers.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nAnd then maybe going back to the margin profile of aerospace, you mentioned better investment decisions post-spin or more refined ones, I guess. Lots of questions around Bombardier and the payment there with $385 million in Q4. So how do we think about the return on that investment and any other margin moves we should be thinking about in terms of long-term investments within aerospace?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International\n\nSo look, the Bombardier agreement is a long-term agreement. It will show into our revenue streams four to five years from now, like any other of these long-term contracts. So we are super excited about this path-breaking win, both for avionics as well as for the engine. Investments on Arrow are going to continue. We are ramping up our investments in R&D because we see more opportunities, and we'll remain active in the M&A market if opportunities are available. So you will not see any lack of momentum, what we have demonstrated in 2024 in aerospace investments in the next 18 months ahead.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Capital Goods and Multi-Industry Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to have another crack at the margin question. So the 10 basis points of the midpoint expansion. So it looks like 100 basis points of M&A dilution in aerospace, and then maybe, I think, 80-90 basis points of expansion elsewhere in automation. Just want to make sure that math is correct and maybe just provide some, I don't know, just overall kind of qualitative kind of discussion on which segments do you see above and below that bar.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nVP of Finance and Incoming CFO, Honeywell International",
    "content2": "Thanks. So I would say your math is directionally correct, and a lot of it will depend just how our short-cycle products grow this year. Right now, we have a lot of projects mixed, but we also have the acquisitions coming in and helping expand margins in the second half. So we can follow up on that with you and give you more particulars on it, but I would say your math is directionally correct.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Capital Goods and Multi-Industry Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Okay. Then I know you, sorry. I know you addressed the question on R&D investment in aerospace, but I think, Vimal, you've been talking about rising investment spending in R&D across the whole portfolio. So I'm just wondering, are we seeing that coming through in 2025? And just maybe just talk about the capital allocation during this process through second half of 2026. You've talked about the share buybacks in 2025, but what's the appetite to really scale up capital allocation while we're going through this process? Thanks.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International\n\nSo R&D investment, yeah, we did mention in some of our conversations that we expect that to go up in dollars, but directly maintain the percentages. You will see that increase coming up as we publish the results of 2025. It's a material increase. If it was a few million dollars, I wouldn't have mentioned it. Our goal is to prepare each business for growth in the future while maintaining our margins.\nAnd we are maintaining that careful balance. On capital allocation, as Mike mentioned in his comments, we do expect to do $3 billion of share buyback to maintain our share count down by 1%. We'll remain active in an M&A market across all segments. We have active deals in motion in automation, in aerospace, and in energy.\nAnd like any other M&A deal, I can't commit to you when they will happen and if they will happen, but we are going to do hard work to do our best to get some deals done so that our portfolio is well positioned for growth in the times ahead. The progress we have shown with the deals we have done in 2024. All those deals are working extremely well. We are on or above our goals there, and that gives us more and more conviction that our strategy of portfolio transformation is working, and we should continue on that while we execute on separation of aerospace and automation.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Capital Goods and Multi-Industry Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nVP of Finance and Incoming CFO, Honeywell International\n\nAnd I would just add that we still have a lot of capacity in our balance sheet on M&A, which we'll continue to be doing, and an issuance. So we feel really good where we are at this point, and obviously are not stopping everything that we've been doing this far.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nExecutive Director and US Multi-Industry Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. Maybe, Vimal, just kind of stepping back on the separation. Clearly, this is something that you've spent a lot of time thinking about over the last year. Is the primary driver of the decision of you that a separation will unlock some of the parts of value, or do you believe the businesses will perform better as standalone entities rather than within the Honeywell conglomerate?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International\n\nYeah. So I would, Chris, I'm just going to go back a little bit to answer your question. I started with October 2023 to say Honeywell should be operated into three megatrends: future of aviation, automation, and energy transition. We started doing the work to build strategy of each of the three pillars. Part of it was organic growth, but a big part of it was inorganic actions, as you saw: four acquisitions last year, spin-off PPE business. It was also clear to me that as we did work, that the strategies for aerospace and rest of Honeywell in automation were diverging.\nAerospace required far more attention on capacity expansion, supply chain transformation, electrification, while automation business wants to focus really on AI, digital transformation, energy security. That made us think, and working with the board, that we are better off to be a separate company so that we can drive growth in each portfolio in a purposeful manner, invest the capital, have the focus strategies.\nSo it's primarily driven by our conviction that there's a more growth momentum and more value to create as a separate company. Now, some of the part is a math. I'm not going to debate it. It's right or wrong. I mean, we are aiming here for higher value by earnings growth and by delivering more compelling proposition.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nExecutive Director and US Multi-Industry Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. Then maybe just kind of following up on that better growth, we saw a pretty nice positive rate of change on some of the short-cycle end markets that have weighed on the company the last couple of years, specifically Industrial Automation and Building Automation, turning nicely positive in Q4.\nI guess, is there anything specific to kind of call out on that pickup in growth that you guys are seeing? I don't know if there's any maybe tariff prebuy in those numbers because the guide does call for both of those, both Building Automation and Industrial Automation, to have worse growth in 2025 than what we just saw in the Q4 exit rate. Thank you.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nVP of Finance and Incoming CFO, Honeywell International\n\nThat's right. We are quite encouraged by the Q4, both on the order side and on revenue. The team delivered really outstanding results. Now, going into the guide for this year, as I come in, I really want to give the guide that is, I would say, aligned with what we see and not really betting on end markets in the industrial products improving. I think that's prudent to do given with everything that's going on. Just like you said yourself, we don't know exactly whether it's prebuy or it's a trend, etc.\nSo that's the one point of the guide and the slower rotation in Q1 specifically. Also, in Q1, we are dealing with fewer days versus Q4, which has impact for us in our short-cycle product sales. Then there's a little bit of lumpiness in aerospace, especially in defense and space as we exit Q4 and go into Q1. So I think the guide is prudent, and we obviously are encouraged by what we're seeing, but I think for Q1, we need to be careful.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nExecutive Director and US Multi-Industry Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nAppreciate that. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, guys. Good morning. Greg, thanks for all the help. Try not to miss us too much.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell International\n\nThanks, Joe. Yeah.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThe first question, and look, I know you guys have a lot going on. Vimal, when you thought about breaking up the company into these three entities, how much thought did you give to potentially maybe even breaking things down further? Because you can make an argument that the automation business could be separate businesses as well. I'm just curious the thought process behind that.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International\n\nYeah. No, thanks, Joe. I mean, if you look at the, I've been quite focused on what doesn't fit into Honeywell's portfolio. The portfolio work, which we have done now by splitting into three companies: aerospace, automation, and specialty chemicals. On automation, we believe there are multiple common threads. So I'm going to give you a one-minute answer, and then we meet next time. I'll give you a 15-minute answer. The one-minute answer is business model.\nAll automation follows the business model of creating installed base and mining that installed base through services and software. Number two, the strategic priorities are very similar. We need to focus upon digitalization, leverage of AI, and that remains a common thread between the businesses. Technology and offerings are highly shared between these businesses.\nThe amount of common product code we have, as an example, our core product in Building Automation, we call it an EBI platform, and in process automation, we call it an Experion platform. They share the code of tens of millions of lines. We don't publicly share that ever, but that's a fact because of high interdependency of technology. More recently, IoT platform or Forge is common across all businesses. Where we sit today, these common elements bind us together.\nI'm not going to the territory of people and all that because that could be debatable. I have worked in all businesses. Another point, just because it's natural, given the similarity of these businesses, we do share a lot of talent across that. So the conviction that RemainCo Honeywell has a strong binding force is extremely strong. We are going to demonstrate that value creation as we go ahead because of this conviction here.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it, Vimal. That's helpful. Yeah. Look forward to the longer version as well. My quick question on the fundamentals, look, I know that you guys had a tough comp in ESS from a margin standpoint this past quarter, but I'm trying to just maybe get a little bit more understanding on what drove the margins down this quarter and fully recognize that there was the refrigerant transition. I'm guessing it had something to do with that. Just any color on what happened this quarter on ESS margins?\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nVP of Finance and Incoming CFO, Honeywell International\n\nYou mean year-over-year, or, sorry.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, just year-over-year. Yeah, year-over-year was down, and it was a little bit below. The performance was a little bit below what we were expecting for the quarter. So I'm just trying to understand what the delta was.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nVP of Finance and Incoming CFO, Honeywell International\n\nYeah. So the first one is really the catalyst sales in our ESS business. That's a big driver, and that will actually reverse itself in the second half. Just these projects, as you know, tend to be lumpy, and when they happen, they're quite, I would say, material. So that's the biggest driver.\nAnd then other than that, like we talked about, there's a little bit of deceleration going on, and we just still don't have the confidence in our industrial products recovery business, which is short-cycle, and we're going to need to monitor it. When it happens, it's going to be, it will be just massively accretive, I would say, to the performance.\nAnd then from the below-the-line standpoint, there are a couple of things happening. Tax rate, even though for the year it's 20%, in Q1 is a pressure of about $0.13. Then, like I talked about, we have a little bit of pressure from pension and other. That's about $0.09. Those are the big drivers for the reason why you see the EPS the way you do in Q1.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell International\n\nYeah, Joe. Mike is spot on in that. Remember, we've talked about this over the years with even when it was PMT, not to really get too excited in any one quarter about the margins, just given the magnitude that individual catalyst shipments can have in a given quarter. I would say now ESS smaller than PMT, right? That was true for $10 billion PMT. Now for $6 billion ESS, that amplitude is even larger. So to Mike's point, I wouldn't get too anchored on any one quarter.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay. Thanks, guys.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nGood morning, everyone. Greg, thanks for all your help. So just focusing on price versus cost, you mentioned prices normalizing in 2025, and it seems like you mentioned cost inflation a lot, really, at all of your segments when describing the margin impact in Q4, maybe except for building automation. So could you give us a little more color into what exactly happened? Because I don't think material cost spiked in Q4. How are you thinking about price versus cost in 2025, especially considering tariffs may impact the business?\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nVP of Finance and Incoming CFO, Honeywell International\n\nSure. So I would say from a, we had a good year on price last year. Let's just start with that. What I see for this year and what we're guiding on the enterprise level will be above 2% on price. Now, the price strategy for us will differ depending on what's going on in each of the businesses. What I see this year and what we've been working for the last 12 months is really on having more optionality and more levers on our cost side.\nAnd that will be invoking an additional price. So I think price cost will be positive overall. Unlike maybe last few years, this year, we just have much more opportunity to work on material productivity, direct material productivity, and the cost side as well. So we'll be balanced on price, but it will be above 2% for the year.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International\n\nSo Andy, the goal here is for us to do margin expansion, doing the balance between price cost and productivity. Unlike when there was a high inflation in 2021, 2022, we had a single lever price. Now we have an equally big lever of productivity. We have done extremely well on productivity in 2024.\nAnd therefore, to Mike's point, we are very conscious on how to dial the two levers because we want to get price. At the same time, we want to get volume. It will vary by business because some business we have more opportunity. We could dial A versus B, etc. So overall, my summary will be 2025 looks more like 2024, very similar pricing, maybe productivity slightly higher. That's the basis of our guide at this point.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nIt's helpful, guys. Then, Vimal, maybe just a little more color how you're thinking about revenue growth by geography in 2025. I know you mentioned some headwinds in Europe and China. Should China still be a growth market for you in 2025? And you've talked in the past about enduring growth, tailwinds in regions such as the Middle East, India. So what are you seeing overall?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International\n\nOverall, I would say the dynamics have been very stable over the last 18 months. If I look at the aerospace business, it's growing globally, given how much of past dues we have and the drivers of flight hours. So is the energy business because the growth is less driven by region and more driven by the timing of the demand of catalysts and new projects. I think in the automation business, we see growth in the US, growth in India, and growth in the Middle East. Those are the regions which have tailwinds.\nAnd we continue to see more pressure both in Europe as well as China. That's one of the reasons in the industrial automation business we have guided low single-digit downward progression because that business has most exposure to China and Europe in Honeywell's portfolio. So I would say our current guide is assuming more of the same. We are not counting on any European recovery. We are not counting on any China recovery in the context of automation businesses. So that's how I'll summarize.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nAppreciate all the color.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dean Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Mike, congratulations.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nVP of Finance and Incoming CFO, Honeywell International\n\nI appreciate it. Thanks, Dean.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nI wanted to just revisit the credit ratings and leverage targets for automation and aero. You're saying look for strong investment-grade ratings, just kind of tack on a leverage range you'd expect. Then just clarify on the below investment grade for advanced materials. That's not surprising, but just kind of frame for us what you're expecting there.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nVP of Finance and Incoming CFO, Honeywell International\n\nSure. So maybe first answer, investment-grade, it will be very high below the investment-grade level. So that's kind of towards where we're going towards. Honestly, I cannot comment more right now as far as the remaining two entities. We're going through it. Given where the business is today, they will be high investment-grade and will have competitive and compelling equity stories. So I can leave it at this stage.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nYep. Thank you. Just, no tariffs got mentioned earlier, but is there anything specific that you have baked in or specifically not baking in for the 2025 guide?\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nVP of Finance and Incoming CFO, Honeywell International\n\nYeah. So there are no tariffs impact in the guide. Now, looking at tariffs, if we look at China and Canada, they're not material for us, given just local for local and how our business are positioned. We're working through Mexico, trying to understand what the tariffs mean. like everybody else, just thinking through it. It's something that's definitely manageable.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you.\n\nMike Stepniak\n\nVP of Finance and Incoming CFO, Honeywell International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our time allowed for questions. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Kapur for any final comments.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell International\n\nI want to thank our shareholders for your ongoing support, and our Honeywell colleagues who continue to enable us to outperform in any environment, and our many customers that work with us to help shape a better world. Our future is bright, and we look forward to updating you on our progress as we execute through our commitment. Thank you for listening, and please stay safe and healthy.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to Sean Meakim, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nSean Meakim\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Honeywell\n\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's Q2 2024 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Vimal Kapur, and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Greg Lewis. This webcast and the presentation materials, including non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our Investor Relations website. From time to time, we post new information that may be of interest or material to our investors on this website.\nOur discussion today includes forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today, and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the ones described in our SEC filings. This morning, we will review our financial results for the Q2, share our guidance for the Q3, and provide an update on full year 2024.\nAs always, we'll leave time for your questions at the end. With that, I'll turn the call over to Chairman and CEO Vimal Kapur.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. The Q2 was another strong one for Honeywell. We exceeded the high end of our adjusted earnings per share guidance and achieved the high end of our organic sales guidance ranges. While aerospace continues to lead our growth, we are seeing broader participation across our portfolio. Three of our four strategic business groups contributed positive growth for the quarter, and we saw sequential improvement in growth rates from all four.\nOrder rates were healthy across Honeywell, supporting our expectation of further organic growth acceleration into the back half of the year. We are adding attractive new assets to our already compelling technology portfolio, which will enable us to create further value for our customers and shareholders alike.\nLet me take a few minutes to restate my priority as Chairman and CEO of Honeywell before we get into more detailed discussion on the Q2 2024 results and update on our full-year 2024 expectations. First, our key priority remains accelerating organic sales growth to deliver the upper end of our long-term target range of 4% to 7. In order to achieve this, we are enhancing how we think about our new product innovation, monetizing our vast installed base, accelerating software offerings, and improving our leadership position in high-growth regions.\nAs an early read on these efforts, our self-help actions and aftermarket services are demonstrating favorable proof points. Double-digit growth in the Q2 and accretive growth even when excluding aerospace. In fact, I'm pleased to highlight that our total Honeywell volume grew in the Q2, and we expect further volume acceleration in the second half.\nSecond, of the strength of our contemporary digital foundation, we are transforming how we run Honeywell through the latest version of our Honeywell Accelerator operating system. We are standardizing our business model to drive incremental value, enhancing our growth capabilities. Our integrated operating system principles enable us to deploy world-class digital supply chain and technology development capabilities at scale, along with multiple growth drivers that benefit the entire enterprise.\nFor example, we are leveraging our digital capabilities in demand planning to more closely match production and material management, enabling us to capture incremental inventory improvement and reduce working capital intensity. We are also leveraging Generative AI to maximize the potential benefit of our operating system, both for our customers and ourselves.\nAs anticipated, Accelerator is proving to be a powerful source of profitable growth across all our businesses, as well as an important tool to successfully integrate the recent addition to our portfolio. Third, we are excited about our progress on our portfolio optimization goals. We are demonstrating a commitment to accelerate deal flow through multiple strategic bolt-on acquisitions in the $1 to 7 billion range in order to upgrade the quality of our business and financial profile. These acquisitions are aligned to three compelling mega trends around which we are focusing Honeywell: automation, the future of aviation, and energy transition.\nThe additions, combined with a modest subtraction of non-core lines of business that are not aligned to these trends, will enable us to accelerate value creation for our shareholders.\nLast, as we aim for ways to simplify and accelerate growth at Honeywell, we are taking our Honeywell Connected Enterprise strategy to the next stage by seamlessly integrating HCE into our strategic business groups. In 2018, we formed HCE to enable the creation of one unified industry-leading IoT Forge platform to support the digital transformation for our customers. Over the last few years, we have been increasingly focused on scaling our commercial offering to deliver outcome-based solutions in performance, sustainability, and security.\nWe are maintaining our robust software development expertise at the center, and HCE version 3.0 will more deeply integrate those centralized capabilities within our segment-level commercial teams. This will deliver even better outcomes to our customers and drive sustained accretive software growth across the portfolio.\nAs we demonstrate further progress against this priority, we expect to deliver on our long-term financial algorithm and generate superior value for our shareholders. In the spirit of that progress, let's turn to slide three to discuss our recent acquisition announcements. Our top M&A priority remains targeting bolt-on acquisition, as evidenced by our recent announcement. We are creating a flywheel of deals that strategically add to our technological capabilities, enhance our alignment to our three compelling mega trends, and provide accretive growth that supports Honeywell's overall long-term financial framework.\nLet's discuss our recent deals in a bit more detail. Earlier this month, we announced our intention to acquire Air Products' liquefied natural gas processing technology and equipment business for approximately $1.8 billion in all cash transactions. With this addition, Honeywell will be able to offer customers end-to-end solutions that optimize the management of natural gas assets.\nCurrently, Honeywell provides a pre-treatment solution serving LNG customers globally and automation technologies unified under the Honeywell Forge and Experion platforms. Air Products' complementary LNG business consists of a comprehensive portfolio, including in-house design and manufacturing of coil-wound heat exchangers and related equipment. This acquisition will bolster our energy transition portfolio within Energy and Sustainability Solutions. The LNG technology will immediately expand our installed base, creating new opportunities to compound growth in aftermarket services and digitalization through Honeywell Forge.\nNotably, this is the fourth acquisition Honeywell has announced this year as part of our disciplined capital deployment strategy, adding a business with accretive economics at an attractive valuation. In June, we announced the acquisition of CAES Systems, or CAES for short, from private equity firm Advent International for $1.9 billion, enhancing Honeywell's defense technology solution across land, sea, air, and space.\nThis business will enable us to provide new Electromagnetic Defense Solutions for end-to-end radio frequency signal management for critical existing and emerging US DOD platforms, which are forecasted to grow significantly at accretive rates in years to come. We are excited that this is the second aerospace-focused transaction we have announced this year, underscoring our alignment to the future of aviation. The business adds state-of-the-art advanced manufacturing capabilities, impressive engineering talent, and potential for significant commercial opportunities in international defense.\nAlso, in June, we completed the acquisition of Carrier's Global Access Solutions business, which positions Honeywell as a leading provider of security solutions for the digital age, with opportunities for accelerating innovation and fast-growing cloud-enabled services.\nHoneywell will also benefit from businesses' attractive growth and margin profile, valuable software content, and a creative mix of recurring revenue, with forecasted annual sales in excess of $1 billion when combined with our existing security portfolio. We are happy to welcome the Access Solutions team to Honeywell's Building Automation business. Together, the combination will build our long track record of delivering high-value, critical Building Automation products, solutions, and services to our customers globally.\nAs we turn our attention to ensuring a seamless integration of the business into our portfolio, we will utilize our multi-facet tools of our Accelerator operating system to streamline processes, digitalize operations, and manifest the anticipated synergies that help make the deal compelling from a top and bottom-line perspective.\nCumulatively, the bolt-on acquisition of the past year represents over $2 billion of incremental annualized revenue, with growth profiles well in excess of Honeywell's growth algorithm of 4% to 7. Collectively, these deals represent an accretive margin profile to our current portfolio at valuation below our own before factoring any expected sales synergies. Before I hand it off to Greg, I'll turn to slide four to review our progress on overall capital deployment commitments.\nWe are very excited to demonstrate significant progress on the commitment I made to you during the last May's Investor Day, when we re-upped our intention to deploy at least $25 billion of capital in 2023 through 2025. With accelerated M&A deal activity this year, we have already deployed and committed approximately $10 billion to acquisitions and approximately $5 billion to share buyback, exceeding our minimum pledge of $13 billion over a year early.\nHowever, this does not mean our work is done. Our robust balance sheet capacity provides us with the flexibility to allocate capital to accretive M&A, opportunistic share purchases, and high-return growth capital. As the deal environment remains favorable, we will continue to reshape the portfolio by building on our already strong pipeline of high-value M&A opportunities, as well as strategically pruned select non-core assets. In true Honeywell fashion, you can expect us to maintain a disciplined approach to generate the highest return combination of capital deployment.\nNow, let me turn over to Greg on slide five to discuss the Q2 results in more detail as we provide our views on Q3 and full year 2024 guidance.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nThank you, Vimal, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin on slide five. As a reminder, starting in Q2, we began excluding the impact of amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets and certain acquisition-related costs, including the related tax effects from segment profit and adjusted earnings per share. We believe this change provides investors with a more meaningful measure of our performance period to period, aligns the measure to how we evaluate performance internally, and makes it easier to compare our performance to peers.\nIn addition, our Q2 Building Automation results incorporate approximately one month of impact from the acquisition of Access Solutions. With that, let's discuss our results.\nWe delivered another strong quarter in a dynamic macro environment, meeting the high end of our organic sales range, landing above the midpoint of our segment margin guidance, and exceeding the high end of our adjusted earnings per share guidance. Q2 organic sales were up 4% year-over-year, supported by 16% organic growth in Aerospace Technologies, driven by another quarter of double-digit growth in both commercial aerospace and Defense & Space, in addition to double-digit growth in our Building Solutions business.\nHoneywell grew volumes by 1% for the second time in the past 10 quarters, and we expect further volume acceleration in the second half. Segment profit grew 4% year-over-year, and segment margin contracted by 10 basis points to 23%, as expansion in Energy and Sustainability Solutions was offset by mixed pressures in our other three businesses.\nEarnings per share for the Q2 was $2.36, up 6% year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share was $2.49, up 8% year-over-year, driven primarily by segment profit growth. A bridge for adjusted EPS from Q2 2023 to Q2 2024 can be found in the appendix of this presentation. Orders grew 4% year-over-year with a book-to-bill of one, led by growth in BA, ESS, and IA, including pockets of short-cycle strength with advanced materials and building products growing both year-over-year and quarter over quarter.\nOrders growth supported a 5% year-over-year increase in backlog to maintain our record level of $32 billion. Free cash flow was approximately $1.1 billion, roughly flat year-over-year versus the Q2 of 2023, as higher net income and improved working capital from reduced inventory levels were offset by the timing of higher cash taxes.\nWe continue to expect working capital becoming a more meaningful tailwind in the coming quarters as we unwind the multi-year buildup of inventory. This quarter, we were able to effectively reduce our days of supply each month in all our businesses by utilizing our accelerator digitalization capabilities, improving demand planning, and optimizing production materials management, which gives me confidence that we are starting to systematically bend the curve.\nAs Vimal discussed earlier, we made significant progress in our capital deployment strategy this quarter, allocating $6.4 billion to M&A, dividends, share repurchases, and capital expenditures, including closing our $5 billion acquisition of Access Solutions. When combined with the anticipated closing of CAES and Air Products' LNG businesses later this year, we are on track to deploy a record $14 billion of capital in 2024. Now, let's spend a few minutes on the Q2 performance by business.\nIn Aerospace Technologies, sales for Q2 were up 16% organically, with double-digit growth in both Defense & Space, and commercial aerospace. This marks the 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in commercial aviation, enabled by sustained growth in global flight activity and increased ship set deliveries. Defense & Space growth accelerated in Q2 as we continue to see robust global demand coupled with supply chain improvements, enabling an incremental volume unlock.\nAerospace supply chain improvements remained on track as output increased by 14% in Q2, the eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit output growth. Segment margin in Aerospace Technologies contracted 60 basis points year-over-year to 27.2%, driven by expected mix pressure within our original equipment business, partially offset by commercial excellence net of inflation.\nFor Industrial Automation, sales fell 8% organically in the quarter, primarily due to lower volumes in Warehouse and Workflow Solutions, but overall sales improved 1% sequentially. Process Solutions revenue grew 1% in the quarter as another quarter of double-digit growth in our aftermarket services business was partially offset by headwinds in Thermal Solutions and Smart Energy. Our Sensing and Safety Technologies business declined modestly year-over-year, but saw sequential growth in both orders and sales, a positive indicator going forward.\nIn Productivity Solutions and Services, sales improved year-over-year when excluding the impact of the $45 million quarterly license and settlement payments that ended in the Q1. Orders in PSS grew double digits for the third consecutive quarter, and overall IA orders grew high single digits, led by growth of over 20% in Warehouse and Workflow Solutions, driving an overall book-to-bill of 1.1.\nIndustrial Automation segment margin contracted 90 basis points to 19% due to lower volume leverage and the end of payments under the license and settlement agreement in Productivity Solutions and Services. Excluding the impact of that agreement, margins expanded in the Q2. Moving to Building Automation, sales were up 1% organically as another quarter of excellent performance in our long-cycle Building Solutions business led the way, while we continue to work through lower volumes in our building products portfolio.\nSolutions grew 14% in the quarter, with 20% growth in projects as a result of strength in data centers, healthcare, and energy. Sales grew double digits sequentially, including one month of benefit from the acquisition of our Access Solutions business, highlighted by strong execution in solutions and further progress in fire and building management systems within building products.\nDouble-digit orders growth was a highlight for Building Automation in the quarter, growing both sequentially and year-over-year in both solutions and products, resulting in an overall book-to-bill ratio of 1.1. Segment margin contracted 60 basis points to 25.3% due to mixed headwinds and cost inflation, partially offset by productivity actions and commercial excellence. In Energy and Sustainability Solutions, sales grew 3% organically in the Q2. Advanced Materials increased 8% year-over-year due to continued strength in fluorine products.\nUOP sales declined 4% as previously noted, difficult year-over-year comps in gas processing equipment projects more than offset solid growth in refining catalysts and aftermarket services. Orders were a highlight in ESS as book-to-bill was 1.2 in the Q2, the third consecutive quarter of a book-to-bill above 1.0, primarily on greater than 20% growth in Advanced Materials and more than 60% growth in Sustainable Technology Solutions.\nSegment margins expanded 200 basis points on a year-over-year basis to 25.2%, primarily driven by productivity actions. We continue to execute on our proven value creation framework underpinned by our Accelerator operating system. This, combined with ongoing benefits from our long-cycle end markets and the strength of our backlog, gives us confidence in our ability to navigate the current environment. Now, let's turn to slide six and talk about our Q3 and full year outlook.\nOur commercial and operational discipline have enabled us to deliver on our organic growth commitments with continued long-cycle strength and modest sequential growth within certain of our short-cycle businesses, particularly in Advanced Materials, building products, and Sensing and Safety Technologies. While we are encouraged by our performance year to date and our robust backlog, the back half will remain influenced by the dynamic macroeconomic backdrop and varying levels of channel improvement across our portfolio.\nGiven these dynamics and our recent acquisition announcements, we are increasing our 2024 top-line expectations. We forecast sales to be in the range of $39.1 to 39.7 billion, which includes overall organic sales growth of 5% to 6 for the year, up from 4% to 6 previously, increasing the midpoint from our prior guidance. The sales forecast also includes the acquisition of CAES and Air Products' LNG businesses, which we expect to close in Q3.\nCollectively, acquisitions are expected to add approximately $800 million to Honeywell sales in 2024. Sequential growth in Q3 and Q4 across most of the portfolio will be driven by continued progress in the aerospace supply chain, seasonal uplift from UOP, in addition to other long-cycle businesses and areas of modest short-cycle improvement, which will vary depending on the end market exposures.\nFor Q3, we anticipate sales in the range of $9.8 to 10 billion, up 4% to 6 organically, with the benefit of roughly $300 million in acquisition-related revenue. Moving to segment margin, as growth in our long-cycle businesses outpaces the short-cycle recovery, supporting the raise to our top-line range, we expect to see a bit less favorable mix within some of our SBGs in the short term. However, from a long-term perspective, executing on robust demand for projects and original equipment sets our businesses up for a long tail of high-margin aftermarket revenue streams by expanding our vast installed base.\nWhen incorporating the impact of recently announced acquisitions, we now anticipate our overall segment margin to be in the range of 23.3% to 23.5, flat to down 20 basis points year-over-year.\nOverall segment profit dollars will still grow significantly in 2024, between 6% and 9, as margins will continue to be supported by price cost discipline and productivity actions, including our focus on reducing raw material costs. From a segment perspective, Energy and Sustainability Solutions and Building Automation will lead the group in margin expansion, followed by modest contraction for Industrial Automation, as well as Aerospace, as a result of the CAES acquisition.\nFor Q3, we anticipate overall segment margin in the range of 23.0% to 23.3, down 30 to 60 basis points year-over-year, and in line with the first two quarters of this year due to quarterly variability in aero mix, the anticipated close of CAES, and normal seasonality within Energy and Sustainability Solutions. Now, let's spend a few minutes on our outlook by business.\nLooking ahead for Aerospace Technologies, we expect momentum from first half to carry over into second half, as robust orders and increases in factory output will support growth. In commercial original equipment, we anticipate Q2 to be our low point of the year for growth, as some related supply chain challenges abate. We see strong sequential and year-over-year growth through Q3 and Q4, particularly in air transport, as build rate strength drives volume progression.\nIn commercial aftermarket, we anticipate continued sales momentum, though growth rates will come down slightly in the back half as comps get more difficult. For Defense & Space, the global geopolitical backdrop, coupled with our robust order book and increased investments in our supply chain, will provide support for sequential growth in Q3 and Q4.\nAs a result of these dynamics and a strong first half, we now forecast Defense & Space growth to be double digits for the year. We still expect Aerospace Technologies to lead Honeywell in 2024, with organic sales growth in the low double-digit range. For segment margin, the dynamics remain comparable to 2022 and 2023, as higher sales from lower margin products are partially offset by volume leverage. However, we now expect 2024 aero margins to decline modestly year-over-year due to the impact of the CAES acquisition.\nWe anticipate Q3 will be the low point in the year, reflecting the closing of CAES and less favorable quarterly mix. In Industrial Automation, we're benefiting from solid orders momentum in most of our long-cycle businesses, while our short-cycle businesses are showing varying signs of sequential progress.\nIn the Q3, we expect modest sequential improvement in IA and a return to year-over-year growth in the back half. Second-half sales growth will be led by Process Solutions, which will see further strength in our aftermarket services businesses and improvement in the Smart Energy and Thermal Solutions businesses that weighed on first-half results. In Productivity Solutions and Services, sales will grow sequentially from here. Orders have grown double digits for three straight quarters in PSS, giving us confidence in our outlook for the second half and into 2025.\nSensing and Safety Technologies will improve sequentially as we benefit from the fading effects of distributor destocking. Warehouse and Workflow Solutions will grow sequentially as we move through the trough in warehouse automation spending and should end the year around $1 billion in sales. As a result of these dynamics, we expect flattish Organic Sales Growth in 2024.\nMargins will expand in the second half as we implement productivity actions and benefit from volume leverage through long-cycle seasonality and further short-cycle progress. Moving on to Building Automation, in the Q3, we expect Building Solutions to outpace Building Products sales. In products, we anticipate sales to improve modestly sequentially in the Q3 and the Q4, supported by Q2's favorable order trends. However, the magnitude remains dependent on the ongoing normalization of channel inventories.\nIn solutions, both projects and services orders grew over 20% in the Q2, providing support for additional revenue growth in the back half and into 2025. Projects have been a standout, and we forecast double-digit growth for the year. As a reminder, the Access Solutions acquisition has now been incorporated into our guidance within Building Products. For the year, we continue to expect organic sales growth of low single digits.\nFor segment margin, while we still anticipate expansion year-over-year, incremental shift in mix toward higher sales in our Building Solutions business will slow the pace of that expansion near term. Finally, in Energy and Sustainability Solutions, encouraging fundamentals in our end markets will drive a favorable growth outlook in Q3 and the full year. In Q3, we expect sales to be roughly flat year-over-year and down slightly sequentially with typical seasonality in fluorine products as we exit the summer months, offsetting improvement in Electronic Materials and UOP.\nNotably, Q2 marks the last of significant year-over-year unfavorable comps from large gas processing equipment projects in UOP. For the full year, sustained strength in catalysts in conjunction with an incremental back half recovery in Electronic Materials will support growth for ESS.\nOur confidence in our Sustainable Technology Solutions business remains unchanged, as a strong demand profile will drive robust growth for the year. Additionally, we expect the closing of our acquisition of Air Products' LNG business to take place in Q3 and have included this impact in our guidance. For the year, our organic growth outlook for ESS is low single digits. Margins should improve half over half, particularly in Q4, as a result of typical catalyst reload seasonality, leading to full-year margin expansion for ESS. Moving on to other key guidance metrics, pension income will remain roughly flat to 2023 at approximately $550 million.\nAs a result of the acquisitions and corresponding increase in interest expense, we now anticipate net below-the-line impact to be between negative $700 million and negative $800 million for the full year and between negative $185 million and negative $235 million in Q3. This guidance includes repositioning spend between $150 and $225 million for the full year and between $30 and $70 million in Q3, as we invest further in high-return projects to support future growth and productivity. Adjusted effective tax rate will be around 21% for both the full year and Q3.\nWe anticipate average share count to be approximately 655 million shares for both the full year and Q3, as we have already achieved more than 1% share count reduction for the year, but we maintain balance sheet flexibility to deploy additional capital to achieve the highest shareholder returns.\nAs a result of these inputs, we now anticipate full-year adjusted earnings per share to be between $10.05 and $10.25, up 6% to 8 year-over-year. We expect Q3 earnings per share between $2.45 and $2.55, up 3% to 7 year-over-year. We expect free cash flow to benefit from progress on the multi-year unwind of working capital as we continue to extract more value from our digitization efforts through Accelerator. In addition, we'll continue to fund high CapEx projects, high-return CapEx projects focused on creating uniquely innovative, differentiated technologies.\nAs a result, our free cash flow expectations are now in the $5.5 to 5.9 billion range, up 4% to 11, excluding the impact of prior-year settlements and commensurate with the revision to net income growth.\nSo, in summary, we delivered a strong first half to the year and anticipate continued top-line acceleration in the second half as we benefit from strength in our long-cycle businesses. Our rigorous operating principles will enable us to execute through short-term mix pressure, and we remain confident in our long-term algorithm with a strong second-half 2024 exit rate on revenue intact, giving us nice momentum into 2025. So, with that, let me turn it back to Vimal on slide seven.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you, Greg. Before we end the call, let's take a moment to focus on the progress Honeywell has demonstrated on our long-term growth algorithm. While we've significantly transformed the company over the past 10 years, we are not close to finished. We remain committed to delivering long-term organic growth in 4% to 7 range, coupled with a gross margin above 40%, segment margin profit above 25%, free cash flow margins in mid-teens plus, and adjusted EPS growth of 8% to 12.\nM&A deals like the three we highlighted today also play a key factor, enabling us to achieve 1% to 2 EPS accretion, a key factor that will allow us to generate double-digit adjusted EPS growth on a through-cycle basis.\nI remain excited about the opportunity to lead Honeywell through the next phase of our transformation, executing on my key priorities of accelerating organic growth, optimizing our portfolio, and evolving our Accelerator operating system. We'll continue to update you as these efforts to drive improvement in our financial performance. Now, let's turn to slide eight for the closing thought before we move into Q&A. In the first half of the year, we made material progress towards our capital deployment goals, closing the Access Solutions deals and announcing three additional deals: Civitanavi, CAES, and Air Products' LNG business.\nThis brings us to $10 billion in M&A since the beginning of the last year as we work towards achieving my key priorities of optimizing the portfolio. We will continue to effectively manage through the dynamic economic and geopolitical backdrop while delivering on our long-term financial framework.\nWe executed well in Q2, meeting or exceeding all guidance metrics, and our portfolio is set up for top-line growth acceleration in second half as we benefit from easy comp, strong orders growth in Q2, and strength in our long-cycle businesses. We are confident in our ability to weather near-term challenges and meet our financial targets. With that, Sean, let's take questions.\n\nSean Meakim\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Honeywell\n\nThank you, Vimal. Vimal and Greg are now available to answer your questions. We ask that you please be mindful of others in the queue by only asking one question and one related follow-up. Operator, please open the line for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you'd like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad to join the queue. Our first question comes from the line of Steven Tusa with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSteven Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nHey, Steve. Good morning.\n\nSteven Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nCan you guys just help us parse out the moving parts here? I mean, the below-the-line costs are higher, obviously, on interest. Quantinuum costs are higher. And you raised organic, but you're also including the revenue from acquisitions, and then you're, I think, cutting core profit. So just really want to get down to what the size of the segment core profit reduction is, if any, and then just help us with the acquisitions and how much they're influencing the segment profit numbers.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nSure. Sure. Thanks, Steve. So I think you've got the thematics quite right there. Essentially, when you think about it, first of all, when we opened the year, we always said the first half was going to tell us a lot about how the full year was coming, particularly as it relates to short-cycle. And now, here we are through six months. And what we're seeing is the organic growth in its totality is still in the range of our guidance and actually doing quite well, which is why we took up the bottom.\nBut it's more heavily towards short-cycle or, sorry, towards long-cycle than short. So there's good news in there, which is things like Building Solutions, our BAS projects business, and HPS and others are accelerating, but some of the short-cycles are not accelerating as much as we had hoped.\nSo that's really just changing the margin mix, particularly in IA and BA. I would say it's probably like 2/3, 1/3 in terms of the, if you think about our guidance at the midpoint. I think we're coming down by about $0.15. It's probably about 2/3, 1/3 the organic core business versus the acquisitions because, as you rightly noted, we've added in the next set of acquisitions. But along with that, we're going to spend $4 billion in the back half of the year. Of course, that's going to cost us about 5%, roundabout.\nSo that's really the thematic changes that we're making here overall. But the encouraging thing is the back half exit rate is still very strong. So we feel really good about the back half in its totality at this point, and it's going to be a really compelling exit rate.\nAnd again, layering on $2 billion of acquired revenue into next year, about 500 basis points of revenue. So I think very much on strategy and from kind of where Vimal is trying to take us at this point.\n\nSteven Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nSorry. What's the profit contribution from these acquisitions that are now in the numbers relative to what you guys had thought in early June? And what is the cut to the core segment profit ex Quantinuum dollar-wise?\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nSteve, it's about 2/3, 1/3. The $0.15 reduction at the midpoint is about 2/3 relative to the core business, and it's about 1/3 relative to our M&A net of interest.\n\nSteven Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Okay. Got it. Got it. Okay. Thank you.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYep.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you, Steve.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi. Good morning. Maybe just wanted to follow up on a couple of points there. So the segment profit dollar guide has come down, I think, about $100 to 150 million. So just wanted to check, Greg, what you're saying is, and that's a full-year number, I think. You're saying that around 2/3 of that is core dilution just from more long-cycle mix versus short-cycle. And then 1/3 of it is just the newer acquisitions closing in Q3. Those are sort of negative EBITA, if you like. I just wanted to check that. And then when we're looking at the.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. What I'm saying, Julian, is that at the EPS line, it's about a $0.15 reduction at the midpoint, and about 2/3 of that is for the core business, and about 1/3 of that is due to the M&A, which is inclusive of the interest cost of actually making those acquisitions.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nJulian, the point I will add there is the margin changes, not that something has shifted in the businesses. It's the mix within the businesses which is causing these margin changes. Like, in case of aerospace, we continue to have OE versus aftermarket mix. In case of building automation, more solution, less product, similar dynamics in case of industrial automation. So I want to make it clear that underlying businesses remain strong. We are seeing margin expansion. We are seeing productivity. Our fixed cost remains very attractive.\nSo it's mixed within the businesses. We are getting more longer-term, long-cycle businesses, which, in a way, also solidifies our second-half outlook. We are not factoring a significant uptake in the short cycle. We are factoring some, to which we have visibility.\nBut the majority of our outlook for the second half is built upon long-cycle businesses, continued growth in aerospace sequentially quarter on quarter, ramp-up of UOP in the second half of the year, specifically catalyst businesses, and strong backlog in other solution businesses. So then all that comes together. It just makes a margin mix to what we have guided it to.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nI see. Yeah. I think a lot of the question is just because it looks like the absolute sort of segment profit dollar guide is lower, not just sort of the margin mix, but.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nThat's right. That's right. That's exactly right.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nThat's right. Because of the dynamics of longer-cycle businesses growing way greater than shorter-cycle, the margin mix is unfavorable. But if you roll it up to 2025, that factor should play off because this is not an underlying business margin issue. That's the point I'm highlighting. It's not that we are dropping margin somewhere. We are having price-cost issue. We are not getting productivity. Our fixed cost has gone up. None of that is true. We are, in fact, getting excellent productivity and margin expansion. It's purely driven by mix within the businesses.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThat's helpful.\nAnd just.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nJust keep in mind, in most cases, our short-cycle margins. Think about them as being 30 points higher than our long-cycle project solution-oriented margins. So that's really what you're seeing. Revenue in its totality, organically, roughly the same, but carrying a lower margin rate along with it.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThat's very helpful. And on your point on the M&A, Q4, I think you're assuming sequentially revenues are up maybe 9%. That's a lot more than normal, but you've got the deals coming in Q3. So just wondered sort of how much do those new deals add to that Q4 revenue if you had that to hand?\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. I mean, you should think that we're expecting closure of those deals in Q3, but likely to be mid to late part of Q3. So there is some level of that step up. Remember, we always have a big step up in Aero's in Q4, and we expect that to also be true. We also have a lot of visibility into the ESS rev streams in Q4 as well, so catalyst reloads and so forth. So it is on the higher side of the revenue step up for sure. But we feel good. We've interrogated that quite deeply, and we feel good about the credibility around that outlook.\nNow, the other thing I would just mention is keep in mind if you just take a step back for a minute on the M&A side, in the early days of these acquisitions, there's going to be some meaningful integration costs on the front end. But again, beyond 2024, these deals are nicely accretive as we get through that integration cost period. So again, I think this is a very nice it's a very nice add or two to the portfolio. And if you think about the work Vimal's trying to do on improving the quality of the portfolio, this is all good news for 2025 and beyond.\n\nSean Meakim\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Honeywell\n\nAnd then, Julian, this is Sean. Just one to put a button on your question around the incremental revenue in 2024.\nOn 3rd June, when we announced the closing of the Access Solutions business, we also increased our guidance by $400 million for the year. Now, this new guidance reflects another $400 million of related M&A revenue in 2024. So full year 2024, about $800 million, of which we had a month of Access Solutions in the month of June in the Q2. So I give you enough to kind of walk through the quarterlies through the balance of the year. And then we talked about a run rate of close to $2 billion collectively going into 2025. And as Greg said, each of these deals are coming in at accretive growth rates to the respective businesses as well as to Honeywell overall.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nVery helpful. Thank you.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you, Julian.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nGood morning. Hate to be a bore, but I do want to come back to this guidance revision math. My understanding was that the LNG acquisition was actually margin accretive, I think maybe 30% to 40. So on that $400 million of incremental M&A revenue, it feels like you've got over $100 million of segment income coming through here. So it feels like the core guide is getting cut by maybe $200 million or so. Is that correct? And how do we think about that? Is that solely within the IA and BA segments, and is it all margin? Just want to clarify that.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nSure. So most of the cut is in IA and BA, for sure. That is where the short cycle, long cycle mix changes is most pronounced, for sure. And yes, we're getting incremental segment profit on these new acquisitions. As I mentioned, there's going to be some integration costs on them early on. And then, net of the interest costs that we're going to bear, that's where we talk about, I don't know, $0.04 to 0.05 roughly of degradation in the EPS guide associated with that.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nBut the repo costs are coming down, Greg, by about $50 million. So are you talking about integration costs that are over and above repo? I mean, and can you just help us out? How much of the segment income?\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. Integration costs get incurred inside of segment profit unless there's a repositioning project associated. But there are ongoing integration costs that go into the segment profit of the business that we're acquiring and into that SBG.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. My last question, Greg, is what is the impact on segment income from the new acquisitions in the back half of the year?\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nI don't think we're giving you a precise answer on that. There's a range around it inside of what I was sharing. So I'm not going to give you a pointed precise number.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. No problem. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nScott Davis\n\nFounding Partner, Chairman, and CEO, Melius Research\n\nHey. Good morning, Vimal, Greg, and Sean.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nHey, John.\n\nScott Davis\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nHey, I'm looking at these book-to-bills on slide 11. I don't think we don't have a lot of history with you guys talking about book-to-bill, but they look pretty encouraging. I just wanted to get kind of your view on historically, they've been relatively volatile. Are they something that we can kind of take to the bank, if you will, that this does indicate a pretty sharp acceleration in the back half? Small color there.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. Yeah. Scott, actually, one of the highlights for this earnings story is our orders performance in Q2. Our orders grew double-digit in building automation, high single in industrial automation, and double-digit in energy and sustainability solutions. So that has put our backlog now to $32 billion, up 5%. And that's really what is now flowing into our revenue of second half with a strong book-to-bill, which we did in Q2. By the way, the forecast we have for the orders for the second half is also very strong.\nSo essentially, we have pivoted towards our guide toward long cycle on the strength of the backlog and the forecast we are getting on the long cycle businesses because it gives us more assurance and more visibility. And that's why we called out book-to-bill, which is nearly one.\nWe feel that this is standing on a very strong footing at this point of time.\n\nScott Davis\n\nFounding Partner, Chairman, and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay. And Vimal, could you walk around the world a little bit for us? I mean, have you seen any meaningful changes in some of the key regions, notably China?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. No, I would say I will call out the two biggest regions for us, China and Middle East, I would say. China, Honeywell continues to do well thanks to aero and energy businesses we have here. We scored high single in last year. We are trending towards similar rates this year. Short-cycle businesses are challenged there too, like the economic cycle of China, as we all read. Middle East remains a counterpoint for us. It is growing very strongly, specifically Saudi Arabia, also UAE. We see a strong momentum.\nAnd in a way, we are counting on that reversion in the times ahead to the slowdown on China progressively every passing year. Europe, actually, we are seeing recovery. We have seen good revenue progression for Honeywell in the first half of the year.\nProbably bottom is behind us, and that's how we are looking at times ahead for Europe for us. That's kind of some high-level comments on geography.\n\nScott Davis\n\nFounding Partner, Chairman, and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay. Very helpful. Thank you. Good luck.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you. Thank you.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nYes. Good morning.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nMorning.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nHey, Andrew.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nHey. Just a question on Aerospace. And as I said, maybe it's too long term, but just sort of thinking about the mix for aero into the second half, which I believe you've sort of highlighted as a drag. Vimal, are you guys changing your approach to monetizing programs in aero that are sunsetting? Because my understanding is that they have been sort of a steady source of upside over the past couple of years. As you sort of become the chairman, are you changing approach to how to think about your portfolio there?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nI mean, I would say we absolutely are looking to make Aero more of a longer cycle growth vector for Honeywell. Aero has always faced its cycle, up cycle, down cycle. We are really positioning it to grow high single digits for the next five to seven years. There's the organic growth work which is happening around it through new products. But equally importantly, the acquisitions which we made of Civitanavi and CAES, both are targeted to defense segment. Defense segment, we are bullish on the growth occurring in defense. Our backlogs are growing very nicely there.\nWe're really pivoting towards higher growth segments within aerospace to maintain our growth rates there in the times ahead. I remain very both bullish and optimistic on how Aero business is going to perform in the next several years ahead.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nI guess I'm going to go back to the question that everybody else asked. As we go through sort of the list of the performance of businesses this quarter, right? I mean, with very few exceptions, it seems that short cycle businesses have actually done as well as you were expecting. So in other way of asking the question, now that you're a chairman, are you just taking a more conservative approach to sort of how to think about the framework going forward, given the level of macro uncertainty out there?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nI mean, I think the macros are reality, Andrew. At the end of the day, that's something which I don't control. So long cycle businesses are performing well because the segments we serve are attractive: energy transition, aerospace. And that's certainly helping us. I think short cycle businesses are reverting back. I'm not suggesting that they are contracting, but the reversion is more at the lower end of our initial estimate at the start of the year versus at the mid or upper end of it. That's the only subtle difference.\nAnd the swing between the mix of short and long is the difference in the margin because we are raising the low end of our guide of revenue, which shows our confidence in the overall business, the organic growth. Because my comment right from the day I started is organic growth is my highest priority.\nWe are delivering on that. Our guide is five to six. My goal will be, of course, to deliver on the upper end of it. I would argue in the very first year of my inception in the job, that's not a bad outcome. We'll strive for that subsequent year. I don't want to leave any impression that short cycle is less important, long cycle is more important. I think it's just a derivative of how markets are performing and how we are performing in the markets at this point of time.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThanks so much.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\n\nDeane Dray",
    "content2": "Managing Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nHi, Deane.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning, Deane.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHey, I was hoping to get some commentary if you're seeing any of the election worries delaying customer decisions. It's not really related, but any impact from the CrowdStrike fiasco early in the week? Anything ripple through your businesses?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nI mean, Deane, nothing on the CrowdStrike, no impact on Honeywell. We are not a user of that software. We obviously pay a lot of attention to our cybersecurity strategy and remain very vigilant on that. So I'm never going to claim victory on that front. We need to stay vigilant. I think on elections, look, I mean, we always will prepare for both the scenarios. That's not new for a company like Honeywell.\nBut this year, elections are more than a US factor, spinning around the rest of the world. And clearly, that has certainly been a factor on how economies are shaping up. That's my view. I think there was a lot of stories around how the world is going through elections, but that's not playing out because the results are out.\nI think the biggest one in the US, we are anxiously waiting on how the results will play out in a couple of months down the line. We are prepared in either scenario. This is something we do for a living, and we anticipate each outcome and how it will impact us.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThat's great to hear. And then just a second question. I know we're still early in the deal integration, but where would you highlight some of the revenue synergy opportunities? What would be the biggest and potential timing?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nLook, I would like to highlight that all the deals we have announced, none of our deal ROIs are based on sales synergy. We don't count it. Having said that, each of the four deals we have done, they are highly synergetic to Honeywell, and that has been our theme. I'm bullish on all the four deals and synergies it brings. Aero has substantial synergies on both CAES acquisition and in Civitanavi acquisition. Same is true for both UOP and HPS, and LNG because we were always present in LNG segment. This was not a new arrival for us.\nBut with the deep technology expertise, this new Air Products business brings, it's just going to further enhance our LNG penetration and growth rate in that segment. And Carrier acquisition, we have talked in some of the earlier calls.\nIt's all about taking that business truly global because the business is very concentrated in North America, and that's going to provide us sales synergies. So there are two factors in these acquisitions I'll call out. The first is all the acquisitions we have made; they are accretive to the baseline growth rate of Honeywell, all of them. Second, the sales synergies are icing on the cake on top of it. And we will deliver on that as we integrate them in 2025 and more. And that's going to be a strong part of our earnings story in the times ahead.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nAirlines Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGood morning, Vimal, Greg, Sean. Thank you.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nAirlines Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGood morning. Maybe just to start on the top line with aerospace, can you talk about commercial OE, how you're thinking about where your MAX and 787 rates are today and how they progress through the year? Is Boeing signaling any sort of change to your output as we think about the rest of the year and into 2025?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nSo Sheila, we are constantly calibrating our output with all the key OEMs on a 12-month rolling frequency. That has been a process for a while now. I would say that based on the recent adjustment by both Airbus and Boeing, we have calibrated our volumes aligned with them. It's not a major change. But there's some small change specifically on the electronic side where we don't have much past use. But the change is not material to aerospace and not material to Honeywell. But our guide does factor changes which have been signaled by both Airbus and Boeing recently.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nAirlines Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nSo how do we think about the OE growth? Is it up 20%, I think?\n\nSean Meakim\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Honeywell\n\nThis year, it's going to be up strong, double digits. So you're in the right neighborhood, yes.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. Sheila.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nAirlines Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nCan I ask a question?\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nThe way to think about Aerospace by end market would be something approaching 20% for OE, is reasonable, something like mid-teens for aftermarket, and then double digits for Defense & Space.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nAirlines Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay. And then just on the profitability, you have about 100 bps of contraction, I think, in the second half despite more typical seasonal credit dynamics. So how do we think about profitability in the second half and how the Cobham acquisition changes that?\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. So as we talked about, the mix inside of our deliveries has caused us quarter-to-quarter volatility, I'll call it, for lack of a better word. The Q3 is likely going to be the lowest margin rate of the year for us. We expect that'll then recover back in Q4. That's based on, again, what we can see in terms of what's in the backlog, the margin on those products, etc.\nWe talked about the fact that aero on an organic basis was going to be roughly flat in margins this year. Then layering on the CAES acquisition, that will have a negative impact on that baseline, and then we'll bring it back up from there. So as you start seeing the Q3 and Q4 prints, that's what you should expect to see inside the aero margin rate.\nBut it's not a change in our overall outlook. Definitely amplitude from quarter to quarter to quarter, as we've been discussing, given the mix of the products we're delivering even inside the OE itself. But no real change in our outlook on how that is performing.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nAirlines Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nGood morning, everyone.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning, Andy.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nHey, Andy.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nVimal or Greg, just maybe double-clicking on the short-cycle businesses that are resulting in the lower expected organic margin in the second half. I think you said building product orders have been improving. Are they just improving more slowly than you thought and you saw weaker than expected June? Is that one of the issues? And then maybe same question on productivity solutions or sensing. What are you assuming for these businesses in terms of rate of recovery now?\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. Thanks, Andy. So a couple of things to keep in mind. Just to remind, when we gave our guidance on 3rd June, it's obviously before the third month of the quarter. And remember, half of our results happen in the third month of any given quarter. So that just speaks to what we were able to see at that moment in time versus what we can see today. But your supposition is exactly right. There are certain parts of the short cycle businesses inside of building products and inside of IA short cycle that are slower than we had hoped.\nAnd so that's really what's driving the margin mix. It's getting offset, as we mentioned, by the building solutions sales, the HPS project sales, etc. But they're still improving sequentially. So that is also still true. They're improving sequentially, but not as robustly as we would have liked.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nSo for Greg, and then Vimal, obviously, you stepped up M&A activity considerably. Do you see the recent rate of M&A continuing? Is the M&A market conducive to that? And then you've talked about divestitures or ramping that up. Can you offset the dilution that you might eventually get from divestitures to still grow that 10% in terms of in line with your longer-term algorithm?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nThat will, Andy, play out. I mean, I can only on divestiture. I would say we are working on it. I would be disappointed if we do not show any progress during 2024. As those things play out, we'll update you on its implication on our earnings guidance, if any. We have to take any cost actions. But that's work in progress. You can expect to hear more from us as the year progresses. On M&A front, our pipeline is still active. We are obviously conscious of the fact we have done four deals. We have to integrate them. We don't want to take that lightly. But it doesn't mean that we are walking away from the market, and we're actively sourcing what's available out there.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nAppreciate it, guys.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, guys. Good morning.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nHey, Joe.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nAnd so thanks for all the color. So maybe just focused on BA and IA for a second and the margins that are expected for the year there. How have those expectations just changed for those two particular segments for the year?\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. They're coming down versus what we had anticipated. And again, mainly because of the back half margin performance expectations. But we still expect that on an overall basis, we will make progress in BA in particular. We ought to see a little bit of improvement. It's just not going to be as robust as we had thought in the beginning of the year. So think about that in tens of basis points as opposed to 100 basis points. And on the IA side, similarly, we expect to make some progress in the year, but it's probably going to be in the tens of basis points overall for the full year as opposed to 100 basis points type of range, so.\nBut progress nonetheless. And keep in mind, inside of IA, we're overcoming the very accretive license payments relative to the PSS business. That were a nice lift for us.\nNow we're going to experience three quarters of that loss this year and one quarter of it next year.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah. Okay. Okay. Great. And then I guess just I know that a lot of the comments on the change in margins has been driven by the mix commentary, and we've highlighted that already. I'm just curious. Has anything changed from a pricing standpoint, raw material inputs, or inflation? Just any comments around that would be helpful.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nThe pricing, Joe, is trending in the direction we have signaled. We are on a rate about 3%, and we expect second half to be a little slightly stronger. The punchline is our price-cost is just about neutral, and our productivity is very strong, which is giving us the margin expansion across our businesses. As I explained before, the margin mix at EPS level, they're just mixed within the businesses themselves. But pricing remains at the right level. We do expect this 3%. I've spoken before that the era of 1% price is over. We always should expect something greater than that, and we are demonstrating that in 2023.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. Again, on the inflation side, no big changes. There's always something that comes along.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nElectronics, I would say, remains hot. That's where we continue to see elevated level of pricing. But others are, I would say, and then labor. Labor is and will remain a highly elevated inflation category for us.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our time allowed for questions. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Kapur for any final comments.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nI want to express my appreciation to our shareholders for your ongoing support and again to our Honeywell future shapers who are driving differentiated performance for our customers. Our future is bright, and we look forward to sharing our progress with you as we continue executing on our commitment. Thank you for listening, and please stay safe and healthy.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to Sean Meakim, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nSean Meakim\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Honeywell\n\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's Q1 2024 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Chief Executive Officer, Vimal Kapur and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Greg Lewis. This webcast and the presentation materials, including non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our Investor Relations website. From time to time, we post new information that may be of interest or material to our investors on this website.\nOur discussion today includes forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our business as we see them today, and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the ones described in our SEC filings. This morning, we will review our financial results for theQ1 , share our guidance for the Q2, and provide an update on full year 2024. As always, we'll leave time for your questions at the end. With that, I'll turn the call over to CEO Vimal Kapur.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. We delivered a very strong Q1, exceeding the high end of our Q1 adjusted earnings per share guidance and meeting the high end of our organic sales, and segment margin guidance ranges. The disciplined execution of our world-class accelerator operating system and differentiated portfolio of technologies enabled this strong performance amidst a dynamic macroeconomic backdrop. As expected, our long-cycle aerospace and energy-oriented businesses led the way with healthy organic volume growth.\nWe are starting to see recovery in some areas of our short-cycle portfolio, including consecutive quarters of orders growth in productivity solutions and services, while the other short-cycle businesses continue to normalize as the effects of de-stocking fade, consistent with our second-half acceleration framework.\nBefore we get into a more detailed discussion on the Q1 2024 results and updates to our full year 2024 expectation, let me take a minute to revisit my priorities for Honeywell. First, we are keenly focused on accelerating organic sales growth towards the upper end of our long-term target range of 4% to 7%. We are doing this by enhancing our innovation playbook, accelerating sustainability and software offering, increasing penetration of our install base, and leveraging our leadership position in high-growth regions.\nSecond, we are evolving Honeywell Accelerator to drive incremental value through deploying a global design model across the portfolio to enhance our growth capabilities. Following the great integration inside of Honeywell over the past several years, we are now an integrated operating company that deploys world-class digital supply chain and technology development capabilities at scale, along with multiple growth drivers that benefit the entire enterprise.\nThis includes leveraging generative AI to maximize the potential benefit of our operating system, both for our customers and internally. On the strong digitally enabled foundation, Accelerator is proving to be a powerful source of profitable growth across all of our businesses and potential addition to our portfolio. Third, we are executing on our portfolio optimizing goals, upgrading the quality of our business and financial profile by executing on strategic bolt-on acquisition while divesting non-core lines of business to accelerate value creation.\nWe expect to deliver profitable growth and strong cash generation as we demonstrate progress against these priorities, creating a compelling long-term value proposition for our shareholders. In the spirit of that progress, let's turn to slide three to discuss the latest action in our portfolio shaping goals. Our M&A playbook is yielding positive results.\nOver the last few years, we have accumulated several quality bolt-ons and tuck-in assets that strategically add to our technological capabilities, enhancing our alignment to compelling megatrends and provide accretive growth that supports Honeywell's overall long-term financial framework. We remain focused on creating a flywheel of bolt-on M&A transactions, roughly in the $1 to 7 billion per share price range.\nWe have successfully executed on meaningful deals that add technological adjacencies to our portfolio and are accretive to our growth and margin profile with attractive business model characteristics. The most recent example of this came in the fourth quarter when we announced our intention to acquire Carrier's Global Access Solutions business for nearly $5 billion, enabling Honeywell to become a leader in security solutions for the digital age. The transaction further enhances our equipment-agnostic, high-margin product business mix within Building Automation.\nLast year's acquisition of Compressor Control Corporation, or CCC, a leading provider of turbomachinery control and optimization solutions that will play a critical role in energy transition, aligns with this playbook as well. CCC technologies, including control hardware, software, and services, bolster Honeywell's high-growth sustainability and digitalization portfolio with new carbon capture control solutions. CCC has seamlessly integrated into our process solution business, and we are already seeing meaningful revenues and energy benefits with Honeywell Forge.\nTuck-in acquisitions are also an important growth lever for us as we continuously evaluate a build-buy or partner approach to add strategically important offerings that solve our customers' toughest challenges. Last month, Honeywell announced our intention to acquire the Civitanovi Systems for approximately EUR 200 million. Civitanovi technology will reinforce our leading navigation solutions across aerospace, defense, and industrial platforms.\nThis acquisition, which is in direct concert with Honeywell's alignment to the mega trend of automation and future of aviation, furthers our ability to create value for our customers from nose to tail, whether they are traditional operators seeking to increase the autonomous capability of their existing fleets or new entrants in the advanced air mobility space. Last year, we acquired SCADAfence, a business that delivers Internet of Things and operational technology cybersecurity solutions for monitoring large-scale networks.\nSCADAfence brought proven technologies in asset recovery, threat detection, and security governance into our HCE portfolio, all key components for critical infrastructure and industrial cybersecurity. The acquisition has bolstered our strategic foundation in an attractive market for us to continue to build on both organically and inorganically.\nWith the recent portfolio announcement, including Carrier's Global Access Solutions business and Civitanovi, we are on track to accelerate capital deployment in 2024 and exceed our commitment to deploy at least $25 billion of capital in 2023 through 2025.\nOur robust balance sheet capacity enables us to allocate capital to opportunistic share purchases, high-return growth CapEx, and accretive M&A. As the deal environment remains relatively favorable in 2024, we will build on our already strong pipeline of high-value M&A opportunities, supporting the execution of our portfolio shaping strategy. Before I hand it off to Greg, let's turn to slide four to review some of our exciting recent wins.\nLet me take this opportunity to highlight our recent commercial wins and strategic actions we are taking that demonstrate innovation across our portfolio and support alignment to three compelling mega trends: automation, future of aviation, and energy transition, all underpinned by robust digitalization capability and solutions.\nIn the automation space, Honeywell was chosen to provide automation, cybersecurity, and safety solutions to a multi-billion-dollar plant expansion project for a major energy company in the Middle East. We will deploy our flagship Distributed Control System and Safety Manager technologies, among other solutions. We remain excited about the various automation opportunities across our portfolio. In aerospace, we will invest more than $80 million to expand our Olathe plant in Kansas.\nThis project will enable the production of next-generation avionics technologies and directly create hundreds of jobs at sites and in the local economy. This facility upgrade is another example of the resources we are committing to unlock the supply chain and our ongoing investment in the aerospace technology business to drive growth. Finally, Honeywell will be incorporating our hydrocracking technology in a new DG Fuels SAF refinery to convert hydrocarbon liquids into SAF.\nThis technology is a low-capital solution, which facilitates 90% reduction in CO2 intensity versus traditional fossil-fuel-based jet fuels by using biomass as a feedstock. When completed, the refinery is expected to produce 600,000 tons of SAF every year. As demonstrated here, Honeywell remains committed to actively solving both our customers' and world's toughest challenges. Now, let me turn it over to Greg on slide five to discuss our Q1 results in more detail, as well as provide us our views on Q2 and full year 2024 guidance.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSenior Vice President and CFO, Honeywell\n\nThank you, Vimal, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin on slide five. As a reminder, we're now reporting our results using the new segment structure, which went into effect in the Q1. With that, let's discuss the results. We delivered a very strong Q1, exceeding the high end of our adjusted earnings per share guidance and meeting the high end of our organic sales, and segment margin guidance ranges.\nDespite a dynamic macro backdrop, Honeywell's disciplined execution and differentiated solutions enabled us to deliver on our commitments. Q1 organic sales growth were up 3% year over year, led by 18% organic growth in aerospace technologies. This was the 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in our commercial aerospace business, in addition to double-digit growth in defense and space.\nSegment profit grew 4% year-over-year, and segment margins expanded by 20 basis points to 22.2%, driven by expansion in Aerospace. Improved business mix, our focus on commercial excellence, and benefits from productivity allowed us to expand margins in line with the high end of our guidance range. Earnings per share for the Q1 was $2.23, up 8% year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share was $2.25, up 9% year-over-year. While tax was a bit lighter relative to our Q1 guide, our full year tax expectations have not changed.\nA bridge for adjusted EPS from Q1 2023 to Q1 2024 can be found in the appendix of this presentation. Orders were $10.2 billion in the quarter, down 1% year on year, which supported our backlog growth of 6% to a new record of $32 billion. This was led by quarter-over-quarter growth in aero, building automation, and industrial automation, including in key short-cycle product businesses, namely productivity solutions and services in IA, and fire in BA. This setup gives us confidence in our back-half 2024 outlook, which I'll discuss in a few minutes.\nFree cash flow was approximately $200 million, up $1.2 billion versus Q1 2023 due to the absence of last year's one-time settlement of legacy legal matters that de-risked our balance sheet. Excluding the impact of these settlements, net of tax, free cash flow was up approximately $200 million as higher net income was partially offset by higher working capital due to lower payables. However, we see working capital becoming a tailwind in the coming quarters as we unwind the multi-year buildup of excess inventory.\nWe also continue to execute on our capital deployment strategy, putting our robust balance sheet to work through $1.6 billion, including $700 million in dividends, $700 million in share repurchases, and $200 million in high-return capital expenditures. As you saw in February, we successfully issued $5.8 billion in bonds during Q1, including our first-ever 40-year maturity, taking advantage of strong demand in both the euro and dollar markets and locking in attractive long-term spreads while extending our weighted average bond maturity from 7 to 10 years.\nProceeds will be used primarily to fund our acquisition of the Carrier Global Access Solutions business and to address current debt maturities. This really demonstrates the attractiveness and strength of Honeywell in the capital markets that we have built over time. Now, let's spend a few minutes on the Q1 performance by business.\nIn Aerospace Technologies, sales were up 18% organically year on year, matching the third quarter of last year as among our strongest performances in over a decade. Increases in commercial aviation were led by original equipment, which saw over 20% growth in both air transport and business and general aviation as supply unlocks and deliveries continued to increase. We also saw significant growth in air transport aftermarket as global flight activity remained strong.\nIn defense and space, robust demand and improvements in our supply chain enabled us to grow sales 16% in the quarter. AT had book-to-bill of approximately 1.1 in the quarter as commercial demand and benefits from the impact of an increased global focus on national security support a strong growth trajectory.\nSupply chain continues to show sustained modest sequential improvements, leading to a 15% increase in output year on year, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit output growth. Segment margin in Aerospace expanded 150 basis points year over year, driven by commercial excellence and volume leverage, partially offset by cost inflation and mix pressures within our original equipment business.\nFor Industrial Automation, sales decreased 13% organically in the quarter, primarily as a result of lower volumes and warehouse and workflow solutions as investments in warehouse automation remained subdued. Our short-cycle Sensing and Safety Technologies and Productivity Solutions and Services sales were stable but lower year over year, with orders in our Productivity Solutions and Services business growing sequentially and year over year for the second consecutive quarter, a positive sign that we're nearing a return to growth in that business.\nProcess Solutions revenue was flat in Q1 as growth in our aftermarket services business was offset by mega project timing. Segment margin in Industrial Automation contracted 200 basis points to 16.8%, driven by lower volume leverage and cost inflation, partially offset by productivity actions and commercial excellence. Building Automation sales were down 3% organically. We had another strong quarter of growth in our long-cycle building solutions business while we worked through the volume challenges in the short-cycle building products area.\nSolutions grew 7% in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in building projects, driven by strong execution of our backlog. On a year-over-year basis, orders in building projects were up double digits, with strength in our core business and robust performance in energy and airports. Sequentially, orders for Building Automation improved in the Q1, highlighted by a seasonal lift in building services and modest improvement in fire, resulting in an overall Building Automation book-to-bill of 1.1.\nSegment margins contracted 120 basis points to 24% due to mixed headwinds from softer product volumes and cost inflation, partially offset by productivity actions and commercial excellence. Energy and Sustainability Solutions sales grew 5% organically in the Q1. Advanced Materials gained 6%, primarily driven by double-digit growth in flooring products.\nIn UOP, sales were up 3% year over year as robust demand led to a double-digit increase in both petrochemical catalyst shipments and refining equipment, more than offset expected challenging year-over-year comps and gas processing equipment projects. ESS book-to-bill was 1.2 in the Q1, the second consecutive quarter of a book-to-bill above 1.\nSegment margin contracted 70 basis points on a year-over-year basis to 19.8% as one-time factory restart costs were partially offset by favorable business mix and productivity actions. Growth across our portfolio was supported by another quarter of double-digit sales growth in Honeywell Connected Enterprise, a powerful indicator of our strong software franchise powered by our differentiated Forge AI IoT platform. Our offerings in cyber, life sciences, and connected industrials all grew by more than 20% year over year in the quarter.\nHCE continues to generate not only value for our customers but accretive growth and profitability for Honeywell. The ongoing tailwinds in our long-cycle end markets and the strength of our backlog give us confidence in our ability to navigate the current operating environment. We continue to execute in our proven value creation framework, underpinned by our Accelerator operating system, which will enable us to drive compelling growth in earnings and cash for quarters to come. Now, let's turn to slide six and talk about our Q2 and full year guidance.\nWe delivered on our Q1 commitments while maneuvering through known risks, and as we look to the rest of 2024, our original guidance framework continues to be solid. We expect the environment to remain dynamic as we were reminded again by recent geopolitical events. However, our Accelerator operating system that enables us to move quickly and decisively, our exposure to attractive megatrends, and our record backlog will continue to support organic growth for the business.\nThis outlook includes continued progress among our long-cycle portfolio, as well as a modest back-half recovery in short-cycle as markets continue to normalize. Overall, we have a strong setup that will drive growth within our long-term financial framework for sales, margin, earnings, and cash in 2024. Now, let's discuss how these dynamics come together for our 2024 guidance.\nGiven the backdrop I just laid out, in total for 2024, we continue to expect sales to be in the range of $38.1 to 38.9 billion, which represents overall organic sales growth of 4% to 6% for the year, with a greater balance between volume and price. We expect sequential improvement in the second half of 2024 over the first as aerospace continues to grow its supply capabilities, coupled with a modest short-cycle recovery that should build momentum in the second half of the year, albeit with different rates of improvement for our various end markets.\nFor the Q2, we anticipate sales in the range of $9.2 to 9.5 billion, up 1% to 4% organically. We anticipate our overall segment margin to expand 30 to 60 basis points this year, supported by improving business mix, price cost discipline, and productivity actions, including our precision focus on reducing raw material costs. Similar to last year, building automation margins will lead the group in margin expansion, followed by industrial automation and energy and sustainability solutions.\nFor aerospace, margins should remain relatively comparable to the last few years as volume leverage covers higher sales from the buildout of our original equipment install base, which is driving robust year-over-year profit growth. For Q2, we expect overall segment margin in the range of 22.0% to 22.4%, roughly flat sequentially, but down 40 basis points to flat year over year, primarily due to volume deleverage in IA, and the expiration of the Zebra licensing payments.\nImportantly, our guidance for both Q2 and full year 2024 does not consider the planned acquisition of Carrier's Global Access Solutions business. We anticipate the closing of the deal by the end of Q3 and will update our guidance accordingly at that time. Now, let's spend a few minutes on the outlook by business. Looking ahead for Aerospace Technologies, demand remains very encouraging across our end markets. Sales should grow sequentially in Q2, particularly in commercial original equipment, as ship set deliveries continue to increase.\nHowever, we expect these sales to come at a lower margin, driving a sequential and year-over-year decrease in margin rate following the Q1 strong result. Increased build rates and shipset deliveries will carry on throughout the year, leading commercial OE to be our strongest growth business in 2024. In commercial aftermarket, volume strength and further improvement in wide-body flight hours will support additional growth. We'll continue to work through our healthy order book in defense and space, generating sequential sales improvement throughout the year.\nOngoing supply chain improvements will continue to support double-digit output growth in AT throughout 2024. For the year, we still expect Aerospace Technologies to lead organic growth for total Honeywell, with sales in the low double-digit range. 2024 segment margin should be relatively comparable to 2022 and 2023, as volume leverage is mostly offset by higher sales of lower margin products, a dynamic that likely leaves Q1 as the high point for aero margins this year.\nIn industrial automation, the timing of short-cycle recovery will remain an important factor in our 2024 results, leading a back-half-weighted year. In Q2, IA should be roughly flat sequentially. We expect growth in process solutions to be offset by warehouse automation demand that remains near trough levels, and the end of the $45 million quarterly license and settlement payments we have received for the past two years in our productivity solutions and services business.\nFor the full year, process solutions will grow sequentially each quarter to build on last year's strong performance, driven by the aftermarket services business. Warehouse and workflow solutions will improve as we move through the trough of warehouse automation spending while also benefiting from easing comps throughout the year. Our Sensing and Safety Technologies business will benefit as the effects of distributor destocking fade throughout the year.\nLife cycle solutions and services orders grew sequentially and year-over-year in Q1, and we expect that strength to continue throughout the rest of the year. Two consecutive quarters of orders growth in our Productivity Solutions and Services business provide confidence in a back-half ramp, excluding the impact from the absence of additional Zebra payments. As a result of these dynamics, we continue to see flattish sales growth in 2024 for IA. We still expect segment margin to expand, particularly in the second half, as short-cycle recovery leads to positive volume leverage.\nMoving to Building Automation, we remain confident in the overall outlook and execution of business. For Q2, sales should improve sequentially as the channel further normalizes, and our long-cycle businesses continue to benefit from strong backlog and aftermarket services tailwinds. The timing of the short-cycle recovery remains one of the key drivers of business performance throughout the year, and our expectation for a more back-half-weighted recovery in BA has not changed.\nAs such, we will anticipate our long-cycle businesses to outpace our short-cycle portfolio as both projects and services benefit from strong demand and backlog. Additionally, high-growth regions remain a core part of the growth strategy for this business, and encouraging signals from regions like India, and the Middle East support our full year sales forecast, which remains low single-digit growth for the year.\nWe anticipate BA will be the segment with the largest margin expansion, primarily driven by productivity actions and commercial excellence net of inflation. Finally, in Energy and Sustainability Solutions, the geopolitical environment will remain a key focus as we move through the year. In Q2, we expect sales to remain roughly flat year-over-year and sequentially as sustained demand in flooring products and catalysts will offset remaining volume headwinds from challenging comps in gas processing equipment.\nFor the full year, strong performance in those businesses is expected to offset volume declines in our legacy stationary products due to well-telegraphed quota reductions within the US. In sustainable technology solutions, robust demand will lead to another strong year of growth. We continue to monitor the ongoing short-cycle recovery, particularly from semiconductor fabs, a key component to achieving our unchanged top-line expectation of flat to up low single digits for the year.\nMargins should improve throughout the year from a Q1 bottom, driven by a combination of commercial excellence and productivity actions. Moving on to other key guidance metrics, pension income in 2024 will be roughly flat to 2023 at approximately $550 million. We anticipate net below-the-line impact to be between -$550 and -$700 million for the full year and between $120 and -$180 million in the Q2.\nThis guidance includes repositioning spend between $200 and $300 million for the full year and between $25 and $75 million in the Q2 as we continue to invest in high-return projects to support our future growth and productivity. We expect the adjusted effective tax rate to be around 21% for both the full year and the Q2.\nWe anticipate average share count to be around 656 million shares for the full year as we execute our commitment to reduce share count by at least 1% per year through opportunistic buybacks. As a result of all these inputs, we are maintaining our previously provided full-year adjusted earnings per share range of $9.80 to 10.10, up 7% to 10% year-over-year. We anticipate Q2 earnings per share between $2.25 and $2.35, up 1% to 5% year-over-year.\nWe also expect free cash flow to grow in line with earnings, excluding the after-tax impact of last year's one-time settlement from de-risking our balance sheet. We are progressing on the multi-year unwind of working capital, where our efforts to improve demand planning and optimize production and materials management are yielding some early operational benefits, another indicator of the power of our digitalization capability through Accelerator.\nIn addition, we will continue to fund high-return projects focused on creating uniquely innovative, differentiated technologies. As a result, our free cash flow expectations remain $5.6 to 6 billion for the year, up 6% to 13%, excluding the impact of prior year settlements. Our robust balance sheet and strong cash generation will support accretive capital deployment, and while we're happy with our recently announced transactions, we will further build on our active M&A pipeline as we continue to optimize the portfolio.\nSo, in summary, we executed a strong Q1 and anticipate delivering a strong Q2 in 2024, benefiting from our alignment to the compelling aerospace, automation, and energy transition megatrends. Our record backlog and rigorous operating principles give us confidence in our track record of execution. So, let me turn it now back to Vimal on slide seven.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you, Greg. Let's take a minute to zoom out from the near-term dynamics and talk about the tremendous progress Honeywell has demonstrated across our key metrics since 2016. We remain keenly focused on delivering our long-term growth algorithm and remain confident in our ability to accelerate growth, achieve 25%+ segment margins, expand gross margins to above 40%, and generate free cash flow margins to mid-teens plus. This framework will enable us to deliver what matters: consistent, compelling EPS growth.\nOur annual 4% to 7% organic sales growth rate and 40 to 60 basis points of margin expansion, coupled with 1% to 2% of EPS accretion from both share buyback and consistent M&A execution, is a powerful combination that will allow us to generate double-digit adjusted EPS growth on a cycle basis. 2024 is no different as we continue to make steady, consistent improvement to the quality of Honeywell's financial profile.\nThe organization is aligned to my key priorities of accelerating organic growth, deploying the operational power of Accelerator 3.0, and executing on a robust portfolio optimization strategy, all of which will enable us to achieve our long-term targets. I'm incredibly optimistic about the high-value opportunities we are already surfacing during the next phase of our transformation. We'll continue to track our progression closely as our efforts to drive incremental sales growth, expand margins, and generate more cash transferred into our enhanced financial profile.\nLet's turn to slide eight for closing thoughts before we move into questions and answers. Our value creation framework is working. While the economic backdrop remains fluid, we are deploying our rigorous operating playbook to effectively manage near-term challenges to meet our performance targets.\nRecord backlog levels, ongoing strength in our biggest end market, aerospace and energy, as well as an impending recovery in our short-cycle businesses, will allow us to achieve our strong results as we progress through 2024. This includes our margin expansion guidance, which will benefit from improving business mix in addition to our continued focus on commercial excellence and productivity.\nIt's no secret I'm excited about the future of Honeywell and believe our company is on track to drive the innovation needed to solve some of the world's most challenging problems and enhance the lives of people around the world. As we move to Q&A, I want to take a moment to thank our 95,000 future shapers whose dedication and capabilities enable us to deliver the best of our customers, partners, and communities every day. With that, Sean, let's take questions.\n\nSean Meakim\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Honeywell\n\nThank you, Vimal. Vimal and Greg are now available to answer your questions. We ask that you please be mindful of others in the queue by only asking one question and one related follow-up. Operator, please open the line for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate that your line is in the question queue, and you may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. One moment, please, while we pull for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis at Melius Research. Your line is now open.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nHey, good morning, Vimal, Greg, and Sean.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning, Scott.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nYou guys, in the spirit of kind of looking at the outliers here, warehouse automation is still really a tough spot. What's on the other side of this? Is this just a deeply cyclical business, and we're going to see a big bounce back? Have you structurally changed your cost structure? What's kind of on the other side of this tough period?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nYeah, so Scott, if I get your question, just that I've missed the front word. Did you mention industrial automation or?\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSenior Vice President and CFO, Honeywell\n\nWarehouse automation.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nWarehouse automation. Okay, thank you.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nWarehouse. Sorry, Vimal. Warehouse.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nNo, I got it. I got it. Look, the need for warehouse automation is strong. There is no doubt that it drives labor productivity. So there is no debate on the basics of it. The interesting part is our pipeline remains strong, but order conversion is weak, specifically in the project side.\nAnother fact which encourages me about the business is the aftermarket continues to grow, which means once the systems are deployed, people use it well, and our aftermarket business is in excess of half a billion dollars. We also have rationalized our cost base. All in, I would say the business is in trough right now, and we are waiting for its recovery, but net net, we remain very optimistic and confident about the business prospects.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay. I appreciate that, Vimal. And you've been in the seat kind of long enough to have a good sense to, well, at least review the portfolio. Do you anticipate further portfolio actions, Vimal? It's still a relatively complex portfolio. We certainly get that feedback frequently. I'm sure you do as well. But has your view on the portfolio evolved at all since you've taken the role? Thanks. And I'll pass it on.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nScott, I would say in two parts. I've committed that we will take action on about 10% of our portfolio, which doesn't fit with the three megatrends, and we are absolutely taking action on that. We will make progress one step at a time because that constitutes a few businesses and no one big thing. On a broader basis, I will review with both, as I did last year, on a broader Honeywell portfolio, and we will continue to be our own activists. And wherever there's a case to look at things differently, we absolutely will do that.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSenior Vice President and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah, and if I just build on that, I would say our pipeline on inbounds as well is very healthy. You saw the Civitanovi announcement. You know that the Carrier deal is on its way. So we're on pace to deploy $10 billion this year with just what we know about, and we're not done, so.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nMakes sense. Thanks, Greg. Thanks, Vimal. Good luck, guys.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSenior Vice President and CFO, Honeywell\n\nThank you. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Stephen Tusa at JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\n\nStephen Tusa\n\nManging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning, Steve.\n\nStephen Tusa\n\nManging Director, JPMorgan\n\nCould you just talk about maybe just sequentially how you see the earnings trajectory in Q3 and Q4?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nYeah, so I would say the earnings, as we guided here, we gave you the guide for Q2 and rest of the year. So I think the headline is that H2 will be stronger than H1, and that's built upon our order spacing. If you see our orders performance in Q1 was on expected lines, our book-to-bill is 1.1, our backlog is up 6%, long cycle remains strong across the board in Aerospace and Building Solutions, and we expect the same trends in European Process Solutions.\nShort cycle is recovering on expected lines. You saw the results of ESS; the chemical business did perform well on the strength of short cycle. We saw recovery in scanning and mobility business. We saw some early green shoots in fire business. So things are progressing as we expected, and that's the basis of our guide for the rest of the year. So the punchline is we're going to have a stronger second half versus first half, and that's reflected on earnings guide for the year.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSenior Vice President and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah, and we know that that's outside of the normal historical concept you've seen, but that's not really different than the way we've modeled the year so far. And to Vimal's point, we are starting to see some of those short cycle order patterns, and we said that those were going to be different by end market as the year progresses. So no real change, Steve, to what we outlined in the original guidance.\n\nStephen Tusa\n\nManging Director, JPMorgan\n\nSo I guess just normally you guys are up, I think, a little bit Q2 to Q3. You're up, I think, I don't know, low to mid singles from Q1 to Q2. Should we think about just to kind of frame the ramp because it is from a timing perspective? Q2 to Q3? What do you think?\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSenior Vice President and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah, so we're going to have a ramp from Q2 to Q3 as opposed to flat, and then the ramp from Q2 to Q4 will be greater than Q2 to Q3.\n\nStephen Tusa\n\nManging Director, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks for the color.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning. I think a lot of that second half pickup rests on the IA segment, so maybe just wanted to hone in on that for a second. I think you'd guided full year sales there, flattish, so about $10.8 billion. And it sounds like you're doing $2.5 billion a quarter in the first half. So you've got a sort of high teens, half on half step up in the second half in IA revenue from sort of $5 billion to 5.8 billion. Maybe help us understand which of the pieces inside IA will lead or lag that delta, and if it's similar to the firm-wide where there's some pickup in Q3 and then a steeper one in Q4 sequentially.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSenior Vice President and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah, so thanks, Julian. I mean, the ramp for the company actually is in IA and in BA, and then we'll get sort of a nice ramp in the Q4 in ESS as well. So it really does come back to all the products, businesses inside of each of those portfolios. So think about in IA, PSS, the sensing business. In BA, think about fire and the BMS business. And then, as Vimal mentioned earlier, in ESS, you're going to get the continued step up in electronics and chemicals, as well as our normal sort of Q4 move in our catalyst business.\nSo it's really not all predicated on any one segment overall, and it's going to be you've got your numbers approximately right in terms of the IA first half, second half overall, but you're going to see it across the portfolio. It's not going to be concentrated in any one specific business around the portfolio.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nOne thing I'll add, Julian, there is that in IA, the HPS continues to perform very well. It's going to mirror the performance it had in 2023. So similar growth rates. The bookings remain very strong. Aftermarket is performing extremely strong. And that's the biggest constituent of the newly framed IA business. And the short cycle is recovering.\nI remain very confident on short cycle recovery. We have seen that in ESS business. It has two successive quarters of orders growth. We see that in early cycle in other businesses. So net net, we are going to see strong exit rates in IA business at the end of the year.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThat's helpful. And then just my quick follow-up on the buildings division margins. So I think they're guided to be up maybe 100 basis points or so for the year above the firm-wide margin expansion. Q1 clearly starting down tricky down over 100 basis points. So the slope of that maybe help us understand kind of how do we think about the buildings margins in Q2, how quickly we start to see that flip to margin expansion in the rest of the year, please.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSenior Vice President and CFO, Honeywell\n\nSure. So again, you're going to see that tie a lot to the product volumes because the volume leverage that comes with that and the margin rates associated with it are going to be very helpful in that margin ramp as well as the work that we've done on productivity, particularly around direct materials this year. So our last two quarters were in the same neighborhood, right around 24 points with the lower products mix. And as the year progresses, you're going to see that move up sequentially throughout the remaining three quarters of the year.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThat's great. Thank you.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSenior Vice President and CFO, Honeywell\n\nThanks, Julian.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Good to hear that short cycle is finally starting to move.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nAbsolutely. Good morning.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nYeah, just a question on defense and space. That picked up very nicely. Nice lever. Can you just talk specifically? And I know there are a lot of programs there, but what is driving that, and what's the outlook specifically for defense and space into the second half? Because this is very, very impressive performance there.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. Thanks, Andrew. Look, the Q1 performance of defense and space was more linked to the supply chain unlock. That remains the biggest variable in aerospace even in 2024. We are very pleased with the strong growth in Q1. We expect high single-digit growth in defense and space in the revenue, but order booking will be much stronger.\nAnd that's driven by the fact of not only the demand in the US, but the international demand which is coming up in this business. And those trends are extremely favorable. So, net net, we do expect to finish the year strong, not only on the revenue side, but equally strong on the order side on the defense.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGotcha. And maybe shifting to ESS, can you just talk about visibility of UOP? I know you guys were optimistic about some of the green projects coming in, and I think due to regulatory issues, it's just taking time. What does the pipeline look like, and what does the ramp look like in this business into the year? And how do you balance this visibility on these projects and just the time it takes to get them approved?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nSo, very bullish on UOP. I would say this business is headed for a great time ahead. The traditional project continues to remain active while the new energy project on sustainability. Strong pipeline, and we see decisions now maturing. You saw in one of our exciting wins we mentioned here, new way to make SAF with a biomass now, which is a new technology we have launched.\nSo net net, with the strength in traditional energy, strength in renewable technologies, and catalysts, we are going to have a strong year for UOP, both in orders and revenue. And that's not only 2024. The look ahead for the business remains extremely positive in the times ahead.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThank you very much.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSenior Vice President and CFO, Honeywell\n\nThanks, Andrew.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nAerospace and Defense and Airlines Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nGood morning, Vimal, Greg, and Sean.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nHey, Sheila.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nAerospace and Defense and Airlines Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nHey, guys. I wanted to ask about aerospace. Commercial OE was really strong, up 24% in the quarter. How are you thinking about that for the full year, just given slower MAX production we're seeing and the new news of the 787 also slowing down production there? Any top-line margin or cash impact that you foresee? And then I just want to clarify the comment about margins for Aerospace. You said it would dampen just given OE mix, but I would think aftermarket would accelerate as we progress through the year.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nOkay. So I think there were three questions there, Sheila. I'll try to pick up.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nAerospace and Defense and Airlines Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nSorry about that.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nOh, no, no problem. So overall, we do expect commercial OE to grow double digits, both on the commercial OE to grow double digits and aftermarket. So we'll maintain the strong growth trend, as is indicated in our guide for the rest of the year. To your comment specifically on 787, MAX, we're not going to give you a specific input on one particular platform, but I would say that our demand for Boeing hasn't changed. We know that we all heard their earnings call yesterday, and there are different drivers for that.\nBut for Honeywell, we are present in multiple platforms, and the demand for them remains unwavering. I personally talked to Boeing leadership, and I'm very confident that's going to trend that way. On margins, Q1 was strong. It's a mixed driver. As the year progresses, we have different product mix and mix between OE and aftermarket. So net net, we are still guiding flattish margin for the year, and that's what we have given in our guide.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nAerospace and Defense and Airlines Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, guys. Good morning.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSenior Vice President and CFO, Honeywell\n\nHey, Jeff. Good morning.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, I just want to really focus my question on margins. So just making sure that I understood some of the comments already. As you think about the rest of the year, I guess how much of the margin expansion you're expecting in both BA and IA is really dependent on short cycle accelerating?\nAnd then, Vimal, just a quick clarification on the answer you just gave on the aero side of the business. The OE business was up, I think it was over 24% or something like that in aero. I'm just curious, what were some of the kind of mixed tailwinds you saw this quarter in aero? And again, why doesn't that continue going forward?\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSenior Vice President and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah, Joe, I mean, as it relates to the mix, I'm not going to bore you with the details, but it's actually quite deep between the different OEs, the ship sets within each of them, and so forth. So that is going to migrate up and down during the course of the year as it goes. So there's not one particular thing happening there.\nAs Vimal mentioned, though, we're going to continue to see very strong OE margins or, excuse me, OE volumes during the year. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the growth in OE actually accelerates in the next couple of quarters. Not dramatically so, but in terms of its relative mix inside of the overall portfolio. So that's what I would say about aero. And then in terms of the margin rates in IA and BA, both of those businesses are seeing mix down with product softer.\nAnd so absolutely mix up with product growth is going to be a driver of those margins. But that also comes with a lot of the work we've been doing on the productivity side, both in direct materials as well as in our continued repositioning of the cost base that we have been doing. So our margin story is going to be a combination of the volume leverage, the product mix, and our productivity actions that we continue to take, as you know, is always a strength for Honeywell.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it. Okay. That's clear. Thank you, Greg.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSenior Vice President and CFO, Honeywell\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat. Thanks for the question, guys. Sorry to bore you. Another, obviously, aero margins were great. Was the timing of Boeing shipments to customers a factor there? Just curious if there's a timing issue there. But mainly, my question is around Q2 margin dynamics.\nThinking about that drop-off in the Zebra royalty income in Q2, are we looking at maybe margins, I don't know, down like 300 basis points year-over-year in Q2 for IA? And therefore, the balance of the segment margin performance is actually probably more like on trend. So just any more color on the Q2 margins by segment would be helpful.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSenior Vice President and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. No, we don't expect IA margins to be down 300 basis points in Q2 on a year-over-year basis. We talked about the Zebra impact. Again, it's $45 million a quarter on the revenue side. There's some costs associated with that, as we've talked about over the last two years as we've had that impacting our P&L.\nSo you guys can do the math on the direct impact of just that item all by itself. But we have other actions in place to continue to offset that. I don't expect margins to necessarily be up year-on-year in IA, but nothing to the degree that you described in terms of 300 basis points drop.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. And then any kind of aero margins in Q2, Greg?\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSenior Vice President and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. Just that I would expect them to be down sequentially from Q1. That Q1 is going to be the high point. And as we go through the year, again, our overall expectation is flattish on a year-on-year basis, but Q1 will be the high point.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. That's helpful. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citi. Your line is now open.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nHey, good morning, everyone.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nHey, Andy. Good morning, Andy.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nVimal, maybe can you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing by region? I think you mentioned strength in India. How important is that region becoming? And what are you seeing in China and Europe?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell",
    "content2": "Yep. So I would say if I go around the corner, we continue to see strength in our high-growth regions, specifically in India and the Middle East. Those remain strong. China also did well for us. We grew high single digits on the strength of our aero and energy business. So net net, we do see a continued strong trend in emerging markets. Europe has stabilized.\nI would say the West is definitely behind us. We see more recovery and positive trends, specifically in short cycle. We talked about it earlier in Europe. US, of course, is the balance here. Net net, high-growth region remains a tailwind in overall revenue mix for Honeywell.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nGreat. I just want to follow up on the Process Solutions business. I think you mentioned delays. Is it you're seeing more geopolitical uncertainty or election fears, higher rates? I think you still have a good outlook for that business. So maybe talk about it a little bit more.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. Process Solutions business, absolutely. We carried a strong backlog, and our booking trend remains strong there. Aftermarket is double-digit growth for several quarters in a row. That business will, as I mentioned before, repeat the 2023 pattern of high growth. We expect to continue to do well in that segment. Monetizing installed-base aftermarket software. All our strategies are really working. And also diversification into new verticals as the new energy segments are emerging, like battery storage, gigafactories. All are becoming attractive growth optionality for us in that business.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nAppreciate it, Vimal.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nHey, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, Vimal. Good morning. Hey, Vimal, just back to kind of the ongoing portfolio review. And you said it could be many things and not one big thing. Can we take that, or should we take that to mean as we look at kind of your revenue disaggregation, right? There's kind of 11 buckets we track and model to, that none of those entire sleeves would be gone at some point in time in your thought process?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nLook, whenever we complete any action of addition and subtraction, we'll give you an early guide for that. As I mentioned, this is no one-step change. So it's not that we're going to take action of a $4 billion type of thing in a single move. But whenever we are ready to communicate, we'll give you a heads-up on what's likely coming in.\nFor example, Carrier business will likely come in, Civitanovi and RV will likely come in, and what are the implications on the guide. And then what goes out, if and when this happens, we'll provide you the guide. But what I can share with you is there is not going to be one mega event on that list here. It's going to be a combination of multiple small events.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nAnd one thing you have been clear on is ultimately there's a monetization play on Quantinuum. Where are we there? Where's the spending tracking? And can you kind of give us an idea of maybe the timeline of a monetization event?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nSo Quantinuum is in, I would say, exciting times. We completed a major event of pre-money. We got valuation in excess of $5 billion. Got more people invested there. We talked about that in the last earnings call. We also met another major milestone. I don't know if you read that. Honeywell and Microsoft announced a major milestone of testing different scenarios to deliver reliable results.\nSo Microsoft ran 14,000 experiments on H2 quantum computer, and they were able to prove that every time, all 14,000 times, we were able to deliver results with accuracy. Why it matters is in quantum, the repeatability or accuracy matters more than the speed at this point. Once we are able to solve the problem solving with accuracy, we can work on the speed part. So that's a major milestone, and that's what matters in Quantum business.\nWe continue to hit these milestones one after another, and we scored some wins on the commercial side, and that will set us for the next event of demonetization somewhere in 2025. It's contingent upon hitting this, but I remain confident that we are on the right track on that. And by the way, the last comment I'll make there is AI is definitely giving us a lot more momentum. There's a deeper understanding and appreciation why Quantum is necessary. And that's going to certainly help us when we are ready for an IPO or something similar in 2025.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nGreat. Thank you for the color.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSenior Vice President and CFO, Honeywell\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Your line is now open.\n\nBrett Linzey\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nHey, good morning, all. Hey. Just wanted to come again, I wanted to come back to ESS. You noted the margin contraction on some of this one-time factory restart cost. Maybe could you quantify that? And then any detail on the nature and just the timing of some of these pressures?\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSenior Vice President and CFO, Honeywell\n\nSure. So in our clean energy business, we had been operating in a trading manner, and we had shut down the major facility some number of years ago in that business, and we restarted it. And so as you can imagine, that restart has some fits in it as we go through the course of the year to get the stabilization.\nAnd that's really, if you looked at the ESS margins, I'm not going to give you precise numbers, but if you backed out the impact of that, we would have been roughly flat, maybe slightly up on a margin rate basis year-on-year in Q1. And so that's going to take some time to get to stability. But the good news is this is a great business. The long-term dynamics for it from a pricing standpoint, a supply standpoint, are very favorable.\nAs we exit the year, we're going to have more stable operations internally. And so we're going to have a very nice exit rate going into 2025 with a very strong business. And again, that business is, think about it, being round about $400 million on an annual basis.\n\nBrett Linzey\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nAll right. Got it. Thanks. And then just one more on M&A, just thinking about the velocity there. I know last May, you talked about the pipeline prioritization. I think you had 90 deals looking at within your markets and distilled the top 10. I guess, how does that 90 compare today? I mean, it sounds like the enthusiasm, and it sounds a little bit more optimistic about some actionability. But maybe just talk about some of the pipeline and the movement there.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nAbsolutely. I would say the pipeline is very strong, as we said today. Of course, we compete for every target, and we remain very sensitive to both strategy fit and valuation fit. So net net, we do expect to continue to take some actions on adding new business to our portfolio. And overall, my tone is very positive on that.\n\nBrett Linzey\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nAll right. Great. Best of luck.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSenior Vice President and CFO, Honeywell\n\nThank you.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nOkay. To wrap up here, I want to continue to express my appreciation to our shareholders for your ongoing support, and again, to our Honeywell future shapers who continue to drive differentiated performance. Our future is bright, and we look forward to sharing our progress with you as we continue to execute on our commitments. Thank you for listening, and please stay safe and healthy.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to Sean Meakim, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nSean Meakim\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Honeywell\n\nThank you, Camilla. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell Q4 2023 earnings and 2024 outlook conference call. On the call with me today are Chief Executive Officer Vimal Kapur and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Greg Lewis. This webcast and the presentation materials, including non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our Investor Relations website. From time to time, we post new information that may be of interest or material to our investors on this website.\nOur discussion today includes forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today, and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the ones described in our SEC filings. This morning, we will review our financial results for Q4 and 2023, discuss our outlook for the year, and share our guidance for Q1 and 2024. As always, we'll leave time for your questions at the end. With that, I'll turn the call over to CEO Vimal Kapur.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO and Chairman, Honeywell\n\nThank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. To start, I would like to acknowledge some important leadership changes announced this morning. First, Honeywell's Board of Directors has elected me to take on the additional role of Chairman when our current Executive Chairman, Darius Adamczyk, retires from the board in June. Additionally, Bill Ayer has been elected to succeed Scott Davis as Independent Lead Director of the board effective this May. First, I want to thank Darius for his innumerable contribution to Honeywell, as well as his mentorship over the past two years in particular.\nI would also like to thank Scott for his insights over the past four years as Independent Director and leadership throughout the CEO succession process. Congratulations to Bill for his appointment as a new Lead Director. I look forward to partnering with him in achieving Honeywell's strategic growth initiatives. Lastly, I would like to thank Darius and the board for their support in naming me Chairman. I'm humbled and honored to lead this great company and wake up every day energized to take on the world's toughest challenges along with our 100,000 future shapers. Now, let's turn to the main topic of today and discussion on slide three.\nWe had a solid finish to another challenging year, delivering on our 2023 commitments. Honeywell's world-class Accelerator Operating System and differentiated portfolio of technologies enabled us to achieve our initial full-year guidance for organic growth, adjusted earnings per share, and free cash flow, and surpass the high end of our original guidance for segment margin expansion. Full-year organic growth of 4% year-on-year was a strong demonstration of resiliency by our long-cycle aerospace and energy-oriented businesses, while we await acceleration in some of our short-cycle businesses as markets continue to normalize.\nBefore we get into a more detailed discussion on 2023 results and 2024 outlook expectations, let me take a minute to revisit my priorities for Honeywell. First, our aim is to deliver the upper end of our long-term organic sales growth target range of 4% to 7%. In order to achieve that, we are enhancing our innovation playbook, accelerating our offerings in sustainability and software, monetizing our install base, and leveraging our leadership position in high-growth regions.\nSecond, over the last six years, the effort of the great integration has transformed Honeywell into an integrated operating company that deploys world-class capability at scale and multiple growth enablers that benefit the entire enterprise. We are evolving Honeywell Accelerator version 3.0 of our operating system to drive further value through standardization by business model built on our contemporary digital backbone. In addition to making this organization simple and more efficient to operate, Accelerator is a powerful source of profitable growth for all of our businesses and potential addition to our portfolio.\nThird, we continue to evaluate and undertake actions to optimize our portfolio. We'll do so by executing on strategic bolt-on acquisitions while divesting non-core lines of business to consistently upgrade the quality of the portfolio and accelerate value creation. This is a powerful combination which delivers profitable growth and strong cash generation, creating a compelling long-term value proposition for our shareholders. Now, let's turn to slide four to discuss our progress on portfolio shaping goals.\nIn the fourth quarter, we announced the acquisition of Carrier's Global Access Solutions business for nearly $5 billion, enabling Honeywell to become a leader in security solutions for the digital age. This transaction, which is clearly in line with our strategic bolt-on M&A framework, further enhances our equipment-agnostic, high-margin product business mix within building automation. Honeywell's overall security portfolio will be more than $1 billion in sales when the deal closes this year, growing at a creative rate to support Honeywell's long-term growth framework.\nIn addition, earlier in January, Quantinuum announced its first equity raise since the merger of Honeywell Quantum Solutions and Cambridge Quantum Computing in late 2021, securing $300 million at a pre-money valuation of $5 billion, demonstrating Quantinuum's leading position on fault-tolerant quantum computing. The round was anchored by Quantinuum's strategic partner, JPMorgan Chase, with additional participation from Mitsui & Company, Amgen, and Honeywell. This investment brings the total capital raised by Quantinuum since inception to approximately $625 million.\nQuantum Computing is a key enabler for AI to reach its scale potential, and Quantinuum is a pioneering key breakthrough and expanding use cases across a number of industries. Honeywell remains the majority owner with over 50% equity ownership, and we are committed to demonstrating a path to monetization of our stake within the next 18 months. With the recent portfolio announcement, we are on a track to accelerate capital deployment and exceed our commitment to deploy at least $25 billion of capital in 2023 through 2025, with a bias towards high-value accretive M&A.\nOur balance sheet trend continues to give us meaningful capacity for both opportunistic share repurchases and M&A, and the ongoing relatively favorable deep environment in 2024 will support the execution of our M&A strategy on a consistent basis. Before I hand off to Greg, let me turn to slide five to review some of our recent exciting wins. Let me briefly highlight some of our recent commercial proof points. These wins demonstrate innovation across our portfolio and support Honeywell's recently announced plans to align its portfolio to three compelling mega trends: automation, future of aviation, and energy transition, all underpinned by robust digitalization capability and solution.\nIn aero, we secured over $1 billion in new avionics and mechanical wins directly with airline carriers in 2023, representing over 2,500 aircraft. With a strong start to 2024, United chose Honeywell to provide a wide range of advanced avionics for close to 350 aircraft that will enter into service over the next decade. This win is another encouraging demand signal and demonstrates the strength of our offering in the marketplace. In the energy space, our battery energy storage solution will be deployed to six solar parks in US Virgin Islands.\nWhen completed, our automation solution will boost the island's decarbonization effort by fulfilling 30% of the energy need through renewable sources, lowering both emissions and consumer energy costs. We remain excited about our sustainable solutions portfolio and Honeywell's position at the forefront of the world's ongoing energy transition. Finally, we'll be incorporating our hydrogen purification and carbon capture technologies into a multi-billion-dollar low-carbon ammonia project. Through this, up to 97% of the plant's carbon dioxide emissions can be sequestered, and the project could remove up to 7 million tons of CO2 pollution per year.\nThis project is yet another example of Honeywell's ability to help solve our customers' toughest challenges and a sign of what's to come for our Energy and Sustainability Solutions business.Now, let me turn over to Greg on slide six to discuss our Q4 and full-year 2023 results in more detail and also provide guidance for 2024.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nThank you, Vimal, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin on slide six. As a reminder, we're reporting Q4 and full-year 2023 results under our legacy segment breakdown and providing our 2024 outlook using the new segment structure which went into effect in January. With that, let's turn to the results. We had a strong finish to another challenging year, delivering on our 2023 commitments. Despite a dynamic macro backdrop, Honeywell's disciplined execution and differentiated solutions enabled us to deliver on our full-year organic sales, segment margin, earnings, and free cash flow commitments.\nFull-year organic sales were up 4% year-over-year, achieving the low end of our long-term financial growth algorithm and beating the midpoint of our initial guidance despite a 5% drag from lower safety and productivity solution sales. Segment profit grew 8% year-over-year, with segment margin expansion of 100 basis points to 22.7%, above our long-term annual expansion target of 40 to 60 basis points and 10 basis points above the high end of our initial guidance.\nAdjusted earnings per share grew 5%, or 11% when excluding the impact of lower non-cash pension income year-over-year. We generated free cash flow of $4.3 billion at the high end of our guidance range, or $5.3 billion excluding the after-tax impact of one-time settlements. We deployed $8.3 billion of capital, including $3.7 billion to share repurchases, $1 billion to CapEx, $700 million to M&A, and $2.9 billion to dividend payouts, which we increased for the 14th time in the past 13 years. Fourth quarter organic sales were up 2%, led by the 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in our commercial aerospace business.\nSegment margin expanded by 60 basis points to 23.5%, driven by expansion in performance materials and technologies, and aerospace. Earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $1.91, up 26% year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share was $2.60, up 3% year-over-year. An adjustment to our estimated future Bendix liability at the end of the year and our annual pension mark-to-market adjustment drove the difference between earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share. Excluding a $0.13 non-cash pension income headwind, adjusted earnings per share was up 8%.\nBridges for adjusted EPS from both Q4 2022 to Q4 2023 and FY 2022 to FY 2023 can be found in the appendix of this presentation. Free cash flow was $2.6 billion, with free cash flow margin of 27.4% versus 23.1% in Q4, as working capital was a greater source of cash compared to the prior year. We deployed $2.6 billion of cash flow to share repurchases, dividends, high-return CapEx, and M&A. The fourth quarter was another strong one for our backlog, which grew to a new record of $31.8 billion, up 8% year-over-year and 1% sequentially due to strength in aero, PMT, and HPT.\nOrders were up 1% in the quarter, led by growth in commercial aero, PMT, and HPT, including orders growth in building products. This setup gives us confidence in our 2024 outlook, which I will discuss in a few minutes. As always, we continue to execute on our proven value creation framework, which is underpinned by our accelerator operating system. I'm confident in the strength of our backlog, the tailwinds we're seeing across our long cycle and markets, and our ability to navigate a dynamic operating environment, which we have demonstrated year after year. Now, let's spend a few minutes on the fourth quarter performance by business.\nAerospace for the fourth quarter was up 15% organically year-over-year, with 20% growth in commercial aviation. Our commercial original equipment business grew over 20% on increased deliveries to both air transport and business and general aviation customers. Commercial aftermarket had another double-digit growth quarter, led by the strength in air transport market as increased flight hours continued to drive demand. Defense and space sales grew again in the fourth quarter as the ongoing global focus on national security continues to drive robust demand, while we continue to work through supply chain challenges which govern that growth.\nAerospace Book-to-Bill of around 1 in the fourth quarter is more evidence that demand continues to outpace supply, an encouraging sign that as the supply chain unlocks, we're well situated to capitalize on our advantageous position in the market. Segment margin expanded 20 basis points to 28% as a result of commercial excellence and volume leverage, which were partially offset by cost inflation, and mixed pressure in our original equipment business. Performance material and technology sales grew 4% organically in the fourth quarter. Advanced materials was up 6%, returning to growth in the quarter driven primarily by a double-digit increase in fluorine products.\nIn HPF, sales were up 4% organically as we saw continued strength in life cycle solutions, services, and smart energy. UOP sales grew 1% organically as a result of robust seasonal demand in petrochemical catalyst shipments, partially offset by lower volumes in gas processing. Our sustainable technology solutions business finished the year with over 30% sales and orders growth in the fourth quarter. Orders for PMT grew across all three businesses. Segment margin expanded 200 basis points to 24% as a result of productivity actions, favorable business mix, and commercial excellence net of inflation.\nSafety and productivity solutions sales decreased 24% organically in the quarter, primarily as a result of lower volumes in warehouse and workflow solutions, and productivity solutions and services. The projects portion of our Intelligrated business remains around trough levels as investments in warehouse automation continue to be subdued. However, our pipeline of new projects is robust, and we are committed to delivering innovative solutions to a widening array of customers in this market, positioning Honeywell to win in an eventual recovery.\nIn our productivity solutions and service business, we continue to work through the effects of distributor destocking, but over 30% orders growth in the quarter provides some confidence that we are near the end of that cycle. Sensing and safety solutions remain relatively resilient despite short-cycle challenges in a few end markets. Segment margin and SPS contracted 290 basis points to 17.3%, driven by lower volume leverage and cost inflation, partially offset by productivity actions and commercial excellence.\nBuilding technology sales were down 1% organically as growth in our long-cycle building solutions business was offset by modest decline in short-cycle building products. Solutions grew 6% in the quarter, led by high single-digit growth in building services, driven by strong execution and past due backlog burndown. Orders were strong across the board in the fourth quarter as every business grew year-over-year. Segment margin contracted 90 basis points year-over-year to 23.9% due to cost inflation and mixed headwinds, partially offset by productivity actions and commercial excellence.\nGrowth across our portfolio was supported by another quarter of double-digit sales growth in Honeywell Connected Enterprise, which remained accretive to overall Honeywell. Our offerings in connected industrial, cyber, connected buildings, life sciences, and connected aircraft all grew by more than 20% year-over-year in the quarter. For the full year, HCE sales and profit both grew by double digits, which is an indicator of the power of our strong software franchise. With 2023 now in the rearview, we're excited about Honeywell's favorable setup to accelerate growth in 2024. Let's turn to slide seven to talk about our outlook for the year.\nWe expect the environment to remain dynamic, but the power of our Accelerator operating system enables us to move quickly and decisively to drive growth, protect margins, ensure liquidity, and position ourselves well to deliver on our commitments. I'm confident we'll do that again in 2024. Our end market exposures across aerospace, automation, and energy remain favorable, with continued commercial aviation fleet growth, higher defense investment, heightened focus on automation due to labor scarcity, intensifying energy demands, and decarbonization goals, and increased infrastructure spending.\nThese compelling vertical tailwinds are underpinned by the ongoing demand for digitalization and our record-level backlogs, which will support robust organic growth for the business. This outlook is somewhat tempered by the uncertain timing of an eventual recovery in the short cycle as markets return to normalcy, which we see as the swing factor to our sales outcome for the year. But we're excited by the prospects of this re-acceleration in the coming quarters. Overall, we have a strong setup that will drive growth within our long-term financial framework for sales, margin, earnings, and cash in 2024.\nOur robust balance sheet and strong cash generation will support accretive capital deployment. While we're happy with our recently announced transaction, we will continue to build on our accretive M&A pipeline as we optimize the portfolio. Now, let's turn to slide eight to discuss how these dynamics come together for our 2024 guidance. Given the backdrop, in total for 2024, we expect sales of $38.1 to $38.9 billion, which represents an overall organic sales growth range of 4% to 6% for the year, with a greater balance between volume and price.\nOur guide anticipates some short-cycle recovery to begin in the second half of the year, albeit likely at different rates for our various end markets, creating a somewhat back half-weighted outlook. Additionally, we remain keenly focused on new product innovation, maintaining our leadership position in high-growth regions, monetizing our vast installed base, and strengthening our software franchise, which we expect to provide resiliency through the year. We also expect the aero supply chains to continue to improve gradually, sequentially throughout the year, as it did in 2023. For Q1, we anticipate sales in the range of $8.9 to 9.2 billion, flat to up 3% organically.\nWe expect our overall segment margin to expand 30 to 60 basis points next year, supported by improving business mix, continued price-cost discipline, and productivity actions, including our precision focus on reducing raw material costs. Similar to last year, we expect Building Automation margins to expand the most as we benefit from productivity actions and build on continued commercial excellence, followed by Industrial Automation, and Energy and Sustainability Solutions.\nFor Aerospace, volume leverage will cover continued investment in our innovation platforms and in the supply chain to unlock volume, keeping our margin rate within a tight band of our recent levels while enabling us to deliver robust year-over-year profit growth. For the first quarter, we expect overall segment margin in the range of 21.9% to 22.2%, down 10 to up 20 basis points year-over-year. Importantly, our guidance for both the first quarter and the full year for 2024 does not consider the planned acquisition of Carrier's Global Access Solutions business. We anticipate the closing of the deal by the end of the third quarter and will update our guidance accordingly at that time.\nNow, let's spend a few minutes on our outlook by business. In Aerospace Technologies, we expect that robust demand will remain throughout 2024 as our record-level backlog provides a catalyst for growth. In commercial original equipment, build rates continue to trend upwards, driving an increase in ship set deliveries, primarily in air transport. On the commercial aftermarket side, we expect to see volume strength as flight hours continue to improve, particularly in wide-body, as international travel normalizes further. In defense and space, supply chain constraints, not demand, will be the limiting factor on volume growth.\nHowever, our output growth of 18% in 2023 across aero gives us confidence in our ability to execute, and we anticipate modest sequential improvement throughout the year. For overall aerospace, we expect organic growth in the low double-digit range of 2024. While we again expect aero to be our fastest top-line grower, margins will likely remain at comparable levels to 2022 and 2023 as higher sales of lower-margin products are mostly offset by increased volume leverage.\nIn the first quarter, we expect to see low teens organic growth year-over-year as the progress we made on supply chain throughout 2023, covered with our record backlog, will drive continued meaningful year-over-year output growth. For Industrial Automation, the timing of short-cycle recovery will play a key factor in 2024 results and will likely lead to a back half-weighted year. In Process Solutions, we expect to further build on the success we experienced in 2023 with another strong year of growth, particularly in our projects and aftermarket services business.\nOur Sensing and Safety Technologies and Productivity Solutions and Services businesses will benefit as the effects of distributor destocking fade throughout the year. In Warehouse and Workflow Solutions, we expect to move through the trough of the warehouse automation spending cycle, capitalizing on our robust pipeline and easier year-over-year comps as the year goes on. As a result of these dynamics, we expect IA sales to be flattish in 2024. Segment margin should expand, particularly in the second half, as short-cycle recovery leads to volume leverage benefits.\nIn the first quarter, IA will remain sequentially stable, while challenging comparisons in warehouse automation demand that is still near trough levels will weigh on year-over-year growth, leading to high single-digit to low double-digit sales declines year-over-year. Turning to building automation, we expect to see our long-cycle businesses again outpace our short-cycle portfolio, particularly early in 2024. Overall, the timing of the short-cycle recovery will be one of the key drivers of performance in the year and likely lead to stronger results in the second half. Both projects and services will grow on the strength of existing backlog and tailwinds from aftermarket services.\nWe are seeing encouraging signs in our core verticals, both in the US and internationally, as institutional investment in developing regions will be an engine for growth in BA. We anticipate our short-cycle products businesses will benefit as inventory levels normalize. For building automation, we forecast full-year sales growth to be low single-digit year-on-year. Despite this, we anticipate BA will be the segment with the largest margin expansion, primarily driven by productivity actions and commercial excellence net of inflation. In the first quarter, we expect sales growth to be similar to the fourth quarter as destocking reaches its late stages.\nIn energy and sustainability solutions, the macro environment will provide both puts and takes in 2024. UOP growth will be led by strength in our catalyst and services businesses, while our process technologies business modular equipment growth will likely be offset by volume headwinds from challenging comps in LNG equipment.In sustainable technology solutions, robust demand will lead to another record year of growth. In advanced materials, strength in the broader flooring products business, particularly in our Solstice portfolio, will be offset by expected volume declines in our legacy stationary products due to well-telegraphed quota reductions in the US.\nWithin the rest of advanced materials, improving short-cycle demand over the course of 2024, particularly from semiconductor fab, will support the top line. Overall, we expect ESS sales to be flat to up low single digits for the year compared to 2023. Margins should improve in 2024, though not as much as in our other segments, thanks to both commercial excellence and productivity actions. In Q1, we expect sales to be down mid to high single digits year-over-year as we work through challenging comps, particularly in our gas processing business, and prepare for higher activity levels as the year progresses. Moving on to other key guidance metrics.\nPension income will be roughly flat to 2023 at approximately $550 million, which is modestly more positive than compared to our outlook comments from the Q3 earnings call, as the interest rate environment became slightly more favorable towards the year-end. As a reminder, pension income is a non-cash item given our overfunded pension status. We'll ensure no incremental contributions are needed. This is a great position to be in for our employees, both former and current, and our shareholders.\nWe anticipate net below-the-line impact to be between negative $550 million and negative $700 million for the full year and between negative $140 million and negative $190 million in the first quarter. This guidance includes a slight improvement in year-over-year repositioning spend, which will be between $200 million and $300 million for the full year and between $60 and $100 million in the first quarter, as we continue to invest in high-return projects to support our future growth and productivity. We expect the adjusted effective tax rate to be around 21% for the full year and around 22% for the first quarter due to timing of discrete payments.\nWe anticipate average share count to be around 656 million shares for the full year as we execute on our commitment to reduce share count by at least 1% per year through opportunistic buybacks. As a result of these inputs, we anticipate full-year adjusted earnings per share to be between $9.80 and 10.10, up 7% to 10% year-on-year. We expect first-quarter earnings per share to be between $2.12 and 2.22, up 2% to 7% year-over-year. Included in the appendix is a bridge that walks the elements of 2024 adjusted earnings per share from 2023.\nYou'll see the primary year-over-year drivers are higher volumes and increased productivity, with lower share count offsetting below-the-line changes, which are primarily from higher net interest expense. On free cash flow, we expect to grow in line with earnings, excluding the after-tax impact of last year's one-time settlement from de-risking our balance sheet. We will begin the multi-year unwind of working capital, where our digitalization capabilities through accelerator are improving demand planning and optimizing production and materials management.\nIn addition, we see several compelling growth-oriented capital investment opportunities and expect to fund high-return projects focused on creating uniquely innovative, differentiated technologies. As a result, we expect Free Cash Flow to be in the $5.6 to $6 billion range, up 6% to 13%, excluding the impact of prior year settlements. A 2024 Free Cash Flow bridge is in the appendix and summarizes the drivers of year-over-year growth, with net income growth being the largest factor, followed by working capital improvements, partially offset by modestly higher growth CapEx spend.\nRegarding capital deployment, while we're focused on executing our robust M&A pipeline, opportunistic share repurchase at highly attractive valuations, which you saw in the second half of 2023 as we accelerated our buyback in Q3 and again in Q4, remains an important part of our framework, a vote of confidence in Honeywell's performance, and that will continue to be true in 2024.\nSo, in summary, while we're cautious on the macroeconomic backdrop, our leverage to the key macro trends of aerospace, automation, and the energy transition underpinned by digitalization, which will be complemented by our record backlog and accelerated operating system, gives us confidence in delivering another strong year in 2024. So, with that, let me turn it back to Vimal on slide nine.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO and Chairman, Honeywell\n\nThank you, Greg. Let's take a minute to zoom out from the near-term dynamics and talk about how our financial algorithm translates into value through EPS growth. Last May, we unveiled our updated long-term financial growth algorithm. One of the strengths of that framework is that we have demonstrated that we can balance between the levers we have to deliver what matters: consistent, compelling EPS growth. Let me unpack this for a moment. Our annual 4% to 7% organic sales growth and 40 to 60 basis points of margin expansion alone will deliver 6% to 10% organic EPS growth.\nSome years, one or other of these elements move, but as you've seen, 6% to 10% delivery has been consistent hallmark of Honeywell. When coupled with 1% to 2% of EPS accretion from both share buyback and consistent M&A execution, we are confident we'll deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth at the midpoint on a through-cycle basis. The strength of our dividend, currently yielding about 2%, also adds further value to our shareholder returns.\nAlthough there has been some noise in our results, mostly related to the below-the-line, we have delivered 8% segment profit growth and 2% adjusted EPS accretion from the share repurchases on average during the past three years, in line with the long-term financial framework. Now, we are ramping up M&A lever, which should drive incremental benefits. With that, let's go to the next page to discuss our recent progress on this long-term growth algorithm.\nAs you can see on slide 10, our 2023 results represent another year of strong financial performance consistent with our framework, following meaningful progress since 2016 in organic growth, gross margin, segment margin expansion, and free cash flow re-acceleration. Similarly, our 2024 expectation for organic growth, gross margin, segment margins, and free cash flow margins are solidly in line with our long-term commitment as we continue to make steady, consistent improvement in quality of Honeywell's financial profile.\nWe are reorienting the organization to prioritize organic growth, deploying the operational power of Accelerator 3.0, and executing on a robust portfolio optimization strategy, which will enable us to achieve our long-term targets. I look forward to the next phase of transformation and remain optimistic about the tremendous opportunities we are uncovering to capture value, drive incremental sales growth, expand margins, and generate more cash. We'll continue to track our progression closely and update you as these efforts increasingly translate into our enhanced financial performance. Now, let's turn to slide 11 for closing thoughts before we move to Q&A session.\nWe delivered on all of our 2023 commitments. We are confident in our ability to weather the dynamic macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop with operating rigor you have come to expect of Honeywell. Recent record backlog levels, ongoing strength in our biggest end markets, aerospace and energy, as well as impending recovery in our short-cycle business, will support strong results as we progress through 2024. I remain optimistic about the future of Honeywell and believe the company is well-positioned to drive the innovation needed to solve some of the world's most challenging problems. The future is really what we make it. With that, Sean, let's move to Q&A.\n\nSean Meakim\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Honeywell\n\nThank you, Vimal. Vimal and Greg are now available to answer your questions. We ask that you please be mindful of others in the queue by only asking one question and one related follow-up. Camilla, please open the line for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate that your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. Once again, in the interest of time, we ask that you limit to one question and to one follow-up. Our first question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO and Chairman, Honeywell\n\nHey, Steve.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning, Steve.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nCan you just talk about the sequential progression in EPS as we move through the year off of the first-quarter base here?\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYou're just talking about for the full year, yeah.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nYeah. I mean, the first quarter is a little bit light as a percentage of the year, so just trying to understand how things build for the next three quarters to get to the midpoint of guide.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nSure. Sure. I mean, if you look at the guide we're giving for Q1, it's actually not that different from 2023. So as we progress through the year, we're going to expect to see the short-cycle revenue inflection more likely between Q2 and Q3 than Q1 and Q2 in terms of the level of that acceleration. And so I think the EPS will follow along with that. I mean, the last two years, our EPS has been more back-end weighted in third and fourth quarter than our prior history, and I think it's going to look fairly similar this year.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. And then just one on the buildings business. What are you guys seeing there, and what are you assuming for the products business in the next few quarters? Obviously, a lot of noise in the channel there, and also just from an end market demand perspective, maybe touch on regionally as well in the buildings business.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO and Chairman, Honeywell\n\nYes, Steve. So we had a quarter four finish in which our buildings orders grew up across all segments, both in building products and in building solutions. So that puts us in a good setup for 2024. To your specific question, the setup we have allows us to see sequential progress in the short cycle as the year progresses, and the front end of the year will see more strength in our solution side of the business. Europe remains challenged as it was over the last several quarters. And in the US, we are in the late innings of destocking of the distributor inventories. So that's the overall setting.\nWhat excites me about the business is the work we have done on new products that's going to position us well. Our strength in high-growth regions, which is performing exceedingly well. So net net, we remain pretty confident on growth in building solutions, building automation business in 2024, specifically margin expansion, and confident of delivering strong results there.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nThanks.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO and Chairman, Honeywell\n\nThanks, Steve.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning. Maybe just wanted to try and think about the progress through the year from a segment margin standpoint. So I guess you've had seven quarters in a row of good year-on-year expansion. Q1 is sort of flat, and then the year is up close to that sort of 50 basis points mark. So you're exiting the year in Q4 maybe with margins up 100 basis points plus. So just trying to understand, starting Q1 at zero, Q4 up 100, where does kind of the sharpest improvement come on a segment basis as you go through the year? And do we think about that margin year-on-year improvement firm-wide as just being pretty steady as we go through 2024?\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. Thanks, Julian. Again, I would tell you a lot of the guidance fundamentals are tied pretty closely to the short-cycle recovery. And what I mean by that is we don't expect a big inflection in the first half. And so, therefore, our segment profit improvement in the first half versus the second half is going to be a bit lower. And as those short-cycle businesses recover, remember, those are some of the highest margin businesses in the portfolio. So that volume leverage is going to be pretty powerful as we go through the year. And that'll be true in each of those non-aero-related businesses.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO and Chairman, Honeywell\n\nWhat I'll add, Julian, is if I look at the full-year picture for the margin expansion, what we have committed, 30 to 60 basis points, there are three broad drivers. The pricing will remain of the order of 3%. Our price-cost will not be a headwind. We remain very confident on our pricing execution. Second, we will see good productivity in 2024. Material productivity remains strong in Q4, and we expect that to roll up on a full-year basis in 2024. We also have made good progress in executing AI in our operation, and that will be also a source of productivity in 2024.\nAnd finally, the short-cycle recovery point, which Greg made, as that unpacks itself, the margin accretion we have on that is pretty sdubstantial. So when you put it all together, we remain extremely confident on our margin expansion algorithm.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThat's helpful. Thank you. And just my quick follow-up, if we look at, say, slide 15, trying to understand sort of the shape of that sales recovery, you've got those two units at the bottom, productivity solutions and service and warehouse and workflow. If we're thinking about those two businesses, one exited the year, just finished down 25%, and the other exited down 50%. What's the exit rate from 2024 for those two that's embedded in the sales guide, please?\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. Well, again, we don't guide that specifically, but you should expect that this exit rate diminishes as the year progresses. And as we get into the back half of the year, that turns to be something that is likely positive on productivity solutions and services and will be flattish on warehouse and workflow solutions. And perhaps up, we'll see how the year progresses on the project side. An important thing to keep in mind is inside of the warehouse business in particular, we've got actually a very rich mix now on the aftermarket services business.\nSo while the projects orders will really be the thing that'll govern the top-line progression overall, we see double-digit growth continuing in the aftermarket bit, which, of course, is where we capture the value from the install base. So we feel very good about the progression of that as we go through the year.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO and Chairman, Honeywell\n\nMaybe to add to Greg's point on the warehouse solutions business, the top line has been challenging. But I see this as not a headwind for EPS in 2024. We have taken action that Greg spoke about on the aftermarket. The aftermarket continues to be strong and will be a factor of growth in 2024. We have taken meaningful action on our cost base, specifically on supply chain. When we put those actions together, which is in our control, we see margin expansion in this business. In spite of top-line pressure, it will not be a source of EPS dilution. It will be a source of EPS accretion.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nJulian, if I could add just one last point there. From a modeling perspective, keep in mind it's not just a dynamic embedded in our model for 2024, second half likely stronger than first half. It's also that second half 2023 was weaker than first half 2023. So both of those will influence the year-to-year growth rate as you're talking about exiting 2023 versus exiting 2024.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThat's great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is now open.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nHey, good morning, Vimal, Greg, and Sean. Good morning. Guys, can we take a step backwards at least and just walk around the world a little bit on what you're assuming? I assume, Vimal, you probably have pretty good read on what's going on in China. It's been a tough region for a lot of your peers. But you don't need to really focus on aerospace because it's a different dynamic. But for the other businesses, perhaps just a little bit of color on what you're expecting. Any differences in 2024 geographically versus 2023? That'd be helpful. Thanks.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO and Chairman, Honeywell\n\nYep. Thanks, Scott. So specifically talking about, let me start with China. We grew about 7% in 2023. I don't expect a material shift between 2024 and 2023. We have weathered a tough year in 2023, China's economic cycle. And I expect 2024 to be a shade better, but it's no more going to be a source of high growth what it used to be five or seven years back. Speaking more broadly of high-growth regions, which represents almost 25% of the Honeywell revenue now, we had very good performance in the Middle East and India in particular, and we expect those trends to continue in 2024.\nIndia grew for us high double digits. In 2023, we have very meaningful revenue there, similar good performance in the Middle East. So we expect those regions to perform well. All in all, I expect high-growth regions to grow double-digit, which will be a source of organic growth, about a percent, an overall Honeywell algorithm of organic growth. Europe remains challenging. We have seen headwinds in some portions of our businesses and tailwinds in some other portions. So net net, it's more neutral to negative. US, of course, we are like everybody else waiting for interest rate environment to settle.\nThat will determine the performance of our business, specifically on the short cycle. So that's kind of my broad overview of how we see different geographies.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay. That's helpful. Then a little bit of a nuance here. Would you classify the Carrier deal as a bolt-on? It seems like a little larger than a bolt-on by my definition, but kind of curious how you think about it because clearly in your slides, you mentioned bolt-on deals being the focus. If we were to expect other kind of $5 billion-ish, go ahead.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO and Chairman, Honeywell\n\nI would call it bolt-on because my argument is that bolt-on to me is adding to our core portfolio and propels the growth of organic growth of the business itself. So that's what this business is. If you see our buildings products business, our strategy is to have products which are specified, which are critical for the building. We had a moderate position in security. With the addition of this portfolio, it makes us a meaningful player. Therefore, I call it a bolt-on because it's a continuum of our strategy. We are not finding a new adjacency. We're not exploring some new idea. It's something we understand extremely well. And therefore, our confidence to add shareholder value here is extremely strong.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nAnd keep in mind, at $5 billion, it's something like 4% of our market cap. So reasonably, it's not a huge bet as it relates to that as well. Obviously, very different world than when our market cap was half that 10 years ago.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nSure. Understood. Thank you, guys. I'll pass it on. Good luck this year.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO and Chairman, Honeywell\n\nThank you.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nThank you, Steve.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGood morning.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nMorning, Andrew.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, just looking at UOP, I was a little bit surprised by the growth in the quarter. I would have thought with SDS being strong. And I know you sort of gave us, I think, was it gas products? But can you just tell us what kind of visibility do you have on this business accelerating into 2024? Because it is sort of, I guess, that's what you're guiding to. But just a little bit more granularity there. Thank you.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO and Chairman, Honeywell\n\nSure, Andrew. So 2023 revenue look is 1% growth. It's primarily driven by equipment revenue we had in the prior year. We had large equipment-based projects in our volume, LNG projects. So on a year-on-year comp basis, those don't repeat itself. But if you see the core UOP business on catalyst remains pretty strong. Your specific question on sustainable technologies, as we mentioned during our earnings earlier, remain very confident on its performance. We crossed the benchmark of 50 licenses of sustainable aviation fuel just a few weeks back. Now we are seeing activity in carbon capture projects, early innings on hydrogen projects.\nSo our plans to have sustainable technology business of $1 billion in the next few years haven't changed. And my confidence of that absolutely has only grown higher over the last few months.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. And I would also just zoom out. I mean, we talk about some of the variability in this business, and PMT has always got some of the highest variability with UOP being a big part of that. Keep in mind, we grew sales in UOP for the year, something like 8%. Very, very healthy. And we've also grown orders somewhere in that same neighborhood. I think 2% for the year, but with 13% in the catalyst business. So we've come off some big comps with the large LNG projects. Overall, this is a very healthy business with a very healthy backlog. And as you said, the STS business provides a really nice catalyst on that new aspect of it. But we feel very good about where UOP is at this stage.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nExcellent. And just to follow up on advanced materials, I guess same question. The business has returned to growth. Just what are you seeing? Maybe in a little bit more detail, driving positive outlook for 2024. I think Chemours is constructive there as well. And maybe you can throw in a lot of questions on semis. I guess that's part of it as well, just if you expand on that. Thank you.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO and Chairman, Honeywell\n\nYeah. Thanks, Andrew. Yeah, we do see recovery in semis modestly increasing. Every month is becoming modestly better. So that's part of our forecast for 2024. We also saw in Q4 recovery in some segments of chemicals in short cycle. And we expect that to roll over in 2024. So the short-cycle recovery on a broader Honeywell portfolio is not a one event. So it's going to happen in different portions. So chemicals happen late Q4, and we expect that to continue. So all in all, advanced materials should have a better year in 2024 compared to what we had in 2023.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThanks so much.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO and Chairman, Honeywell\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning. Thanks for the question. And best of luck on the chairman role. So lots more questions. So here's a few more. Well, a couple more. Pricing, I'm not sure if you've caught our note, but maybe if you just talk about what you've embedded for price in your revenue guide. But it seems that we're entering the year with two of the segments down pretty heavily. Maybe just talk about how you see that break back the growth for IA and ESS. Is that in the second quarter? Is it more second half loaded? And perhaps maybe talk about what you've seen in the order rates to maybe support the view that we are at the bottom in some of these markets.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO and Chairman, Honeywell",
    "content2": "Yep. So for IA and ESS, I would say IA broadly, as we said, will be flattish on a year-on-year basis. The strength we see there is in process solutions in particular. It had a strong 2023. We expect another strong 2024 from process solutions. Rest of IA is a short cycle recovery. We saw pockets of that happening in Q4 in our scanning and mobility business. Now, other portions have to also recover during the course of the year. I talked about our warehouse automation business and how we expect that to perform during the course of the year, specifically on the margin side. So that definitely is part of our forecast. On ESS, we briefly talked in an earlier question.\nUOP is carrying a pretty strong booking and backlog. So we expect a good year from UOP in 2024. And then I talked about advanced materials a bit earlier there. On orders rate, the Q4 orders were up 1%, which helped us to further bolster our backlog now to record high level. Specifically on orders, there were highlights on short-cycle, early green shoots in building products, in scanning and mobility business, in parts of chemicals business, which is a good sign because if a couple have shown, I remain confident this will grow more broadly across our portfolio. Long-cycle, strong bookings in commercial aerospace, in UOP, in process solutions.\nThere were some lumpiness in the orders in warehouse automation and defense and space, which I talked earlier. So net net, our long-cycle orders performed extremely well on an annualized basis in 2023. And short-cycle is showing early cycle of recovery, which gives me confidence for 2024.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. And maybe just to hit the last point on pricing, we talked about 4% for 2023. That's exactly where it came in. And the more balanced view of price versus volume in our model for 2024 is really 3% pricing. And that's going to be, to Vimal's point, I think price cost neutral to maybe slightly positive for the year. So we feel very good about our ability to deliver on that. We've talked about that at length in the past. I think our capabilities in that area have been very strong, and we continue to be confident going into next year.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. That's helpful, Greg. And quick follow-up on the cash flow. Nice to see the pickup year to year. I'm guessing the tax benefits, potential tax benefits from R&D kind of rollback. I'm assuming that's not in your guide, but just curious if that does pass the Senate, what kind of benefit you might see for 2024 for cash flow?\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. Well, first of all, it's not nearly home, as I'm sure you can appreciate. So we're not sitting here counting any chickens. To be honest, Nigel, I think we need to wait and see exactly how all the rules, first, whether it happens and how they set the rules. As you can appreciate, all the specifics matter a lot in this area. So no, we're not guiding anything special about that. We'll wait and see exactly what happens and then interpret that and integrate it into our view when it becomes a real thing.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. That's great. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nGood morning, guys. And thank you.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO and Chairman, Honeywell\n\nHey, Sheila.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nMaybe I'll start off with aerospace, if that's okay. You talked about it growing low double digits. How do we think about the OE growth there? What build rates are you embedding into that on the commercial aerospace side? Any color you could give on aftermarket and defense growth?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO and Chairman, Honeywell\n\nYeah. So Sheila, we expect the overall low double-digit guide includes continued high growth rate of OE, as we saw in 2023. That will repeat itself in 2024. Also expect double-digit growth in aftermarket. Defense, we performed at low single- to mid-single-digit in 2023. The supply chain constraint remains the biggest handle there. And as we make progress, we expect it to perform in that range in 2024 also. But the biggest unlock for us is supply chain. We have demonstrated a strong performance in 2023. We expect a good start of the year and will unpack the year as the things progress.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. And so to be clear, I mean, no new signals from the OEs. They're continuing to place the same level of demand on us that they have been. So that's what we're committed to try to deliver.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay. Great. And then if I could ask one more, you've been asked every angle in terms of revenue growth acceleration. Outside of Aero, what do you need to see in the other three segments to hit the high end of guidance? Is it just all based on short-cycle recovery and the timing of that, or is it some additional price capture? If you could maybe talk about that.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO and Chairman, Honeywell\n\nYeah. Yes. The biggest variable is the short-cycle recovery and the pace of it, which remains variable. I mean, you look at 2024 set up for Honeywell in three buckets. Our backlog is up 8%, and we convert backlog at a pretty predictable rate. So that's something which is highly deterministic. Number two, the self-help actions we are driving to drive growth. The self-help action includes price. That includes new products. I talked about high growth regions, aftermarket services.\nAll that is going to help us to drive growth regardless of the market. And then the third variable is short cycle. If it returns quicker, we'll have an upper end of the growth, or we can beat it if it surprises everybody. And the vice versa. If it doesn't perform well during the course of the year, then we are at the lower end of the guide.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citi. Your line is now open.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nGood morning, everyone.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO and Chairman, Honeywell\n\nGood morning, Andy.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nHey, Andy.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nVimal, I just wanted to follow up on a commentary that you're on track to exceed the $25 billion of capital deployment guidance from 2023 to 2025. Obviously, you announced the carrier deal, but does that commentary suggest continued more aggressive capital deployment? Does your M&A pipeline support that? And then could you update us on the progress in divesting the 10% of the sales you talked about previously?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO and Chairman, Honeywell\n\nYep. So I would say that our capital deployment strategy would be balanced, which maximizes shareholder return. That's what we are really targeting for. It will be the balance. As Greg mentioned earlier, we expect both M&A and share repurchases to be part of that element for 2024 and years to come. The pipeline is adequate at this point of time, and activity remains strong. So we are constantly looking at the deals which work in our algorithm. It has to be bolt-on. It has to help to drive our overall organic growth and generally meet our financial algorithm, which we have earlier talked about.\nOn the part of the portfolio which doesn't fit in well, we are going to drive action starting 2024. Of course, we are not going to rush through that because we need to capture shareholder value, but you can anticipate some initial actions on that during 2024.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. And maybe just to put numbers on it, Andy, as we showed in that slide, I mean, we've been doing $8-ish billion per year. The simple math for 2024 says just with Carrier, that number is $10 billion going in with just enough share repurchase to buy back the creep. So we're going to be sitting at $18 billion through two years towards the $25-plus billion number. So the high confidence that we're going to be above that level just with the math.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nAnd then just a quick follow-up. You managed to grow Aero margin by 20 basis points in Q4, even with OE mix being against you, and you talked about supply chain improving in 2024. I know you're saying it'll marginally stay in a tight range, but if supply chain does continue to improve, is there an opportunity there with all of your productivity projects in that segment?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO and Chairman, Honeywell\n\nLook, I mean, there is a volume growth there, which will continue, and the volume leverage gets offset by the OE mix, which I talked earlier. The OE mix remains strong. But we are also, Andy, investing into aerospace. The volume growth is not coming accidentally. We have invested into our supply chain operations, supplier recovery, which is demonstrating the continuous volume growth occurred in 2023 and 2024. So when you put those facts together, that really drives the margin forecast for Aero at this point.\n\nAndy Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nHelpful, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Your line is now open.\n\nPeter Arment\n\nManaging Director, Baird\n\nYeah. Thanks. Good morning, Vimal. Greg. Greg, just a quick one. You mentioned in just kind of the legacy segment, SBS, you were talking about warehouse, that the pipeline of kind of in the projects business, that there were some signs that there was at least some improvement there. Maybe you can just give us a little color there just because obviously, that particular area has had a big downturn here.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO and Chairman, Honeywell\n\nI can start there. Yeah. I can start there, and Greg can join. Look, the pipeline, if I compare simple facts, our pipeline in January 2024 compared to January 2023 for warehouse automation projects, it's up nearly 30%. So what it tells us is that the basic value proposition and the long-term trend of warehouse automation are intact, but customers' willingness to invest in this very tight market or uncertain market is what is holding them back from making capital decisions. So we remain absolutely convinced on this business. And the foundational actions we have taken on continuing to grow our aftermarket, they are really paying off.\nI mean, our aftermarket business has crossed the $0.5 billion mark in 2023. We expect double-digit growth in aftermarket in 2024. And you can expect the business almost coupling half projects and half aftermarket in this year. So as the market confidence returns, we'll see the growth back. And that's supported by the pipeline we have and activity in the market.\n\nPeter Arment\n\nManaging Director, Baird\n\nVery helpful, Color. Thanks. I'll leave it at one.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO and Chairman, Honeywell\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.Our next question will come from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks. Good morning, guys.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO and Chairman, Honeywell\n\nGood morning, Andy.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nSo maybe circling back to Nigel's question on pricing, the three points that's embedded into your expectations, is that disproportionately coming from Aero, or how do I just kind of think about pricing across the segments?\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. So Aero is probably on the mid to lower end of that, just given all the contract nature of their business. And the other businesses, the other three segments are going to be a bit higher than that overall. So that's really, without being too specific, that's sort of directionally or notionally how you should think about it.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks, Greg. And then the quick follow-up, just circling, I'm trying to square the commentary on HBT and the destocking that you're seeing in the products business. With, obviously, you're excited about the security acquisition, and the growth profile for that business appears to be different. I'm just trying to square those comments, and maybe you can kind of help me with what you're seeing within your own security business today.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO and Chairman, Honeywell\n\nNo, as I mentioned before, we expect the front end of the year growth to be more driven by solutions side of the business. We are carrying forward meaningful backlog, both in projects and services. And as the year progresses, we expect short-cycle recovery to be the key factor for growth as the year passes along. And net net, we expect low single-digit growth in building technologies, but strong margin expansion. Our commercial excellence actions are in place. We remain confident that we're going to have meaningful progress in the year, both on growth, and margin expansion.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. I mean, I would just say, Joe, zoom out for a minute. We're coming towards the end of a three-year period where, again, COVID, then followed by big supply chain constraints, followed by massive inflation. That's why you hear everyone talking about what's going on in inventory destocking all over. Yeah, as that thing normalizes, that's going to make things clear across many of our products businesses, including HBT. But more broadly, again, zooming out, we love where this business is going and also creating that sizable position in security with a very attractive asset that we're bringing on from Carrier.\nYeah, we're very excited about that opportunity because we think that's going to be a creative growth across the portfolio for us. So it's just a matter of, I would say, differentiating between the here and now and the medium to longer term with those comments.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHelpful. Thank you, guys. Got it.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to CEO Vimal Kapur for closing remarks.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO and Chairman, Honeywell\n\nThank you. I want to thank all our shareholders for your ongoing support and our Honeywell colleagues who continue to enable us to outperform in any environment. Our future is bright, and we look forward to updating you on our progress as we execute on our commitments. T\nhank you very much for listening, and please stay safe and healthy. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question and answer session. Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to Sean Meakim, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nSean Meakim\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance, Honeywell\n\nGood morning and welcome to Honeywell's third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Chief Executive Officer Vimal Kapur and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Greg Lewis. This webcast and the presentation materials, including non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our Investor Relations website. From time to time we post new information that may be of interest or material to our investors on this website.\nOur discussion today includes forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the ones described in our SEC filings. This morning we will review our financial results for the third quarter, share our guidance for the fourth quarter, and full year 2023 and provide some preliminary thoughts on 2024. As always, we'll leave time for your questions at the end. With that, I'll turn the call over to our CEO Vimal Kapur.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on slide 2. First off, we are saddened by recent events in Middle East. We are deeply upset by the loss of innocent lives. Our number one priority continues to be safety and security of our employees and partners in the region and responding to their immediate needs.\nComing to the third quarter, it was another strong quarter for Honeywell in which we delivered all of our financial commitments. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.27, $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range. That was up 1% year over year or up 7% excluding a $0.14 non-cash pension headwind. Disciplined execution of our rigorous operating principles in the face of ongoing macroeconomic challenges continues to serve us and our stakeholders well. Third quarter sales were up 2% year over year driven by double-digit growth in our commercial aviation, defense and space, and process solutions. Our Aerospace business continues to be a bright spot in our portfolio driving meaningful commercial success.\nOur already robust backlog grew to a new record of $31.4 billion in third quarter, up 8% year-over-year and 3% sequentially due to strength in Aero and other long-cycle businesses. Orders grew double-digit in the quarter due to tremendous demand generation in Aero where orders were up 30% year-over-year. Honeywell Building Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions ended the quarter with flat year-over-year orders with book-to-bill of around 1x, an indication that we are seeing a short-cycle end market beginning to stabilize. Intelligrated was another positive indicator in the third quarter as we converted on a robust pipeline to drive double-digit year-over-year orders growth and over 50% sequential orders growth. PMT was down mid-single digits on unfavorable comparisons to last year's peak in advanced materials orders.\nOur segment margin expanded 80 basis points year over year, achieving the high end of our guidance range led by HBT up 110 basis points. We continue to see business mix improvement due to strong growth in our higher margin Aerospace business as well as ongoing gains from productivity. Free cash flow was $1.6 billion in third quarter with over 100% cash conversion and 17% free cash flow margin in line with our expectations. Greg will walk you through the free cash flow drivers in more detail in few minutes. We remain committed to our capital deployment strategy and we put our robust balance sheet to work in the third quarter by deploying $2 billion to dividends, M&A growth, CapEx, and share repurchases.\nWe bought back 5.3 million shares in the quarter, reducing our weighted average share count to 667 million, a step up due to highly attractive valuation and our ongoing confidence in Honeywell's performance. We remain on track with our commitment to deploy capital to high return categories and generate compelling value for Honeywell's shareholders. As always, we continue to execute on our proven value creation framework, effectively managing through ongoing external difficulties and delivering on our commitments. Looking forward, our consistent adherence to our rigorous operating principles, underpinned by our accelerated operating system, continued strength in our long-cycle end markets, and our technologically differentiated portfolio of solutions should provide investors with comfort that we will remain highly resilient, perform in all economic cycles, and drive shareholder value for years to come.\nNext, let's turn to slide 3 to review some of our exciting recent wins. Before I hand it off to Greg, let me briefly highlight some recent announcements that demonstrate our innovation across our portfolio. In Aero, we recently won a key new customer in the air transport space that will increase our APU and avionics install base on roughly 200 new aircraft over the next five years. This win helps demonstrate the strength in our Aerospace portfolio regardless of the market conditions. In energy space, we announced a partnership with SK E&S to deploy our UOP carbon capture technology at a natural gas power plant in Korea. Our technology will help enable the capture of greater than 95% of the carbon dioxide produced in the plant. We remain excited about the win rates across our sustainable technology solutions business as we help pave the way for the world's great energy transition.\nFinally, our Forge for buildings software was recently implemented in One Bangkok, the city's largest integrated district. This partnership with Frasers and TCC Technologies will foster an expanding adoption of our software offerings across business sectors as we support the achievement of sustainability goals. Our core focus as a company continues to be on Aerospace sustainability and automation. Our recent wins are closely aligned to these initiatives and are proof that we continue to drive innovation across our portfolio. We not only see profitable market outcomes, but also position Honeywell to address the world's toughest challenges. Now let me turn it over to Greg on slide 4 to discuss our third quarter results in more detail as well as provide our views on guidance.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nThank you, Vimal, and good morning, everyone. As Vimal outlined, we delivered another strong quarter in a dynamic macro environment. Third quarter sales grew 2% organically, led by double-digit organic sales growth in commercial aviation, defense and space, and process solutions. Commercial success in Aerospace, which drove 18% year-over-year growth in the third quarter, was once again a bright spot for Honeywell. Our short-cycle businesses continue to show signs of stabilizing sequentially. Encouraging fundamentals persist across most of PMT's end markets, which led to another quarter of 3% year-over-year growth despite more challenging comps as we entered the second half. As expected, our long-cycle warehouse automation business remains around trough levels, which led to overall volume decline of 1% for the quarter. However, excluding SPS's, volumes were up 6% across the portfolio.\nOur backlog remains at a record level ending the third quarter at $31.4 billion, up 8% year over year, driven by double-digit orders growth across our long-cycle businesses. Sequential improvements in supply chain constraints led to past-due backlog reductions in our short-cycle businesses, while demand continues to outpace output in Aero, a bullish signal of the underlying robustness of that business. An improving cost position and favorable business mix, due to significant growth in our high-margin Aerospace business among others, enabled us to expand segment margins by 80 basis points year over year to 22.6% and achieve the high end of our guidance on cash. We generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow, down 18% year over year, due to timing of cash tax payments and higher net working capital as strong Aerospace sales performance drove up our receivables balances year over year.\nThough we improved collections on our past due balances. Throughout this quarter, we accelerated our share buyback program, more than doubling the amount of shares repurchased compared to second quarter. We feel great about the future of Honeywell and believe in our next leg of transformation and will continue to opportunistically buy Honeywell shares at attractive valuations. Now let's spend a few minutes on third quarter performance by business.\nAerospace sales for the third quarter were up 18% organically with double digit growth in both commercial aviation and defense and space, the strongest growth quarter for Aero in over a decade. Commercial aviation growth was led by strength in the air transport aftermarket where increased flight activity globally continues to drive demand. Commercial original equipment also grew in the quarter on increased deliveries to both business and general aviation, and air transport customers. Defense and space sales inflected in 3Q growing 18% organically and orders grew over 30% year over year for the second consecutive quarter as we see the impact of increased global focus on national security come through. While the Aerospace supply chain remains constrained, we are continuing to see modest sequential improvements which enabled us to increase our output and convert our record backlog into sales growth.\nFor example, this was the third consecutive quarter with a 20% year over year increase in original equipment and spare shipments. While these gains in output are encouraging and leading to sales acceleration, demand continues to outpace supply. This is evidenced by our Aerospace book-to-bill of around 1.3x in third quarter. Segment margins in Aero were flat year over year as increased volume leverage and commercial excellence offset cost inflation and mix pressure in our original equipment. As expected.\nPerformance Materials and Technologies sales grew 3% organically in the third quarter led by HPS, which saw double-digit growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. Process Solutions sales grew 11% organically driven by continued strength in our projects, business, and life cycle solutions and services. In UOP, sales grew 6% organically led by gas processing solutions and petrochemical catalyst shipments. We continue to see robust demand in our sustainable technology solutions business within UOP as orders grew triple-digit for the third consecutive quarter and sales grew at strong double-digit rates. In advanced materials, sales decreased 8% organically driven primarily due to the continued expected macro-driven softness in our electronics, chemicals, and life science businesses and challenging year-over-year comps.\nSequentially, segment margins expanded 40 basis points, while on a year-on-year basis, segment margins contracted 50 basis points to 22.1% as a result of lower volumes, and Advanced Materials. Safety and Productivity Solutions sales decreased 25% organically in the quarter, primarily driven by lower volumes in warehouse and workflow solutions, and productivity solutions and services. The projects portion of our Intelligrated business is around trough levels in the current low investment warehouse automation environment, but our pipeline remains robust, and successful execution of our sales strategies resulted in double-digit year-over-year growth and over 50% sequential growth in orders in third quarter .\nAdditionally, the aftermarket services portion of the business continues to deliver solid double-digit sales growth in productivity solutions and services. We are working through the effects of distributor destocking but believe we are nearing the end of that cycle. Sensing & Safety Technologies was also impacted by short-cycle softness, but this business continues to remain relatively resilient. Second margin in SPS contracted 120 basis points to 14.5% as a result of volume deleverage, partially offset by our continued operational improvements and commercial excellence.\nTurning to Honeywell Building Technologies, sales were flat year over year in the quarter. Our long-cycle building solutions business continues to outpace our short-cycle building products. Building solutions grew 4% organically led by high single-digit growth in building projects driven by strong execution, particularly in energy projects. Orders for building projects were also substantial in the quarter, up nearly 20% year over year and resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.2x. On the product side, sales decreased modestly as a result of relatively soft demand for security products. Segment profit remained a bright spot for the business, continuing to grow as a result of productivity actions and commercial excellence all in HBT. Segment margin expanded 110 basis points to 25.2%.\nGrowth across the portfolio continues to be supported by accretive results in Honeywell Connected Enterprise, providing further evidence of Honeywell's strong software franchise across our businesses. Overall organic growth of approximately 20% in the third quarter was supported by strength in Connected Industrial, Connected Buildings, Cybersecurity, and Connected Aircraft orders. Growth above 20% in the quarter remains a powerful indicator of the continued robust demand for HCE offerings.\nIn October we held the latest installment of Honeywell Connect where we conducted 29 technology demonstrations to a group of 200 customers. We launched three new products, featured several product enhancements, and showcased advanced intelligence solutions using AI and Generative AI technology. One highlight from the event was the introduction of a suite of cybersecurity solutions including Honeywell Forge Cybersecurity+, Cyber Insights, and Cyber Watch, supported by the acquisition of SCADAfence in August, leading to new sales opportunities in as early as fourth quarter.\nOverall, this was a great result for Honeywell. Our operational execution enabled us to grow third quarter earnings per share to $2.27 up 1% year over year on an adjusted basis. Segment profit drove $0.15 of improvement in earnings per share. The main driver of our EPS growth, excluding the $0.14 pension headwind, EPS was $2.41 up 7% year over year. A bridge for adjusted EPS from 3Q 2022 to 3Q 2023 can be found in the appendix of this presentation with all the details. Finally, as Vimal mentioned earlier, we continue to leverage our healthy balance sheet, deploying $2 billion in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $5.7 billion as we execute on our capital deployment strategy.\nSo overall, Honeywell's operating playbook continues to deliver strong results, and our best-in-class Honeywell value creation framework will enable us to drive compelling growth, earnings, and cash for quarters to come. Now let's turn to slide 5 to discuss our fourth quarter and full year guidance.\nAt this stage in the year and given the incrementally more challenging macro backdrop with geopolitics and interest rate dynamics, we are narrowing our full year guidance ranges for sales and EPS while increasing the midpoints of our segment margin expectations. Our demand profile remains healthy with record backlog and favorable orders performance. While we continue to monitor the timing of short cycle recovery, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments. For the fourth quarter we anticipate sales to be between $9.6 and 9.9 billion, up 3% to 7% organically, driven by continued strength in Commercial Aviation, Defense and Space, Process Solutions, and UOP. We anticipate organic sales growth in Aero, PMT, and HBT in the fourth quarter.\nFor the full year, we're raising the low end of our previous sales guidance by $100 million and lowering the high end by $200 million for a new range of $36.8 to 37.1 billion, representing 4% to 5 organic growth for the year. This reflects continued solid execution in our long-cycle business while we awaited demand acceleration in some of our short-cycle businesses. Turning to segment margin, we anticipate the fourth quarter to be between 22.9% and 23.2%, flat to up 30 basis points year over year and up sequentially. As we continue to benefit from improving business mix, and our productivity actions, for the full year we are also raising the low end of our segment margin guidance by 10 basis points for a new range of 22.5% to 22.6, representing 80 to 90 basis points of year over year expansion.\nThis improvement is driven by HBT, SPS, and PMT, which are all expected to expand margins. Now let me walk you through the expectations for each segment in a little bit more detail.\nLooking ahead for Aerospace, we're very pleased with the continued improvements in the Aero supply chain that are allowing us to capitalize on our record backlog. In 4Q, we anticipate another quarter of strong sales growth both year over year and sequentially in commercial aviation, defense, and space. In commercial aviation, we expect most of the sequential growth to come through increased original equipment volumes. The commercial aftermarket will also deliver healthy year over year growth with demand driven by continued improvement in air transport flight hours in defense and space. We are coming off back-to-back quarters of +30% orders growth which has bolstered our already sizable backlog and we see another quarter of double-digit growth to end the year.\nWith our growth momentum from third quarter carrying over into 4Q, we now expect Aerospace sales to be up mid-teens for the year, with much of the incremental sales in this upgrade coming from increased original equipment shipments. As we capture a greater installed base, we expect Aero margins to be flat to modestly down for the year. In Performance Materials and Technologies. Our strong execution and the encouraging outlook in our end markets will continue to drive favorable growth.\nFor the fourth quarter. We expect our typical solid finish to the year leading to year-over-year and sequential sales growth. Growth will be led by Process Solutions on strength in projects and aftermarket services. In UOP., our growth outlook is supported by robust demand for petrochemical and refining catalysts. The sustainability technology solutions business will continue to grow as we capitalize on legislation-backed demand. For advanced materials. We expect continued demand for fluorine products, a rebound in life sciences end markets, and an improvement in our electronics and chemicals business supportive of sequential growth. For the full year, we continue to expect high single-digit sales growth in PMT due to typical catalyst seasonality. We still expect meaningful sequential and year-over-year margin expansion and in fourth quarter, resulting in modest segment margin expansion for the year for PMT.\nIn Safety and Productivity Solutions, our outlook continues to be impacted by the current low levels of investment in new warehouse capacity and distributor destocking. However, the impact on our financials is declining, creating stabilization and signs of potential return to growth in the coming quarters. For the fourth quarter, we expect these effects to lead to sales that are roughly flat sequentially, down organically, but to a lesser degree than earlier in the year. Orders will grow sequentially and year over year in the fourth quarter as we build on momentum from this quarter. While new warehouse investment remains challenged, customers continue to upgrade their existing infrastructure, which will lead to another quarter of double-digit growth for the aftermarket services portion of our Intelligrated business.\nFor the full year, we now expect sales to be down approximately 20% as the SPS portfolio bounces along the bottom of the cycle. However, the productivity actions and operational improvements we have made this year will still enable us to expand margins solidly for the year. In building technologies, we were prudent with our posture at the start of the year as we faced unprecedented central bank tightening cycle and uncertain demand environment. While the operating backdrop remains difficult, we are encouraged by the sequential orders progression we saw each month throughout 3Q, including double-digit products orders growth in the month of September.\nFor the fourth quarter we expect modest sequential sales improvement from our Q2 and Q3 levels, with growth continuing to be led by our long cycle building solutions business. The supply chain is improving each quarter and we expect to make further progress on converting our past due backlog into sales.\nWe're also encouraged by the resiliency we are seeing in verticals such as airports, government, and education and expect institutional demand to provide support amid commercial softness. We project HBT sales to be up low single digits for the year with commercial and operational excellence enabling HBT to be our largest margin expander in 2023. Now moving on to our other key guidance metrics, we anticipate net below the line impact to be between negative $105 million and negative $155 million in the fourth quarter and between negative $525 million and negative $575 million for the full year. This guidance includes a range of repositioning between $45 million and $85 million in the fourth quarter and between $260 million and $300 million for the full year. As we continue to invest in high return projects to support our future growth and productivity.\nWe expect the adjusted effective tax rate to be around 19% in the fourth quarter and around 21% for the full year, unchanged from our previous guidance. We anticipate average share count to be around 664 million shares in the fourth quarter, around 669 million shares for the full year as we continue to reduce our share count through opportunistic buybacks. As a result of these inputs, we anticipate adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.53 and $2.63 for the fourth quarter, flat to up 4% year over year excluding pension headwinds. Fourth quarter EPS growth would be up 6% to 10 for the full year. We are narrowing both ends of our EPS guidance ranges by $0.05 for a new range of $9.10 to 9.20, up 4% to 5 year-over-year holding the midpoint of our prior guide.\nExcluding pension headwinds, EPS growth would be up 10% to 11 for the year. On cash, we continue to expect to meet our original free cash flow guidance of $3.9 to 4.3 billion in 2023 or $5.1 to 5.5 billion excluding the net impact of settlements driven by stronger collections and inventory management. Higher cash tax outlays in third quarter will be offset by more favorable cash outlook in fourth quarter, giving us confidence in our full year guidance.\nSo to summarize, we're narrowing our full year guidance ranges for sales and EPS while raising the midpoint of our segment margin expectations based on our confidence and the ability to successfully deliver results in a fluid operating environment. Before turning back to Vimal, let's turn to the next page and discuss our preliminary thoughts for 2024. While next year's environment is shaping up to be just as volatile as the last few years, our proven track record of navigating an uncertain macro backdrop should give investors confidence in our ability to execute on our commitments. We have a unique set of operating principles that enable us to move quickly and decisively to drive growth, protect margins, ensure liquidity, and position ourselves well to deliver in any environment.\nOur end market exposures remain favorable into 2024, particularly in Aerospace and Energy. We expect continued commercial aviation fleet growth and replenishment, increased domestic and international defense investment amid geopolitical uncertainty, heightened focus on automation due to labor scarcity, increased energy demands and intensifying decarbonization goals accelerating the need for technologies enabling the energy transition, and increased infrastructure spending.\nAll of these compelling vertical tailwinds as well as ongoing customer demand to help enable digitalization give us confidence that all four of our reconstituted businesses will deliver growth next year. The timing of an eventual recovery in short-cycle is less certain and will be a swing variable to our sales outcome. We have a strong setup that will drive growth in sales, margin, and earnings in 2024. Within our long-term financial framework.\nWe expect organic growth to be led by our long-cycle businesses due to record level demand and backlog in 2023. Additionally, our focus on new product innovation is yielding benefits. We believe extending our success in delivering new solutions to our existing vast installed base, as well as the commercial efforts driving greater penetration of our current set of technologies to new markets, will help enable robust organic growth. That coupled with our ongoing leadership in high growth regions and the strength of our software franchise gives us confidence in the top line. We also expect supply chains to continue to improve gradually in Aero throughout next year. For overall Honeywell, 2024 margins will benefit from improving business mix, continued benefits from price, costs, and productivity actions, including our precision focus on reducing raw material costs, as well as implementing AI into our development and production.\nWe will continue our investments in R&D and growth-oriented capital expenditures and remain keenly focused on creating uniquely innovative, differentiated recession-proof technologies to address the world's toughest automation, digitalization, and sustainability challenges.\nWhile we expect our spend on repositioning to be relatively stable year over year in 2024, we also anticipate modestly higher interest expense and lower pension income next year, both driven by the acceleration in yields across the bond markets we have seen since this summer, that will lead to slightly higher net below the line expense. We will provide more information about the year over year magnitude of these changes at year-end when we snap the line on pension, but we anticipate they'll be more in line with normal historical changes, not last year's outsized impacts. As a reminder, pension income is a non-cash item given our overfunded pension status and will ensure no incremental contributions are needed. This is a great position to be in for our employees, both former and current, and our shareholders.\nWe expect our cash to grow in line or above earnings next year, with improvement assisted by the absence of the one-time settlement from de-risking our balance sheet earlier this year, which had an outsized effect on our cash performance. We're also embarking on a multi-year unwind of the last two years of working capital buildup. We will continue benefiting from improved demand planning and optimize production and materials management using our enhanced end-to-end process and visualization capabilities through accelerator. We see several compelling growth capital opportunities and expect to fund high-return projects through disciplined CapEx spending in the coming years.\nOur balance sheet strength will continue to give us meaningful capacity for M&A, and we expect an ongoing favorable deal environment going into 2024, which supports our intention to accelerate capital deployment. Now I'm going to pass the call over to Vimal to say a few words about the announcement we made earlier this month on our portfolio and strategic priorities. Over to you, Vimal.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nThanks, Greg. Two weeks ago, we announced a portfolio reorganization that aligns our business with distinct, compelling megatrends that are shaping the future of our industries and our planet. These are automation, the future of aviation, and energy transition, and all are underpinned by our robust capability in digitalization. This realignment will enable us to have a simpler, clearer strategic focus and clearly define Honeywell's value proposition for our customers, investors, and employees. We are an automation, Aerospace, and sustainability-focused technology company. We believe this change will empower our business leaders to better prioritize R&D efforts, capital expenditures, M&A pipeline, go-to-market strategies, and more. It will also create a more focused framework for M&A, allowing us to pursue bolt-on acquisitions and select divestitures that align to our themes and enhance our portfolio overall.\nWe have demonstrated the ability to operate under dynamic circumstances including a global pandemic, large-scale supply chain disruptions, heightened inflation, international trade disputes, unprecedented central bank tightening, and geopolitical tensions underpinned by the strength of our differentiated accelerator operating system. We are confident that we can deliver strong financial performance in 2024. We will provide more specific inputs in our annual outlook calls once we close out the year. Now let's turn onto slide 7, and I will close with some long-term comments. Let's take a minute to zoom out from the quarterly result. As a reminder, my priorities as CEO are first, simplify the portfolio to better align with the key megatrend that I mentioned earlier. Next, I will drive accelerated organic growth by strengthening our innovation playbook, growing our sustainability and digitalization offerings, and maintaining our leadership position in high-growth regions.\nOn top of those organic growth efforts, I will manage the portfolio of enhancing our M&A capability, including staying disciplined and executing on bolt-on M&A aligned to these three megatrends. I also plan to advance the Accelerator operating system to create more value through business model optimization. We continue to make progress on our long-term growth algorithm that we discussed during our May Investor Day. Our 2023 guidance represents another year of strong financial performance consistent with our framework following meaningful progress since 2017 through some very turbulent times. We'll continue to carefully track our progression towards achieving our targets and remain confident in our ability to accelerate growth, expand gross margin to above 40%, achieve +25% segment margins, and generate free cash flow margins of mid-teens plus.\nI'm thrilled to lead Honeywell into the next phase of our transformation, and I'm optimistic about the tremendous opportunities we are uncovering to capture value, drive incremental sales growth, expand margins, and generate more cash. We'll continue to update you as these efforts increasingly translate into enhanced financial performance. Now let's turn to slide 8 for closing thoughts before we move into the Q&A.\nWe delivered on all commitments in third quarter. We have and will continue to demonstrate resiliency while managing through a dynamic macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop. Overall demand generation remains strong, particularly in the long cycle of businesses with orders up double-digit year over year, and record backlog levels will continue to support strong results while we navigate an external environment that remains challenging for the short cycle. Our portfolio is aligned to powerful mega trends including automation, the future of aviation, and energy transition, all underpinned by digitalization. Our technologically differentiated portfolio of solutions and our world-class Honeywell Accelerator operating system will enable us to capitalize on these trends and drive the profitable growth we outlined in our long-term financial framework. We're expecting a strong finish to 2023 and well positioned for further growth in 2024.\nWe look forward to updating you on the progress as we execute on our commitments. With that, Sean, let's move to Q&A.\n\nSean Meakim\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance, Honeywell\n\nVimal and Greg are now available to answer your questions. We ask that you please be mindful of others in the queue by only asking one question. Operator, please open the line for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder to ask a question, you will need to press Star 11 on your telephone to remove yourself from the question queue. Press Star 11 again. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nJust wanted to start off with a question on the fourth quarter margin outlook. I think you're looking at about 40 bps of margin uplift sequentially, 30% operating leverage sequentially. It looks like PMT perhaps is the segment where you're expecting a very big margin uplift. So just wondered if you could go into a little bit more detail around that. The margins have been down year on year all year there, so just maybe help us understand, you know, what's really changing a lot in the fourth quarter to get that moving. And then just as a very quick follow up, HBT crosscurrents. This year you've got a low base as we think about 2024, but the interest rate environment is negative. So just confidence in HBT's growth ability looking out. Thank you.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nHey Julian, so I'll take the first one and I'll pitch it to Vimal for number two. Overall we've had a great year in margin expansion for Honeywell, and again we're looking to finish the year at the high end of our guidance range as you've seen. I think we've continued to demonstrate our ability to drive margin expansion in any environment. And as we look into Q4, as you said, we see a nice sequential improvement from Q3 to Q4 and some healthy margin expansion there as well. You know, in PMT we talk about it often. The margin tends to be somewhat lumpy from any one quarter to the next. A big part of that, of course, is where catalyst shipments wind up, you know, during the course of the year and in which end market.\nAs we go into Q4 for PMT, you know, we have a pretty healthy UOP mix for sure, and we're seeing also some recovery from some of the challenges that we've had earlier in the year with operations in am. So you know, that's really the underlying, you know, the underlying theme for Q4. But we think the teams have done a great job, and PMT is on track also to have a very nice year overall with high single digit top line growth and some modest margin expansion. We're pretty pleased with where we are going with that, and maybe Vimal, I'll hand it to you on the HBT.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nJulian, on HBT, I would say I'll spend a minute to kind of first go back to what our business model is before I kind of answer your question. I think there are three parts of our HBT business model. First, it is 60% product, 40% solution, and within 40% solution more than half is aftermarket. So by virtue of its mix, it's a short-cycle oriented business. The second point is the products we have; they are critical to the buildings, and that's why they are higher margin. And that explains our constant margin improvement in the segment. And finally, our exposure in buildings is combination of real estate, but also infrastructure. And all that put together explains our results of 2022, where we grew double-digit, and this year will grow low single-digit. To your question of 2024, we remain confident HBT will grow for our guidance.\nOur backlog is growing in our solution business and of course the swing factor remains here, the short cycle position.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nSean Meakim\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance, Honeywell\n\nLatif. Can we have the next question please?\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.\n\nStephen Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHey guys, good morning.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning, Steve.\n\nStephen Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nSome cross currents here at SPS. I mean it's now down to you. No, like 10% of your profits. Things seem to be bottoming there. But does the timing of those shipments, can that business grow next year or should we be kind of prepared for another down year there? Maybe if you could just like base out the expectations there for SPS.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nSure. Steve, so you're right, SPS is coming out of the bullpen effect of COVID, and clearly that reflects in our Q3 numbers. But as we mentioned in our earlier conversation, the SPS orders in Q3, we had a book-to-bill of 1x, and we see similar trends continuing in Q4, which means we are in a recovery cycle in this business, moving forward starting Q4, and we'll see that in 2024. Margin expansion will certainly help there because the volumes growth will help in margin expansion. We have re-baselined our cost base, aligned to the new revenue scale. So overall, we should see recovery from this point onwards.\n\nStephen Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nOkay, so that's a growth business with some nice leverage next year, is what you're saying.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nI think, Steve, the overall top line growth could be flattish next year. But as Vimal said, with particularly as the short-cycle accelerates, there's a lot of leverage in those short-cycle businesses in particular. So we absolutely will do that. Expect to see that come through. And again on the Intelligrated side, with the aftermarket growing far greater than the projects business, we should see some nice mix in that business as well. So the timing of that acceleration, as we've said overall, still is something that we're waiting to see happen. But we've flattened out, bottomed out the orders rate, so it should be coming anytime now, and when it does, a lot of leverage comes along with it.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Scott Davis of Melius Research.\n\nScott Davis\n\nCEO & Chairman, Melius Research\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Greg.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning, Scott.\n\nScott Davis\n\nCEO & Chairman, Melius Research\n\nHey, the world is kind of changing and volatile. China seems like it's taken another step down. Can you guys walk us around the world and what you're seeing from a geographic mix perspective, and just a little bit of color on how things maybe change through the quarter or into 4Q from that front as well? That'll be my question. I'll pass it on after that. Thanks.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nOkay, thanks Scott. I would say you're absolutely right, Scott. There is a lot of variation how things are working in the world at the time same point. Let me start with China. We are going to have high single-digit growth in China this year. It's primarily supported by growth in Europe, but also in some other businesses too. We see China to be a similar trend, mid single-digit to high single-digit, in 2024. We have enough backlog and strength in Aerospace to support that in other parts of the world. I would say we see a lot of strength in Asia, in particular, India, and ASEAN countries, and Middle East, also given our strong position in energy, positions us pretty well. And then Europe and US probably we'll see the impact of high interest rates and challenging environment. So probably we are experiencing the same here. So it's a good balance of positive and negative.\nBut one thing I'd like to add there is, as we see our backlog, which grew by 8%, we also see good orders position forecasted for quarter four. It's going to position us pretty well for 2024 ahead in spite of the challenging condition because we do expect our long cycle businesses are going to help to drive in our forecasted range of revenue growth for 2024.\n\nScott Davis\n\nCEO & Chairman, Melius Research\n\nThank you guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe, your line is open. Please proceed.\nYes, sorry about that. I had my mute button on. Sorry about that. Thanks for the question. Greg, I don't want to put kind of words in your mouth, but I think I heard DC in 2024. As sort of within the long term framework of four to 750 basis points of OM. Is that sort of what you meant? Based on what you see today? I understand a lot of macro uncertainty out there, and if I could just clarify the free cash flow growing in line with earnings, whatever that may be. Should we add back the one-timers this year as the base and then grow from there? Because obviously $1.2 billion is a big number, and any thoughts on the pension headwind would be helpful as well.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nSure, yes. So again, it's way too early for guidance. Of course we'll do that specifically in 90 days or so when we announce our full year earnings. So the comments we've been giving is that we see things within that long term framework. That's a reasonably good barometer for how we're seeing things at the moment. But again, 90 days from now we'll know a lot more in terms of the free cash flow. You're exactly right. We have $1.2 billion of settlements. That's obviously not going to happen again next year. So that's immediate add back to the base, and then from there we expect to see free cash grow in line or maybe better with earnings.\nThe math, maybe, around that is really a matter of we expect to start seeing the liquidation of our working capital, but we also have a very robust set of growth projects on capital. We're going to be going through our budgeting process here over the course of fourth quarter, and we may have some good things to put forth from a CapEx standpoint next year. But we feel really good about the progress that we're making in cash flow again this quarter. Very nice cash flow number, 100% conversion, 17% cash margin. So made some nice progress. One other kind of good anecdotal point, we've started to see Aero bring their days of supply down in inventory. So while the number in the aggregate has gone up, they're obviously growing the business in the high teens.\nWe are starting to see the efficiency and inventory show up. So that's really how we're thinking about it at this stage for next year. But we'll know a lot more in 90 days and be a bit more precise. And then, you know, on pension, you know, could it be $50 or 100 million worse? You know, we'll see rates move around a lot as you know. And as I mentioned in my comments, we snapped the line at the end of the year but it's trending to be, you know, lower income next year but obviously nowhere near the kind of shock that we had in 2023 change.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Multi-Industry Senior Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYes, good morning.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning, Andrew.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Multi-Industry Senior Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYeah, just a question on advanced materials I think was a little bit weaker than we expected. I think you said softness in electronics, chems, and lifestyle drove the declines. I think last quarter you highlighted electronics and chemicals. Just want to understand what the changes are because I think before you were saying that electronic materials should improve in second half. Just right. I know it's a high margin business. Just what has changed and how does the business look into year end and maybe what kind of momentum you have into next year? Thanks so much.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nYeah, thanks Andrew. Look, I would say in AM the fluorine products, the business of Solstice is doing extremely well. Continues to grow as its applications keeps growing, its geographic spread keeps growing. So that that's very positive. Electronic materials have definitely bottomed out. We have, we have seen signaling of recovery from the key fab manufacturers and part of that is seen in Q4. Not as good as we like it to see, but we are seeing signals of recovery in the electronic side, and there are parts of chemicals which are weak, which is reflected in our overall revenue, and like any other short-cycle, we expect it to recover aligned with economic conditions there. But, but I must say that our, our conviction in the business is very strong.\nWe had outstanding years in 2021 and 2022, and this year should be seen in comps to, you know, the past two years.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nHey, good morning everyone. Thank you. I wanted to ask. [crosstalk] Hi, I wanted to ask about Aerospace please. And specifically defense and space. Great growth in the quarter up 18%. What are you seeing from a bookings perspective there? The sustainability of demand with everything going on. And how does defense factor into Aero margin mix? Thank you.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nThanks, Sheila. I mean, I think one of our headlines of our Q3 has been Aero, and within Aero the defense and space our bookings continue to be strong. Q3 was a strong booking quarter, so was Q2, and that's driven by not only the US domestic bookings but also international defense markets opening up. And we clearly see reflecting that in our booking rates. The revenue growth is driven by supply chain actions which are now being seen in defense also. And we expect, you know, the continued growth in the defense segment in quarter four and 2024 ahead too. So punchline is that defense is going to become a contributing factor in the continued Aero growth. Given the overall geopolitical political conditions in the world.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nOn Aerospace margins as it relates to defense and space, it's not a material drag on our margins. So that growth there is going to be not materially different than the overall margin rate. We find that growth to be quite nice to segment profit growth.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research.\n\nJeffrey T. Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nHey, thank you. Good morning everyone.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning, Jeff.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning. Hey, not to get too tied up in arcane pension accounting, but did you guys change something, you know, in pension to mitigate, you know, the impact the interest rate changes? Certainly nice to hear the headwind is, you know, that modest. But my rough math would have maybe suggested a bit more, and then maybe just to add another part. Vimal, you touched on advanced materials a little bit in a previous answer, but can you give us a little bit of color on how you see the 410A to 454B transition unfolding? What's happening to, you know, 410A prices and availability, and you know, where you stand competitively as these OEMs are making the shift. Thank you.\nMaybe I'll hit the pension one first. So no, you know, Jeff, we haven't changed anything in our accounting. You know, we'll do our normal mark to market in the fourth quarter as we've done, you know, for many years now. And again, you know what I mentioned, you know, $50 to 100 million is a range. We'll see how the final numbers pan out with discount rates and returns on assets for the asset basis themselves. So nothing different. And we'll give you a more precise answer after the turn of the year when we snap the line.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nJeff, on Advanced Materials, I would say it's pretty fascinating to see how this changeover is happening between Solstice 410A and 454B. We are working with all key OEMs for several years. This is not a new dimension for us. We have been on it for last several years, and we see the switchover happening from 410A to 454B in the times ahead, and we have secured our position with the key OEMs. I would say for us, I would call it like business as usual because this is something which is part of our business, and we were ahead of the game here to look ahead and think about its implication on us. And we are well covered on that.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank.\n\nNicole DeBlase\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah, thanks. Good morning guys.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nHey Nicole.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nNicole, good morning.\n\nNicole DeBlase\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nCan we double click a little bit on what you guys are seeing with respect to channel inventory reductions within HBT and SPS? Where are we in that inventory destocking process, and do you think we will enter 2024 in a pretty clean position with respect to channel inventories?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell",
    "content2": "Nicole? We have, I would say the channel inventory is reflected in our orders rate. Our orders rate for both buildings and SPS had a book-to-bill of 1x last quarter, and the similar trends are persisting so far in October, which tells me that we are on a path of slight recovery and. That's the indirect measure for me on channels are looking at stocking back again from the cycle. We expect short cycle to slightly recover progressively every month moving forward, but not as fast as we'd like it to be at this point.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Good morning everyone.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nHey Deane.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHey, on HBT you called out cost inflation, headwinds. Could you size that and what kind of pricing actions have you taken? And then on the verticals, airport, government, and education, how has government stimulus? Has that started to come through and are you benefiting there? Thanks.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. Hey Deane, we don't disclose our individual segments, you know, price, price, cost. But if you recall, I mean we've, we've mentioned that we're going to retain our price cost positivity and we've done that inside of HBT, you know, throughout the course of the year. So you know, you see the numbers for total Honeywell, you know, I think we're within our, within our zone that we had guided from a pricing perspective. It's probably going to be, you know, 4% for the year across the total portfolio. Maybe I'll pass it to Vimal on the other side.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nWe do get, I would say, benefit of different government stimulus programs. The recent one being around, I would say, CHIPS Act semiconductor activity in the US, the proposal activity there is strong, and hopefully we'll win enough to see the benefit of that in the times ahead. But I must also point out that we also see heightened infrastructure activity outside the US, specifically in high-growth regions. One of the strength of HBT business is very strong footprint in high-growth regions: China, ASEAN, Middle East, India, etc. And there, the activity on infrastructure build-out is pretty strong, which is going to help us in building out our backlog, specifically in long-cycle. So that's how we see those dimensions in the business.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks. Good morning everyone.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nHey Joe.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning, Joe.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey guys. My one question is it's just on orders, so you know, nice to see the inflection versus what you'd experienced last quarter. I think Aero was the only segment that grew last quarter. I didn't hear the commentary on PMT, so if I missed it, my apologies. But what were orders like in PMT this quarter and maybe specifically for HPS and UOP.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nYes. Year to date, I would say the orders rate in UOP and HPS are pretty strong, and we expect to finish very strongly for both the businesses in 2023 and carry forward good backlog for 2024. The wins are, you know, driven by multiple end markets in HPS. UOP is certainly benefiting from strong demand of catalysts, but also now strong demand coming from sustainable technologies. Our sustainable technology business is growing at triple-digit rate as we had anticipated. All that is really adding up for strong performance of UOP for 2023 orders.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citigroup.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nHey, good morning everyone.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning, Andrew.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nI know you're expecting a nice uptick in PMT margin in Q4, but as you've guided this year, PMT margins tended to be a bit muted for the year. So maybe conviction level that it does jump in Q4 and then I know you're moving HPS over, but pro forma DC PMT is one of the better margin performers in 2024.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nIn terms of conviction level it's high. I mean I feel pretty strongly about the PMT team's ability to perform. You know, here again, we're not at a place where we're giving guidance ranges for next year for any given segments. I expect the PMT business as currently constructed. You know, we expect accretion next year as well, but we're not going to get into any specific guidance ranges around that at this moment. Our conviction level is high. The team is delivering; they've taken all the right actions in each of the three businesses, and as we said with a nice mix going into Q4 on catalysts, we expect to be able to deliver the margin accretion in Q4.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Vimal Kapur for closing remarks.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you. Our value creation framework is working while the macroeconomy remains challenging and the timing of a short cycle acceleration is uncertain. We are deploying our rigorous operating playbook to navigate near term volatility. We are confident in our ability to weather near term challenges and meet our performance targets underpinned by ongoing strength in our two biggest end markets, Aerospace and Energy, combined with the operating rigor you have expected from Honeywell. Thank you all, and our Honeywell colleagues who continue to enable us to outperform in any environment and drive differentiated performance for our customers and shareholders. Thank you all for listening, and please stay safe and healthy.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.\nThank you for standing by and welcome to the Honeywell Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation there will be a question and answer session. Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to Sean Meakim, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nSean Meakim\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance, Honeywell\n\nGood morning and welcome to Honeywell's third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Chief Executive Officer Vimal Kapur and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Greg Lewis. This webcast and the presentation materials, including non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our Investor Relations website. From time to time we post new information that may be of interest or material to our investors on this website.\nOur discussion today includes forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the ones described in our SEC filings. This morning we will review our financial results for the third quarter share our guidance for fourth quarter and full year 2023 and provide some preliminary thoughts on 2024. As always, we'll leave time for your questions at the end. With that, I'll turn the call over to our CEO Vimal Kapur.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on slide 2. First off, we are saddened by recent events in Middle East. We are deeply upset by the loss of innocent lives. Our number one priority continues to be safety and security of our employees and partners in the region and responding to their immediate needs.\nComing to the third quarter, it was another strong quarter, one for Honeywell in which we delivered all of our financial commitments. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.27, $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range. That was up 1% year over year or up 7% excluding a $0.14 non-cash pension headwind. Disciplined execution of our rigorous operating principles in the face of ongoing macroeconomic challenges continues to serve us and our stakeholders well. Third quarter sales were up 2% year over year driven by double-digit growth in our commercial, aviation, defense and space, and process solutions. Our Aerospace business continues to be a bright spot in our portfolio driving meaningful commercial success.\nOur already robust backlog grew to a new record of $31.4 billion in third quarter, up 8% year over year and 3% sequentially due to strength in Aero and other long-cycle businesses. Orders grew double-digit in the quarter due to tremendous demand generation in Aero where orders were up 30% year over year. Honeywell Building Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions ended the quarter with flat year-over-year orders with book-to-bill of around 1x, an indication that we are seeing a short-cycle end market beginning to stabilize. Intelligrated was another positive indicator in the third quarter as we converted on our robust pipeline to drive double-digit year-over-year orders growth and over 50% sequential orders growth. PMT was down mid-single digits on unfavorable comparisons to last year's peak in advanced materials orders.\nOur segment margin expanded 80 basis points year over year, achieving the high end of our guidance range, led by HBT, up 110 basis points. We continue to see business mix improvement due to strong growth in our higher margin Aerospace business as well as ongoing gains from productivity. Free cash flow was $1.6 billion in third quarter with over 100% cash conversion and 17% free cash flow margin in line with our expectations. Greg will walk you through the free cash flow drivers in more detail in few minutes. We remain committed to our capital deployment strategy, and we put our robust balance sheet to work in the third quarter by deploying $2 billion to dividends, M&A growth, CapEx, and share repurchases.\nWe bought back 5.3 million shares in the quarter, reducing our weighted average share count to 667 million, a step up due to highly attractive valuation and our ongoing confidence in Honeywell's performance. We remain on track with our commitment to deploy capital to high return categories and generate compelling value for Honeywell's shareholders. As always, we continue to execute on our proven value creation framework, effectively managing through ongoing external difficulties and delivering on our commitments. Looking forward, our consistent adherence to our rigorous operating principles, underpinned by our accelerated operating system, continued strength in our long cycle end markets, and our technologically differentiated portfolio of solution should provide investors with comfort that we will remain highly resilient, perform in all economic cycles, and drive shareholder value for years to come.\nNext, let's turn to slide 3 to review some of our exciting recent wins. Before I hand it off to Greg, let me briefly highlight some recent announcements that demonstrate our innovation across our portfolio. In Aero, we recently won a key new customer in the air transport space that will increase our APU and avionics installed base on roughly 200 new aircraft over the next five years. This win helps demonstrate the strength in our Aerospace portfolio regardless of the market conditions in energy space. We announced a partnership with SK E&S to deploy our UOP carbon capture technology at a natural gas power plant in Korea. Our technology will help enable the capture of greater than 95% of the carbon dioxide produced in the plant. We remain excited about the win rates across our sustainable technology solutions business as we help pave the way for the world's great energy transition.\nFinally, our Forge for buildings software was recently implemented in One Bangkok, the city's largest integrated district. This partnership with Frasers and TCC Technologies will foster an expanding adoption of our software offerings across business sectors as we support the achievement of sustainability goals. Our core focus as a company continues to be on Aerospace sustainability and automation. Our recent wins are closely aligned to these initiatives and are proof that we continue to drive innovation across our portfolio. We not only see profitable market outcomes, but also position Honeywell to address the world's toughest challenges. Now let me turn it over to Greg on slide 4 to discuss our third quarter results in more detail as well as provide our views on guidance.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nThank you, Vimal, and good morning, everyone. As Vimal outlined, we delivered another strong quarter in a dynamic macro environment. Third quarter sales grew 2% organically, led by double-digit organic sales growth in commercial aviation, defense and space, and process solutions. Commercial success in Aerospace, which drove 18% year-over-year growth in the third quarter, was once again a bright spot for Honeywell. Our short-cycle businesses continue to show signs of stabilizing sequentially. Encouraging fundamentals persist across most of PMT's end markets, which led to another quarter of 3% year-over-year growth despite more challenging comps as we entered the second half. As expected, our long-cycle warehouse automation business remains around trough levels, which led to overall volume decline of 1% for the quarter. However, excluding SPS's volumes were up 6% across the portfolio.\nOur backlog remains at a record level, ending third quarter at $31.4 billion, up 8% year over year, driven by double-digit orders growth across our long-cycle businesses. Sequential improvements in supply chain constraints led to past-due backlog reductions in our short-cycle businesses, while demand continues to outpace output in Aero, a bullish signal of the underlying robustness of that business. An improving cost position and favorable business mix, due to significant growth in our high-margin Aerospace business among others, enabled us to expand segment margins by 80 basis points year over year to 22.6% and achieve the high end of our guidance on cash. We generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow, down 18% year over year, due to timing of cash tax payments and higher net working capital.\nAs strong Aerospace sales performance drove up our receivables balances year over year, so we improved collections on our past due balances. Throughout this quarter we accelerated our share buyback program, more than doubling the amount of shares repurchased compared to second quarter. We feel great about the future of Honeywell and believe in our next leg of transformation and will continue to opportunistically buy Honeywell shares at attractive valuations. Now let's spend a few minutes on the third quarter performance by business.\nAerospace sales for the third quarter were up 18% organically with double digit growth in both commercial aviation, and defense and space, the strongest growth quarter for Aero in over a decade. Commercial aviation growth was led by strength in the air transport aftermarket where increased flight activity globally continues to drive demand. Commercial original equipment also grew in the quarter on increased deliveries to both business and general aviation, and air transport customers. Defense and space sales inflected in 3Q growing 18% organically, and orders grew over 30% year over year for the second consecutive quarter. As we see the impact of increased global focus on national security come through while the Aerospace supply chain remains constrained, we are continuing to see modest sequential improvements which enabled us to increase our output and convert our record backlog into sales growth.\nFor example, this was the third consecutive quarter with a 20% year over year increase in original equipment and spare shipments. While these gains in output are encouraging and leading to sales acceleration, demand continues to outpace supply. This is evidenced by our Aerospace book-to-bill of around 1.3x in the third quarter. Segment margins in Aero were flat year over year as increased volume leverage, and commercial excellence offset cost inflation, and mix pressure in our original equipment. As expected.\nPerformance Materials and Technologies sales grew 3% organically in third quarter, led by HPS, which saw double digit growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. Process Solutions sales grew 11% organically, driven by continued strength in our projects business and lifecycle solutions and services. In UOP, sales grew 6% organically, led by gas processing solutions and petrochemical catalyst shipments. We continue to see robust demand in our sustainable technology solutions business within UOP as orders grew triple digits for the third consecutive quarter and sales grew at strong double digit rates. In advanced materials, sales decreased 8% organically, driven primarily due to the continued, expected, macro-driven softness in our electronics, chemicals, and life science businesses and challenging year-over-year comps.\nSequentially, segment margins expanded 40 basis points, while on a year-on-year basis, segment margins contracted 50 basis points to 22.1% as a result of lower volumes in Advanced Materials, Safety and Productivity Solutions. Sales decreased 25% organically in the quarter, primarily driven by lower volumes in warehouse and workflow solutions, and productivity solutions and services. The projects portion of our Intelligrated business is around trough levels in the current low investment warehouse automation environment, but our pipeline remains robust, and successful execution of our sales strategies resulted in double-digit year-over-year growth and over 50% sequential growth in orders in the third quarter. Additionally, the aftermarket services portion of the business continues to deliver solid double-digit sales growth in productivity solutions and services. We are working through the effects of distributor destocking but believe we are nearing the end of that cycle.\nSensing & Safety Technologies was also impacted by short-cycle softness, but this business continues to remain relatively resilient. Segment margin and SPS contracted 120 basis points to 14.5% as a result of volume deleverage partially offset by our continued operational improvements and commercial excellence.\nTurning to Honeywell Building Technologies, sales were flat year over year in the quarter. Our long-cycle building solutions business continues to outpace our short-cycle building products. Building solutions grew 4% organically, led by high single-digit growth in building projects driven by strong execution, particularly in energy projects. Orders for building projects were also substantial in the quarter, up nearly 20% year over year, and resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.2x. On the product side, sales decreased modestly as a result of relatively soft demand for security products. Segment profit remained a bright spot for the business, continuing to grow as a result of productivity actions and commercial excellence, all in HBT. Segment margin expanded 110 basis points to 25.2%.\nGrowth across the portfolio continues to be supported by accretive results in Honeywell Connected Enterprise, providing further evidence of Honeywell's strong software franchise across our businesses. Overall organic growth of approximately 20% in third quarter was supported by strength in Connected Industrial, Connected Buildings, Cybersecurity, and Connected Aircraft orders. Growth above 20% in the quarter remains a powerful indicator of the continued robust demand for HCE offerings.\nIn October we held the latest installment of Honeywell Connect where we conducted 29 technology demonstrations to a group of 200 customers. We launched three new products, featured several product enhancements, and showcased advanced intelligence solutions using AI and generative AI technology. One highlight from the event was the introduction of a suite of cybersecurity solutions including Honeywell Forge Cybersecurity+, Cyber Insights, and Cyber Watch, supported by the acquisition of SCADAfence in August, leading to new sales opportunities in as early as fourth quarter.\nOverall, this was a great result for Honeywell. Our operational execution enabled us to grow third quarter earnings per share to $2.27 up 1% year over year. On an adjusted basis, segment profit drove $0.15 of improvement in earnings per share. The main driver of our EPS growth, excluding the $0.14 pension headwind, EPS was $2.41 up 7% year over year. A bridge for adjusted EPS from 3Q 2022 to 3Q 2023 can be found in the appendix of this presentation with all the details. Finally, as Vimal mentioned earlier, we continue to leverage our healthy balance sheet, deploying $2 billion in the quarter, bringing the year to date total to $5.7 billion as we execute on our capital deployment strategy.\nSo overall, Honeywell's operating playbook continues to deliver strong results, and our best-in-class Honeywell value creation framework will enable us to drive compelling growth in earnings and cash for quarters to come. Now let's turn to slide 5 to discuss our fourth quarter and full year guidance.\nAt this stage in the year and given the incrementally more challenging macro backdrop with geopolitics and interest rate dynamics, we're narrowing our full year guidance ranges for sales and EPS while increasing the midpoints of our segment margin expectations. Our demand profile remains healthy with record backlog and favorable orders performance. While we continue to monitor the timing of short-cycle recovery, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments. For fourth quarter, we anticipate sales to be between $9.6 and 9.9 billion, up 3% to 7 organically, driven by continued strength in commercial aviation, Defense and Space, Process Solutions, and UOP. We anticipate organic sales growth in Aero, PMT, and HBT in fourth quarter.\nFor the full year, we're raising the low end of our previous sales guidance by $100 million and lowering the high end by $200 million for a new range of $36.8 to 37.1 billion, representing 4% to 5 organic growth for the year. This reflects continued solid execution in our long cycle business while we awaited demand acceleration in some of our short cycle businesses. Turning to segment margin, we anticipate the fourth quarter to be between 22.9% and 23.2, flat to up 30 basis points year over year and up sequentially as we continue to benefit from improving business mix and our productivity actions. For the full year, we are also raising the low end of our segment margin guidance by 10 basis points for a new range of 22.5% to 22.6, representing 80 to 90 basis points of year over year expansion.\nThis improvement is driven by HBT, SPS, and PMT which are all expected to expand margins. Now let me walk you through the expectations for each segment in a little bit more detail.\nLooking ahead for Aerospace, we're very pleased with the continued improvements in the Aero supply chain that are allowing us to capitalize on our record backlog. In 4Q, we anticipate another quarter of strong sales growth both year over year and sequentially in commercial aviation, defense, and space. In commercial aviation, we expect most of the sequential growth to come through increased Original Equipment volumes, though commercial aftermarket will also deliver healthy year over year growth with demand driven by continued improvement in air transport flight hours. In defense and space, we are coming off back-to-back quarters of +30% orders growth which has bolstered our already sizable backlog, and we see another quarter of double-digit growth to end the year.\nWith our growth momentum from third quarter carrying over into 4Q, we now expect Aerospace sales to be up mid-teens for the year, with much of the incremental sales in this upgrade coming from increased original equipment shipments. As we capture a greater installed base, we expect Aero margins to be flat to modestly down for the year.\nIn Performance Materials and Technologies. Our strong execution and the encouraging outlook in our end markets will continue to drive favorable growth for the fourth quarter. We expect our typical solid finish to the year leading to year-over-year and sequential sales growth. Growth will be led by Process Solutions on strength in projects and aftermarket services. In UOP, our growth outlook is supported by robust demand for petrochemical and refining catalysts. The sustainability technology solutions business will continue to grow as we capitalize on legislation-backed demand. For advanced materials, we expect continued demand for fluorine products, a rebound in life sciences end markets, and an improvement in our electronics and chemicals business. Supportive of sequential growth.\nFor the full year, we continue to expect high single-digit sales growth in PMT due to typical catalyst seasonality. We still expect meaningful sequential and year-over-year margin expansion in fourth quarter resulting in modest segment margin expansion for the year for PMT.\nIn Safety and Productivity Solutions. Our outlook continues to be impacted by the current low levels of investment in new warehouse capacity and distributor destocking. However, the impact on our financials is declining, creating stabilization and signs of potential return to growth in the coming quarters. For the fourth quarter, we expect these effects to lead to sales that are roughly flat sequentially, down organically but to a lesser degree than earlier in the year. Orders will grow sequentially and year over year in the fourth quarter as we build on momentum from this quarter. While new warehouse investment remains challenged, customers continue to upgrade their existing infrastructure which will lead to another quarter of double-digit growth for the aftermarket services portion of our Intelligrated business.\nFor the full year, we now expect sales to be down approximately 20% as the SPS's portfolio bounces along the bottom of the cycle. However, the productivity actions and operational improvements we have made this year will still enable us to expand margins solidly for the year. In Building Technologies, we were prudent with our posture at the start of the year as we face unprecedented central bank tightening cycle and uncertain demand environment. While the operating backdrop remains difficult, we are encouraged by the sequential orders progression we saw each month throughout Q3, including double-digit product orders growth in the month of September.\nFor the fourth quarter, we expect modest sequential sales improvement from our Q2 and Q3 levels with growth continuing to be led by our long-cycle Building Solutions business. The supply chain is improving each quarter and we expect to make further progress on converting our past due backlog into sales.\nWe're also encouraged by the resiliency we are seeing in verticals such as airports, government, and education, and expect institutional demand to provide support amid commercial softness. We project HBT sales to be up low single digits for the year, with commercial and operational excellence enabling HBT to be our largest margin expander in 2023. Now moving on to our other key guidance metrics, we anticipate net below the line impact to be between negative $105 million and negative $155 million in fourth quarter and between negative $525 million and negative $575 million for the full year. This guidance includes a range of repositioning between $45 million and $85 million in fourth quarter and between $260 million and $300 million for the full year as we continue to invest in high return projects to support our future growth and productivity.\nWe expect the adjusted effective tax rate to be around 19% in the fourth quarter and around 21% for the full year, unchanged from our previous guidance. We anticipate average share count to be around 664 million shares in the fourth quarter, around 669 million shares for the full year as we continue to reduce our share count through opportunistic buybacks. As a result of these inputs, we anticipate adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.53 and $2.63 for the fourth quarter, flat to up 4% year over year, excluding pension headwinds. Fourth quarter EPS growth would be up 6% to 10 for the full year.\nWe are narrowing both ends of our EPS guidance ranges by $0.05 for a new range of $9.10 to 9.20, up 4% to 5 year over year. Holding the midpoint of our prior guide excluding pension headwinds, EPS growth would be up 10% to 11 for the year. On cash. We continue to expect to meet our original free cash flow guidance of $3.9 to 4.3 billion in 2023 or $5.1 to 5.5 billion excluding the net impact of settlements driven by stronger collections and inventory management. Higher cash tax outlays in third quarter will be offset by more favorable cash outlook in fourth quarter, giving us confidence in our full year guidance.\nTo summarize, we're narrowing our full year guidance ranges for sales and EPS while raising the midpoint of our segment margin expectations based on our confidence and the ability to successfully deliver results in a fluid operating environment. Before turning back to Vimal, let's turn to the next page and discuss our preliminary thoughts for 2024.\nWhile next year's environment is shaping up to be just as volatile as the last few years. Our proven track record of navigating an uncertain macro backdrop should give investors confidence in our ability to execute on our commitments. We have a unique set of operating principles that enable us to move quickly and decisively to drive growth, protect margins, ensure liquidity, and position ourselves well to deliver in any environment. Our end market exposures remain favorable into 2024, particularly in Aerospace and Energy. We expect continued commercial aviation fleet growth and replenishment, increased domestic and international defense investment amid geopolitical uncertainty, heightened focus on automation due to labor scarcity, increased energy demands and intensifying decarbonization goals accelerating the need for technologies enabling the energy transition, and increased infrastructure spending.\nAll of these compelling vertical tailwinds as well as ongoing customer demand to help enable digitalization give us confidence that all four of our reconstituted businesses will deliver growth next year. The timing of an eventual recovery and short cycle is less certain and will be a swing variable to our sales outcome. We have a strong setup that will drive growth in sales, margin, and earnings in 2024. Within our long-term financial framework. We expect organic growth to be led by our long-cycle businesses due to record-level demand and backlog in 2023.\nAdditionally, our focus on new product innovation is yielding benefits. We believe extending our success in delivering new solutions to our existing vast installed base, as well as the commercial efforts driving greater penetration of our current set of technologies to new markets, will help enable robust organic growth. That, coupled with our ongoing leadership in high-growth regions and the strength of our software franchise, gives us confidence in the top line. We also expect supply chain to continue to improve gradually in Aero throughout next year. For overall Honeywell, 2024 margins will benefit from improving business mix. Continued benefits from price, costs, and productivity actions, including our precision focus on reducing raw material costs, as well as implementing AI into our development and production.\nWe will continue our investments in R&D and growth-oriented capital expenditures and remain keenly focused on creating uniquely innovative, differentiated, recession-proof technologies to address the world's toughest automation, digitalization, and sustainability challenges. While we expect our spend on repositioning to be relatively stable year over year in 2024, we also anticipate modestly higher interest expense and lower pension income next year, both driven by the acceleration in yields across the bond markets we have seen since this summer. That will lead to slightly higher net below the line expense.\nWe will provide more information about the year over year magnitude of these changes at year end when we snap the line on pension, but we anticipate they'll be more in line with normal historical changes, not last year's outsized impacts. As a reminder, pension income is a non-cash item given our overfunded pension status and will ensure no incremental contributions are needed. This is a great position to be in for our employees, both former and current, and our shareholders.\nWe expect our cash to grow in line or above earnings next year, with improvement assisted by the absence of the one-time settlement from derisking our balance sheet earlier this year, which had an outsized effect on our cash performance. We're also embarking on a multi-year unwind of the last two years of working capital buildup. We will continue benefiting from improved demand planning and optimize production and materials management using our enhanced end-to-end process and visualization capabilities through Accelerator. We see several compelling growth capital opportunities and expect to fund high-return projects through disciplined CapEx spending in the coming years.\nOur balance sheet strength will continue to give us meaningful capacity for M&A, and we expect an ongoing favorable deal environment going into 2024, which supports our intention to accelerate capital deployment. Now, I'm going to pass the call over to Vimal to say a few words about the announcement we made earlier this month on our portfolio and strategic priorities. Over to you, Vimal.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nThanks Greg. Two weeks ago we announced a portfolio reorganization that aligns our business with distinct, compelling megatrends that are shaping the future of our industries and our planet. These are automation, the future of aviation, and energy transition, and all are underpinned by our robust capabilities in digitalization. This realignment will enable us to have a simpler, clearer strategic focus and clearly define Honeywell's value proposition for our customers, investors, and employees. We are an automation, aerospace, and sustainability focused technology company. We believe this change will empower our business leaders to better prioritize R&D efforts, capital expenditures, M&A pipeline, go-to-market strategies, and more. It will also create a more focused framework for M&A, allowing us to pursue bolt-on acquisitions and select divestitures that align to our themes and enhance our portfolio.\nOverall, we have demonstrated the ability to operate under dynamic circumstances including a global pandemic, large scale supply chain disruptions, heightened inflation, international trade disputes, unprecedented central bank tightening, and geopolitical tensions underpinned by the strength of our differentiated accelerator operating system. We are confident that we can deliver strong financial performance in 2024. We will provide more specific inputs in our annual outlook calls once we close out the year. Now let's turn to slide 7 and I will close with some long-term comments. Let's take a minute to zoom out from the quarterly result. As a reminder, my priorities as CEO are first, simplify the portfolio to better align with the key megatrend that I mentioned earlier. Next, I will drive accelerated organic growth by strengthening our innovation playbook, growing our sustainability and digitalization offerings, and maintaining our leadership position in high-growth regions.\nOn top of those organic growth efforts, I will manage the portfolio of enhancing our M&A capability, including staying disciplined and executing on bolt-on M&A aligned to these three megatrends. I also plan to advance the Honeywell Accelerator to create more value through business model optimization. We continue to make progress on our long-term growth algorithm that we discussed during our May Investor Day. Our 2023 guidance represents another year of strong financial performance consistent with our framework following meaningful progress since 2017 through some very turbulent times. We'll continue to carefully track our progression towards achieving our targets and remain confident in our ability to accelerate growth, expand gross margin to above 40%, achieve +25% segment margins, and generate free cash flow margins of mid-teens plus.\nI'm thrilled to lead Honeywell into the next phase of our transformation, and I'm optimistic about the tremendous opportunities we are uncovering to capture value, drive incremental sales growth, expand margins, and generate more cash, and we'll continue to update you as these efforts increasingly translate into enhanced financial performance. Now let's turn to the slide 8 for closing thoughts before we move into the Q&A.\nWe delivered on all commitments in third quarter. We have and will continue to demonstrate resiliency while managing through a dynamic macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop. Overall demand generation remains strong, particularly in the long cycle. Businesses with orders up double digit year over year and record backlog levels will continue to support strong results while we navigate an external environment that remains challenging for the short cycle. Our portfolio is aligned to powerful megatrends including automation, the future of aviation, and energy transition, all underpinned by digitalization. Our technologically differentiated portfolio of solutions and our world class Honeywell Accelerator operating system will enable us to capitalize on these trends and drive the profitable growth we outlined in our long term financial framework. We're expecting a strong finish to 2023 and well positioned for further growth in 2024.\nWe look forward to updating you on the progress as we execute on our commitments. With that, Sean, let's move to Q&A.\n\nSean Meakim\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance, Honeywell\n\nVimal and Greg are now available to answer your questions. We ask that you please be mindful of others in the queue by only asking one question. Operator, please open the line for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder to ask a question, you will need to press star one on your telephone to remove yourself from the question queue. Press star one again. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning. Maybe.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nMaybe. Just wanted to start off with a question on the fourth quarter\nmargin outlook. I think you're looking at about 40 bps of margin uplift sequentially, 30% operating leverage sequentially. It looks like PMT perhaps is the segment where you're expecting a very big margin uplift. So, just wondered if you could go into a little bit more detail around that the margins have been down year on year. We're all here. There. Just maybe help us understand what's really changing a lot in the fourth quarter to get that moving. And then just as a very quick follow-up, HBT cross-currents. This year you've got a low base as we think about 2024, but the interest rate environment is negative. So just confidence in HBT's growth ability looking out. Thank you.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nHey, Julian. I'll take the first one, and I'll pitch it to Vimal for number two. So overall, we've had a great year in margin expansion for Honeywell, and again we're looking to finish the year at the high end of our guidance range as you've seen. I think we've continued to demonstrate our ability to drive margin expansion in any environment. And as we look into Q4, as you said, we see a nice sequential improvement from Q3 to Q4 and some healthy margin expansion there as well. In PMT we talk about it often. The margin tends to be somewhat lumpy from any one quarter to the next. A big part of that, of course, is where catalyst shipments wind up, you know, in, during the course of the year and in which end market.\nAnd so as we go into Q4 for PMT, you know, we have a pretty healthy UOP mix for sure, and we're seeing also some recovery from some of the challenges that we've had earlier in the year with operations in 'em. So you know that's really the underlying, you know, the underlying theme for Q4. But we think the teams have done a great job, and PMT is on track also to have a very nice year overall with high single digit top line growth and some modest margin expansion. We're pretty pleased with where we are going with that, and maybe Vimal hand it to you on the HBT.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nSo, Julian, on HBT, I would say I'll spend a minute to kind of first go back to what our business model is before I kind of answer your question. I think there are three parts of our HBT business model. First, it is 60% product, 40% solution, and within 40% solution, more than half is aftermarket. So by virtue of the mix, it's a short-cycle oriented business. The second point is the products we have. They are critical to the buildings, and that's why they are higher margin. And that explains our constant margin improvement in the segment. And finally, our exposure in buildings is a combination of real estate but also infrastructure. And all that put together explains our results of 2022, where we grew double-digit, and this year will grow low single-digit. To your question of 2024, we remain confident HBT will grow for our guidance.\nYou know our backlog is growing in our solution business, and of course the swing factor remains here, the short cycle position.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JP Morgan.\n\nStephen Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHey guys, good morning.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning Steve.\n\nStephen Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nSo some cross currents here at SPS. I mean it's now down to, you know, like 10% of your profits. Things seem to be bottoming there. But does the timing of those shipments can that business grow next year, or should we kind of prepared for another down year there? Maybe if you could just like lay out the expectations there for SPS.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nAnd sir, you're right, SPS is coming out of the bullpen effect of COVID, and clearly that reflects in our Q3 numbers. But as we mentioned in our earlier conversation, the SPS orders in Q3; we had a book-to-bill of 1x, and we see similar trends continuing in Q4, which means we are in a recovery cycle in this business moving forward starting Q4, and we'll see that in 2024. Margin expansion will certainly help there because the volumes growth will help in margin expansion. We have rebaselined our cost base aligned to the new revenue scale. So overall, we should see recovery from this point onwards.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nOkay, so that's a growth business with some nice leverage next year, is what you're saying.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nI think Steve, the overall top line growth could be flattish next year. But as Vimal said, particularly as the short-cycle accelerates, there's a lot of leverage in those short-cycle businesses in particular. We absolutely will do that, expect to see that come through. And again on the Intelligrated side, with the aftermarket growing far greater than the projects business, we should see some nice mix in that business as well. So the timing of that acceleration as you've said overall still is something that we're waiting to see happen. But we've flattened out, bottomed out the orders rate. So it should be coming anytime now, and when it does, a lot of leverage comes along with it.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Scott Davis of Melius Research.\n\nScott Davis\n\nCEO & Chairman, Melius Research\n\nHey, good morning, guys.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning, Todd.\n\nScott Davis\n\nCEO & Chairman, Melius Research\n\nHey. The world is kind of changing and volatile. China seems like it's taken another step down. But can you guys walk us around the world and what you're seeing from a geographic mix perspective and just a little bit of color on how things maybe change through the quarter or, or into 4Q from that front as well? And that'll be my question. I'll pass it on after that. Thanks.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nOkay, thanks, Scott. I would say you're absolutely right, Scott. There is a lot of variation in how things are working in the world at this point. Let me start with China. We are going to have high single digit growth in China this year. It's primarily supported by growth in Europe, but also in some other businesses too. We see China to be a similar trend, mid single digit to high single digit, in 2024. We have enough backlog and strength in Aero to support that in other parts of the world. I would say we see a lot of strength in Asia, in particular India, ASEAN countries, and Middle East, also given our strong position in energy positions us pretty well. And then Europe and US probably we all see the impact of high interest rate and challenging environment. So probably we are experiencing the same here.\nThe good balance of positive and negative. But one thing I'd like to add there is, as we see our backlog which grew by 8%, we also see good orders position forecasted for quarter four. It's going to position us pretty well for 2024 ahead in spite of the challenging condition because we do expect our long-cycle businesses are going to help to drive in our, you know, the forecasted range of revenue growth for 2024.\n\nScott Davis\n\nCEO & Chairman, Melius Research\n\nThank you guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe, your line is open. Please proceed.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nYes, sorry about that. I had my mute button on. Sorry about that. Thanks for the question. Greg, I don't want to put kind of words in your mouth, but I think I heard DC in 2024 as sort of within the long-term framework of four to 750 basis points of OM. Is that sort of what you meant. Based on what you see today? I understand a lot of macro noise out there, and if I could just clarify, you know, the free cash flow growing in line with earnings, whatever that may be. Should we add back the one-timer this year as the base and then grow from there? Because obviously, you know, $1.2 billion is a big number and any thoughts on? The pension headwind would be helpful as well.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nSure, sure, yes. So again, it's way too early for guidance. Of course we'll do that specifically, you know, in 90 days or so when we announce our full-year earnings. So the comments we've been giving is that we see things within that long-term framework. That's a reasonably good barometer for how we're seeing things at the moment. But again, 90 days from now we'll know a lot more in terms of the free cash flow. You're exactly right. We have $1.2 billion of settlements. That's obviously not going to happen again next year. So that's immediate add back to the base and then from there we expect to see free cash grow in line or maybe better with earnings.\nThe margin around that is really a matter of we expect to start seeing the liquidation of our working capital, but we also have a very robust set of growth projects on capital. We're going to be going through our budgeting process here over the course of the fourth quarter, and we may have some good things to put forth from a CapEx standpoint next year. But we feel really good about the progress that we're making in cash flow again this quarter. Very nice cash flow number, 100% conversion, 17% cash margin. So made some nice progress. One other kind of good anecdotal point, we've started to see Arrow bring their days of supply down in inventory.\nWhile the number in the aggregate has gone up, they're obviously growing the business in the high teens, but we are starting to see the efficiency and inventory show up. So that's really how we're thinking about it at this stage for next year. But we'll know a lot more in 90 days and be a bit more precise. And then on pension, could it be $50 or 100 million worse? We'll see rates move around a lot, as you know. And as I mentioned in my comments, we snapped the line at the end of the year, but it's trending to be lower income next year, but obviously nowhere near the kind of shock that we had in the 2023 change.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Multi-Industry Senior Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYes, good morning.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Multi-Industry Senior Analyst, Bank of America",
    "content3": "Yeah, just a question on advanced materials I think was a little bit weaker than we expected. I think you said softness in electronics, chems, and lifecycle drove the declines. I think last quarter you highlighted electronics and chemicals. Just, you know, want to understand what the changes are because I think before you were saying that electronic materials should improve in second half. Just right. I know it's a high margin business. Just what has changed, and how does the business look into year, and then maybe what kind of momentum you have until next year. Thanks so much.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nYeah, thanks Andrew. Look, I would say in AM the fluorine products. The business of Solstice is doing extremely well. Continues to grow as its applications keep growing, its geographic spread keeps growing. So that. That's very positive. Electronic materials have definitely bottomed out. We have, we have seen signaling of recovery from the chip fab manufacturers and part of that is seen in Q4. Not as good as you like it to see, but we are seeing signals of recovery in the electronic side, and there are parts of chemicals which are weak, which is reflected in our overall revenue. Like any other short-cycle, we expect it to recover aligned with the economic conditions there. But, but I must say that our, our conviction in the business is very strong.\nWe had outstanding years in 2021 and 2022, and this year should be seen in comps to the past two years.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nHey, good morning everyone. Thank you. [crosstalk] Hi, I wanted to ask about Aerospace please. And specifically defense and space. Great growth in the quarter, up 18%. What are you seeing from a bookings perspective there? The sustainability of demand with everything going on. And how does defense factor into Aero margin mix? Thank you.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nThanks, Sheila. I mean, I think one of our headlines for our Q3 has been Aero, and within that, defense and space. Our bookings continue to be strong. Q3 was a strong booking quarter, so was Q2. That's driven by not only the US domestic bookings but also international defense markets opening up. We clearly see that reflecting in our booking rates. The revenue growth is driven by supply chain actions, which are now being seen in defense also. We expect the continued growth in the defense segment in quarter four and 2024 ahead too. So, the punchline is that defense is going to become a contributing factor in the continued Aero growth, given the overall geopolitical conditions in the world.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nOn Aerospace margins as it relates to defense and space, it's not a material drag on our margins. So that growth there is going to be, you know, not materially different than the overall margin rate. We find that to be that growth to be quite nice to segment profit growth.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research.\n\nJeffrey T. Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nHey, thank you. Good morning, everyone.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning, Jeff.\n\nJeffrey T. Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nGood morning. Hey, not to get too tied up in arcane pension accounting, but did you guys change something, you know, in pension to mitigate, you know, the impact interest rate changes? Certainly nice to hear the headwind is, you know, that modest. But my rough math would have maybe suggested a bit more. And then maybe just to add another part, Vimal, you touched on advanced materials a little bit in a previous answer. But can you give us a little? Bit of color on how you see the 410A, the 454B transition unfolding, what's happening to, you know, 410A prices and availability, and you know, where you stand competitively as these OEMs are making the shift? Thank you.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nSo maybe I'll hit the pension one first. So no, you know, Jeff, we haven't changed anything in our accounting. You know, we'll do our normal mark to market in the fourth quarter as we've done, you know, for many years now. And again, you know, what I mentioned, you know, $50 to 100 million is a range. We'll see how the final numbers pan out with discount rates and returns on assets for the asset bases themselves. So nothing different. And we'll give you a more precise answer after the turn of the year when we snap the line.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nJeff, on advanced material, I would say it's pretty fascinating to see how this changeover is happening between Solstice 410A and 454B. We are working with all key OEMs for several years. This is not a new dimension for us. We have been on it for last several years, and we see the switchover happening from 410A to 454B in the times ahead. We have secured our position with the key OEMs. I would say for us, I would call it like business as usual because this is something which is part of our business, and we were ahead of the game here to look ahead and think about its implication on us. We are well covered on that.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank.\n\nNicole DeBlase\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah, thanks. Good morning, guys.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nHey, Nicole.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nNicole, good morning.\n\nNicole DeBlase\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nCan we double click a little bit on what you guys are seeing with respect to channel inventory reductions within HPC and SPS? Where are we in that inventory destocking process? And do you think we will enter 2024 in a pretty clean position with respect to channel inventories.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nNicole. We have, I would say the channel inventory is reflected in our orders rate. Our orders rate for both buildings and SPS had a book-to-bill of 1x last quarter, and the similar trends are persisting so far in October, which tells me that we are on a path of slight recovery and. That's the indirect measure for me on channels are looking at stocking back again from the cycle. We expect short cycle to slightly recover progressively every month moving forward but not as fast as we'd like it to be at this point.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Thank you.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGood morning everyone.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHey, on HBT you called out cost inflation, headwinds. Could you size that and what kind of pricing actions have you taken? And then on the verticals, airport, government, and education, how has government stimulus? Has that started to come through, and are you benefiting there? Thanks.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nHey Dean, we don't disclose our individual segments, you know, price, price cost. But if you recall, I mean we've, we've mentioned that we're going to retain our price cost positivity and we've done that inside of HBT, you know, throughout the course of the year. So you know you see the numbers for total Honeywell, you know I think we're within our, within our zone that we had guided from a pricing perspective. It's probably going to be you know, 4% for the year across the total portfolio. Maybe I'll pass it to Vimal on the other side.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nWe do get, I would say, benefit of different government stimulus programs. The recent one being around, I would say, CHIPS Act semiconductor activity in the US; the proposal activity there is strong, and hopefully we'll win enough to see the benefit of that in the times ahead. But I must also point that we also see heightened infrastructure activity outside the US, specifically in high growth regions. One of the strength of HBT business is very strong footprint in high growth regions: China, ASEAN, Middle East, India, etc. And there the activity on infrastructure built out is pretty strong, which is going to help us in building out our backlog specifically in long-cycle. So that's how we see those dimensions in the business.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks. Good morning everyone.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nHey Joe.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning Joe.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey guys. My one question is just on orders, so you know, nice to see the inflection versus what you'd experienced last quarter. I think Aero was the only segment that grew last quarter. I didn't hear the commentary on PMT. So if I missed it, my apologies. But what were orders like in PMT this quarter, and maybe specifically for HPS and UOP?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. So year to date, I would say the orders rate in UOP and HPS are pretty strong, and we expect to finish very strongly for both the businesses in 2023 and carry forward good backlog for 2024. The wins are, you know, driven by multiple end markets in HPS. And UOP is certainly benefiting from strong demand of catalyst, but also now strong demand coming from sustainable technologies. Our sustainable technology business is growing at triple-digit rate as we had anticipated, and all that is really adding up for strong performance of UOP for 2023 orders.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citigroup.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nHey, good morning everyone.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning, Andrew.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nSo I know you're expecting a nice uptick in PMT margin in Q4, but as you've guided this year, PMT margins tended to be a bit muted for the year. So maybe conviction level that it does jump in Q4 and then I know you're moving HPS over, but pro forma, do you see PMT is one of the better margin performers in 2024?\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nSo in terms of conviction level, it's high. I mean, I feel pretty strongly about the PMT team's ability to perform. You know, here again, we're not at a place where we're giving guidance ranges for next year for any given segments. I expect the PMT business as currently constructed. You know, we expect accretion next year as well, but we're not going to get into any specific guidance ranges around that at this moment. But our conviction level is high. The team is delivering. They've taken all the right actions in each of the three businesses. And as we said, with a nice mix going into Q4 on catalysts, we expect to be able to deliver the margin accretion in Q4.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Vimal Kapur for closing remarks. Thank you.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nOur value creation framework is working, while the macro economy remains challenging and the timing of a short-cycle acceleration is uncertain. We are deploying our rigorous operating playbook to navigate near-term volatility. We are confident in our ability to weather near-term challenges and meet our performance target, underpinned by ongoing strength in our two biggest end markets, Aerospace and energy, combined with the operating rigor you have expected from Honeywell. Thank you all, and our Honeywell colleagues who continue to enable us to outperform in any environment and drive differentiated performance for our customers and shareholders. Thank you all for listening, and please stay safe and healthy.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to Sean Meakim, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go.\nAhead.\n\nSean Meakim\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Honeywell\n\nThank you. Liz: Good morning and welcome to Honeywell's Q2 2023 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with me today are Chief Executive Officer Vimal Kapur, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Greg Lewis, and Senior Vice President and General Counsel Anne Madden. This webcast and the presentation materials, including non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our Investor Relations website. From time to time, we will post new information that may be of interest or material to our investors on this website.\nOur discussion today includes forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the ones described in our SEC filings.\nThis morning we will review our financial results for Q2, share our guidance for Q3, and provide an update to our full year 2023 outlook. As always, we'll leave time for your questions at the end. With that, I'll turn the call over to the CEO, then we'll come forward.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on slide two. The Q2 was another strong one for Honeywell. We met or exceeded our commitments as our rigorous operating principles enable us to navigate a challenging backdrop. We grew adjusted earnings per share 6% year-over-year to $2.23 or up 13% excluding a $0.15 non-cash pension headwind. Q2 organic sales were up 3% year-over-year led by double-digit growth in commercial Aerospace, Process Solutions, and UOP.\nOur Aerospace business continues to perform at very high levels. The Q2 backlog grew to a new record of $30.5 billion, up 4% year-over-year and 1% sequentially due to strength in Aero, PMT, and HBT.\nSimilar to last quarter, orders continue to grow double-digit organically in Aero. For other segments, unfavorable comparison to last year's peak supply chain disruption led to a single-digit decline in orders for overall Honeywell. We remain confident in our 2023 outlook as recovering end markets and operational excellence continue to deliver resilient results despite macroeconomic uncertainty. Our segment margin expanded 150 basis points year-over-year, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by 20 basis points, led by expansion in SPS, HBT, and Aero.\nOur continued focus on commercial excellence and greater gains from productivity enabled us to remain ahead of our inflation curve. Free cash flow was $1.1 billion in Q2, up 34% year-over-year driven by strong net income and improved working capital in line with our expectations.\nGreg will walk you through the free cash flow drivers in more detail in a few minutes. We deployed $2.1 billion to dividends, M&A, share repurchases, and growth CapEx, including opportunistically repurchasing 2.4 million shares throughout the quarter, reducing our weighted average share count to 670 million. I'm pleased with the progress we made this quarter on our portfolio-shaping priorities. We invested in multiple new technologies utilizing our robust M&A playbook, including completing the acquisition of Compressor Controls Corporation for approximately $700 million.\nAs always, we continue to execute on our proven value creation framework, which is underpinned by the Accelerator Operating System. The operating system, along with ongoing growth in our key end markets and technologically differentiated portfolio of solutions, is enabling us to navigate a challenging economic backdrop and deliver on our commitment again this quarter.\nLooking forward, I'm encouraged by the strength we are seeing in our long cycle Aero and energy verticals and remain confident in our position to outperform. Next, let's turn to slide three to discuss the important leadership announcement. Last month we announced that Jim Currier will be succeeding Mike Madsen as Honeywell Aerospace CEO. I want to congratulate Mike Madsen on his retirement and extend my sincere gratitude. For 37 years he has given to Honeywell.\nMike has been extremely effective leader and change agent in our company and the Aero industry. He has a rich history of exceeding expectations as Aerospace won an unprecedented $35 billion in new business in these last two years. His leadership and commitment to customers, employees, and the community is unparalleled.\nDuring his tenure as Aero CEO, Mike navigated the business to unprecedented pandemic disruptions while growing the top line, expanding margins by over 200 basis points. Because of Mike's passion and dedication to the business, he helped set up Honeywell Aerospace to be even more successful in the years to come. We're excited about the next phase of growth in Honeywell's Aero business under Jim Currier's leadership. We are fortunate to have someone with this level of experience and tenure ready to take the helm, a true testament to Honeywell's bench strength and focus on succession planning.\nJim has been with Honeywell's Aero for 17 years and prior to his current position he had held multiple roles of increasing responsibility across function and geography, most recently as President of our Electronic Solutions business.\nThe medium-term setup for Aero is the strongest it has ever been. Flight hours continue to be strong, including wide-body upside, which is now underway. We have diverse and optimized platform exposure, particularly in business aviation. In fact, over the last few months alone, we have won $3 billion in business to provide OEMs and airlines with our engines, wheels & brakes, APUs, and flight management system along with associated aftermarket services. In addition, supply chains are gradually improving, and we have returned to growth in Defense & Space. This momentum points to a robust multi-year trajectory for the largest businesses in Honeywell portfolio.\nLet's turn to slide four to discuss our recent corporate development activity. I'm excited about our recent capital deployment announcement, closing on our previously announced Compressor Controls Corporation acquisition, and adding two strategic assets that will drive enhanced innovation and strengthen our technology portfolio.\nThis mix really exemplifies the type of deals that we look to generate on a consistent basis. Last month we closed our acquisition of CCC, a leading provider of turbomachinery control and optimization solutions, deploying approximately $700 million in all-cash transactions. CCC technologies, including control hardware, software, and services, foster Honeywell's high-growth, sustainability, and digitization portfolio with new carbon capture control solutions. CCC integrates seamlessly into our process control Process Solutions business and provides meaningful revenue synergy potential with Honeywell Forge.\nWe are excited to extend Honeywell's leadership in automation and help customers accelerate their energy transition. With the completion of this acquisition, we also acquired SCADAfence, an Israel-based company that delivers operational technology, or OT, and Internet of Things, or IoT, cybersecurity solutions for monitoring large-scale network.\nSCADAfence brings proven technologies in asset discovery, threat detection, and security governance which are key to industrial and critical infrastructure cybersecurity program into our SCE portfolio. The OT cybersecurity industry is expected to grow to greater than $10 billion in next several years and the SCADAfence portfolio pair seamlessly with Honeywell's Cybersecurity business, providing an end-to-end enterprise solution that helps customers enhance enterprise resilience. In addition, we signed an agreement with Saab to acquire its heads-up-display or HUD asset.\nBoasting Honeywell's comprehensive end-to-end avionics and safety offering, we'll partner with Saab to develop and strengthen the HUD product line which enables pilots increased situation awareness, specifically at night or in difficult weather conditions.\nImportantly, the HUDs will be integrated into Honeywell Anthem, our revolutionary integrated flight deck with an intuitive user interface and highly scalable design, in addition to Honeywell's Primus Epic flight deck and retrofit solutions. I'm excited about our new technologies and adjacencies we have unlocked through our recent M&A activity, as we said before, and we have an active and robust pipeline, and this is further evidence that we are continuously enhancing our portfolio by investing in new opportunities.\nWe look forward to continuing to deploy our capital in coming quarters to create more value for Honeywell shareholders. Now let me turn it over to Greg on slide five to discuss our Q2 results in more detail as well as provide our views on guidance.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nThank you, Vimal, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another strong quarter in a very challenging operating environment. Q2 sales grew 3% organically, led by double-digit organic sales growth in commercial Aerospace, Process Solutions, and UOP, where demand strength continues to support Honeywell's short-term and long-term outlook. PMT grew at a robust 7% pace after four consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. Our long-cycle warehouse automation business is around trough levels as expected, which led to overall volume decline of 1% for the quarter.\nHowever, excluding SPS's volumes, were up 5% across the remainder of the portfolio. Our backlog remains at a record level, ending Q2 at $30.5 billion, up 4% year-over-year, driven by strength in Aero and PMT. Supply chain constraints continue to moderate our overall growth rate.\nHowever, we continue to record sequential improvements in Aero output as expected and are reducing our past due backlog across our short cycle businesses. Our investments in Honeywell Digital have continued to yield commercial and operating benefits through surgical pricing actions, enabling us to expand segment margin by 150 basis points year-over-year to 22.4% and exceed the high end of our guidance by 20 basis points. Three out of four segments expanded margins in the quarter, each by more than 100 basis points, with SPS leading the way as expected. On cash, we generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow up 34% year-over-year.\nThis increase was driven by stronger net income, as well as improved working capital performance with higher collections and good progress on inventory, where we have improved our demand planning and optimized our production and materials management using our improved end-to-end process and digitalization capabilities. Now let's spend a few minutes on the Q2 performance by business.\nAerospace sales for Q2 were up 16% organically, led by over 20% growth in commercial aviation. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit Aerospace organic sales growth and over two years of double-digit growth for commercial aviation supported by strong recovery in both flight hours and higher shipset deliveries. Growth remained strongest in commercial aviation aftermarket, up over 25%, led by over 30% growth in air transport, as increased flight hours resulted in higher spare shipments and repair and overhaul activity. Commercial original equipment sales also increased double digits, driven by increased build rates.\nDefense & Space grew for the second consecutive quarter as we were able to execute on our strong backlog and increase our sales volumes. The Aero supply chain continued to make progressive improvements as better material availability enabled 20% year-over-year growth in original equipment and spare shipments.\nAgain in Q2. Historically high past due backlog increased again in the quarter as orders growth outpaced our backlog burn down. Segment margin Aerospace expanded 120 basis points year-over-year to 27.7% due to commercial excellence and higher volume leverage, partially offset by cost inflation. Performance Materials and Technologies sales grew 7% organically in the Q2 with double digit growth for the third consecutive quarter in both HPS and UOP. Process Solutions sales grew 11% organically driven by strength in our projects business and in life cycle solutions and services.\nIn UOP, sales also grew 11% organically led by gas processing and refining catalyst shipments. Sustainable Technology Solutions within UOP had another standout quarter in Q2 with strong triple digit orders growth and over 30% sales growth in Advanced Materials.\nContinued demand for Fluorine Products portfolio was offset by expected macro-driven softness in our Electronics and Chemicals business, leading to flat organic growth despite challenging year-over-year comps. Segment margin contracted 60 basis points to 21.7% as favorable price cost was more than offset by challenges in Advanced Materials, including lower volumes and the previously communicated disruption in one of our plants.\nSafety and Productivity Solutions sales decreased 21% organically in the quarter. Sales declines are primarily driven by Warehouse and Workflow Solutions, and Productivity Solutions, and Services. While the project portion of our Intelligrated business is around trough levels and the current low investment warehouse automation environment, the aftermarket services portion of the business continues to deliver solid double-digit growth. Sensing and Safety Technologies was flattish in the quarter with ongoing strength in our industrial sensing product portfolio offset by modestly lower volumes and safety.\nSegment margin performance for SPS once again led Honeywell expanding 410 basis points to 16.7% as a result of productivity actions and commercial excellence partially offset by lower volume leverage and cost inflation.\nHoneywell Building Technologies sales were flat year-over-year on an organic basis in Q2. Building Solutions sales grew 2% organically despite expected year-over-year order softness as we continue to execute on our robust backlog with organic growth in our services business and no change year-over-year in projects. Turning to our products portfolio, we continue to see sequential improvements in the supply chain environment and we're burning down our past-due backlog.\nAs expected, Building Products sales decreased 1% organically as continued growth in our world-class fire products business was offset by declines in access, security, and building management systems. Our continued commercial excellence and productivity actions have allowed us to once again mitigate the effects of elevated inflation, expanding HBT segment margin by 200 basis points to 25.5%.\nHoneywell Connected Enterprise's strong software franchise continues to be accretive to overall Honeywell and a powerful differentiator. Overall double-digit organic growth was supported by strength in cyber, industrial, aircraft, and buildings. Double-digit orders growth in the quarter is supportive of continued strong performance for HCE.\nOverall this was a great result for Honeywell. Our operational efforts enabled us to grow Q2 GAAP earnings per share 21% year-over-year to $2.22 and adjusted earnings per share 6% year-over-year to $2.23 despite a $0.15 headwind from lower non-cash income from our overfunded pension. From a year-over-year perspective, segment profit drove $0.21 of the improvement in earnings, the main driver of our EPS growth. A lower adjusted effective tax rate contributed $0.06 of improvement, and reduced share count added an additional $0.05.\nExcluding the pension headwind, below the line and other created a $0.04 year-over-year headwind due to higher net interest expense, for a total EPS excluding the pension impact of $2.38, up 13% year-over-year. A bridge for adjusted EPS from Q2 2022 to Q2 2023 can be found in the appendix of this presentation.\nFinally, as Vimal mentioned earlier, we continue to leverage our strong balance sheet, deploying $2.1 billion in the quarter, bringing the year to date total to $3.7 billion, as we execute on our capital deployment strategy with meaningful portfolio updates. So overall, disciplined adherence to our best-in-class Honeywell value creation framework provided us with the operational agility to meet or exceed our guided financial metrics. Now let's turn to slide six to discuss our Q3 and full year outlook.\nWhile a number of challenges persist in the current environment, our rigorous operating principles and enable us to increase our guided metrics for the full year. Our demand profile remains robust, with record backlog levels, particularly in Aerospace and PMT, and stabilized sequential short cycle order rates across much of the portfolio. For our Q3 sales guidance, we expect to be in the range of $9.1 to 9.3 billion, up 1% to 4 on an organic basis.\nWe now expect full year sales of $36.7 to 37.3 billion, which represents an increase of $200 million on the low end. Incorporating our strong Q2 results, we're raising the low end of our organic growth range, now 4% to 6, and we continue to expect a greater balance of price and volume versus last year.\nWe've upgraded our full-year expectations in PMT while softening our outlook for SPS to reflect our latest views on the end markets each. Moving to our segment margin guidance, we expect Q3 to be in the range of 22.3% to 22.6, resulting in year-over-year margin expansion of 50 to 80 basis points due to commercial excellence and productivity actions. For full year 2023, we are upgrading our segment margin expectations by 10 basis points on the low end to a new range of 22.4% to 22.6, or 70 to 90 basis points of year-over-year expansion driven by improvement in HBT, SPS, and PMT.\nNow let's take a moment to walk through the Q3 and full year expectations by business. Looking ahead, for Aerospace, we continue to be excited about demand across our end markets and expect sequential sales growth throughout the second half supported by ongoing sequential factory output increases and strong orders. Commercial aftermarket, particularly in air transport, should lead growth in the Aero portfolio as flight hours continue to recover and we see further recovery in the widebody market from increased international travel. On the commercial original equipment side, we expect build rate strength to drive volume progression in the second half.\nIn Defense & Space, we expect sequential and year-over-year growth in the second half and continue to work through our robust backlog. As a result, we expect Defense & Space to grow at a mid single digit rate for the full year 2023.\nWe continue to expect modest sequential improvement in the Aerospace supply chain as growing commitments from our suppliers year to date, coupled with a second consecutive quarter of 20% output increases, give us continued confidence in our outlook. Given these factors, we still expect Aero organic sales growth in the low double-digit range. For segment margin, we still expect Aero to be flattish for the year as we see modest mix pressure within our OE business offsetting overall volume leverage in Performance Materials and Technologies. Encouraging fundamentals persist across our end markets driving favorable growth.\nFor Q3, we expect sales to increase year-over-year and sequentially, coupled with a seasonally strong Q4. Growth will be led by Smart Energy projects and Lifecycle Solutions and Services within Process Solutions as the strength these businesses saw in first half continues into second half.\nIn UOP, our growth outlook for the year is supported by robust demand for petrochemical and refining catalysts. The Sustainability Technology Solutions business within UOP will also provide growth as we capitalize on legislation-backed mandate. For Advanced Materials, we see ongoing demand for Fluorine Products combined with improvements in Electronic Materials supportive of sequential growth from the first half.\nDespite more challenging comps in the second half, these favorable market conditions and our strong execution give us confidence to upgrade our full year sales growth expectations for PMT to high single digits compared to mid single digits last quarter. For segment margin, we expect sequential improvement throughout the year including robust expansion in the Q4 resulting in modest year-over-year improvement for overall 2023.\nLooking ahead for Safety and Productivity Solutions, our outlook continues to be impacted by the decline in CapEx for new warehouse capacity. However, our short cycle businesses appear to be stabilizing as we await a demand acceleration in the coming quarters. For the Q3, we expect this to lead to organic sales decline similar to Q2. However, we anticipate another quarter of strong growth in the aftermarket services portion of our Intelligrated business, and Sensing and Safety Technologies should return to growth. With the SPS's portfolio bouncing along the bottom of the cycle, we now expect full-year sales to be down low double digits in 2023.\nHowever, segment margin continues to be a bright spot for SPS as we implement productivity actions, and drive operational improvements, and we still expect strong margin expansion for the full year. In Building Technologies, the macroeconomic environment remains challenging.\nOur team continues to execute well and burn down our past few backlog. For Q3, we expect sales to be relatively flat year-over-year as we continue to see more challenging comps and the timing of short cycle recovery remains uncertain. For the year, we still expect sales in our long cycle Building Solutions business to outgrow the more short cycle Building Products. Our institutional verticals such as airports, and education will remain strong as we continue to see stimulus spend come through.\nThe business is well aligned to energy efficiency and sustainability megatrends. Given these dynamics, we still expect HBT sales for the year to grow low single digits organically, and we see potential for growth acceleration as we exit 2023.\nFor segment margins, we now expect HBT to lead Honeywell margin expansion as a result of strong inflation management and productivity actions. Turning to our other core guided metrics, net below the line impact, which is the difference between segment profit and income before tax, is expected to be in the range of -$120 to -170 million in the Q3 and -$500 to -625 million for the full year. This guidance includes a range of repositioning between $40 and $85 million in the quarter and $225 to 325 million for the year. As we continue to fund attractive restructuring projects and properly position Honeywell for the future.\nWe expect the adjusted effective tax rate to be roughly 23% in the Q3, 2 points higher than our full year guide of 21% and 2 points higher than Q2, which is unchanged from our previous guide. That implies a lower Q4 rate due to the timing of discrete items. Importantly, this higher tax rate in Q3 reflects an approximately $0.06 headwind to EPS but will be offset by a commensurate tailwind in Q4 leaving the full year unchanged. We expect average share count to be around 669 million shares in Q3 and 670 million shares for the full year. As a result of these inputs, our adjusted EPS guidance range is now between $2.15 to 2.25 for the Q3 which would be down 4% to flat year-over-year.\nExcluding the pension headwinds, Q3 EPS growth would be up 2% to 6. For full year EPS, we are increasing the midpoint of our guide, upgrading the low end of the range by $0.05 for a new range of $9.05 to 9.25, up 3% to 6, reflecting our continued confidence that 2023 will be a solid growth year for Honeywell despite the year-over-year pension headwinds. Excluding these headwinds, EPS growth would be 10% to 12 of the year. After a strong first half and continued progress on inventory and receivables management, we expect to meet our original free cash flow guidance of $3.9 to 4.3 billion in 2023 or $5.1 to 5.5 billion excluding the net impact of settlements.\nSo to wrap up, our original thesis for 2023 remains intact.\nRobust backlog of $30 billion underpins our strength, our growth. Though the timing of the short cycle recovery remains uncertain, we're encouraged by the strength of our portfolio and continue to execute on our rigorous operating playbook through a challenging backdrop to deliver outstanding results. Now let's turn to slide seven and I'll hand the call back to Vimal for some long-term comments.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you, Greg. I'd like to take a minute to zoom out from the quarterly result to emphasize the long-term journey Honeywell is on. As you can see from the charts on slide, Honeywell has made tremendous progress whether it is accelerating organic growth, expanding gross margins, and segment margin, or growing free cash flow. We've come a long way, but we are not close to done, and we have identified the critical levers that will enable us to reach even higher level of financial performance. We remain committed to our long-term growth algorithm that we discussed during our May Investor Day and during 2023 guidance.\nClosely aligned with this framework, we carefully track our progression towards achieving our targets and remain confident in our ability to accelerate growth, achieve 25% segment margin, and expand gross margin to above 40% and free cash flow margins to mid-teens and beyond. As I said in May, my priorities as CEO include accelerating organic growth, enhancing our innovation playbook, growing our sustainability and digitization capability, and maintaining our leadership position in high-growth regions. I also plan to evolve the Accelerator operating system to drive incremental value through business model optimization.\nAdditionally, Honeywell has undergone substantial internal transformation, the result of which you can see in our top line and bottom line improvements over the last decade. I plan to further optimize the portfolio through strategic capital deployment and reduce exposure to non-core areas.\nThree deals announced this quarter demonstrate the strength of our M&A pipeline and our commitment to deploy capital. I'm excited to lead the change for this next phase of transformation for Honeywell, and I'm confident in our ability to deliver superior returns for our shareholders as we deploy our global design model. Across our portfolio, we are uncovering substantial opportunities to capture value whether it is expanding margins, driving incremental sales growth, or generating more cash, and we will continue to update you as these efforts translate increasingly into enhanced financial performance.\nNow let's turn it to slide eight into closing thought before we move into Q&A. Honeywell executed very well in what remains a very dynamic operating environment. We'll continue to effectively manage through ongoing external factors by delivering on our commitment.\nBy relying on our value creation framework, the macro economy remains challenging and the timing of a short cycle acceleration is uncertain. But with ongoing strength in our two biggest end markets, Aerospace and Energy, combined with operating rigor you have come to expect from Honeywell, we are confident in our ability to weather near term challenges and meet our performance targets. Thank you all to our Honeywell colleagues who continue to enable us to outperform in any environment. With that, Sean, let's move to Q&A.\n\nSean Meakim\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Honeywell\n\nThank you. Vimal. Vimal, Greg, and Anne are now available to answer your questions. We ask that you please be mindful of others in the queue by only asking one question. Liz, please open the line for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nOur first question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew, you're.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nYeah. Can you hear me?\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYep. Good morning, Andrew.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nYeah, good morning. Just a question on Advanced Materials. You know, it's a, it's a good return business. When should we expect this business to return to growth? And also, you know, do you guys.\nNeed to add capacity to grow this business?\nHow strong the structural demand is?\nThank you.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nYeah, thanks, Andrew. So I think the key is the comps of Advanced Materials to 2022. We grew more than 20% last year. So combine that with some of the weaknesses we see in Electronic Material side. We are having a moderate year for Advanced Materials this year. We do expect markets to turn better during second half and more importantly in 2024. To your question on capacity expansion, we remain very excited. In fact, in the next track cycle we expect more capital investment, increase our capacity for Advanced Materials for some of the existing offerings and potentially some new offerings. So overall we remain very bullish on Advanced Materials portfolio.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHey, good morning, guys.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nThe underlying, I guess on the positive side, the very strong margin in aerospace [is] tough to kind of like cut through the OE incentives. Was there anything unusual there? Like, were the OE incentives? We just don't know the quarterly timing of those. I mean, I'm kind of getting to an underlying incremental of around like 40% for that business. If we adjust for some of these OE incentives, can you just maybe talk about some of the moving parts there, and whether I'm roughly right on the math?\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. So the OE incentives, we haven't disclosed the exact amount of them, but the first half is going to be a little lighter than the second half in terms of those OE incentives. So that's why when we talk about the full year margins still being flattish, even though we had a pretty strong Q2, I think that's really what's going on in that regard.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. And then just one last one on HBT, you know, that business just perhaps should be growing better in this environment.\nEven Building Solutions was kind of like, you know, weak. So there's really not a function of. That's really can't be a function of destocking. So maybe you know, what are the moving parts there and why are you guys not keeping up with the other non res players out there? Thanks.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nYeah, so Steve, we are conscious of our margin rates in HBT and make careful selection of our projects which have adequate margins and strong service days.\nSo I think, given that choice we make, you can see impact of that in margin expansion of Building Technologies, and that comes to a certain degree at the organic growth rate. So it's a choice to be made, and we want to deliver both in ideal work, but we remain biased more towards growth in margin expansion versus the top line growth.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat, thanks a lot.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nAirlines Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGood morning, guys, and thank you. I wanted to ask an Aerospace-specific one if that's okay. Last quarter you raised your Aerospace guide to low double digits, and I think the bulk of the raise had come from the OE side, which you guys are doing well in. But there's been a bunch of moving pieces this quarter with the MAX officially going to 38 per month yesterday. And then, of course, engine issues could force like a build-new-build versus spares issue at Airbus on the A320. So kind of how are you thinking about the puts and takes for aerospace OE as we get into the second half following 15% growth in the first half?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nSo, Sheila, our deliveries for the year are pretty well aligned with all OEs both on air transport as well as on the business jet side. We have our commits to all key OEMs on for Q3, Q4, and our projections are based upon those commit rates. So, I can't comment on their commitments to their customers. But we are pretty well aligned our commits to them, and our revenue growth and our volume growth is linked to that, and it's going to be pretty strong. I mean, we expect the momentum in Aerospace not to change in 2023 or, for that matter, even in 2024. Our backlog is extremely strong, and our supply chain continues to improve every quarter.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nThe recent events have not changed their expectations of us to this stage.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nAirlines Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGot it. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning. Maybe just my question would be on SPS. Just wanted to try and understand.\nHow the sort of orders and backlog there is moving? I can imagine it's not moving well and that's why the revenue guide has come down. But any finer points on the orders and backlogs, and I suppose in the conviction level around warehouse accelerating next year, if that's starting to get sort of tested now because of the ongoing backlog pressure.\nYou know, if we think about the shorter cycle businesses, you know, how severe do you think the inventory depletion needs are in that business, and what does that mean for exit rates in SPS from this year on the top line?\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nSure. So I would say if we take IGS first, you know, our order rates are down meaningfully as we've just talked about. But when we look at the overall pipeline, we're starting to see the pipeline build back to a little bit better levels. That may not occur immediately, but we see there is a chance that we may be growing again in 2024. That will really be dictated by how the back half orders really come in. But we are starting to see a little bit more strength in the pipeline, which I think is a positive as it relates to the short cycle businesses.\nWhat we talked about is it's down year on year because the first half of the year was particularly high. But we're seeing stabilization. The last two to three quarters have been either going up sequentially or staying roughly flat.\nSo I think we've reached this stabilization point on a short cycle. And as and when some of those markets begin to recover, then we'll see some growth. So as we think about SPS overall, I would expect it's going to grow in 2024. It's probably not going to be at the high end of our growth rate for our SBGs, but that's how we see it with the data that's coming through right now.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThanks very.\nMuch.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nHey, good morning, everybody, and welcome. Vimal.\nA couple small things here. One, I mean, you guys are spending $200 million a year on Quantum. Do you have a kind of an evolved vision of, you know, of where this business goes and how you can monetize it when you can monetize it? If, you know, is it a, you know, can the cash flow bleed go down a little bit over time or is there some kind of positive end game that you, you see here?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nWell, Scott, we have publicly stated that we would like to monetize value of the Quantum investment we have made in Quantinuum. And as the markets are more ready for IPO, which probably are here for a while.\nWe are getting prepared for that. So we are doing everything towards that endgame and the strategy hasn't changed to create more value for our shareholders. At appropriate time through an IPO for that business.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay, fair enough. And just quickly just following up on Steve's question. I mean, I would have thought Forge for buildings would have given you a little bit of a lift given the timing of when you rolled that out. You know, I understand project selectivity, but I would have thought that would have given you a little bit more of a tailwind into the quarter. Is there timing issues there and that those orders haven't really kicked in yet and we'll see that later in the year, or is there other competitive dynamics?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nLook, I mean we are definitely seeing better bookings for Forge for buildings, but one fact I would like to state is that business runs on a SaaS model. So even a large booking, the revenue recognition process is different from traditional perpetual license-based model. So the revenue accretion is going to spread over multiple years for that. And we are consciously make that decision because rather than showing a short-term win, we are more biasing ourselves towards more recurring revenue model there as I started before. So that's why you see lesser impact. But we are scoring wins in Forge for buildings, and I continue to remain very bullish on that segment.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay, fair enough. Best of luck, Vimal.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you Scott.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to maybe just put a final point on Julian's question on SPS. So obviously encouraging signs of the ordering process here. But it does feel like the guidance embeds flat to maybe flattish ± growth in Q4. Just want to make sure that's the case and you've got good lines out on that and maybe on HBT just break down geographically what you're seeing versus North America, Europe, and China and whether there's any channel dynamics here that we should think about as well.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nSo I'll start with HBT. Turn to Greg to respond to SPS question. I think HBT from a geographic perspective.\nEurope continues to be where we want have better outcome. I think that's a bit of a drag at this point. The strength is in high growth regions. We see strength in Middle East, India, and China in buildings, and North America is more of, I would say, sequentially no change within the business. So that's kind of our overall dynamic on the channel side. I mean, the channel demand will be determined by the end market demand. So it's a very short cycle business. So we don't see any dynamics of channels having less or more inventory. In the HBT business, maybe Greg, you want to respond to SPS question.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. So SPS, it's likely to be down in the Q4. So I would say it's not going to be flattish. It's going to be probably more like down. I think Q3 and Q2 are going to look pretty similar to one another, and then we'll get a little bit of a normal seasonal bump in the Q4. So that's the way I would think about the progression for SPS top line overall.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat, thanks.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYep,\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nHey, thank you. Good morning everyone.\nI was going to ask a near-term question, but given your response about margins in HBT, I wonder if we could maybe just zoom out and just kind of think philosophically about kind of the trade-off between growth and margins. Right. You know, we have seen situations in the past where companies with high margins get, like, for lack of a better term, a little bit trapped in wanting to maintain and grow the margins. Right. And growth ends up suffering as a result.\nSo could you, and you addressed this to some degree, obviously, when we were together in New York, but could you maybe elaborate a little bit more on your philosophy relative to managing those two metrics and how you make sure you don't hinder growth by overly focusing on margins?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nJeff, our business model in HBT is combination of serving the market both through direct and channel. So we have to make choice what business we want to serve directly and what business we want to serve through channels and indirect. We want to pick projects which have a strong first party content and aftermarket services. So given that algorithm.\nWe make choices with that rule. We are sensitive to drive top line growth. But we are not going to compromise to book projects which are lower margins and show shiny top line growth without any margin expansion. That has been our principles. The reason we are quite determined on the principle is it takes one bad project to deteriorate the entire business and the portfolio. So we remain, you know, committed to that model. I'm not suggesting that we will not see growth in Building Technologies.\nI do believe that as energy efficiency becomes more prominent across the board, our Energy business there will do well and we will deliver more growth in the project side of the house too. But that remains our overarching.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nYeah, thank you. I sort of meant the question on a total Honeywell basis also though.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nOkay. On total Honeywell basis. I mean, organic growth on the top end of our range is my biggest priority. I stated that in Investor Day. If something I want to make my contribution in my tenure is how we grow at a higher rate. Now we are having favorable macros in two of our biggest SBGs, both in Aero and PMT. So on the strength of that, and if we couple that with the right new products, I see no reason that we should be delivering our growth in upper end of our four to seven algorithm. And that's what I work on every day and continue to drive our new product execution and then M&A accelerating our overall growth algorithm. You know, that that remains my top commitment.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nThank you for the perspective.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.\n\nJosh Pokrzywinski\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nHey Josh.\n\nJosh Pokrzywinski\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey.\nI just want to maybe flip around the HBT question from the other perspective on PMT. I mean you're seeing some of the bulk chemical guys go through destocking. You know, I think traditional oil spending has been okay, but maybe not as strong as what you guys are seeing in some of the other process guys are seeing. I guess just how much are we getting away from kind of traditional oil versus either some of these megaprojects or energy transition? Is this business really transcending its roots of even five, six, seven years ago?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nSure. So Josh, if I look at each of the three segments, our Automation business Process Solution has increasingly reduced its dependence on oil and gas. It has diversified very well in other end markets, energy storage.\nGigafactories, metals and mining, et cetera. So we can see that in the growth rate of revenue generation for Process Solutions, and we remain very bullish on that business for 2023 and 2024. The UOP segment, our strategy has been to grow our business into sustainable technology, renewable fuels, clean hydrogen, and carbon capture. And we see pretty strong bookings in our sustainable technologies business. Just as a data point now, we have licensed 40 renewable fuel projects till Q3 and on a path to be 50 by, I would say, Q1 of 2024, which I mentioned in a couple of earlier investor meetings.\nSo UOP business is becoming also less linked to traditional refining petrochemicals, but fast moving towards renewable technology. And in Advanced Materials, our business is very specialty chemicals Solstice product line continues to grow. We see.\nSome pressure in Electronic Materials, which is reflected in our overall growth rates. But we do expect that to turn back into normalcy in 2024. So overall extremely positive outcome and bullish view on PMT for second half of 2023 and 2024. The booking rates remain strong, backlog is very strong. New innovation pipeline is very, very strong. So all good news there.\n\nJosh Pokrzywinski\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nUnderstood, thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks. Good morning guys.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nAnd so just really two quick ones, I guess, just on SPS. We've talked a little bit about the growth dynamics for the year. I'm just curious how the reduction in the short cycle businesses is perhaps impacting margins for the second half of the year. And then the other question is really around the Defense business. It's nice to see the inflection there. I'm just curious at what point do you really start to see an acceleration in Defense growth just given what you know about your production schedules.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nSo.\nThe.\nThe way we have guided it, we are, you know, short cycle orders have stabilized and we're expecting similar trend over the next few months, and our guide is based upon that. We are expecting stronger performance in warehouse automation orders because our pipeline has become better. But that will really strengthen our 2024 position given the long cycle nature of the business. And that's our forecast right now. And we'll continue to update you if things change.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah, and I would just say, Joe, you know, we have the teams have resized their cost envelope to the current reality and as and when the short cycle businesses re-accelerate, you know, you can imagine those are very high-margin at the VCM level and that will create a lot of acceleration from a margin rate standpoint. So the margin rates that we're going to be printing now are going to be within a tighter band until we see that acceleration come.\nBut their business is poised for it and we'll see, is that going to be Q4, is it going to be Q1? You know, remains to be seen but we've sized the business properly and there's going to be a fairly substantial leverage opportunity, you know, when that acceleration happens.\n\nSean Meakim\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Honeywell\n\nThen he had a question on Defense; we could see an acceleration in demand there.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYes.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nYep. So in Defense, we, our bookings remain very, very strong. So we are working our supply chain constraints there, and we do expect our delivery performance to be better in second half versus first half. So we had low single digits in the first half of the year. We expect the year to finish more on the mid single digits for the Defense business.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nFrom here though, you know, we passed probably the comps where small increments are going to create meaningful growth from a percentage basis. It should be all accretive from this point on.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nAnd also, I should also mention, we see, longer term, for the Defense business pretty strong demand outside the United States, as we can all imagine. The recent war in Ukraine has created much higher budgets by different countries. And we clearly see those signals coming to us in terms of demand from NATO countries, other friendly countries, and that will play out even more stronger for the Defense business in the times to come.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Good morning everyone.\nHey, just want to circle back on SPS if we could. On warehouse automation. What are you seeing in the pipeline that suggests a bottoming? And then a related question is, can you give us any sense of when you'll hit this targeted critical mass of installations that will drive that flywheel of attractive aftermarket? How close are you to that? What kind of time frame?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell",
    "content2": "So the pipeline is growing very nicely, and that gives us a little bit more optimism on better orders performance for the business in the second half of the year, and the part of where the pipeline growth is driven by much more diversified end markets we serve now. So we are not limited to e-commerce. We are diversified into retail, into fashion, into logistics. So that's wider coverage is giving us better pipeline. And you know, we are anticipating good progress in the orders in the second half of the year.\nOn the aftermarket flywheel, I would say it's been working. Now we are growing double digits in aftermarket in 2023 and will cross our aftermarket business more than $500 million in bookings and pretty much nearly the same revenue for the year. And we don't expect the momentum to stop. That's our strength.\nHoneywell has a strong playbook on how to drive aftermarket services, and that's the value we'll continue to add into the business and our strength in that business in 2024. Therefore, we anticipate.\nLow to moderate growth, but very strong margin expansion because we continue to build more business with more first party content, very strong aftermarket. We coupled the two together. We do expect pretty healthy margin growth in warehouse automation business in 2024.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYes. I mean, that business was around $200 million of the total in 2018. By 2022, it doubled to roughly $400 million. As Vimal said, this year it's going to be over $500 million aftermarket business. So that aftermarket is happening.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nWelcome.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.\n\nNicole DeBlaze\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah, thanks guys. Good morning.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning.\n\nNicole DeBlaze\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nJust maybe on PMT, if you guys could talk a little bit more about the order activity you saw within UOP and HPS in the quarter. And then on the margins you talked about the challenges in Advanced Materials. I guess how does that kind of phase through the second half of the year? Thank you.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nSo orders remain pretty strong in the first half for UOP and HPS, and we expect to finish here strong in both the businesses. I would say high single-digit orders growth in both UOP and HPS, and explain the rationale of it. In HPS, it's more diversified end markets and our strength of our aftermarket business there, and in UOP it is diversifying to renewable technologies. And as they become more and more important part of our portfolio, it continues to grow the business, and you'll be the catalyst. Business continues to have a lot of strength in both refining and petrochemical catalyst.\nAdvanced Materials. As I mentioned, 2020 to 2022, 2022 was an outstanding year, 20% plus growth. So our comps year on year are tough. The margin rates are driven by some of the plant shutdown which we had announced earlier.\nSo that certainly put pressure on our cost positions and then some contraction in Electronic Materials business, which is depressing our margins. But overall it's a still highest margin business in the PMT portfolio. And as mentioned before, with the potential capacity expansion coming in years to come, this business is poised to perform very well in our portfolio.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah, Nicole, if you think about this year, we're literally going to progress each and every quarter sequentially a little bit better. You know, we picked up about 110 basis points sequentially from Q1 to Q2. We expect, you know, some additional sequential improvement in Q3 and then again in Q4. So you know, I think as we get to the end of the year it'll look like modest year-over-year for the full year. But it's going to be a nice sequential step up quarter to quarter to quarter.\n\nNicole DeBlaze\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nThanks guys.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you.\n\nSean Meakim\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Honeywell\n\nLiz, I think we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nThis question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nGood morning everyone. Hey, Vimal, could you talk about the stepped up level of acquisitions you did in the quarter? Would you expect that kind of activity to continue over the next few quarters? Have you changed any of your methods for assessing potential acquisitions? I think given the Investor Day you probably didn't. But could you talk about the pipeline of opportunities going forward?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nLook, Andrew, the pipeline remains extremely strong. We are actively working more outbound activities in M&A and remain very optimistic if we can get the deals done at the right price. Because one thing we're not going to compromise is our deal metrics. We want to stay disciplined to create shareholder value. But at the same time, our number of opportunities in the play are at a much higher elevated level compared to this time in the past. So Anne, if you want to add any comment from your perspective.\n\nAnne Madden\n\nSVP and General Councel, Honeywell\n\nYeah, I would just add the pipeline is growing.\nIt's rich. We feel good.\nAs a strategic acquirer, we maintain the view that it's a hospitable environment for strategic acquirers while the private equity community still is having a harder time financing. So it's a good time for us to be a buyer and we expect that environment to continue into 2024 and beyond.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Vimal Kapur for closing remarks.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you. Our value creation framework is working. We are deploying our rigorous operating playbook to navigate near-term uncertainty. Honeywell remains well positioned to outperform in any environment as we capitalize on recovering end market combined with solid operational execution. Thank you all our Honeywell colleagues who continue to drive differentiated performance for all our customers and shareholders. Thank you for listening and please stay safe and healthy.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.\nSa.\nIt.\nSam.\nSa.\nThank you for standing by and welcome to the Honeywell Q2 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question and answer session. Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to Sean Meakim, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nSean Meakim\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Honeywell\n\nThank you, Liz. Good morning and welcome to Honeywell's Q2 2023 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with me today are Chief Executive Officer Vimal Kapur, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Greg Lewis, and Senior Vice President and General Counsel Anne Madden. This webcast and the presentation materials, including non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our investor relations website. From time to time, we will post new information that may be of interest or material to our investors on this website.\nOur discussion today includes forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the ones described in our SEC filings this morning.\nWe will review our financial results for the Q2 sales, our guidance for the Q3, and provide an update to our full year 2023 outlook. As always, we'll leave time for your questions at the end. With that, I'll turn the call over to the CEO, Vimal Kapur. Thank you.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nSean, and good morning everyone. Let's begin on slide two. The Q2 was another strong one for Honeywell. We met or exceeded our commitments as our rigorous operating principles enable us to navigate a challenging backdrop. We grew adjusted earnings per share 6% year-over-year to $2.23 or up 13% excluding a $0.15 non-cash pension headwind. Q2 organic sales were up 3% year-over-year led by double digit growth in commercial Aerospace, Process Solutions, and UOP. Our Aerospace business continues to perform at very high levels.\nThe Q2 backlog grew to a new record of $30.5 billion, up 4% year-over-year and 1% sequentially due to strength in Aero, BMT, and HBT.\nSimilar to last quarter, orders continue to grow double-digit organically in Aero. For other segments, unfavorable comparison to last year's peak supply chain disruption led to a single-digit decline in orders for overall Honeywell. We remain confident in our 2023 outlook as recovering end markets and operational excellence continue to deliver resilient results despite macroeconomic uncertainty. Our segment margin expanded 150 basis points year-over-year, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by 20 basis points, led by expansion in SPS, HBT, and Aero.\nOur continued focus on commercial excellence and greater gains from productivity enabled us to remain ahead of our inflation curve. Free cash flow was $1.1 billion in Q2, up 34% year-over-year driven by strong net income and improved working capital in line with our expectations. Greg will walk you through the free cash flow drivers in more detail.\nIn a few minutes we deployed $2.1 billion to dividends, M&A share repurchases, and growth CapEx, including opportunistically repurchasing 2.4 million shares throughout the quarter, reducing our weighted average share count to 670 million. I'm pleased with the progress we made this quarter on our portfolio shaping priorities. We invested in multiple new technologies utilizing our robust M&A playbook, including completing the acquisition of Compressor Controls Corporation for approximately $700 million. As always, we continue to execute on our proven value creation framework which is underpinned by Accelerator operating system.\nThe operating system, along with ongoing growth in our key end markets and technologically differentiated portfolio of solutions is enabling us to navigate a challenging economic backdrop and deliver on our commitment again this quarter.\nLooking forward, I'm encouraged by the strength we are seeing in our long cycle Aero and Energy verticals and remain confident in our position to outperform. Next, let's turn to slide three to discuss the important leadership announcements. Last month, we announced that Jim Currier will be succeeding Mike Madsen as Honeywell Aerospace CEO. I want to congratulate Mike Madsen on his retirement and extend my sincere gratitude. For 37 years he has given to Honeywell.\nMike has been extremely effective leader and change agent in our company and the Aero industry. He has a rich history of exceeding expectations as Aerospace won an unprecedented $35 billion in new business in these last two years. His leadership and commitment to customers, employees, and the community is unparalleled.\nDuring his tenure as Aero CEO, Mike navigated the business to unprecedented pandemic disruptions while growing the top line, expanding margins by over 200 basis points. Because of Mike's passion and dedication to the business, he helped set up Honeywell Aerospace to be even more successful in the years to come. We're excited about the next phase of growth in Honeywell's Aero business under Jim Currier's leadership. We are fortunate to have someone with this level of experience and tenure ready to take the helm. A true testament to Honeywell's bench strength and focus on succession planning.\nJim has been with Honeywell Aero for 17 years, and prior to his current position, he had held multiple roles of increasing responsibility across function and geography, most recently as President of our Electronic Solutions business.\nThe medium-term setup for Aero is the strongest it has ever been. Flight hours continue to be strong, including wide-body upside, which is now underway. We have diverse and optimized platform exposure, particularly in business aviation. In fact, over the last few months alone, we have won $3 billion in business to provide OEMs and airline with our engines, wheels & brakes, APUs, and flight management system along with associated aftermarket services. In addition, supply chains are gradually improving, and we have returned to growth in Defense & Space. This momentum points to a robust multi-year trajectory for the largest businesses in Honeywell portfolio.\nLet's turn to slide four to discuss our recent corporate development activity. I'm excited about our recent capital deployment announcement, closing on our previously announced Compressor Controls Corporation acquisition, and adding new strategic assets that will drive enhanced innovation and strength. Our technology portfolio.\nThis mix really exemplifies the type of deals that we look to generate on a consistent basis. Last month we closed our acquisition of CCC, a leading provider of turbomachinery control and optimization solutions. Deploying approximately $700 million in all-cash transactions. CCC technologies, including control hardware, software, and services, foster Honeywell's high growth, sustainability, and digitization portfolio with new carbon capture control solutions. CCC integrates seamlessly into our process control and solutions business and provides meaningful revenue synergy potential with Honeywell Forge.\nWe are excited to extend Honeywell's leadership in automation and help customers accelerate their energy transition with the completion of this acquisition. We also acquired SCADAfence, an Israel-based company that delivers operational technology or OT and Internet of Things or IoT cybersecurity solutions for monitoring large-scale networks.\nSCADAfence brings proven technologies in asset discovery, threat detection, and security governance, which are key to industrial and critical infrastructure cybersecurity programs, into our SCE portfolio. The OT cybersecurity industry is expected to grow to greater than $10 billion in the next several years, and the SCADAfence portfolio pairs seamlessly with Honeywell's Cybersecurity business, providing an end-to-end enterprise solution that helps customers enhance enterprise resilience.\nIn addition, we signed an agreement with Saab to acquire its heads-up-display or HUD asset, bolstering Honeywell's comprehensive end-to-end avionics and safety offering. We'll partner with Saab to develop and strengthen the HUD product line, which enables pilots increased situational awareness, specifically at night or in difficult weather conditions.\nImportantly, the HUD will be integrated into Honeywell Anthem, our revolutionary integrated flight deck with an intuitive user interface and highly scalable design, in addition to Honeywell's Primus Epic flight deck and retrofit solutions. I'm excited about our new technologies and adjacencies we have unlocked through our recent M&A activity, as we said before, and we have an active and robust pipeline, and this is further evidence that we are continuously enhancing our portfolio by investing in new opportunities.\nWe look forward to continuing to deploy our capital in coming quarters to create more value for Honeywell shareholders. Now let me turn it over to Greg on slide five to discuss our Q2 results in more detail as well as provide our views on guidance.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nThank you, Vimal, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another strong quarter in a very challenging operating environment. Q2 sales grew 3% organically, led by double-digit organic sales growth in commercial Aerospace, Process Solutions, and UOP, where demand strength continues to support Honeywell's short-term and long-term outlook. PMT grew at a robust 7% pace after four consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. Our long-cycle warehouse automation business is around trough levels, as expected, which led to overall volume decline of 1% for the quarter.\nHowever, excluding SPS, volumes were up 5% across the remainder of the portfolio. Our backlog remains at a record level, ending the Q2 at $30.5 billion, up 4% year-over-year, driven by strength in Aero and PMT. Supply chain constraints continue to moderate our overall growth rate.\nHowever, we continue to record sequential improvements in Aero output as expected and are reducing our past due backlog across our short cycle businesses. Our investments in Honeywell Digital have continued to yield commercial and operating benefits through surgical pricing actions, enabling us to expand segment margin by 150 basis points year-over-year to 22.4% and exceed the high end of our guidance by 20 basis points. Three out of four segments expanded margins in the quarter each by more than 100 basis points with SPS leading the way as expected. On cash, we generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow up 34% year-over-year.\nThis increase was driven by stronger net income as well as improved working capital performance with higher collections and good progress on inventory where we have improved our demand planning and optimized our production and materials management using our improved end to end process and digitalization capabilities. Now let's spend a few minutes on the Q2 performance by business.\nAerospace sales for Q2 were up 16% organically, led by over 20% growth in commercial aviation. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit aerospace organic sales growth and over two years of double-digit growth for commercial aviation supported by strong recovery in both flight hours and higher shipset deliveries. Growth remained strongest in commercial aviation aftermarket, up over 25%, led by over 30% growth in air transport as increased flight hours resulted in higher spare shipments and repair and overhaul activity. Commercial original equipment sales also increased double-digit, driven by increased build rates.\nDefense & Space grew for the second consecutive quarter as we were able to execute on our strong backlog and increase our sales volumes. The Aero supply chain continued to make progressive improvements as better material availability enabled 20% year-over-year growth in original equipment, and spare shipments.\nAgain, in Q2, historically high past-due backlog increased again in the quarter as orders growth outpaced our backlog burn-down. Segment margin, Aerospace expanded 120 basis points year-over-year to 27.7% due to commercial excellence and higher volume leverage partially offset by cost inflation. Performance Materials and Technologies sales grew 7% organically in the Q2 with double-digit growth for the third consecutive quarter in both HPS and UOP.\nProcess Solutions sales grew 11% organically driven by strength in our projects, business, and in life cycle solutions and services. In UOP, sales also grew 11% organically led by gas processing and refining catalyst shipments.\nSustainable Technology Solutions within UOP had another standout quarter in Q2 with strong triple-digit order growth and over 30% sales growth. In Advanced Materials. Continued demand for Fluorine Products portfolio was offset by expected macro-driven softness in our Electronics and Chemicals business, leading to flat organic growth. Despite challenging year-over-year comps, segment margin contracted 60 basis points to 21.7% as favorable price-cost was more than offset by challenges in Advanced Materials, including lower volumes and the previously communicated disruption in one of our plants.\nSafety and Productivity Solutions sales decreased 21% organically in the quarter. Sales declines are primarily driven by Warehouse and Workflow Solutions, Productivity Solutions, and Services. While the project portion of our Intelligrated business is around trough levels and the current low investment warehouse automation environment, the aftermarket services portion of the business continues to deliver solid double-digit growth.\nSensing and Safety Technologies was flattish in the quarter, with ongoing strength in our industrial sensing product portfolio offset by modestly lower volumes, and safety segment margin performance for SPS once again led Honeywell, expanding 410 basis points to 16.7%, as a result of productivity actions and commercial excellence partially offset by lower volume leverage and cost inflation.\nHoneywell Building Technology sales were flat year-over-year on an organic basis in Q2. Building Solutions sales grew 2% organically despite expected year-over-year order softness. As we continue to execute on our robust backlog with organic growth in our services business and no change year-over-year in projects turning to our products portfolio, we continue to see sequential improvements in the supply chain environment and we're burning down our past-due backlog.\nAs expected, Building Product sales decreased 1% organically as continued growth in our world-class fire products business was offset by declines in security, and building management systems. Our continued commercial excellence and productivity actions have allowed us to once again mitigate the effects of elevated inflation, expanding HBT segment margin by 200 basis points to 25.5%.\nHoneywell Connected Enterprise's strong software franchise continues to be accretive to overall Honeywell and a powerful differentiator. Overall, double-digit organic growth was supported by strength in the cyber, industrial, aircraft, and buildings. Double-digit orders growth in the quarter is supportive of continued strong performance for HCE.\nOverall this was a great result for Honeywell. Our operational efforts enabled us to grow Q2 GAAP earnings per share 21% year-over-year to $2.22 and adjusted earnings per share 6% year-over-year to $2.23 despite a $0.15 headwind from lower non-cash income from our overfunded pension. From a year-over-year perspective, segment profit drove $0.21 of the improvement in earnings. The main driver of our EPS growth, a lower adjusted effective tax rate, contributed $0.06 of improvement, and reduced share count added an additional $0.05.\nExcluding the pension headwind, below the line and other created a $0.04 year-over-year headwind due to higher net interest expense for a total EPS excluding the pension impact of $2.38, up 13% year-over-year. A bridge for adjusted EPS from Q2 2022 to Q2 2023 can be found in the appendix of this presentation.\nFinally, as Vimal mentioned earlier, we continue to leverage our strong balance sheet, deploying $2.1 billion in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $3.7 billion as we execute on our capital deployment strategy with meaningful portfolio updates. So, overall, disciplined adherence to our best-in-class Honeywell value creation framework provided us with the operational agility to meet or exceed our guided financial metrics. Now let's turn to slide six to discuss our Q3 and full year outlook.\nWhile a number of challenges persist in the current environment, our rigorous operating principles enable us to increase our guided metrics for the full year. Our demand profile remains robust with record backlog levels, particularly in Aerospace and PMT, and stabilized sequential short cycle order rates across much of the portfolio. For our Q3 sales guidance, we expect to be in the range of $9.1 to 9.3 billion, up 1% to 4 on an organic basis. We now expect full year sales of $36.7 to 37.3 billion, which represents an increase of $200 million.\nOn the low end, incorporating our strong Q2 results, we're raising the low end of our organic growth range now 4% to 6, and we continue to expect a greater balance of price and volume versus last year.\nWe've upgraded our full-year expectations in PMT while softening our outlook for SPS to reflect our latest views on the end market supply chain. Moving to our segment margin guidance, we expect Q3 to be in the range of 22.3% to 22.6, resulting in year-over-year margin expansion of 50 to 80 basis points due to commercial excellence and productivity actions. For full-year 2023, we are upgrading our segment margin expectations by 10 basis points on the low end to a new range of 22.4% to 22.6, or 70 to 90 basis points of year-over-year expansion driven by improvement in HBT, SPS, and PMT.\nNow let's take a moment to walk through the Q3 and full-year expectations by business. Looking ahead for Aerospace, we continue to be excited about demand across our end markets and expect sequential sales growth throughout the second half supported by ongoing sequential factory output increases and strong orders. Commercial aftermarket, particularly in air transport, should lead growth in the Aero portfolio as flight hours continue to recover and we see further recovery in the widebody market from increased international travel.\nOn the commercial original equipment side, we expect build rate strength to drive volume progression in the second half. In Defense & Space, we expect sequential and year-over-year growth in the second half and continue to work through our robust backlog. As a result, we expect Defense & Space to grow at a mid-single-digit rate for the full year 2023.\nWe continue to expect modest sequential improvement in the Aerospace supply chain as growing commitments from our suppliers year to date, coupled with a second consecutive quarter of 20% output increases, give us continued confidence in our outlook. Given these factors, we still expect Aero organic sales growth in the low double-digit range for segment margin. We still expect Aero to be flattish for the year as we see modest mix pressure within our OE business offsetting overall volume leverage in performance materials and technologies. Encouraging fundamentals persist across our end markets driving favorable growth.\nFor the Q3. We expect sales to increase year-over-year, and sequentially, coupled with a seasonally strong Q4. Growth will be led by Smart Energy projects and Lifecycle Solutions, and Services within Process Solutions as the strength these businesses saw in the first half continues into the second half.\nIn UOP, our growth outlook for the year is supported by robust demand for petrochemical and refining catalysts. The Sustainability Technology Solutions business within UOP will also provide growth as we can capitalize on legislation-backed mandates. For Advanced Materials, we see ongoing demand for Fluorine Products combined with improvements in Electronic Materials supportive of sequential growth from first half despite more challenging comps in second half. These favorable market conditions and our strong execution give us confidence to upgrade our full-year sales growth expectations for PMT to high single digits compared to mid single digits last quarter.\nFor segment margin, we expect sequential improvement throughout the year including robust expansion in Q4 resulting in modest year-over-year improvement for overall 2023.\nLooking ahead for Safety and Productivity Solutions, our outlook continues to be impacted by the decline in CapEx for new warehouse capacity. However, our short cycle businesses appear to be stabilizing as we await a demand acceleration in the coming quarters. For the Q3, we expect this to lead to organic sales declines similar to Q2. However, we anticipate another quarter of strong growth in the aftermarket services portion of our Intelligrated business, and Sensing and Safety Technologies should return to growth with the SPS's portfolio bouncing along the bottom of the cycle. We now expect full year sales to be down low double digits in 2023.\nHowever, segment margin continues to be a bright spot for SPS as we implement productivity actions and drive operational improvements, and we still expect strong margin expansion for the full year. In Building Technologies, the macroeconomic environment remains challenging.\nOur team continues to execute well and burn down our past due backlog. For Q3, we expect sales to be relatively flat year-over-year as we continue to see more challenging comps and the timing of short cycle recovery remains uncertain. For the year, we still expect sales in our long cycle Building Solutions business to outgrow the more short cycle Building Products. Our institutional verticals such as airports, and education will remain strong as we continue to see stimulus spend come through. The business is well aligned to energy efficiency and sustainability megatrends.\nGiven these dynamics, we still expect HBT sales for the year to grow low single digits organically, and we see potential for growth acceleration as we exit 2023. For segment margins, we now expect HBT to lead Honeywell margin expansion as a result of strong inflation management and productivity actions.\nTurning to our other core guided metrics, net below the line impact, which is the difference between segment profit and income before tax, is expected to be in the range of -$120 to -170 million in the Q3 and -$500 to -625 million for the full year. This guidance includes a range of repositioning between $40 and $85 million in the quarter and $225 to 325 million for the year. As we continue to fund attractive restructuring projects and properly position Honeywell for the future.\nWe expect the adjusted effective tax rate to be roughly 23% in Q3, two points higher than our full year guide of 21% and two points higher than Q2, which is unchanged from our previous guide. That implies a lower Q4 rate due to the timing of discrete items. Importantly, this higher tax rate in Q3 reflects an approximately $0.06 headwind to EPS but will be offset by a commensurate tailwind in Q4 leaving the full year unchanged. We expect average share count to be around 669 million shares in Q3 and 670 million shares for the full year.\nAs a result of these inputs, our adjusted EPS guidance range is now between $2.15 to 2.25 for the Q3, which would be down 4% to flat year-over-year excluding the pension headwinds. Q3 EPS growth would be up 2% to up 6%. For full year EPS, we are increasing the midpoint of our guide, upgrading the low end of the range by $0.05 for a new range of $9.05 to 9.25, up 3% to 6, reflecting our continued confidence that 2023 will be a solid growth year for Honeywell despite the year-over-year pension headwinds. Excluding these headwinds, EPS growth would be 10% to 12 of the year.\nAfter a strong first half and continued progress on inventory and receivables management, we expect to meet our original free cash flow guidance of $3.9 to 4.3 billion in 2023 or $5.1 to 5.5 billion excluding the net impact of settlements. So to wrap up, our original thesis for 2023 remains intact. Robust backlog of $30 billion underpins our strength, our growth. Though the timing of short cycle recovery remains uncertain, we're encouraged by the strength of our portfolio and continue to execute on our rigorous operating playbook through a challenging backdrop to deliver outstanding results.\nNow let's turn to slide seven and I'll hand the call back to Vimal for some long-term comments.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you, Greg. I'd like to take a minute to zoom out from the quarterly result to emphasize the long-term journey Honeywell is on. As you can see from the charts on slide, Honeywell has made tremendous progress whether it is accelerating organic growth, expanding gross margins, and segment margin, or growing free cash flow. We have come a long way, but we are not close to done, and we have identified the critical levers that will enable us to reach even higher level of financial performance. We remain committed to our long-term growth algorithm that we discussed during our May Investor Day and during 2023 guidance.\nClosely aligned with this framework, we carefully track our progression towards achieving our targets and remain confident in our ability to accelerate growth, achieve 25% segment margin, and expand gross margin to above 40% and free cash flow margins to mid-teens and beyond. As I said in May, my priorities as CEO include accelerating organic growth and enhancing our innovation playbook, growing our sustainability and digitization capability, and maintaining our leadership position in high-growth regions. I also plan to evolve the Accelerator operating system to drive incremental value through business model optimization.\nAdditionally, Honeywell has undergone substantial internal transformation, the result of which you can see in our top line and bottom line improvements over the last decade. I plan to further optimize the portfolio through strategic capital deployment and reduce exposure to non-core areas.\nThree deals announced this quarter demonstrate the strength of our M&A pipeline and our commitment to deploy capital. I'm excited to lead the change for this next phase of transformation for Honeywell. I'm confident in our ability to deliver superior returns for our shareholders as we deploy our global design model. Across our portfolio, we are uncovering substantial opportunities to capture value, whether it is expanding margins, driving incremental sales growth, or generating more cash. We will continue to update you as these efforts translate increasingly into enhanced financial performance.\nNow, let's turn to slide eight for closing thoughts before we move into Q&A. Honeywell executed very well in what remains a very dynamic operating environment. We'll continue to effectively manage through ongoing external factors by delivering on our commitment, by relying on our value creation framework.\nThe macro economy remains challenging, and the timing of a short-cycle acceleration is uncertain. But with ongoing strength in our two biggest end markets, Aerospace and Energy, combined with operating rigor you have come to expect from Honeywell, we are confident in our ability to weather near-term challenges and meet our performance targets. Thank you to all our Honeywell colleagues who continue to enable us to outperform in any environment. With that, Sean, let's move to Q&A.\n\nSean Meakim\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Honeywell\n\nThank you, Vimal. Vimal, Greg, and Anne are now available to answer your questions. We ask that you please be mindful of others in the queue by only asking one question. Liz, please open the line for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nOur first question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew?\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nYeah. Can you hear me?\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYep.\nGood morning, Andrew.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nYeah, good morning. Just a question on Advanced Materials. You know, it's a good return business. When should we expect this business to return to growth? And also, you know, do you guys need to add capacity to grow this business? How strong the structural demand is?\nThank you.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nYeah, thanks, Andrew. So I think the key is the comps of Advanced Materials to 2022. We grew more than 20% last year. So combine that with some of the weaknesses we see in Electronic Material side. We are having a moderate year for Advanced Materials this year. We do expect markets to turn better during second half and more importantly in 2024. To your question on capacity expansion, we remain very excited. In fact, in the next upcycle we expect more capital investment, increase our capacity for Advanced Materials for some of the existing offerings, and potentially some new offerings. So overall we remain very bullish on Advanced Materials portfolio.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHey, good morning, guys.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nThe underlying, I guess on the positive side, the very strong margin in Aerospace, tough to kind of like cut through the OE incentives. Was there anything unusual there? Like, were the OE incentives? We just don't know the quarterly timing of those. I mean, I'm kind of getting to an underlying incremental of around like 40% for that business. If we adjust for some of these OE incentives, can you just maybe talk about some of the moving parts there and whether I'm roughly right on the math?\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYes. So the OE incentives, we haven't disclosed the exact amount of them, but the first half is going to be a little lighter than the second half in terms of those OE incentives. So that's why when we talk about the full year margins still being flattish, even though we had a pretty strong Q2, I think that's really what's going on in that regard.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nOkay, and then just one last one on HBT, you know, that business just perhaps should be growing better in this environment.\nEven Building Solutions was kind of like, you know, weak. So there's really not a function of these things that really can't be a function of destocking. So maybe what are the moving parts there and why are you guys not keeping up with the other non-res players out there? Thanks.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. So Steve, we are conscious of our margin rates in HBT and make careful selection of our projects which have adequate margins and strong service data.\nSo we, I think, given that choice we make, you can see impact of that in margin expansion of Building Technologies. That comes to a certain degree at the organic growth, you know, rate. It's a choice to be made, and we want to deliver both an ideal world, but we remain biased more towards growth in margin expansion versus the top line growth.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat, thanks a lot.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nAirlines Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGood morning, guys, and thank you. I wanted to ask an Aerospace-specific one if that's okay. Last quarter, you raised your Aerospace guide to low double digits, and I think the bulk of the raise had come from the OE side, which you guys are doing well in. But there's been a bunch of moving pieces this quarter with the MAX officially going to 38 per month yesterday. And then, of course, engine issues could force like a new-build versus spares issue at Airbus on the A320. So, kind of, how are you thinking about the puts and takes for aerospace OE as we get into the second half following 15% growth in the first half?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nSo Sheila, our deliveries for the year are pretty well aligned with all OEs both on air transport as well as on the business jet side. We have our commits to all OEMs on for Q3, Q4, and our projections are based upon those commit rates. So I can't comment on their commitments to their customers. But we are pretty well aligned our commits to them, and our revenue growth and our volume growth is linked to that. It's going to be pretty strong. I mean we expect the momentum in Aerospace not to change in 2023 or for that matter even in 2024. Our backlog is extremely strong, and our supply chain continues to improve every quarter.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nThe recent events have not changed their expectations of us to this stage.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nAirlines Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGot it. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning. Maybe just my question would be on SPS. Just wanted to try and understand.\nHow the sort of orders and backlog there is moving. I can imagine it's not moving well, and that's why the revenue guide has come down. But any finer points on the orders and backlogs, and I suppose in the conviction level around warehouse accelerating next year if that's starting to get sort of tested now because of the ongoing backlog pressure.\nYou know, if we're thinking about the shorter cycle businesses, you know, how severe do you think the inventory depletion needs are in that business, and what does that mean for exit rates in SPS from this year on the top line?\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nSure. So I would say if we take IGS first, you know, our order rates are down, you know, meaningfully, as we've just talked about, but when we look at the overall pipeline, we're starting to see the pipeline build back to a little bit better levels. That may not occur immediately, but we see there is a chance that we may be growing again in 2024. That will really be dictated by how the back half orders really come in. But we are starting to see a little bit more strength in the pipeline, which I think is a positive as it relates to the short cycle business is what we talked about. It's down year on year because the first half of the year was particularly high. But we're seeing stabilization.\nThe last two to three quarters have been either going up sequentially or staying roughly flat. So I think we've reached this stabilization point on a short cycle, and as and when some of those markets begin to recover, you know, then we'll see some growth. So as we think about SPS overall, I would expect it's going to grow in 2024; it's probably not going to be at the high end of our growth rate for our SBGs, but that's how we see it with the data that's coming through right now.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThanks very.\nMuch.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nHey, good morning everybody and welcome. Vimal.\nA couple small things here. One, I mean you guys are spending a couple hundred million a year on Quantum. Do you have a kind of an evolved vision of, you know, of where this business goes and how you can monetize it when you can monetize it? You know, is it a, you know, can the cash flow bleed go down a little bit over time or is there some kind of positive end game that you, you see here,\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nScott.\nI mean, we have publicly stated that we would like to monetize value of the Quantum investment we have made in Quantinuum. And as the markets are more ready for IPO, which probably are here for a while, we are getting prepared for that. So we are doing everything towards that end game, and the strategy hasn't changed to create more value for our shareholders at appropriate time through an IPO for that business.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay, fair enough. Just quickly following up on Steve's question. I mean, I would have thought Forge for buildings would have given you a little bit of a lift given the timing of when you rolled that out. You know, I understand project selectivity, but I would have thought that would have given you a little bit more of a tailwind into the quarter. Is there timing issues there and that those orders haven't really kicked in yet and we'll see that later in the year, or is there other competitive dynamics?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nLook, I mean we are definitely seeing better bookings for Forge for buildings, but one fact I would like to state is that business runs on a SaaS model. So even a large booking, the revenue recognition process is different from traditional perpetual license based model. So the revenue accretion is going to spread over multiple years for that and we are consciously making that decision because rather than showing a short term win, we are more biasing ourselves towards more recurring revenue model there as I stated before. So that's why you see lesser impact. But we are scoring wins in Forge for buildings and I continue to remain very bullish on that segment.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay, fair enough. Best of luck, Vimal.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you Scott.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to maybe just put a final point on Julian's point question on SPS, so obviously encouraging signs of the bottoming process here. But it does feel like the guidance embeds flat to maybe flattish ± growth in Q4. Just want to make sure that's the case and you've got good lines out on that, and maybe on HBT just break down geographically what you're seeing versus North America, Europe, and China and whether there's any channel dynamics here that we should think about as well.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nSo I'll start with HBT. Turn to Greg for response to HPS question. I think HBT from a geographic perspective.\nEurope continues to be where we want, have better outcome. I think that's a bit of a drag at this point. The strength is in high growth regions. We see strength in Middle East, India, and China in buildings. And North America is more of, I would say, sequentially no change within the business. So that's kind of our overall dynamic on the channel side. I mean the channel demand will be determined by the end market demand. So it's a very short cycle business. So we don't see any dynamics of channels having less or more inventory, at least in the HBT business maybe. Greg, you want to respond to SPS?\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. So SPS, it's likely to be down in Q4. So I would say it's not going to be flattish, it's going to be probably more like down. I think Q3 and Q2 are going to look pretty similar to one another, and then we'll get a little bit of a normal seasonal bump in Q4. So that's the way I would think about the progression for SPS top line overall.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat, thanks.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYep.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nHey, thank you. Good morning everyone.\nI was going to ask a near term question, but Vimal, given your response about margins in HBT, I wonder if we could maybe just zoom out and just kind of think philosophically about kind of the trade off between growth and margins. Right. You know, we have seen situations in the past where companies with high margins get like for lack of a better term, a little bit trapped in wanting to maintain and grow the margins. Right. And growth ends up suffering as a result. So could you and you address this to some degree obviously when we're together in New York, but could you maybe elaborate a little bit more on your philosophy relative to managing those two metrics and how you make sure you don't hinder growth by overly focusing on margins?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nJeff, our business model in HBT is combination of serving the market both through direct and channel. So we have to make choice what business we want to serve directly and what business we want to serve through channels and indirect. We want to pick projects which have a strong first-party content and aftermarket services. So given that algorithm.\nWe make choices with that rule, and we are sensitive to drive top line growth. But we are not going to compromise to book projects which are lower margins and show shiny top line growth without any margin expansion mentioned. That has been our principles. And the reason we are quite determined on the principle is, it takes one bad project to deteriorate the entire business and the portfolio. So we remain, you know, committed to that model. And I'm not suggesting that we will not see growth in Building Technologies.\nI do believe that as energy efficiency becomes more prominent across the board, our Energy business there will do well and we will deliver more growth in the project side of the house too. But that remains our overarching.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nYeah, thank you. I sort of meant the question on a total Honeywell basis also though.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nOkay. On total Honeywell basis, I mean organic growth on the top end of our range is my biggest priority. I stated that in Investor Day. One thing I want to make, my contribution in my tenure is how we grow at a higher rate. Now we are having favorable macros in two of our biggest SBGs, both in Aero and PMT. So on the strength of that and if we couple that with the right new products, I see no reason that we should be delivering our growth in upper end of our 4 to 7 algorithm. And that's what I work on every day and continue to drive our new product execution and then M&A accelerating our overall growth algorithm. You know, that that remains my top concern commitment.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nThank you for the perspective.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.\n\nJosh Pokrzywinski\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nHey Josh.\n\nJosh Pokrzywinski\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey.\nJust want to maybe flip around the HBT question from the other perspective on PMT. I mean, you're seeing some of the bulk chemical guys go through destocking. You know, I think traditional oil spending has been okay, but maybe not as strong as what you guys are seeing in some of the other process guys are seeing. I guess just how much are we getting away from kind of traditional oil versus either some of these megaprojects or energy transition. Is this business really transcending its roots of even kind of five, six, seven years ago?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell",
    "content3": "So Josh, if I look at each of the three segments, our Automation business Process Solution has increasingly reduced its dependence on oil and gas. It has diversified very well in other end markets. Energy storage.\nThe gigafactories, metals and mining, etc. So we can see that in the growth rate of revenue generation for Process Solutions, and we remain very bullish on that business for 2023 and 2024. The UOP segment, our strategy has been to grow our business into sustainable technology, renewable fuels, clean hydrogen, carbon capture. And we see pretty strong bookings in our, you know, sustainable technologies business. Just as a data point, now we have licensed 40 renewable fuel projects till Q3, and on a path to be 50 by, I would say, Q1 2024, which I mentioned in a couple of earlier investor meetings.\nSo UOP business is becoming also less linked to traditional refining petrochemicals, but fast moving towards renewable technology. And in Advanced Materials, our business is very specialty chemicals; Solstice product line continues to grow. We see.\nSome pressure in Electronic Materials, which is reflected in our overall growth rates. But we do expect that to turn back into normalcy in 2024. So overall, the extremely positive outcome and bullish view on PMT for second half 2023 and 2024, the booking rate remains strong. Backlog is very strong. New innovation pipeline is very very strong. So all good news there.\n\nJosh Pokrzywinski\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nUnderstood, thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks. Good morning guys.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nAnd so just really two quick ones, I guess, just on SPS. We've talked a little bit about the growth dynamics for the year. I'm just curious how the reduction in the short cycle businesses is perhaps impacting margins for the second half of the year. And then the other question is really around the Defense business. It's nice to see the inflection there. I'm just curious at what point do you really start to see an acceleration in Defense growth just given what you know about your production schedules.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nSo.\nThe.\nThe way we have guided it, we are, you know, short cycle orders have stabilized and we expecting similar trend over the next few months. Our guide is based upon that. We are expecting stronger performance in warehouse automation orders because our pipeline has become better. But that will really strengthen our 2024 position given the long cycle nature of the business. That's our forecast right now. We'll continue to update you if things change.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah, and I would just say, Joe, you know, we have the teams have resized their cost envelope to the current reality, and as and when the short cycle businesses reaccelerate, you know, you can imagine those are very high margin at the VCM level, and that will create a lot of acceleration from a margin rate standpoint. So the margin rates that we're going to be printing now are going to be within a tighter band until we see that acceleration come.\nBut their business is poised for it, and we'll see. Is that going to be Q4, is it going to be Q1? You know, remains to be seen, but we've sized the business properly, and there's going to be a fairly substantial leverage opportunity, you know, when that acceleration happens.\n\nSean Meakim\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Honeywell\n\nAnd then he had a question on Defense. We could see an acceleration in demand there.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYes.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nYep. So in Defense, we, our bookings remain very, very strong. So we are working our supply chain constraints there and we do expect our delivery performance to be better in second half versus first half. So we had low single digits in the first half of the year. We expect year to finish more on the mid single digits for the Defense business.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nAnd from here though, we've passed probably the comps where small increments are going to create meaningful growth from a percentage basis. So it should be all accretive from this point on.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nAnd also I should also mention we see longer term for the Defense business pretty strong demand outside the United States, as we can all imagine. The recent war in Ukraine has created more higher budgets by different countries. And we clearly see those signals coming to us in terms of demand from NATO countries, other friendly countries, and that will play out even more stronger for the Defense business in the times to come.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Good morning everyone.\nHey, just want to circle back on SPS if we could, on warehouse automation. What are you seeing in the pipeline that suggests a bottoming? And then a related question is, can you give us any sense of when you'll hit this targeted critical mass of installations that will drive that flywheel of attractive aftermarket? How close are you to that? What kind of time frame?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nSo the pipeline is growing very nicely, and that gives us a little bit more optimism on better orders performance for the business in the second half of the year. And the part where the pipeline growth is driven by much more diversified end markets we serve now, we are not limited to e-commerce. We are diversified into retail, into fashion, into logistics. So that's wider coverage is giving us better pipeline. And you know, we are anticipating good progress in the orders in the second half of the year.\nOn the aftermarket flywheel, I would say it's been working. Now we are growing double digits in aftermarket in 2023 and will cross our aftermarket business more than $0.5 billion in bookings and pretty much nearly the same revenue for the year. And we don't expect that momentum to stop. That's our strength.\nHoneywell has strong playbook on how to drive aftermarket services, and that's a value we'll continue to add into the business, and our strength in that business in 2024. Therefore, we anticipate.\nLow to moderate growth, but very strong margin expansion because we continue to build more business with more first-party content, very strong aftermarket. We coupled the two together. We do expect pretty healthy margin growth in warehouse automation business in 2024.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYes. I mean that business was around $200 million of the total in 2018. By 2022 it doubled to roughly $400 million. As Vimal said, this year it's going to be over $500 million aftermarket business. So that aftermarket is happening.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nWelcome.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.\n\nNicole DeBlaze\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah, thanks guys. Good morning.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning.\n\nNicole DeBlaze\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nJust maybe on PMT, if you guys could talk a little bit more about the order activity you saw within UOP and HPS in the quarter. And then on the margins you talked about the challenges in Advanced Materials. I guess how does that kind of phase through the second half of the year? Thank you.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nThe orders remain pretty strong in first half for UOP and HPS, and we expect to finish here strong in both the businesses. I would say high single-digit orders growth in both UOP and HPS. I explained the rationale of it. In HPS, it's more diversified end markets and our strength of our aftermarket business there. In UOP it is diversifying to renewable technologies. As they become more and more important part of our portfolio, it continues to grow the business. UOP, the catalyst business continues to have a lot of strength in both refining and petrochemical catalyst Advanced Materials.\nAs I mentioned, 2022 was an outstanding year, 20%+ growth. Our comps year on year are tough. The margin rates are driven by some of the plant shutdown which we had announced earlier.\nSo that certainly put pressure on our cost positions, and then some contraction in Electronic Materials business, which is depressing our margins. But overall, it's a still highest margin business in the PMT portfolio. And as mentioned before, with the potential capacity expansion coming in years to come, this business is poised to perform very well in our portfolio.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah, Nicole, if you think about this year, we're literally going to progress each and every quarter so sequentially a little bit better. You know, we picked up about 110 basis points sequentially from Q1 to Q2. We expect, you know, some additional sequential improvement in Q3 and then again in Q4. So, you know, I think as we get to the end of the year, it'll look like modest year-over-year for the full year, but it's going to be a nice sequential step up quarter to quarter to quarter.\n\nNicole DeBlaze\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nThanks, guys.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nWelcome.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you.\n\nSean Meakim\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Honeywell\n\nLiz. I think we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nThis question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nGood morning, everyone.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nHey, Andrew\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nVimal, could you talk about the stepped up level of acquisitions you did in the quarter? Would you expect that kind of activity to continue over the next few quarters? Have you changed any of your methods for assessing potential acquisitions? I think, you know, given the implementation, you probably didn't. But could you talk about the pipeline of opportunities going forward?\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nLook, Andrew, the pipeline remains extremely strong. We are actively working more outbound activities in M&A and remain very optimistic if we can get the deals done at the right price. Because one thing we're not going to compromise is our deal metrics. We want to stay disciplined to create shareholder value, but at the same time, our number of opportunities in the pipeline are at a much higher elevated level compared to this time in the past. So, Anne, if you want to add any comment from your perspective.\n\nAnne Madden\n\nSVP and General Councel, Honeywell\n\nYeah, I would just add the pipeline is growing.\nIt's rich.\nWe feel good as a strategic acquirer. We maintain the view that it's a hospitable environment for strategic acquirers. We, while the private equity community still is having a harder time financing, so it's a good time for us to be a buyer and we expect that environment to continue into 2024 and beyond.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Vimal Kapur for closing remarks.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nCEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you. Our value creation framework is working. We are deploying our rigorous operating playbook to navigate near term uncertainty. Honeywell remains well positioned to outperform in any environment as we capitalize on recovering end markets combined with solid operational execution. Thank you, all our Honeywell colleagues who continue to drive differentiated performance for all our customers and shareholders. Thank you for listening, and please stay safe and healthy.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to Sean Meakim, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nSean Meakim\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Honeywell\n\nThank you, Liz. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's Q1 2023 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with me today are Chairman and CEO Darius Adamczyk, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Greg Lewis, President and Chief Operating Officer Vimal Kapur, and Senior Vice President and General Counsel Ann Madden. This webcast and the presentation materials, including non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our Investor Relations website. From time to time, we post new information that may be of interest or material to our investors on this website.\nOur discussion today includes forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of the businesses as we see them today, and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the ones described in our SEC filings. This morning, we will review our financial results for the Q1, share our guidance for the Q2, and provide our update to our full year 2023 outlook. As always, we'll leave time for your questions at the end. With that, I'll turn the call over to Chairman and CEO Darius Adamczyk.\n\nDarius Adamczyk\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on slide two. To open today's discussion, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on what our company has accomplished over the past seven years. We've consistently outperformed against the market and our peers, doubling our share price over that timeframe. We undertook a radical transformation agenda, dramatically simplifying and digitizing our operations and supply chain, resulting in a much more contemporary company, which is a platform for growth. We launched a software business, Honeywell Connected Enterprise, that continues to generate not only value for our customers, but creative growth and profitability for Honeywell.\nWe also reshaped the portfolio, spinning off three sizable businesses while selling to others and adding 16 successful acquisitions, reducing cyclicality and enhancing our margins. We reconfigured our strategic business groups to better align with end market opportunities and customer needs. We built a culture of innovation that has led to significant new breakthrough technologies and ultimately meaningfully stronger organic growth. Last, and I'm not breaking any news here, this will be my last earnings call as the CEO of Honeywell.\nAs Vimal transitions into the CEO role in just over a month, and I become Executive Chairman, it's a great example of the emphasis Honeywell places on leadership development and succession planning. With his decades of experience and success leading businesses across our portfolio, Vimal is absolutely the right person to take on the CEO mantle for Honeywell into the next phase of our transformation. I look forward to supporting him over the next year, providing him with additional bandwidth by helping with mergers and acquisitions activity, spending time with customers, and strategic planning. Our future is bright. With that said, the present is pretty good too.\nLet's turn to slide three to discuss our Q1 performance. We delivered a very strong Q1, exceeding the high end of our Q1 organic sales, segment margin, and adjusted earnings per share guidance, despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges. I'm pleased with our disciplined execution and differentiated technologies that enable us to overdeliver on our commitments. Q1 organic sales were up 8% year over year, led by double-digit growth in our Aerospace and PMT businesses, underpinned by a rigorous operational execution. The Q1 backlog grew to a new record of $30.3 billion, up 6% year over year and 2% sequentially due to continued strength in Aerospace and Performance Materials and Technologies.\nSimilar to last quarter, orders remained a very positive story in Aero and PMT, up double digits organically in each, leading to 1% organic growth and 8% sequential growth overall in Q1, overcoming the difficult year-over-year comps in HBT and SPS. We remain confident in our 2023 setup as we capitalize on recovering end markets combined with solid operational execution. Our segment margin expanded 90 basis points year over year, led by robust expansion safety and productivity solutions and Honeywell building technologies, as our strategic pricing actions enable us to remain ahead of the inflation curve, and we benefit from our productivity actions.\nExcluding the net impact of the settlements, as we discussed in our guide, free cash flow was $300 million in Q1, in line with our expectations and operationally stronger than 2022. We deployed $1.6 billion to dividends, growth CapEx, and share repurchases, including opportunistically repurchasing 3.5 million shares throughout the quarter, reducing our weighted average share count to 673 million. We also announced the acquisition of Compressor Controls Corporation this week, which Vimal will provide more detail on shortly. Looking forward, I'm encouraged by the strength we're seeing in many areas of our portfolio.\nWe continue to execute in our proven value creation framework, which is underpinned by our Accelerator operating system. I am proud of our ability to overdeliver another quarter amidst a challenging external environment. Next, let's turn to Vimal to discuss some exciting recent announcements.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nPresident and COO, Honeywell\n\nThank you, Darius, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to slide four. In February, we announced that ExxonMobil will deploy Honeywell's carbon capture technology at its integrated complex in Baytown, Texas. The plant is expected to be the largest low-carbon hydrogen project in the world at plant startup and projected to produce around 1 billion cu ft of low-carbon hydrogen per day. Honeywell technology will enable the facility to capture more than 98% of the associated CO2 emission, which will be sequestered and permanently stored by ExxonMobil.\nIn addition, Honeywell recently launched a European Clean Aviation project to develop a new generation of aerospace-qualified megawatt-class fuel cells powered by hydrogen. Green hydrogen is an extremely clean power source that can be used to propel future aircraft, which makes it particularly appealing to the aerospace sector as we work to reduce carbon emissions. Work on this project will be performed at Honeywell Technology Solution Research and Development Center in Brno, Czech Republic, and at all other Honeywell and project partner sites across Europe.\nFinally, this week, we announced a $40 million-plus win in our connected enterprise business with Globalworth, a leading real estate investor in Central and Eastern Europe. Globalworth is using Honeywell's Forge for building technology to help monitor energy consumption down to a device or asset level across their commercial office buildings in Romania, and Poland, while maintaining occupant comfort and productivity. Our solution will help reduce operating costs and lower energy consumption, key outcome for Europe's overarching climate objectives.\nThese existing technologies provide us with a new growth vector while reinforcing Honeywell's sustainability message, demonstrating how we are helping the world solve its toughest challenge across all our end markets. Now, let's turn to slide five to discuss an exciting new acquisition we just announced this week. On Wednesday, we announced an agreement to acquire Compressor Controls Corporation, in short, CCC, a leading provider of turbomachinery control and optimization solutions, including control hardware, software, and services for $670 million in all cash transactions.\nCCC technologies primarily serve the LNG, gas processing, refining, and petrochemical segment and will bolster Honeywell's high-growth sustainability portfolio with new carbon capture control solutions where the same turbomachinery is used to achieve effective removal of CO2 from the process plant emissions. This acquisition will be integrated into Honeywell's process solution business and strengthen Honeywell's leadership in industrial control, automation, and process solutions, enabling customers to accelerate their energy transition.\nCCC's EBITDA margins are accretive to Honeywell, and we expect to achieve a cash-basis return on investment of more than 15% by fifth year that CCC is part of Honeywell. The transaction represents 15x 2023 expected EBITDA on a tax-adjusted basis and 13x EBITDA, assuming 8 million of annualized cost synergies. I'm excited about the new technologies and adjustments we have unlocked through this latest transaction. We said before that we have an active M&A pipeline, and this is further evidence that we are continuously enhancing our automation portfolio by investing in new opportunities. Now, let's turn to slide six to discuss the Q1 results in more detail. As Darius mentioned, we delivered a strong Q1 result despite a dynamic economic backdrop.\nOur operational agility enabled us to exceed our financial commitments. Q1 sales grew 8% organically with double-digit growth in PMT and Aero, where we generated continued volume improvement on a strong demand and an improving supply chain. In fact, volume grew 2% for overall Honeywell in the Q1, despite an impact of traffic activity levels in our long-cycle warehouse automation business. Excluding SPS, volumes were up 7% for Q1. Our backlog grew 6% year over year and 2% sequentially, and our orders grew 1% organically and 8% sequentially, driven by long-cycle strength in Aero and PMT.\nSupply chain remains a constraint on our overall growth. However, Aero saw further output improvement, and we saw positive backlog reduction across all our short-cycle businesses. In addition to strong organic growth, we expanded segment margins by 90 basis points year over year to 22%. We continue to reap benefits from our investment in Honeywell's digital that have enabled us to stay ahead of the inflation curve through the strategic pricing action. Despite the top-line headwinds, SPS led the other SPGs with the largest segment margin expansion as a benefit from the right-sized cost base.\nNow, let's spend a few minutes on the Q1 performance by business. Aerospace sales for the Q1 were up 14% organically, led by 20% growth in commercial aviation, the fifth straight quarter of at least 20% organic growth, and the eighth straight quarter of double-digit growth. Sales growth was strongest in commercial aviation aftermarket, where continued flight hour recovery resulted in increased spare shipments and repair and overhaul sales, particularly in air transport. Commercial Original Equipment sales were also increased double-digit, driven by higher business and general aviation sales.\nDefense and Space returned to growth in Q1 as we were able to convert our strong 2022 orders book increase sales volume. Book-to-bill in Defense & Space remained greater than one in the quarter. As expected, the Aero supply chain continued to make modest progress sequentially. Improvements in material availability from the lower supplier decommitment rates enabled us to increase our original equipment and spare shipment by 20% year over year in Q1. Our positive backlog remains a historically high level, as expected, with plenty of volume yet to be unlocked.\nSegment margin in Aerospace contracted 80 basis points year over year to 26.6%, driven by higher sales of lower margin original equipment products, partially offset by our commercial excellence effort and volume leverage. Performance Materials and Technologies orders grew organically across all three businesses ahead of our expectations, led by over 20% growth in UOP. We remain particularly excited about traction in our Sustainable Technology Solutions business, where orders doubled year over year. For sales, PMT grew 15% organically in the quarter, with double-digit growth in all three segments of the PMT portfolio.\nThis was the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic growth in PMT. UOP grew 19% organically in the quarter, led by refining catalyst shipment and gas processing, partially offset by lower refining and PET chem equipment volumes. Process Solutions grew 16% organically, driven by strength in projects and smart energy. In Advanced Materials, sales grew 12% in the quarter, as we saw another quarter of robust demand in Fluorine products that more than offset some softness in our electronic materials business.\nSegment margin contracted 20 basis points year over year to 20.6% as a result of cost inflation, higher sales of lower margin products, and a previously communicated disruption in one of our PMT plants that caused some unplanned downtime, partially offset by commercial excellence and volume leverage. Safety and productivity solution sales decreased 11% organically in the quarter. Sales decline was led by warehouse and workflow solutions, and productivity solutions and services. The aftermarket services portion of our integrated business continues to perform well as expected, with sales growing greater than 20% in the quarter at accretive margins.\nThe sensing portion of our sensing and safety technologies business remains a bright spot in the portfolio. Continuing on the trend from last year, segment margin for SPS was once again a standout in the quarter, expanding 270 basis points to 17.2% as a result of productivity actions and commercial excellence, partially offset by lower volume leverage, and inflation. In building technologies, sales increased 9% organically in the quarter, with growth in both building products, and building solutions.\nProject sales were up double digits for the fourth consecutive quarter as we continue to convert our strong backlog. Services volumes also increased in the quarter, resulting in 13% organic sales growth in building solutions. Turning to our product portfolio, the supply chain is improving as expected. Building products grew 7% organically year over year to continue to strengthen our world-class fire franchise. HBT orders were stronger than expected in Q1, although down mid-single-digit year over year organically as we lap outsized 2022 comps from the height of supply chain challenges.\nWhile inflation remains elevated and our strong building solution sales presented with mixed headwinds, our commercial excellence and productivity effort allow us to mitigate these challenges and expand HBT segment margins by 170 basis points to 25.2%. Growth across our portfolio continues to be supported by accretive results in Honeywell Connected Enterprise, an ongoing indicator of the power of strong software franchise. Robust overall growth was driven by double-digit growth in cyber, industrial, Aerospace, and connected building. The future outlook is also strong due to double-digit growth in orders. Overall, this was a great result for Honeywell.\nAdjusted earnings per share in the Q4 grew 8% to $2.07, $0.11 above the high end of our Q1 guidance and up 16%, excluding pension headwinds. Segment profits drove $0.21 of year-over-year improvement in earnings per share, the main driver of our EPS growth. Excluding the pension headwinds, below the line and other added $0.03 year-over-year. A lower adjusted effective tax rate contributed $0.02 of improvement and reduced share count added an additional $0.05 for total EPS, excluding the pension impact of $2.22. This was offset by $0.15 headwind from a lower pension income.\nA bridge from adjusted EPS from Q1 2022 to Q1 2023 can be found in the appendix of this presentation. We made good progress on cash for Q1. Reported cash flow for the quarter was negative $1 billion due to payment of settlements signed in Q4 of 2022, which we signaled in our guidance call. Excluding the net impact of these settlements, we generated $300 million of free cash flow up from $50 million in the Q1 of last year. This increase was driven by improved working capital, including more favorable payables and inventory balances. As we discussed, our inventory planning focus will be a major contributor to our cash performance in 2023, and we are off to a promising start.\nSo overall, Honeywell operating playbook continues to deliver strong results, and that combined with our differentiated portfolio of solutions will enable us to drive compelling growth in earnings and cash for the quarters to come. Now, let me turn it over to Greg as we move to slide seven to discuss our Q2 and full-year guidance.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nThanks, Vimal, and good morning, everyone. As we look to the rest of 2023, our original guidance framework continues to be solid. We delivered above our Q1 guide as we navigated known risks and have raised the year to reflect that. Our demand profile remains robust with record backlog and favorable order trends in Aerospace and PMT. We continue to monitor the macroeconomic backdrop and its impact on our shorter-cycle businesses, and our rigorous operating principles enable us to stay agile to outperform through another challenging year. For our Q2 sales guidance, we expect to be in the range of $9.0 to 9.2 billion, up 1% to 4% on an organic basis.\nWe now expect full-year sales of $36.5 to 37.3 billion, which represents an increase of $500 million in the low end and $300 million in the high end from our prior guidance, incorporating our strong Q1 results. We're raising our organic growth range now at 3% to 6%, and we continue to expect a greater balance of price and volume versus last year and have upgraded our full-year expectations in Aero while softening our outlook for SPS to reflect the demand we're seeing.\nMoving to our segment margin guidance, we expect the Q2 to be in the range of 21.8% to 22.2%, resulting in year-over-year margin expansion of 90 to 130 basis points due to continued benefits from our improving cost position and business mix in SPS and commercial excellence in PMT. For full-year 2023, we're upgrading our segment margin expectations by 10 basis points in the low end to a new range of 22.3% to 22.6%, or 60 to 90 basis points of year-over-year expansion. Our rigorous fixed cost management and favorable price-cost strategies remain key elements of our operating playbook, helping us to drive margin expansion.\nNow, let's take a moment to walk through the Q2 and full-year expectations by segment. Looking ahead for Aerospace, demand across our end markets remains very encouraging. We expect modest sequential sales growth in the Q2 as flight hours continue to improve, with particular strength in commercial aftermarket. This flight hour growth, enhanced by further recovery in wide-body aircraft as international travel recovers, will lead commercial aftermarket to be our strongest end market for sales in 2023.\nOn the commercial OE side, we also expect strong volume growth as build rates, particularly for business and general aviation OEs, continue to trend upwards. In Defense & Space, we passed the growth inflection point in Q1, and we expect similar organic growth rates throughout the year as we convert our strong defense order book into sales. While the demand environment supports rapid top-line acceleration, the pace of sales growth throughout 2023 will ultimately be determined by the rate of recovery in the Aero supply chain. Our expectation for the supply chain remains unchanged: modest, steady improvement each quarter.\nReduced decommits from suppliers should allow for sequential improvements in factory output. Given the positive signs from the supply chain and continued strength in our order book, we now expect Aero organic sales growth in the low double-digit range and upgrade from our outlook last quarter of high single digits to low double-digit growth. However, we anticipate most of the incremental sales strength to come from our OE business, resulting in modest mix pressure on margins. We now expect Aero segment margins to be flattish for the full year.\nIn Performance Materials and Technologies, the constructive outlook across our end markets will continue to drive favorable growth. For Q2, we expect sales to increase sequentially and year over year, led by continued strength in our projects and Smart Energy businesses within Process Solutions, as well as Lifecycle Solutions and Services. This strength will likely continue throughout the year, supporting strong growth for Process Solutions overall. In advanced materials, continued demand for fluorine products will enable us to capitalize on our capacity expansion investments we made in 2022, though we still expect to see some softness in electronic materials until the second half of the year.\nIn UOP, our growth outlook is supported by robust demand for gas processing equipment, and we see increasing global demand for our sustainable technology solutions as legislation has improved project economics. For the full year, another quarter of strong orders and backlog growth gives us confidence in our sales expectations, although more challenging comps moving forward mean that the Q1 will likely be the largest in terms of organic growth. We still expect sales for overall PMT to be up mid-single digits for the year. Segment margin and PMT should expand sequentially in the Q2 and throughout the second half, leading to modest expansion for the year.\nLooking ahead for SPS, we are expecting low double-digit year-over-year declines in the Q2 as we see continued impact from the decline in investment for new warehouse capacity and short-cycle demand softness in our products businesses. However, we expect sales to grow sequentially from the Q1, led by strength in Sensing and Safety Technologies. The aftermarket services portion of our Intelligrated business continues to grow at strong double-digit rates, and we anticipate this trend continuing throughout the year.\nIn our short-cycle businesses, the demand outlook for 2023 is a bit more challenged than we initially anticipated, and as a result, we now expect SPS to be down high single digits, lower than our initial guidance last quarter of down mid-single digits to high single digits. However, from a margin standpoint, we still anticipate another solid year for SPS as we see the results of our operational improvements and as sales mix continues to improve, as evidenced in our Q1 results. In building technologies, we are encouraged by our strong start to the year and the overall execution in the business.\nFor the Q2, sales should improve sequentially and lead to modest year-over-year growth as the supply chain environment continues to slowly improve, allowing us to further work down the past due backlog we built last year in our building products business. We expect this robust backlog, along with stimulus-led institutional demand in verticals such as airports, healthcare, and education, to remain resilient throughout the year. On the building solution side, we are encouraged by the strong demand for our building services, and we see our long-cycle building solution sales likely outpacing product sales in 2023.\nFor overall HBT, while we delivered high single-digit growth for the Q1, comps get harder as we progress throughout the year, given that the impacts from our supply constraints were most acute in the first half of 2022, and we maintain our full-year sales outlook of low single-digit organic growth, although, as we've said previously, we'll continue to monitor orders for Q2 and may have an upgrade opportunity after we complete the Q2. HBT remains well aligned to emerging secular themes of sustainability and energy efficiency, and we see runway for growth acceleration as we exit 2023. For HBT's segment margins, we still expect year-over-year expansion in 2023 as we maintain our momentum for the Q1.\nTurning to our other core guided metrics, net below-the-line impact, which is the difference between segment profit and income before tax, is expected to be in the range of - $130 to -185 million in the Q2 and -$500 to -625 million for the full year. This guidance includes a range of repositioning between $50 and $100 million for Q2 and $225 to 325 million for the year as we continue to fund attractive restructuring projects and properly position Honeywell for the future. We expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be roughly 21% in the Q2 and for the year, and the average share count to be around 671 million shares in Q2 and approximately 670 million shares for the full year.\nEarlier this week, the board approved a $10 billion share repurchase authorization, providing us with continued flexibility on the best way to deploy our balance sheet. As a result of these inputs, our adjusted earnings per share guidance range is between $2.15 and $2.25 for the Q2, up 2% to 7% year-over-year. For full-year EPS, we are upgrading the low end of our guidance range by $0.20 and the high end of our guidance range by $0.05 to a new range of $9.00 to 9.25, up 3% to 6%, reflecting our continued confidence that 2023 will be a strong growth year for Honeywell despite the year-over-year pension headwinds. Excluding these headwinds, EPS growth will be 9% to 12% up for the year.\nWe still expect to meet our original free cash flow guidance of $3.9 to 4.3 billion in 2023, or $5.1 to 5.5 billion, excluding the net impact of settlements. So in total, we executed a strong Q1 with outperformance across all guided metrics and are raising our full-year 2023 organic sales growth, segment margin, and adjusted EPS guidance ranges. Now, let's turn to slide eight, and I'll hand the call back to Darius for some closing thoughts before we move to Q&A.\n\nDarius Adamczyk\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you, Greg. In summary, we're off to a strong start to 2023, over-delivering across the board versus our guidance, allowing us to meaningfully raise our full-year guidance for organic growth, segment margin, and earnings per share. Our value creation framework is working. The macroeconomy remains uncertain, but we continue to grow our record backlog, and executing on it provides significant runway in the near term. Honeywell remains well-positioned to outperform in any environment. Thank you to all of our Honeywell colleagues who continue to drive differentiated performance for our customers and shareholders. With that, Sean, let's move to Q&A.\n\nSean Meakim\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Honeywell\n\nThank you, Darius. Darius, Greg, Vimal, and I are now available to answer your questions. We ask that you please be mindful of others in the queue by only asking one question. Liz, please open the line for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nOur first question comes from a line of Steve Tusa at JPMorgan.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Good morning.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nPresident and COO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning.\n\nDarius Adamczyk\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nCongrats again, Vimal, on the change.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nPresident and COO, Honeywell\n\nThanks.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nI guess your first call is going to be, I guess, the Q2. But on that front, maybe give us some color on the sequential trends as far as earnings are concerned for the rest of the year: Q2, Q3, and Q4, just to kind of level set everybody after this pretty strong Q1.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nPresident and COO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. So sequentially, as Greg gave you the full-year view, we do expect the growth momentum to continue, even though at a slightly different rate. Part of it is we had a pretty strong quarter in PMT and HPT prior year, so we are dealing with the tough comps. So there is certainly going to be some revenue comparison issues there. Aero will be very strong, and SPS, as we guided, will be moderated performance over the rest of the year. But overall, we remain confident on our new guide of 3% to 6% organic growth rate, and we'll work hard to perform on that. Greg, if you want to add anything?\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. No, I think you hit it. I mean, the Q2, we're going to be really nice results, I think, across the portfolio, albeit we're just coming off of four quarters of significantly strong double-digit growth in PMT for four straight quarters, HPT at high single digits for three to four straight quarters. But the underlying business performance going forward is going to be really healthy.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nSorry. So what's the sequential performance for EPS? Should we think about that as kind of in line with normal seasonality or seasonality across the quarter?\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. When you look at our- [crosstalk]\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHow do we think about the phasing of EPS for the rest of the year? Yeah.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nWhen you look at EPS sales, I mean, we're going to be roughly in line with our normal kind of percentage of the year in those quarters. This year and last year a little bit heavier in the back half. This year a little less so, but it's not going to look out of the norm.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nWhat is the norm? Just can you just remind us? Because it's been a couple of years of.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nWell, you're asking about many different metrics, so it depends on which one you're talking about.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nEPS. EPS. EPS. EPS.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. I mean, when you look at it right now, we're going to have a little bit of a heavier back end of the year. Q4 will probably be bigger than second and third, but the second and third will be within spitting distance of one another, roundabout.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks a lot for the color.\n\nOperator\n\nYou're good. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi. Good morning. Maybe.\n\nDarius Adamczyk\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGood morning. Just wanted to try and understand, dialing in on the Q2 for a second. So you've got a smaller than maybe normal sequential sales increase. It doesn't sound like that's anything sort of macro or demand-related. It's maybe more on supply, so any extra color on that. And also, it looks like you're guiding for sort of sales to be up sequentially in Q2 firm-wide somewhat, but flat margins. So is that just something around maybe Aero OE mix? Just any thoughts on that, please.\n\nDarius Adamczyk\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. Julian, if you actually look at the historical revenue sort of step from Q1 to Q2, it's very much in line with what we've done historically. Now, last year was a bit of an anomaly given that it was more heavily impacted by some of our supply chain challenges. But if you look at the historical graduation from Q1 to Q2, it's very much consistent and in line with that if you look at the prior year averages.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. No, I mean, we've grown anywhere from 4% to 7%, quarter to quarter sequentially. This guide has us right in like a 3% to 4% range. Last year, we had a really big step up in PMT. It's a little bit less in Q2 this year, but again, very much within historical parameters. And from a margin perspective, again, last year we went down in margin rate from Q1 to Q2. So our guide is solidly within our Q1 performance. I think at the top end, we're up 20 basis points. At the bottom end, we're down 20. So it's frankly right in the norm. So I wouldn't read too much into it.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThanks very much. And then just my follow-up would be around the SPS piece, sort of updated thoughts on that second-half outlook, particularly the PSS portion, kind of how are you looking at that in the second half on revenue versus warehouse, and if there's been any change in your warehouse growth or sales assumptions for the year. Thank you.\n\nDarius Adamczyk\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. So I mean, let's kind of take this piece by piece. I mean, in terms of PSS, I mean, we've kind of actually seen sequential improvement off of Q4, so we think that that business is back on the rise, and we saw that sequentially. So I think that that's very much consistent with our assumptions and very much in line with our expectations. When it comes to IGS, that market continues to be relatively soft. But having said that, our core activity and our opportunity activity is significantly increasing for Q2, Q3, and Q4 because as we look forward in the pipeline, that continues to get better and better. So we're cautiously optimistic that we're going to see much better order trends as we head into the last three quarters of the year.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nPresident and COO, Honeywell\n\nYep. No, I think Darius put it quite well. Look, this is IGS revenue for this year is kind of already locked given the long nature of the business here. We're really working hard to secure a good base of orders for 2023 so that we can print a good year for 2024 ahead. And one thing I can assure, we're not going to lose share. So it's more on the market. As the market recovers, we will get our fair share of demand.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOh, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for the question.\n\nDarius Adamczyk\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nHey. Good morning, I guess. Maybe just be a little clearer on kind of what surprised to the upside. And it sounds like it's partly supply chain, but it also sounds like it's partly demand. So maybe just talk about that. And we saw a pretty significant uptick in accounts receivable on the balance sheet, which might indicate the March was perhaps particularly strong. So maybe just talk about that as well.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nSure. Let me take that. So if you think about our guidance 90 days ago, we talked about really three specific risks that we were watching. One was China with Chinese New Year and concerns about whether everyone was going to go home and then come back and wind up with lockdowns in China. It didn't happen. Things turned out quite well. There was really no disruption in China at all. Second one was really, again, Aerospace and were we going to get a substantial sequential improvement in output? And we did.\nWe were up 20% in our output in Aerospace year over year, which was above the high end of our guidance and was quite strong. And then the third one was PMT. And we talked about the fact that in December, we had some challenges with a freeze in the Louisiana area with some of our factories there, and we had an outage early January, which we needed to shut down a plant and bring it back up again. It came up quite well. In fact, on time, and after the plant was restored, it was operating at levels that were greater than before the outage even occurred. That's why what you're seeing is essentially PMT and Aerospace in particular drove probably over $100 million each on the top end of our own guide in terms of the revenue outlook.\nThose are things that we were conscious of and were watching and managing where we could, and things turned out quite well. That was really good. Then again, as you mentioned, accounts receivable goes up. As you recall, 50% of our revenues in any quarter, or in the last month of the quarter, we had a really strong revenue performance. AR goes up, and we've got a lot of receivables here to collect in April, and I'm sure that will bode well for strong cash here in Q2.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat. Thanks, Greg. I'll leave it there with one question.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYep.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research.\n\nDarius Adamczyk\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nHey. Good morning, guys.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning.\n\nDarius Adamczyk\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nAnd welcome, Vimal.\nGuys, the announced buyback is pretty darn large, $10 billion's a big number. And we're hearing chatter from kind of other companies here and there that M&A is just starting to get into a little bit of a sweet spot where valuations are starting to make a little bit more sense, and PE is less competitive, of course. How do you guys think about your pipeline of deals that's out there and the optionality versus kind of the guide, I think, of share countdown, kind of 1% ballpark means you may not be going in and hitting the bid on that $10 billion right away. But how do you think about the ebb and flow of the buyback versus that M&A? And perhaps the big question there is, what's your backlog and pipeline look like? And I'll stop there. Thanks.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nHey, Scott, real quick, just what you saw with the $10 billion authorization, that is what we always do. We work our authorization down to about a $2 billion range, and then we, frankly, almost as a matter of course, re-up it to $8 or 10 billion. And so you should view that as us just doing our normal restacking of our buyback authorization to give us the flexibility that we always have. So there was nothing abnormal in that at all in terms of the cycle of the way we operate. But I'm sure Darius will talk about the capital allocation aspect.\n\nDarius Adamczyk\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nYeah, I mean, in terms of our framework, you've got to remember, we are holding to the framework of 1% min buyback per year on average. And we've done that. We've stuck to that. And I think that's very, that $10 billion authorization continues to underpin that kind of an algorithm. So I think I wouldn't look too much or too little into it. It's just supportive of that. And we're going to continue to buy back shares as we see the priced aggressively, and we'll do at least 1%. On the M&A, which I think is the more important question, I think I've always said there's time to be a buyer and there's a time to be a seller.\nI have not seen a better time, at least since I've been CEO, to be a buyer. You saw one deal we did this past week. I think that it's an opportunity for us to be much more active. The pipeline is probably better than it's ever been. I think we've got some interesting bolt-ons that we're looking at that hopefully we're going to be able to close here in the next few months.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nDarius, just natural follow-up. It's quite a statement. Never seen a better time to be a buyer. I don't think I've ever heard you say anything in that context or that bullish in your tenure. Would you consider going up in size? You just said bolt-ons, but perhaps something a little bit more larger in the pipe?\n\nDarius Adamczyk\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nWell, I mean, I think we said the bolt-on for us is up to a $5 billion, $6 billion, $7 billion range. So I would say that that's decent in size. The reason I'm more bullish is, look, the cost of money has gone up significantly. I mean, you see the interest rates, and frankly, the competition is different. The competition for assets now is primarily strategics. A lot of the PE activity is not, I wouldn't say it's nonexistent, but it's not nearly as strong as it used to be. And I think it's smart to be a buyer or a seller in various cycles of economic conditions and interest rates. And I think right now, I think it's smart to be a little bit more aggressive on being a buyer.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nVery encouraging. Thank you. I'll pass it on, guys. Good luck.\n\nDarius Adamczyk\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Directors, Jefferies\n\nThank you. And good morning, everyone. Maybe bigger picture as well. Can you talk about what you guys are seeing, Darius, across the pricing portfolio? I think, Greg, you mentioned pricing contributed six points to organic growth of eight, including SPS. How does pricing balance out in volume throughout the remainder of the year, and how do you see it playing across the segments?\n\nDarius Adamczyk\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. I mean, I think you saw kind of a 6/2 mix as we move forward. I think, frankly, we're still projecting to be about a 4% price impact for the year. So obviously, pricing is going to become a bit tougher in the second half of the year as we kind of lap some of those comps. But overall, pricing is going to continue to be a significant value driver for our results given the differentiation, and the technologies that we have within our portfolio.\nSo that's kind of how we see the setup. Obviously, coming off a 6% and projecting forward for the year, we expect something a bit lower in the second half. But that's all very much within the algorithm that we expected for the year. And I actually gained confidence in that algorithm given our raise both in the bottom, and top end of our ranges. I don't know, Greg, if you want to.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. No, I think you said it. This is not really that different from what we talked about, and we have positive price every quarter of this year. So no concerns in that. Again, we've talked about it for the last six, nine months. As inflation settles down a little bit, there are going to be pockets where it won't be as necessary as it was a year ago. And so that's what you're seeing. That's what you're seeing now.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Directors, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone.\n\nDarius Adamczyk\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nGood morning too.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nHey. Good morning. Just a two-parter on kind of Aero OE. I mean, it looks like you're making pretty good progress, as you stated, and you acknowledged some supply chain issues. But I was a little surprised when your customers called you out by name yesterday. I'm just wondering if there's something Honeywell-specific that's hung up from a delivery standpoint, or you would just kind of point your finger further down the line to your suppliers. That's just kind of part one, if you could add any color there. And then just also on OE kind of incentive payments and the like, where do we stand for 2023 now? Is this still kind of peak year for headwinds, or does some of that maybe move into 2024 if deliveries aren't quite what you thought they might be?\n\nDarius Adamczyk\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. So let me kind of start with the first part of your question. I think as we look at our output, it's ranges depending upon whether it's avionics or some of the mechanical things. We're up anywhere from 20% to 40-plus%. So I think we're actually very pleased in terms of the output. I can assure you that in terms of the bottlenecks, it's not Honeywell. It's not sort of throughput to our facility. So we have a lot of issues with our supply base as well, and frankly, some of those being large public companies. I'm not going to sit here and call them out on a call like this. Frankly, it's our responsibility, and it's our job to deliver.\nI'm not going to use somebody else as an excuse for us not delivering. That's our job to manage. Frankly, earnings call is not the right place to actually have those kinds of discussions. So we're going to work at it. We own it. I know the supply chain in Aerospace is not perfect. It's getting better, and it's getting better relatively quickly, probably even better than we anticipated. But there's work to do. There's four or five layers of the supply chain, and what we're seeing and feeling flows down to our suppliers. We're still getting some very inconsistent supply base. I mean, our decommit rate went from being 19%, 20% Q4 down to 15%.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nPresident and COO, Honeywell\n\nBut 15% is still not good, but improving, and we're making those improvements. We've launched hundreds and, I mean, literally hundreds of people into our supply chain to assist our suppliers and, frankly, probably put more time and effort to be responsive to the needs of our OE base. And I don't know, Greg.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. On the incentive side, we're not making any adjustment to our expectations as far as that is concerned. It's still very early in the year. As far as we know, OE deliveries are still going to be roughly in the range of what we had anticipated as we opened the year. And like you said, we expect this year is probably the peak, and then it's going to flatten out or come down slightly next year but still be relatively high. Should that shift left to right a little bit, we'll see. But at this moment, we're keeping our expectations as they were.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nPresident and COO, Honeywell\n\nI think one point I wanted to add was that the diversity of our portfolio in Aero is quite unique. We supply engines, avionics, navigation equipment, lighting, brakes. The list goes on. So due to diversity, our volume is growing overall, but there could be some category where the growth is slightly less versus others. And I think that puts us in a unique position on how we get viewed by our customers because they obviously want growth to occur consistently across all product lines. So I want to have that appreciation that our diversity is one of the unique factors compared to our peer group here.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nGreat. Thanks for that color. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks. Good morning, everybody.\n\nDarius Adamczyk\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nHey, Jeff. Good morning.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nSo just wanted to stay on Aero for my one question. I guess as you think about the margins for the year, you guys talked about flat margins, but that started the year off down. And what's expected to improve as the year progresses? Is there friction associated with the supply chain that's impacting the margins today? Because your aftermarket business is growing faster than OE. So just any color on what gets better in Aero from a margin standpoint as the year progresses.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. Sure. I mean, think about it this way. The first and most basic one is volume leverage, right? We are very much in control of our fixed cost, and revenue is going to go up each and every quarter sequentially, and it will have a crescendo in probably the highest quarter in Q4. So just by that alone, we're going to get some volume leverage. So there's not any big changes from one quarter to the next that I would call out from a mixed perspective. Now, again, that can always fluctuate as time goes by. But the single biggest thing that you should expect is really around volume leverage. It's fairly simple.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay. Great. Good enough. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director and Electrical Equipment Equity Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone.\n\nDarius Adamczyk\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nGood evening.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director and Electrical Equipment Equity Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHey, Darius. Since this is your last call, I just want to say congratulations on your run as CEO. And look, all CEOs want to go out on a strong note and leaving the company in good hands. And I think this quarter speaks to that. So congrats.\n\nDarius Adamczyk\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nThank you. Appreciate that.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director and Electrical Equipment Equity Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHey, for my one question on integrated aftermarket, there was always this high growth in installations, and we were waiting to get that critical mass in the installed base to start to get to the aftermarket. Have you reached that point? And what's that mix going forward between OE and aftermarket? Thanks.\n\nVimal Kapur\n\nPresident and COO, Honeywell\n\nYep. So overall, our performance on aftermarket has been double digits for the last couple of years, including this year. In fact, we are performing extremely well, I would say, in high teens. So we are at a point, to your question on the mix now, 2/3, 1/3. I think we are going towards that mix now, which is a start. I mean, this business is seven, eight years old. So if you roll the dice 15 years from now, the mix will be probably more in favor of aftermarket as we are experiencing other parts of Honeywell. But it's trending, very frankly, better than our thesis, consistently north of 15%. And we are pretty pleased with that, and margins are pretty attractive.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director and Electrical Equipment Equity Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Gautam, your line is now open. Our next question will come from Chris Snyder with UBS.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nExecutive Director, UBS",
    "content2": "Thank you. So the guidance, at least at the midpoint, seems to suggest slightly better organic growth in the back half relative to Q2 and comes despite tough comps and maybe some macro concerns out there. So could you just maybe provide some more color on the subsegments or business lines where you think you could see better organic growth relative to Q2? And also, does this dynamic maybe reflect some Q2 conservatism? The prior commentary kind of said that Q2 seasonality is coming in below normalized levels. Thank you.\n\nGreg Lewis\n\nSVP and CFO, Honeywell\n\nSure. Again, what I would tell you is Aerospace, we expect now to have some really nice sequential organic growth as the year progresses, which is going to be a big level of support for us overall. Back to Q2, it's very much in line with kind of our historical trends. And so we feel good about the guided range that we're at. In terms of the back end of the year, as far as PMT is concerned, I think we'll have a really strong back half there as well. SPS will get actually sequentially a little bit easier as the year goes by. So we'll probably hit the heights of our declines here in the first half. And the second half will get a little bit easier, and that'll take a little bit of pressure off the overall portfolio. So I think we're going to see really nice growth throughout the portfolio in three out of the four businesses, and the easing of the SPS comps will help.\n\nDarius Adamczyk\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nYeah. And the other factor is that we're gaining more and more confidence in output out of Aerospace. I mean, we're continuing to grow. The work that we've done in terms of mending the supply chain is producing results. I quoted some of the year-over-year numbers earlier. And we expect that progress to continue and even accelerate, particularly as we get into the back half of the year. So we're very confident in our outlook for the growth that we have and looking forward for signs, especially order rates for HPT, to see what that looks like because obviously, our Q1 results there were also better than expectations, both in terms of revenue as well as orders. So we'll see how Q2 goes, and that may offer some further upside.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nThank you. Appreciate that.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Darius Adamczyk for closing remarks.\n\nDarius Adamczyk\n\nChairman and CEO, Honeywell\n\nOnce more, I want to thank our shareholders for ongoing support. I valued our dialogue over the past seven years. I also want to thank the entire Honeywell family, including our colleagues, both present and past. We've built a tremendous company over the past two decades, and it's thanks to all your hard work and perseverance. It has been an honor to be able to lead this company. We delivered outstanding Q1 results.\nMore importantly, I have the utmost confidence that we'll continue to do so in the future under Vimal's leadership with the typical level of operational rigor we've come to expect from Honeywell. This company's best days remain ahead of us, and we look forward to discussing this further at our upcoming investor day next month. Thank you all for listening, and please stay safe and healthy. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

As always, we'll leave time for your questions at the end.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Chairman and CEO Darius Adamczyk.\n\nDarius E. Adamczyk\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Honeywell International Inc.\n\nThank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 2. The fourth quarter was another challenging one with supply chain constraints and inflation headwinds still at play. But Honeywell's disciplined execution and differentiated solutions enable us to deliver on organic sales, segment margins, earnings and free cash flow commitments.\nOrganic sales were up 10% year-over-year or up 11% excluding the impact of the wind-down of operations in Russia led by double-digit growth in commercial aviation, building products, advanced materials and UOP businesses, a testament to the underlying strength we're seeing across our end markets, particularly in long-cycle businesses.\nThe fourth quarter was another strong one for our backlog, which grew to a new record of $29.6 billion, up 7% year-over-year and 2% sequentially due to strength in Aerospace and Performance Materials and Technologies. Orders were also a positive story in Aero and PMT, leading to a 2% organic orders growth and 6% sequential growth in the fourth quarter. The tailwinds we'll continue to see in these 2 businesses gives us confidence in our 2023 outlook, which Greg and Vimal will share more detail about in a few minutes.\nOur segment margin expanded 150 basis points year-over-year, led by over 900 basis points of expansion in safety and productivity solutions as volumes improve and we continue to stay ahead with the inflation curve through our strategic pricing actions.\nExcluding the year-over-year impact of our investment in Quantinuum, the margin expansion was 180 basis points. Free cash flow was $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter with 125% adjusted conversion, down 18% year-over-year but delivering in line with our original guidance for the year.\nCapital deployment in the fourth quarter was $2.3 billion, including $1.4 billion of share repurchases, bringing our full year total to $4.2 billion in shares repurchased and exceeding our goal of $4 billion from our March Investor Day. For the full year 2022, we delivered outstanding results above the high end of our initial guidance for segment margin and adjusted earnings per share despite approximately $2 billion in year-over-year top line headwinds and constantly shifting macroeconomic conditions.\nWe finished the year with 6% organic sales growth, 70 basis points of margin expansion and $8.76 of adjusted earnings per share, up 9% year-over-year and above the top end of our original $8.70 guide. Orders ended the year up 8% on an organic basis, and our backlog reached an all-time high of $29.6 billion. We generated $4.9 billion of cash in the year, 14% of our revenue. The appendix of this presentation contains a slide highlighting our guidance progression through 2022 as well as our performance against these guides.\nCapital deployment for 2022 was $7.9 billion in total, in addition to the $4.2 billion in share repurchases, which lowered our weighted average share count by 2.5%. We deployed $800 million to high-return capital expenditures and $200 million on closing the acquisition of US Digital Designs.\nFinally, we maintained our dividend growth policy, paying out $2.7 billion and raising our dividend for the 13th time in 12 years. As always, we continue to execute on our proven value-creation framework, which is underpinned by our Accelerator operating system. I am confident in the strength of our backlog and the tailwinds we're seeing across our end markets, and I'm proud of our ability to execute and drive shareowner value through the current challenging environment.\nNow let's turn to Slide 3 to discuss an important development from the fourth quarter, which further improved our company's strength for the future. In the fourth quarter, we announced the final court approval of our buyout agreement with the NARCO Trust, providing the elimination of our funding obligations in exchange for our $1.325 billion cash payment to the trust. This liability has been weighing on our balance sheet since 2002, one of the numbers of legacy liabilities the company has been carefully managing.\nWe recognized the charge from the buyout in the fourth quarter, and the cash outflow took place in January. Partially offsetting the impact of the buyout is the sale of HarbisonWalker International, the reorganized and renamed entity that emerged from the NARCO bankruptcy, which announced that and will be acquired from the trust by private equity firm, Platinum Equity. We expect this transaction to be completed later in 2023, reducing the net free cash flow impact by approximately $300 million.\nThis development represents a significant improvement in our financial strength. Specifically, it simplifies our balance sheet by eliminating our evergreen funding obligations, eliminates quarterly asbestos charges related to NARCO and extinguishes any further uncertainty on our company's financial health.\nNow let me turn over to Vimal to discuss our fourth quarter results in more detail on Slide 4.\n\nVimal M. Kapur\n\nCOO & President, Honeywell International Inc.\n\nThank you, Darius, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 4. As Darius mentioned, we continue to deliver on our financial commitments despite a very challenging operating environment. In the fourth quarter, sales grew 10% organically with double-digit growth in 3 of our 4 SBGs: HPT, PMT and Aero. We generated volume improvement from third quarter in Aero and HBT despite continued supply chain constraints.\nAs expected, we are seeing some signs of demand weakness in pockets of our shorter-cycle businesses in SPS and HBT, but demand across our long-cycle portfolio remains robust with the exception of warehouse automation as evidenced by 2% organic growth in orders and 7% growth in backlog. Supply chain remains a constraint on our overall growth, but we are encouraged by another quarter of sequential volume improvement in Aero as output expanded by double digits in 4Q.\nAlongside solid organic growth came robust segment margin expansion of 150 basis point year-over-year to nearly 23% as our investment in Honeywell Digital enabled us to make a nimble and surgical approach to staying ahead of price/cost. While SPS was the lone segment to experience a decline in revenue year-over-year, the business also generated the most profitable quarter in its history, which we will discuss in more detail shortly.\nLet's spend a few minutes on the fourth quarter performance by business. Aerospace. Sales for the fourth quarter were up 11% organically year-over-year led by 23% growth in commercial aviation. This marks the second consecutive quarter of double-digit Aerospace organic sales growth and the seventh straight for commercial aviation, which gives us confidence despite the state of the Aero supply chain over the past 2 years. Supply chain remains a gating factor to volume growth, though we made a further progress this quarter with a factory output up 15% year-over-year and 14% sequentially.\nOur past-due backlog grew an accelerated pace in the fourth quarter, but this was more driven by the strength of inbound orders. Growth was highest in Commercial OE, where increased ship-set deliveries led to 25% sales growth year-over-year.\nCommercial aero aftermarket sales were up 20% in the fourth quarter as increased flight hours resulted in higher spare shipments and repair and overhaul activity. While defense volumes continued to be in the lower on a year-on-year basis in the fourth quarter, our order rates remained strong, up high single digits for the quarter and mid-single digit for the year, giving us positive momentum for 2023. Aero segment margins contracted 120 basis point to 27.8% due to higher sales of lower-margin OE products, partially offset by our commercial excellence efforts.\nBuilding Technologies delivered another outstanding quarter with 15% organic sales growth year-over-year. Modest improvement in supply chain enabled us to reduce our past-due backlog sequentially and deliver more fire products and building management systems, resulting in 21% organic growth in building products.\nHowever, supply chains still have not fully unlocked. We exited 2022 with higher past D-U-E backlogs than we entered the year and considerably higher levels than our pre-COVID norms. Building solutions sales also increased organically with double-digit organic growth in project sales for the third consecutive quarter. We finished the year with higher project backlog levels than the start of the year, providing a solid runway for 2023.\nOur continued commercial excellence in this inflationary environment enabled us to expand HBT segment margins 370 basis point to 24.8%, substantial progress nearly reaching our long-term margin target of 25%.\nPerformance Materials and Technologies sales grew 15% organically in fourth quarter despite a 4% headwind from Russia. Advanced materials grew 20% organically in the quarter as we continued to see robust value capture across the portfolio and demand in Fluorine products. The quarter was the fourth consecutive quarter where advanced materials led PMT growth.\nUOP grew 13% organically, overcoming 9% headwind year-over-year from lost Russia sales. Growth in UOP was led by refining catalyst shipments, and we also saw a double-digit sales increase in Sustainable Technology Solutions. Process technology returned to growth in the quarter as a result of strong gas processing demand. Process Solution also grew double digit in the quarter with a strength across the portfolio, led by thermal solutions, lifecycle solution and services and projects.\nIn late 2022, weather freeze caused some operational challenges at one of our plants, reducing output in the quarter. PMT orders once again grew organically in the fourth quarter, underpinned by strength in Fluorine products. Segment margins contracted 100 basis point in the quarter to 22% driven by cost inflation and higher sales of lower-margin products, partially offset by our commercial excellence efforts.\nSafety and Productivity Solutions sales decreased 5% organically in the quarter, in line with our expectation, as continued growth in sensing portion of sensing and safety technology business was offset by lower volume in warehouse automation and productivity solution and services.\nWhile Intelligrated volumes declined overall, our aftermarket services business saw another quarter of double-digit growth. PSS continues to see some demand moderation from macroeconomic conditions, but we remain confident in our differentiated solutions.\nSegment margin was a standout for SPS with expansion of 940 basis point to 20.2%, our highest ever in this business due to commercial excellence, improved sales mix, and productivity actions more than offsetting lower volume leverage and cost inflation headwinds. Growth across portfolio continues to be supported by accretive results in Honeywell Connected Enterprise. We had another quarter of double-digit revenue growth, including over 20% growth in our recurring and SaaS business year-over-year. Cyber, Sparta Systems and Connected Building all grew by more than 35% year-over-year in the quarter.\nFor the full year, [SC] sales and profit both grew by double digit, which is an indicator of the power of a strong software franchise. Overall, this is a great operational result for Honeywell. Adjusted earning per share in the fourth quarter grew 21% to $2.52, $0.01 above the midpoint of our prior guidance range.\nSegment margin drove 29% of year-over-year improvement in earnings per share, the main driver of our year-over-year growth. A lower adjusted effective tax rate contributed 10% of improvement and reduced share count added an additional $0.07. A bridge for adjusted EPS from 4Q '21 to 4Q '22 can be found in appendix of this presentation.\nMoving to cash. We generated $2.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, down 18% year-over-year but delivering the midpoint of our full year free cash flow guidance at $4.9 billion. Cash continued to be challenged by higher receivables and inventory as we continue to work through the supply-constrained environment as well as $200 million headwind from Garrett receipt in the fourth quarter of 2021. So overall, Honeywell's rigorous operating principles allowed us to manage successfully through another challenging quarter as we close our 2022.\nNow let's turn to Slide 5 to talk about where we expect to see across our end markets and the broader macro environment in 2023. Looking ahead to 2023, we see a continuation of many of the challenges we faced in 2022. But we also see ongoing progress in our key initiative to unlock more volume from our supply chain in order to meet very robust demand in several of our key end markets.\nCommercial Aerospace will continue to be a standout in terms of demand, both build rates amongst our OEM customers as well as aftermarket flight hours, particularly as widebody makes a more meaningful contribution on its way back to normalization.\nAlongside that strong demand profile, we expect steady progress of the Aero supply chain in 2022 to continue in 2023. As a result, we expect acceleration in Aero's top line growth compared to 2022, potentially achieving low double digits.\nWe continue -- we see continued tailwinds for investment in Sustainable Building Solutions, particularly through institutional channels as well in the production of both current and future energy supply as evidenced by strength in orders across both sustainable building technologies and sustainable technology solutions, including green fuels. We expect a moderation in raw material inflation but for it to remain at elevated levels. Coupled with a gradual improvement in supply chain, we should see more of a balance between volume and price to drive our top line growth in 2023.\nOur order growth of 2% decelerated in the fourth quarter compared to 8% for the full year but remained in positive territory, including sequential growth from the third quarter for Aero, PMT and SPS. Our backlog of almost $30 billion remains at record levels, growing 7% year-over-year in fourth quarter. We reduced our positive backlog in all SBGs except Aero for the second consecutive quarter, reflecting supply chain loosening and the effects of effort to mitigate part shortages.\nThe current macroeconomic uncertainty is giving some customers pause amongst our short-cycle businesses in SPS and HBT, and there's a lot of near-term uncertainty regarding how the reversal of China's Zero COVID policy will impact 1Q, particularly the potential impact of Chinese New Year, though this may be a tailwind in the second half.\nAs discussed on the third quarter call, lower noncash pension income is a headwind to EPS growth in 2023, but our underlying segment profit growth continues to look robust. Underpinning our expectation is the confidence we have in our continued operational execution, underpinned by our operating system called Honeywell Accelerator. We'll manage through another challenging operational environment with the rigor you have come to expect from us.\nNow let me turn it over to Greg as we move to Slide 6 to discuss in more detail how these dynamics come together for our 2023 financial guidance.\n\nGregory Peter Lewis\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Honeywell International Inc.\n\nThanks, Vimal, and good morning, everyone. Given the backdrop Vimal just shared, in total for 2023, we expect sales of $36 billion to $37 billion, which represents an overall organic growth sales range of 2% to 5% for the year. While we'll continue to drive pricing actions where needed to offset the impact of cost inflation, we expect more balance between the contributions of volume and price in 2022.\nSimilar to last year, we believe the first half of the year will be slower as supply chains improve sequentially throughout the year and potential headwinds from the reversal of zero COVID policies in China are strongest in the first quarter.\nIn Aerospace, the demand backdrop remains very encouraging in both commercial aviation and defense and space. In the commercial aftermarket, we expect continued flight-hour growth, particularly in widebody as international borders open and travel further normalizes to drive growth in air transport aftermarket sales. The policy change in China should provide added fuel to this dynamic.\nOn the commercial OE side, build rate schedules among the OEMs are trending upwards year-over-year, leading to more shipset deliveries for Honeywell, driving revenue growth but also translating into a corresponding increase in selection credits, a headwind to margins.\nIn Defense & Space, we plan to convert our strong order book into sales and expect Defense to return to growth in 2023 as the supply chain improves. Supply chain constraints, not demand, remain the gating factor to both commercial and Defense volume growth in 2023, but we're encouraged by the improvements our team has executed in recent months, resulting in 7% output growth in 2022.\nThe sourcing environment for electronic components in Aero improved over the past quarter, but the supply chain for mechanical components remains constrained due to skilled labor shortages among Tier 3 and 4 suppliers. We entered 2023 with Aerospace backlog levels that are more than 20% higher year-over-year, giving us confidence in our growth projections.\nFor overall Aero, we expect organic growth for the year to be in the high single-digit to low double-digit range. While Aerospace will likely be our strongest top line grower in 2023, we expect only modest margin expansion year-over-year as increased volume leverage is largely offset by unfavorable mix due to increased selection credits in the commercial OE business.\nIn Building Technologies, we're cognizant of the broader economic environment and expect private investment in nonres construction to continue to be impacted by increased financing costs. However, throughout 2022, we built a strong slate of orders partially as a result of the supply chain environment that provides solid sales visibility and buffer for 2023.\nIn addition, we believe that institutional investment will remain robust, buoyed by government stimulus funds that have not yet been deployed, supporting key verticals such as education, airports and health care. We see the most significant sales growth this year coming from building projects and building management systems as we capitalize on a robust 2022 book-to-bill in these businesses.\nWe also expect increased spot orders for our building services throughout the year as the supply chain normalizes, layering incremental demand in. For overall HPT, we remain cautious in the current environment, expecting our strong backlog to support us early in the year and anticipate low single-digit organic sales growth for 2023 overall. However, we remain very confident in our long-term framework for Building Technologies as much of our portfolio is aligned with secular trends of sustainability and energy efficiency. On the segment margins, we expect to carry the momentum from 2022's strong exit rate, resulting in year-over-year expansion for the full year.\nIn PMT, we're set up to build upon an impressive 2022 and convert favorable macro conditions into another solid year with sales growth sequentially throughout the year. Backlog built through 2022 will enable another year of growth in Process Solutions led by lifecycle solutions and services and thermal solutions.\nIn UOP, improved comps as we lap the lost Russian sales headwinds will provide support to a business that already has potential for upside. Our Process Technologies business returned to growth in the fourth quarter and is poised to continue to grow in '23, while catalyst shipments should remain robust throughout the year. Demand for new energy capacity to offset lost Russian supply will also be a tailwind, particularly for our LNG business.\nIn advanced materials, growth will continue despite difficult comps, thanks to strong demand for our Solstice products and supply chain improvements. In addition to Solstice, our other sustainable offerings will benefit from legislation, such as the Inflation Reduction Act and increased customer focus on environmental responsibility. Orders in our Sustainable Technology Solutions business have accelerated dramatically over the past 2 years, and we're expecting more of the same in '23 as we continue towards our $700 million sales target by the end of 2024.\nIn total, we expect PMT sales to be up mid-single digits for '23. PMT margins should expand modestly as a result of improved volume leverage and continued pricing and productivity actions.\nTurning to Safety and Productivity Solutions. That will be the business most impacted by the macroeconomic environment in '23. An Intelligrated decreased investment in new warehouse capacity will continue to limit near-term opportunities in our long-cycle projects business with a trough in demand likely coming this year before returning to growth in '24.\nHowever, our aftermarket services business has been growing at double-digit rates, and we expect that to continue in 2023. In productivity solutions and services, short-cycle demand softness and the distributor destocking will impact sales in the first half of '23, but we expect this dynamic to taper off and should see sequential improvement later in the year.\nIn sensing and safety technologies, sales growth will continue in '23 after a strong finish to 2022. In total, we expect SPS sales to be down mid- to high single digits for the year. From a margin standpoint, '23 should be another solid year for SPS as we continue to benefit from improved business mix and drive our operational improvements.\nWhile 4Q '22 was a high watermark for the business and will not necessarily be the new standard moving forward, we believe high-teen margin rates are achievable in 2023. So we expect our overall segment margin to expand 50 to 90 basis points next year, supported by higher sales volumes, our continued commercial excellence efforts and productivity actions.\nSimilar to last year, we expect SPS margins to expand the most as we build on our operational improvements in '22 and continue to benefit from improved mix and cost structure in that business. For the year, we expect earnings per share of $8.80 to $9.20, flat to up 5% adjusted despite an approximately $0.55 headwind from lower pension income. Excluding this impact, our adjusted EPS range would have been $9.35 to $9.75, up 7% to 11% adjusted.\nOn the free cash flow front, we expect a range of $3.9 billion to $4.3 billion in 2023 or $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion, excluding the onetime $1.2 billion net impact of NARCO, HWI and UOP matters.\nI'll walk through the puts and takes for our '23 cash flow in greater detail in a couple of minutes. But first, let's turn to Slide 7 and walk through our EPS bridge for 2023.\nAs you can see, segment profit will be the key driver of our earnings growth in '23, contributing $0.59 at the midpoint of our guidance range. Net below-the-line impact, which is the difference between segment profit and income before tax, is expected to be in the range of negative $475 million to $625 million, which includes capacity for $200 million to $325 million of repositioning, which is lower than the approximately $400 million we used in '22. For tax, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 21% for the year.\nWith these inputs below the line and other items, excluding pension, are expected to be up $0.05 per share year-over-year at the midpoint of guidance primarily driven by lower repositioning and asbestos charges, partially offset by higher net interest expense.\nFor share count, our base case for 2023 is that our minimum 1% share count reduction program will result in a benefit of approximately $0.15 per share, reducing our weighted average share count to approximately 672 million from the 683 million in 2022.\nAs we previously communicated, we expect a large decline in pension and OPEB income this year as a result of the increased interest rate environment. For the full year, we expect approximately $550 million of pension and OPEB income, down about $500 million from 2022, driving about $0.55 headwind to EPS. However, this is a noncash accounting item as our overfunded pension status will ensure that no incremental contributions are needed.\nWe ended '22 with a pension-funded status of over 125% as a result of diligent management and strong returns, a great position to be in for our employees and shareholders. In total, we expect '23 earnings per share to be in the range of $8.80 to $9.20, flat to up 5% year-on-year on an adjusted basis. However, excluding the impact of noncash pension headwinds, our guidance would be a range of $9.35 to $9.75, up 9% at the midpoint.\nNow let's turn to Slide 8 and talk about the drivers of our free cash guidance for 2023. As we've outlined in the bridge, our '23 free cash flow story can be characterized as strong operational performance offset by a few discrete nonoperational items. Income growth is the largest driver of free cash flow, and we expect to make further progress this year on working capital as the supply chain normalizes.\nWe expect '23 free cash flow, excluding the settlement of the legacy legal matters we discussed earlier, to range between $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion, up 8% year-over-year at the midpoint as we had previously spoken about. Accounting for the settlements, we're expecting free cash flow for 2023 in the range of $3.9 billion to $4.3 billion.\nNow let's turn to Slide 9, and we can discuss our guidance for Q1. As we highlighted earlier, we entered '23 with record backlog, providing a solid foundation for the first quarter. Supply chains remain constrained, however, we anticipate modest sequential improvement in volumes. We're closely monitoring the impacts of Zero COVID policy changes in China as the country reopens and eased its COVID restrictions and are wary of potential Q1 impacts. However, we anticipate that these policy changes will be a net positive for demand as we progress throughout the year and will result in a robust second half in China.\nLooking at the segments. We expect sales growth in Aerospace in the first quarter as the demand environment remains robust and we execute on our strong backlog. However, the rate of growth will be more subdued than our full year expectations as we anticipate 1Q will be the most supply-constrained for the quarter.\nIn Building Technologies, we anticipate modest organic sales growth in the first quarter as we work through our backlog, and the supply chain continues to heal. We see the strongest sales growth in building projects, followed by increased sales of Fire.\nIn PMT, we expect another quarter of year-over-year growth in 1Q. We expect that growth to be once again led by advanced materials with Process Solutions the laggard, though still with strong year-over-year growth. We're expecting -- sorry, we experienced a disruption in one of our PMT plants that will cause some unplanned downtime, though that is embedded in our guide.\nIn Safety and Productivity Solutions, short-cycle and warehouse automation demand softness will offset growth in Intelligrated aftermarket services and the sensing part of our sensing and safety technologies business, leading to a decline in year-over-year sales. However, we expect another strong margin performance in the high teens.\nSo for overall Honeywell, we anticipate sales in the range of $8.3 billion to $8.6 billion in the first quarter, up 1% to 5% organically. We expect margins in the range of 21.4% to 21.8%, up 30 to 70 basis points year-over-year as we remain diligent in our price/cost management and benefit from favorable business mix. The net below-the-line impact is expected to be between $165 million to $210 million of an expense with a range of repositioning between $80 million and $120 million as we continue to provide capacity to fund our transformational efforts.\nWe expect the effective tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 22% for the quarter and average share count to be approximately 675 million shares. As a result, we expect first quarter EPS between $1.86 and $1.96, down 3% to up 3% year-over-year or up 5% to 10%, excluding the year-over-year impact of lower noncash pension income.\nAnd lastly, while the first quarter is already historically our lowest from a free cash flow perspective, the settlement payments related to the aforementioned legal liabilities were paid out in January, and we expect cash from operations to be a net use in 1Q.\nOverall, while we maintain a prudent level of caution, we're confident in our operational abilities and our portfolio of differentiated technologies. Our portfolio is well positioned for this stage of the cycle, and we'll continue to innovate and invest in the businesses to support long-term growth.\nNow with that, I'll turn the call back over to Darius on Slide 10.\n\nDarius E. Adamczyk\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Honeywell International Inc.\n\n2022 was another year of both challenges and progress for Honeywell. Despite another host of macroeconomic and geopolitical difficulties, we attacked the challenges we faced head on. We overdelivered on our financial commitments. While 2023 brings new (inaudible), including potential recession scenarios, leading to uncertain demand in short cycle with a record $30 billion backlog, a robust balance sheet and one that has been further derisked due to the NARCO settlement and the ability to deploy capital organically and inorganically, I remain optimistic about the future of Honeywell and believe the company is well positioned to drive innovation to solve some of the world's most challenging problems.\nOne last item before we move to Q&A. I'm pleased to announce that our 2023 Investor Day will be held on May 11 in New York City. At this Investor Day, I, along with our other members of the senior management team, will provide an update on Honeywell's business strategy, exciting new growth opportunities and our long-term growth algorithm. We look forward to sharing more about Honeywell's future at that time. With that, Sean, let's move to Q&A.\n\nSean Christopher Meakim\n\nVP of IR, Honeywell International Inc.\n\nThank you, Darius. Darius, Greg, Vimal and Anne are now available to answer your questions. (Operator Instructions) Crystal, please open the line for Q&A.",

(Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to Sean Meakim, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nSean Christopher Meakim\n\nVP of IR, Honeywell International Inc.\n\nThank you, Liz. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with me today are Chairman and CEO, Darius Adamczyk; Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Greg Lewis; and President and Chief Operating Officer, Vimal Kapur.\nThis call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website at www.honeywell.com/investor. Honeywell also uses our website as a means of disclosing information, which may be of interest or material to our investors and for complying with disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.

Those elements can change based on many factors, including changing economic and business conditions, and we ask that you interpret them in that light. We identify the principal risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance in our annual report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings.\nThis morning, we will review our financial results for the third quarter of 2022, share our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2022 and provide some preliminary thoughts on 2023. As always, we'll leave time for your questions at the end.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Darius Adamczyk.\n\nDarius E. Adamczyk\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Honeywell International Inc.\n\nThank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 2. Our outstanding discipline and rigorous execution enabled us to meet or exceed guidance for all third quarter metrics amid ongoing supply chain constraints and inflation headwinds. We exceeded the high end of our third quarter adjusted earnings per share guidance range by $0.05. While navigating a challenging backdrop, we delivered organic sales growth of 9% year-over-year or 10% excluding the impact of the wind down of operations in Russia led by strong double-digit growth in our advanced materials, commercial aerospace and building products businesses, a testament to our ongoing resiliency and our rigorous operating principles.\nWe expanded segment margin by 60 basis points year-over-year to 21.8%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by 60 basis points, with margin expansion in all 4 segments as we remain ahead of the inflation curve through continued commercial excellence. Excluding the impact of our investment in Quantinuum, the margin expansion was 90 basis points year-over-year.\nOur backlog continues to be strong, up 9% year-over-year in the third quarter, led by Aero, PMT and HBT as our demand profile remains robust. Orders were down 1% on a reported basis but up 2% organically year-over-year with Aerospace and PMT orders up double digits, signaling that these end markets continue to be resilient despite the risks of a broader economic recession.\nExcluding the impact of blower Intelligrated orders, which we have talked about extensively, orders in the remainder of the portfolio were up 8% reported or 11% organically year-over-year. Our record level 2022 orders in backlog will support our growth trajectory through the fluid operating environment.\nCash was another bright spot with $1.9 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, more than double a year ago, a strong result that leaves us well positioned to deliver our full year free cash flow commitment.\nIn terms of capital, we deployed $1.2 billion to share repurchases, dividends and capital expenditures. We leveraged the strength of our balance sheet to opportunistically purchase over 2 million shares throughout the quarter, reducing our average share count to 680 million shares and continuing to execute on our commitment to buy back at least $4 billion in share in 2022.\nLooking forward, I remain encouraged by the strength we're seeing in many areas of our portfolio as we continue executing our rigorous and proven value creation framework underpinned by our accelerator operating system to drive outstanding shareholder value. I am proud of Honeywell's ability to overdeliver in another quarter amidst a challenging macro backdrop.\nNow let's turn to Slide 3 to discuss recent senior leadership additions. In September, we announced that Lucian Boldea will succeed Vimal Kapur as President and Chief Executive Officer of our Performance Materials and Technologies segment, enabling Vimal to transition full-time to his new role as Chief Operating Officer for Honeywell. Lucian joins Honeywell from Eastman Chemical Company, where he led global strategy, business operations and financial performance as Executive Vice President. Lucian began his career at Eastman as a chemist and held a variety of leadership roles at the company.\nHis diverse global experience building business both organically and inorganically and deep knowledge of the chemical process industry is invaluable for leading PMT, which is in a unique position to enhance sustainable technologies portfolio to help drive the energy transition while also taking advantage of our strong position in traditional energy markets.\nWe also announced a new addition to our Board of Directors in September. Robin Watson was elected to join the Board as an Independent Director and will serve on our Audit Committee. Robin currently is an advisory consultant for Wood Group, where he was CEO from 2016 to 2022. During his time as CEO, Robin led the transformation of Wood from an oil field services company into an integrated engineering and consultancy company spanning a variety of growing end markets and geographies. He has extensive industry experience, including in sustainable technologies such as carbon capture and hydrogen. Robin's perspective will be instrumental as we further advance Honeywell's leadership in the energy transition and broader ESG transformation.\nWe're shocked and saddened to learn that our Board member and friend, George Paz, passed away on Sunday, October 23. He has provided invaluable contributions to our company over the last 14 years. His perspective, tenacity and friendship will be greatly missed and of course, our heartfelt and deepest condolences are with this family.\nAs part of his Board service, George was Chair of our Audit Committee. Scott Davis, our Lead Director, will serve as the interim Chair of the Audit Committee of the Honeywell Board until his successor is named.\nNext, let me turn to Slide 4 to discuss our other exciting recent announcements. Earlier this month, we announced a new innovative ethanol-to-jet fuel processing technology that allows producers to convert ethanol-based feedstock to sustainable aviation fuel. The aviation industry is challenged by limited supplies of traditional feedstocks and ethanol offers producers a widely available, economically viable new feedstock. Depending on the type of ethanol feedstock used, Honeywell's ETJ process can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% on a total life cycle basis compared to petroleum-based fuel.\nIn addition, we opened 2 separate capacity expansions for our Solstice business this quarter. We recently opened the first large-scale manufacturing site for Solstice Air, a near-zero global warming potential medical propellant for use in respiratory inhalers. Solstice Air technology is up to 99.9% less GWP than propellants currently used in inhaled respiratory medicine. AstraZeneca is currently working to incorporate our Solstice Air technology into their full inhaler portfolio pending regulatory approval.\nElsewhere in our Solstice portfolio, we opened a plant in India, which has begun manufacturing our Solstice zd solution, which has uses in blowing agents for foam insulation and refrigeration liquid for chillers.\nFinally, last week, we published our first quarterly Environmental Sustainability Index, a global report showing sustainability decision makers' sentiment on progress, year ahead plans and meeting 2030 goals. 2/3 of the S&P 500 have set emissions reductions targets of some kind, and the index sheds light on past progress and future expectations towards these goals. For a long history of achievements of sustainability, Honeywell's unique position to provide this free public service. The initial survey found that approximately 97% of organizations plan to increase current year budgets in at least one sustainability category, and Honeywell remains committed to helping our customers achieve their sustainability goals.\nNow let me turn it over to Vimal on Slide 5 to discuss our third quarter operating performance in more detail.\n\nVimal M. Kapur\n\nCOO & President, Honeywell International Inc.\n\nThank you, Darius, and good morning, everyone. As Darius highlighted, we delivered strong third quarter results despite a tough operating environment. Disciplined adherence to our best-in-class Honeywell value creation framework provided us with operational agility to meet or exceed our guided financial metrics. Third quarter sales grew by 9% organically or 10%, excluding the wind down of our operations in Russia. The performance was driven by double-digit organic growth in HBT, PMT and Aerospace.\nDemand trend remains strong with backlog near record levels. However, ongoing supply chain constraints continue to temper overall volume growth. We did see modest sequential improvement in volume causing our positive backlog to decrease in SPS, HBT and PMT as we benefit from our reengineering effort to qualify alternative parts and our proactive partnering with distributors and alternative suppliers to ensure priority sourcing. Our readiness efforts in Aero also enabled single-digit sequential improvement in output.\nWe continue to reap benefits of Honeywell digital transformation investments made over the past few years. We leverage these digital tools to drive commercial and operational actions, which enabled us to stay ahead of inflation curve and helped us expand segment margin by 60 basis points year-over-year to 21.8%. We are also starting to see some benefits in inventory from our digital and process improvements in planning and scheduling.\nNow let me share a few comments on third quarter performance by business. Aerospace sales for the third quarter were up 10% organically year-over-year as commercial aviation sales grew double digits for the sixth consecutive quarter despite ongoing supply chain challenges. In fact, if we had held past due backlog flat sequentially for the quarter, we could have delivered an additional 9% of organic sales growth.\nCommercial aftermarket demand remains robust with continued flight or recovery, leading to increased payer shipment and repair and overhaul sales. Both air transport aftermarket and business and general aviation aftermarket sales grew over 20% organically in the quarter. Commercial original equipment sales increased 30% year-over-year, including approximately 50% growth in our air transport original equipment, driven by increased chipset deliveries to these customers.\nDefense volumes were down in the quarter, but we believe 2022 will be trough for this business as our elevated backlog position and an expected increase in defense spending support recovery in coming years. Aero segment margin expanded 40 basis points to 27.5% as our commercial excellence effort more than offset our cost inflation.\nBuilding Technologies was our fastest-growing business in the third quarter with 19% organic sales growth. Sales of our fire products and building management system remains strong, resulting in 23% organic growth in building products portfolio, the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. In building solutions, the sales grew 13% as project volume increased despite ongoing part shortages.\nWhile supply chains have not fully unlocked and significant material constraints remain, we did see sequential improvement in volumes for the third consecutive quarter, a sign that supply chains are moving in the right direction. Backlog in our building projects and services business remains robust, roughly flat to the second quarter and 7% above third quarter 2022 levels. Orders were down 3% reported but growing 3% on an organic basis, with continued strength in U.S. and China, somewhat diluted by softening in parts of Europe and Asia. Our agile commercial actions were a net contributor to both top line and bottom line growth in the quarter, and segment margin expanded 60 basis points to 24.1%.\nPerformance Materials and Technologies grew 14% organically in the quarter despite an approximately 3% headwind from Russia. Advanced materials grew 33% organically, leading PMT for the third consecutive quarter as we continue to see favorable demand, specifically in our Fluorine Products business. UOP sales increased 6% in the quarter, returning to growth and overcoming a 7% year-over-year headwind from lost Russian sales. Growth in UOP were led by sales -- led by gas processing and refining catalyst demand, and Sustainable Technology Solutions also excel, growing triple digits year-over-year.\nProcess Solutions grew 6% organically on continued demand for life cycle solutions and services and thermal solutions. Sparta Systems grew over 40% for second consecutive quarter and continues to be earnings accretive. Orders for PMT grew double digit in the third quarter, led by approximately 40% growth in orders in advanced materials and approximately 20% in UOP, underpinned by strength in gas processing orders. Segment margin expanded 40 basis points in the quarter to 22.6%, driven by commercial excellence, offsetting cost inflation.\nAs expected, Safety and Productivity Solutions sales decreased 4% organically in the quarter. We saw double-digit growth in advanced sensing and gas detection portion of our sensing and safety technologies business, and productivity solutions and services also grew organically in the quarter. However, this growth was offset by expected softness in warehouse automation and lower volumes in personal protective equipment.\nIntelligrated will be a key area of focus for me as we continue to improve our operations and drive margin expansion in that business. Our strategic pricing and productivity actions, along with favorable business mix, brought segment margins for SPS in its highest level since the fourth quarter of 2018, expanding 250 basis points year-over-year to 15.7%.\nHoneywell Connected Enterprises continues to underpin the growth we are seeing across our portfolio. Recurring revenue grew over 10% in the quarter, and SaaS growth was approximately 40%. Sparta System was once again standout within HCE, growing over 40% in the quarter, with cyber and connected building also seeing double-digit organic growth.\nSo overall, this was a great operational result for Honeywell and our HBT performance was a key driver for our third quarter adjusted earnings per share growth. Adjusted EPS for the quarter grew 11% to $2.25, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $0.05.\nOn cash dynamics, we generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, up 108% year-over-year. The increase was driven by a positive contribution from working capital due to strong collections and continued focus on matching our supply to our demand, which enabled us to reduce inventory for the first time in 7 quarters, an encouraging example of the results that Honeywell is capable of delivering despite the supply chain challenges and extended lead times we have been battling in recent quarters.\nThe Honeywell playbook continues to deliver outstanding results, and these operating principles, combined with our attractive end market exposure and differentiated portfolio of solutions, will allow us to maintain resiliency for quarters to come.\nLet me turn it over to Greg to discuss third quarter earnings per share in more depth and provide an update on our 2022 outlook.\n\nGregory Peter Lewis\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Honeywell International Inc.\n\nThank you, Vimal. Let's turn to Slide 6, and we'll unpack our EPS story a little bit further. In the third quarter, we delivered GAAP earnings per share of $2.28 and adjusted EPS of $2.25, which was up $0.23 year-over-year despite a $0.05 foreign exchange headwind as the dollar continued to strengthen throughout the quarter. Increased segment profit driven by our strong commercial execution provided an $0.18 uplift year-over-year. A lower effective tax rate, 22.1% this year versus 22.9% last year, provided a $0.03 benefit, including a $0.05 tailwind from a onetime discrete change in German tax law. Share count reduction driven by progress towards our share repurchase commitment from our March Investor Day drove a $0.06 year-over-year tailwind to EPS.\nWe saw a $0.04 headwind from below-the-line items primarily due to lower pension income. GAAP EPS was $0.03 higher than adjusted EPS due to a positive adjustment related to our wind down of our business in Russia. So overall, we delivered another strong quarter with results at or above our expectations, demonstrating our ability to operate seamlessly through challenging economic conditions.\nSo now let's turn to Slide 7. We can talk about our fourth quarter and full year guidance. While a number of challenges persist in the current operating environment, we're entering the fourth quarter with a very strong demand profile.\nSince we provided our initial 2022 guidance in February, we have battled supply chain constraints, encountered unprecedented inflation, contended with geopolitical disruption and experienced rapidly rising interest rates. At each turn, our rigorous operating principles have enabled us to continue to deliver.\nAs you saw from the 3Q bridge, the ongoing strengthening of the U.S. dollar has driven materially higher foreign currency impacts and has been a significant headwind to our guidance, which we have consistently offset at the EPS level.\nFor our 4Q sales guidance, we expect to be in the range of $9.1 billion to $9.4 billion, up 10% to 13% on an organic basis or up 11% to 14%, excluding the 1 point impact of lost Russian sales. We now expect full year sales of $35.4 billion to $35.7 billion, which represents a decrease of $100 million in the low end and $400 million on the high end from our prior guidance, incorporating greater foreign currency impact. However, we're raising the low end of our organic growth range now at 6% to 7%, increasing the midpoint versus our prior guidance and narrowing the overall range. Excluding a 1 point impact of lower COVID-related mass demand and 1 point impact of lost Russian sales, organic growth range would be 8% to 9%.\nThe difference between our reported and organic sales growth guidance is 3 points driven entirely by foreign currency translation. To dimensionalize this further for the full year, on a year-over-year basis, we expect $1.1 billion of sales headwinds from foreign currency, which compared to our original guidance from February is approximately $750 million of incremental headwind, a substantial challenge, which, as I mentioned, we've overcome on EPS.\nMoving to our segment margin guidance. We expect the fourth quarter to be in the range of 22.8% to 23.2%, resulting in year-over-year margin expansion of 140 to 180 basis points due to timing of high-margin catalyst shipments in PMT, stable business mix and productivity in SPS and increased volume leverage in HBT. For full year 2022, we are upgrading our segment margin expansion expectations by 30 basis points on the low end and 10 basis points in the high end to a new range of 21.6% to 21.8% or 60 to 80 basis points of year-over-year expansion.\nOur rigorous fixed cost management and disciplined price cost actions remain key elements of our operating playbook, helping us to drive margin expansion. Excluding the 30 basis point 4Q and full year headwinds from Quantinuum, we expect margins to expand 170 to 210 basis points in 4Q and 90 to 110 basis points for the full year.\nNow let's take a moment to walk through fourth quarter and full year expectations by segment. In Aero, we anticipate demand across our businesses to remain strong, leading to sequential sales growth in the fourth quarter. The growth trajectory will largely be determined by the rate of our supply chain recovery, which we anticipate will be modest. Both commercial aftermarket and commercial OE should see another quarter of double-digit sales growth year-over-year in 4Q as flight hours and build rates continue on their path to recovery.\nIn defense, we view the third quarter as an inflection point, leading to sequential improvement in 4Q to close the year as demand remains strong and modest improvements in the supply chain will allow us to deliver greater volumes. Orders in defense and space are up approximately 5% year-to-date, including high single-digit growth in the third quarter. So we've built a very healthy backlog to support sales growth as we lap similarly supply-impacted comparison period.\nOur full year expectations for Aerospace are slightly improved on a stronger third quarter, and we now expect full year organic sales to be up mid-single to high single digits year-over-year, with modest declines in segment margins as a result of OE mix headwinds.\nIn Building Technologies, we expect continued sequential improvement in volumes to lead to another quarter of double-digit organic sales growth year-over-year. Our backlog for building products remains well above normal prepandemic levels, supporting sales growth as the supply capacity improves. Modest improvement in supply chain enabled a sequential drop in past due backlog in the third quarter, and we expect the same in 4Q. We anticipate strong growth in building projects for the fourth quarter as our projects business has grown sequentially each quarter this year, an encouraging indicator of post-pandemic recovery.\nFor overall HBT, we still expect double-digit organic sales growth for the full year, and increased volume leverage should allow for continued sequential segment margin improvement in the fourth quarter and healthy expansion for 2022 overall.\nIn PMT, the favorable outlook in our end markets supports a strong fourth quarter with sales up sequentially from third quarter and year-over-year. In Process Solutions, we expect growth to be supported by continued demand for thermal solutions and process controls. In UOP, increased refining catalyst reload demand will support growth and provide margin benefit. However, the loss of Russia will continue to be a headwind in the fourth quarter. Advanced materials will continue to outperform in the fourth quarter due to strong demand across the portfolio.\nThanks to a strong third quarter, we now expect sales for overall PMT to be up double digits for the year, an upgrade from our outlook last quarter of up high single digits, and we expect segment margin to expand both sequentially and year-over-year in the fourth quarter.\nLooking ahead for SPS, we expect to see continued growth in the advanced sensing and gas detection portion of our sensing and safety technologies business, where demand indicators remain favorable and our backlog is robust. Warehouse automation demand will remain soft in the fourth quarter as customers push new warehouse capacity and investments to the right. So we continue to be encouraged by the bottom line benefits of our improvements in operational efficiency and our focus on higher-margin aftermarket services, which we expect to continue growing double digits.\nWe still expect demand for warehouse automation to trough in 2023, and our long-term outlook for the business remains positive. Our short-cycle productivity solutions and service businesses continue to deal with the impact of supply chain shortages and has seen some demand moderation, which may result in sequentially lower sales in 4Q, but we expect our differentiated technology to allow us to continue to outperform against our peers.\nWhile we remain confident in the medium-term growth rate in SPS, short-term headwinds persist, and we still expect SPS sales to decline mid-single digits in 2022. However, we expect to see strong margin expansion both sequentially and year-over-year in the fourth quarter as a result of shifting business mix and our continued operational improvements.\nTurning to our other core guided metrics for overall Honeywell. Net below-the-line impact, which is the difference between segment profit and income before tax, is expected to be in the range of negative approximately $60 million to positive $40 million in the fourth quarter and negative $125 million to negative $50 million for the full year. This guidance includes a range of repositioning between $86 million and $136 million in 4Q at $375 million to $425 million for the year as we continue to fund attractive restructuring projects and properly position Honeywell for a good financial outcome in [2023.]\nWe expect the adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 19% in the fourth quarter and approximately 22% for the year and the average share count to be approximately 676 million shares in 4Q and approximately 683 million shares for the full year, reflecting our commitment to repurchase at least $4 billion of Honeywell shares in 2022.\nAs a result of these inputs, our adjusted EPS guidance range is between $2.46 and $2.56 for the fourth quarter, up 18% to 22% year-over-year. For full year EPS, we are upgrading the low end of our guidance range by $0.15 to a new range of $8.70 to $8.80, up 8% to 9%, reflecting the confidence in our ability to more than offset foreign exchange headwinds of $0.19 year-over-year and $0.08 versus our initial guide from February as well as absorbing ongoing macroeconomic risk.\nWe still expect to meet our original free cash flow guidance of $4.7 billion to $5.1 billion in 2022 or $4.9 billion to $5.3 billion, excluding the impact of Quantinuum.\nSo in total, we are raising the midpoint of our full year 2022 organic sales growth, segment margin and adjusted EPS guidance ranges while absorbing headwinds of $1.1 billion in sales and $0.15 in adjusted earnings per share versus our initial guidance from lost Russian sales and incremental FX, a strong indicator of our ability to successfully deliver results in a fluid operating environment. Details on our full year 2022 guidance progression and FX impacts can be found in the appendix of this presentation.\nBefore turning back to Darius, let's turn to the next page and discuss our preliminary thoughts for 2023. While the macro backdrop signals another year of volatility, we believe our historical execution through multiple downturns demonstrates our ability to move quickly and decisively to protect margins, drive growth, ensure liquidity and position ourselves well to deliver in any environment.\nOur rigorous operating principles and favorable end market exposure will help us remain resilient with commercial aerospace recovery continuing, upcoming capital reinvestment in the energy sector and increased sustainability and infrastructure spending. We have a strong setup that will drive growth in sales, margin and earnings in 2023. We expect organic growth in Aero, PMT and HBT due to record-level demand in backlog in 2022 in our long-cycle businesses. In fact, both of our largest businesses are seeing double-digit orders and backlog growth, which will headline growth and profitability in 2023.\nThis will be offset by lower demand in warehouse automation volumes which we believe will trough next year. We expect supply chain dynamics to improve gradually but remain constrained versus prepandemic levels. With these dynamics in mind, let's look at each of our businesses.\nIn Aero, we expect the demand picture to remain robust with increased flight hours, particularly a recovery in wide-body and increased build rates among aircraft manufacturers, which will support growth in our commercial aviation businesses, tempered only by the pace of supply chain healing. We also anticipate a return to growth in divestment space on increased defense budget and elevated backlog and an improving supply chain.\nIn HBT, stimulus-fueled investment in institutional markets as well as elevated backlog levels from this year's supply constraints should provide resiliency into 2023, regardless of the macro environment. Many of our offerings are aligned to key secular themes such as energy efficiency and decarbonization, and we expect the verticals we serve to remain strong on balance throughout next year.\nIn PMT, we expect to continue to capitalize on the growth we have seen in 2022. Backlog built this year will drive growth in Process Solutions. LNG capacity expansions and improved comps as Russia headwinds fall off will support growth in UOP and improvement in semiconductor supply among customers, and continued demand for Solstice products will enable advanced materials to have another strong year. Sustainable Technology Solutions should also provide growth as the Inflation Reduction Act supports new SaaS and carbon capture opportunities.\nFor Safety and Productivity Solutions, decreased investment in new warehouse capacity and potential recession impacts in our short-cycle businesses will provide headwinds in 2023. However, we have a strong portfolio with differentiated solutions that will allow us to compete regardless of the macro environment. Operational improvement actions that we've already begun implementing and shifting business mix will allow us to expand margins in '23, even if revenues decline year-over-year.\nSo overall, Honeywell 2023 margins will benefit from the continued volume recovery on a streamlined cost base, anticipated pricing tailwind, flight hour improvement in Aero and mix shift in SPS towards higher-margin businesses. We'll continue our investments in R&D and growth-oriented CapEx as we remain keenly focused on creating uniquely innovative, differentiated, recession-proof technologies to address the world's toughest process technology, digital transformation and sustainability challenges.\nWe expect our spend on repositioning to begin to normalize lower. However, that EPS benefit will be more than offset by significantly lower noncash pension income in a rising interest rate environment, which likely results in a higher discount rate and lower asset base next year. This accounting headwind is a noncash item as our overfunded pension status will ensure no incremental contributions are needed, which is a great position to be in for our employees, both former and current, and our shareholders.\nWe have significant balance sheet capacity for meaningful M&A and expect a favorable deal environment going into '23, which supports our commitment to accelerate capital deployment.\nOverall, the resiliency of our end markets and demonstrated ability to operate under dynamic circumstances gives us the confidence that we can deliver a strong financial performance in '23, including overall sales growth, margin expansion, adjusted EPS and free cash flow growth despite the environment. We'll provide more specific inputs in our annual outlook call once we close the year.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Darius to discuss our dedication to environmental excellence.\n\nDarius E. Adamczyk\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Honeywell International Inc.\n\nThank you, Greg. Let's turn to Slide 9 and talk more about the aspirational approach we are taking to our ESG commitments. ESG is more than just an initiative for Honeywell. It is a common thread that ties our businesses together and helps us shape the future of the company.\nAt a corporate level, we have set aggressive targets to reduce our impact and protect the environment. We've reduced our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by over 90% since 2004. Committed to set a target for Scope 3 emissions with the Science Based Targets initiative, we have pledged to be carbon neutral in our facilities and operations by 2035.

Adamczyk\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Honeywell International Inc.\n\nThank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 2. The second quarter was another strong one for Honeywell. We over delivered on our commitments as our rigorous operating principles enable us to navigate a challenging backdrop and remain highly resilient amid ongoing supply chain constraints, inflation headwinds and geopolitical unrest. We met or exceeded our second quarter guidance despite these challenges of adjusted earnings per share of $2.10, up 4% year-over-year and $0.02 above the high end of the guidance range.\nOrganic sales grew 4% year-over-year, led by strong double-digit growth in our commercial aviation, building products, productivity solutions and services, advanced sensing technologies, advanced materials and recurring connected software businesses. This was partially offset by 3 percentage point impact from a combination of the wind down of our Russian operations and lower COVID-related mask sales as we lapped the height of demand in 2021.\nWe expanded segment margin by 50 basis points year-over-year to 20.9%, meeting the high end of the guidance range as commercial excellence enable us to remain ahead of the inflation curve. Excluding the impact of our investment in Quantinuum, the margin expansion was 80 basis points year-over-year. Orders and backlog strength continued in the second quarter, led by Aero, HBT and PMT as our end markets continue to recover, giving us confidence in our demand outlook for the back half of the year.\nOrders were up 12% year-over-year, and closing backlog was $29.5 billion, while also up 12% year-over-year. In terms of capital, we deployed $2.3 billion to share repurchases, dividends and capital expenditures. We leveraged the strength of our balance sheet to opportunistically purchase 7.5 million shares throughout the quarter, reducing our average share count to 685 million shares and continuing to execute on our commitment to buy back $4 billion in shares in 2022. As always, we continue to execute our rigorous and proven value creation framework, which drives outstanding shareholder value. I am proud of Honeywell's ability to rise to the challenge to deliver strong results amid such a fluid operating environment.\nNow let's turn to Slide 3 to discuss recent senior leadership changes. This morning, we announced that Vimal Kapur has been appointed role of President and Chief Operating Officer effective immediately. Vimal is currently the President and CEO of Honeywell Performance Materials and Technologies and will maintain his PMT role until his successor is named. Honeywell is fortunate to benefit from a very deep bench of experienced leaders like Vimal with 33 years across various Honeywell businesses. As COO, he will work closely with me to drive the continued profitable growth of Honeywell's operating businesses. This includes creating new solutions to help our customers drive their sustainability transformations and accelerate their digital transformation journeys. Vimal will also oversee the continued integration of Honeywell's operating system, which we call Honeywell Accelerator. Vimal is uniquely qualified for this role in improving its operational capabilities across many different industries, business models, regions and business cycles.\nThis appointment provides me additional bandwidth to focus on strategy, business development, customer engagement and people development. Now many of you will recall that I served as COO once upon a time as well. This announcement today is not a repeat of that playbook. While I won't be Chairman and CEO, indefinitely, I have no definitive plans to retire and will continue to lead Honeywell. Vimal's appointment is going to allow me additional flexibility to focus on our overarching objectives.\nIn addition, effective earlier this month, we expanded both Sheila Jordan's and Suresh Venkatarayalu's role and welcome them to the executive leadership team as Honeywell officers reporting to me to ensure we continue to advance our enterprise transformation. Sheila expanded her role to include all digital transformation efforts, becoming Senior Vice President, Chief Digital Technology Officer. Sheila joined Honeywell in January 2020 and has proven significant value, working to modernize our IT infrastructure, applications, digital capabilities and talent.\nSuresh took an expanded role becoming Senior Vice President, Chief Technology and Innovation Officer. Suresh has been with Honeywell almost 30 years and has held a series of engineering and IT leadership positions, including CTO of Honeywell and SPS. Suresh is responsible for new product development and introduction processes, including development for breakthrough technologies. I'd like to congratulate Vimal, Sheila and Suresh on their new roles, and I look forward to working closely with them as they enter the next phase of Honeywell's transformation.\nNext, let me turn the slides forward to discuss other exciting recent announcements. In the second quarter, we continued to build on our reputation as one of the premium providers of cutting-edge technologies that can deliver more sustainable solutions. We announced yesterday that Archer Aviation selected Honeywell to provide flight control actuation and thermal management technologies for the urban air mobility aircraft. Archer's production aircraft will operate in dense urban environments, making critical precision from the aircraft's flight controls and actuators a must for civilian safety.\nHoneywell's actuators can accept hundreds of micro-adjustments and commands per second from fly-by-wire computers, enabling precise navigation, which will enhance safety and accommodate the unique elements of Archer's electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft. Honeywell has a wide variety of ready-now solutions that will create a more sustainable future for the aviation sector. It's a great example of that.\nIn addition, last month, we announced a partnership with EnLink Midstream to deliver carbon capture solutions to industrial scale CO2 emitters along their Louisiana Gulf Coast. Our carbon capture and hydrogen purification technologies, combined with EnLink's planned CO2 pipeline transportation network provides a cost-efficient solution for customers looking to reduce the environmental impact of their operations.\nLastly, we discussed in our Q2 leadership webcast on sustainable building technologies, released a new carbon and energy management software focused on the energy optimization and carbon reduction of commercial buildings. Commercial buildings currently account for almost 1/3 of global energy consumption and 37% of global energy-related CO2 emissions. Building owners recognize that this issue needs to be addressed and thousands of companies have voluntarily pledged to meet sustainability targets.\nHoneywell's new software offering enables building owners to track and optimize energy performance down to a device or asset level. Our carbon and energy management software leverages Honeywell's Forge, artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to autonomously identify and implement energy conservation measures. This makes it possible for building owners to reduce the environmental impact of their building while at the same time, improving the well-being of their occupants. As you can see, we are leveraging our expertise and culture of innovation to enable a more sustainable future. Now let me turn it over to Greg on Slide 5 to discuss our second quarter results in more detail and to provide an update on our 2022 outlook.\n\nGregory Peter Lewis\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Honeywell International Inc.\n\nThank you, Darius, and good morning, everyone. As Darius highlighted, we delivered second quarter results, which met or exceeded the high end of our guidance while navigating persistent macroeconomic uncertainties. Second quarter sales grew by 4% organically or 7%, excluding the impact of lower COVID-related mask volumes and the wind down of our operations in Russia.\nWhile demand trends remain strong, supply chain constraints continues to weigh on volume growth, predominantly in Aero, HBT and SPS, causing our past due backlog to increase sequentially by more than $100 million in the quarter. However, we once again demonstrated our operational agility by staying ahead of the inflation curve through strategic pricing actions, enabling us to expand margins and beat the high end of our adjusted EPS guidance.\nAerospace sales for the second quarter were up 5% organically compared to the second quarter of '21 as we continue to face a challenged overall aerospace supply chain. The ongoing recovery in commercial flight hours led to approximately 20% year-over-year sales growth in both air transport aftermarket and business in general aviation aftermarket sales. Business in general aviation original equipment returned to growth in the quarter, growing double digits while air transport original equipment continued its strong 2022, growing over 25% year-over-year.\nGrowth from our commercial Aerospace business was partially offset by defense and space sales, which were down 11% year-over-year, though up sequentially from Q1 in both U.S. and international markets. Aerospace segment margins expanded 80 basis points in the second quarter to 26.5%.\nIn Building Technologies, sales were up 14% organically, led by commercial actions and strength in both building products and building solutions. Demand remained strong with orders up double digits for the second consecutive quarter, led by building projects, building management systems and our security products. Backlog grew double digits year-over-year in the second quarter, giving us continued confidence in our 2022 outlook. Our healthy buildings portfolio remains robust with over $100 million of orders in the quarter. Segment margins expanded 110 basis points to 23.5%.\nIn Performance Materials and Technologies, sales grew 10% organically in the quarter despite an approximately 3% headwind from Russia. Advanced Materials continues to stand out with 21% organic sales growth in the quarter as a result of commercial excellence and greater volumes in specialty additives and electronic materials. Process Solutions grew 7% organically on increased demand for thermal solutions and life cycle solutions and services.\nSparta Systems grew over 40% and was earnings accretive for the second consecutive quarter. Process Solutions orders grew more than 15%, including double-digit growth in our Projects business showing continued momentum. UOP sales decreased 1% in the quarter, including a 7-point headwind to year-over-year growth from lost Russia sales. We continue to see strength in our higher-margin catalyst business, which grew more than 20% and helped to offset lower equipment volumes due to timing of larger projects.\nPMT segment margin expanded 150 basis points to 22.3% in the quarter. Safety and Productivity Solutions sales decreased 10% organically in the quarter, in line with our expectations as strength in Advanced Sensing Technologies and Productivity Solutions and Services was offset by lower personal protective equipment and warehouse automation volume. Elevated COVID-driven mask demand in the second quarter of '21 led to a 5% year-over-year headwind for SPS in the quarter.\nAdvanced Sensing Technologies grew 25%. Productivity Solutions and Services grew 19%, and Gas Detection also grew organically in the quarter, all demonstrating excellent execution in a difficult supply-constrained environment. We continue to be impressed by the performance of these businesses. This quarter marks 6 straight quarters of double-digit organic growth in Productivity Solutions and Services and 3 straight quarters for Advanced Sensing Technologies.\nSPS also benefited from a licensing and settlement agreement to resolve patent-related litigation with a competitor, which we entered into in the second quarter. Under this agreement, each party agreed to provide a license to its existing patent portfolio for use by the other party's existing products, and Honeywell is entitled to receive up to $360 million over 2 years. Honeywell received the first of these payments of $45 million in the second quarter and recognize the corresponding sales and profit in the SPS financial results. This incremental profit in the quarter was more than offset by legal costs associated with the agreement and a onetime write-down of excess COVID-related mask inventory, which should close the book on that mask story. Overall, SPS segment margins contracted 140 basis points to 12.6%, primarily due to the lower volumes and the PPE write-down.\nGrowth across our portfolio continues to be supported by strong results in Honeywell Connected Enterprise. We had another quarter of double-digit revenue growth, including double-digit recurring and 40% SaaS business growth year-over-year. Sparta Systems, Connected, Safety and Cyber all saw growth of greater than 25% year-over-year in the quarter. So for overall Honeywell, we exceeded our sales outlook growing top line 4% organically, and we executed operationally to expand second quarter segment margins by 50 basis points to 20.9%, meeting the high end of our margin guidance range with expansion in PMT, HBT and Aerospace. This expansion is net of a 30 basis point year-over-year headwind associated with our investment in Quantinuum.\nOn EPS, we delivered second quarter GAAP earnings per share of $1.84 and adjusted earnings per share of $2.10, which was up $0.08 year-over-year despite a $0.04 headwind from foreign exchange. A bridge for adjusted earnings per share from 2Q '21 to 2Q '22 can be found in the appendix of this presentation. Segment profit was an $0.08 tailwind, driven by strong commercial execution. Share count reduction drove a $0.05 year-over-year tailwind to earnings per share. We saw a $0.04 headwind from below the line items, primarily due to the lower pension income. A higher effective tax rate, 23.4% this year versus 23% last year drove a $1 headwind.\nIn response to winding down operations in Russia, we recorded an additional charge of $126 million or a $0.19 impact to GAAP EPS. The company also took a $50 million noncash charge in 2Q related to the potential comprehensive resolution of ongoing UOP matters. More information on this can be found in our Form 10-Q.\nMoving to cash. We generated over $800 million of free cash flow in the quarter, down 43% year-on-year, which was closely aligned to our expectations. We continue to invest in inventory to deliver for our customers, which is driving elevated working capital in recent quarters, including Q2. During the quarter, we also received the final payment to close out our agreement with Garrett, but still saw a year-over-year decline in Garrett payments due to an elevated $375 million payment in the second quarter last year. We remain on track to deliver our cash guidance range of $4.7 billion to $5.1 billion for the full year.\nFinally, as Darius mentioned earlier, we continue to leverage our strong balance sheet, deploying $2.3 billion in the quarter. Notably, we repurchased 7.5 million shares for $1.4 billion in the second quarter, bringing our first half total to $2.4 billion as we execute on our updated commitment to buy back $4 billion in shares in '22. We also paid approximately $690 million in dividends and invested approximately $160 million in CapEx. So overall, another strong quarter in which we delivered results at or above our expectations, executed well through challenging economic conditions and accelerated our capital deployment.\nNow let's turn to Slide 6 to talk about our third quarter and full year guidance. While the environment continues to be volatile, our demand profile remains resilient. Our 2Q orders and our closing backlog of $29.5 billion both grew 12% year-over-year, positioning us well for the quarters to come. Supply chain constraints, particularly related to semiconductors improved slightly in the second quarter, and we expect modest sequential benefits to continue throughout the back half of the year, enabling us to unlock greater volumes.\nThe aerospace supply chain has continued to face difficulties, but we're confident in the eventual recovery as Tier 3 and Tier 4 suppliers work to combat labor shortages. Once again, this quarter and throughout the rest of the year, we are staying ahead of the inflation curve with our strategic pricing actions. As a result of rising interest rates and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we are experiencing higher foreign currency impact than we had in our prior guidance, impacting sales and EPS that we are overcoming that operationally.\nWith that as a backdrop, we expect third quarter sales to be in the range of $8.9 billion to $9.2 billion, up 7% to 11% on an organic basis or up 8% to 12%, excluding the 1-point impact of our lost Russian sales. We now expect full year sales of $35.5 billion to $36.1 billion, which represents a decrease of $300 million on the high end from our prior guidance, incorporating higher foreign currency impact. However, we are raising the low end of our organic growth range now at 5% to 7%, increasing the midpoint versus our prior guidance and narrowing the overall range. That represents organic growth of 7% to 9%, excluding a 1-point impact of lower COVID-related mask demand and a 1 point impact of lost Russian sales.\nThe difference between our reported and our organic sales growth guidance is 2 points, driven entirely by foreign currency translation. We expect our disciplined commercial actions will contribute approximately 8% to our sales growth in 2022, which is higher than we anticipated last quarter as we remain vigilant in addressing price cost dynamics given elevated inflation.\nNow let's take a moment to walk through the third quarter and full year expectations by segment, an update on our 2022 end market outlook can be found in the appendix of this presentation. In Aerospace, we see ongoing flight hour improvement leading to another quarter of robust growth in our aftermarket business, led by air transport aftermarket. In original equipment, build rates continue to ramp, driving growth in both Air Transport and Business & General Aviation.\nDefense and space grew sequentially in the second quarter, and we expect this trend to continue into the second half. We anticipate the business will return to year-over-year growth in the second half as comps ease, but it will be down slightly for the full year. As I mentioned earlier, the overall aerospace supply chain remains challenged and is partially offsetting strong end market demand. While our supplier de-commit rate improved sequentially in the second quarter, the pace of improvement is slower than the higher end of our expectations. As a result, we now expect aerospace sales for the year to be up mid-single digits compared to 2021, lower than our previous outlook of high single digits.\nOriginal equipment mix headwinds were well telegraphed, but lower volume leverage will weigh on full year margin, which we now expect to be down modestly year-over-year. In Building Technologies, where supply chain constraints, particularly around semiconductors have improved slightly each quarter so far in '22, we expect sequentially improved volumes and pricing actions will support continued growth into the second half of the year.\nEnergy efficiency and healthy building solutions remain a priority for our customers, enabling growth in our Building Solutions and healthy buildings businesses. We now expect full year organic growth in the double digits, trending better than our outlook at the end of the first quarter of high single digits to double digits. Our operational excellence and additional volume leverage should allow us to build upon our margin expansion from the first half in the third quarter and throughout the rest of '22.\nIn Performance Materials and Technologies, the favorable outlook in our end markets and 2 consecutive quarters of double-digit orders growth provides solid footing for the future. In Process Solutions, we expect sequential improvement in the third quarter with continued strong demand for Thermal Solutions leading the year-over-year growth. We expect sequential growth in UOP throughout the remainder of the year, largely driven by increased refining catalyst shipments with a heavier margin benefit in the fourth quarter versus the third.\nAs we discussed last quarter, Russia will be a headwind to year-over-year growth throughout '22, but we're optimistic about the potential capacity investments in the energy sector to offset Russian supply, especially in LNG, and these investments provide support for our long-term growth framework. We expect the typical seasonality in Advanced Materials as we exit the summer months, but pricing tailwind and solid demand support continued year-over-year growth in the back half.\nFor overall PMT, we now expect sales to be up high single digits for the year and upgrade from our outlook last quarter of up mid- to high single digits, and we expect segment margin expansion in the second half versus the first. Looking ahead for SPS, we expect continued growth in Advanced Sensing Technologies and Gas Detection as demand indicators have remained strong, and these businesses are supported by a robust backlog, and we expect modest sequential improvement throughout the back half of the year. As we enter into the second half, we expect our Personal Protective Equipment sales run rate to be relatively stable in the third and the fourth quarter.\nIn Intelligrated, we are encouraged by the improvements we're making in our operational efficiency and strategic customer wins, which will enable greater profitability over the project life cycle. That said, we're seeing capital spending plans of our warehouse automation customers pushed to the right, some of which has been broadly publicized. While we remain very confident in the medium-term growth rate, we expect 2022 SPS revenue to decline mid-single digits versus 2021 as delivery slide to the right.\nAs I mentioned earlier, segment margin in the second quarter was lowered by a onetime inventory write-down, so we expect a significant sequential margin improvement in the third quarter and continued expansion in the fourth quarter through a combination of higher volume leverage, some cost reduction and positive mix shift.\nFor overall Honeywell, we expect third quarter segment margins to be in the range of 20.9% to 21.2%, resulting in year-over-year margin contraction of 30 basis points to flat due to timing of high-margin catalyst shipments in PMT and some mix headwinds in Aerospace. Excluding the 40 basis point headwind from Quantinuum, we expect margins to expand 10 to 40 basis points. From a sequential perspective, our third quarter margin expectations are flat to up 30 basis points.\nTurning to our other core guided metrics. Third quarter net below-the-line impact, which is the difference between segment profit and income before tax, is expected to be in the range of negative $20 million to positive $30 million with a range of repositioning between $50 million and $90 million in the quarter as we continue to fund attractive restructuring projects. We expect the third quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 24% and the average share count to be approximately 679 million shares. As a result, we expect adjusted third quarter EPS between $2.10 and $2.20, up 4% to 9% year-over-year.\nTurning to the full year. We expect organic sales growth of 5% to 7%, up from 4% to 7% last quarter. We are upgrading our segment margin expectations by 20 basis points to 30 to 70 basis points of year-over-year expansion at a margin rate of 21.3% to 21.7%. This is supported by successful execution of our price cost strategies as well as our continued rigor on fixed cost management.\nExcluding the 30 basis point headwind from Quantinuum, we expect margins to expand 60 to 100 basis points in the year. We expect full year net below-the-line impact to be in the range of negative $150 million to negative $50 million, including capacity for $350 million to $425 million of repositioning. We expect a full year effective tax rate of approximately 22%, and we expect a weighted average share count to be in the range of 684 million to 687 million shares for the year, reflecting our commitment to repurchase $4 billion of Honeywell shares in '22.\nAs a result of all these inputs, we have raised the low end of our full year adjusted earnings per share expectation to $8.55 to $8.80, up 6% to 9% year-over-year, reflecting confidence in our ability to more than offset or offset a $0.05 foreign exchange headwind versus our initial guidance in February as well as navigate evolving external risks. We still expect to see free cash flow in the range of $4.7 billion to $5.1 billion in 2022 or $4.9 billion to $5.3 billion, excluding the impact of Quantinuum. The cash impact and timing of our Russia exit does remain uncertain, and we'll update you as that continues to develop as it is not contemplated in this guidance.\nSo in total, we executed a strong Q2 despite supply chain, foreign currency, Russia and inflation headwinds and are raising the midpoint of our organic sales growth, adjusted EPS growth and segment margin ranges, while holding our cash range, demonstrating our strong operational capabilities.\nBefore turning it back to Darius, let's turn to the next page to discuss our ability to deliver in all economic cycles. During our Investor Day earlier this year, we talked about our track record of managing through the cycle. Our execution through multiple downturns highlights our ability to move quickly and decisively to protect margins, drive growth, ensure liquidity and position ourselves for recovery.\nAs we continue to maneuver through changing economic conditions, our favorable end market exposures, robust orders and backlog position and diligent cost management will enable us to deliver differentiated results for our shareholders as we have proven in the past. We believe our end market exposures will help us remain resilient during times of short-cycle demand softness. In fact, 65% of our sales address the commercial aviation, defense, energy and nonresidential end markets, which are all set up favorably to weather a potential recession.\nIn commercial aviation, pent-up demand for leisure and business travel will continue to drive aftermarket demand, particularly as international travel resumes. Defense will remain relatively stable as international budgets are poised to increase with restocking from NATO allies, adding upward momentum to this end market. The energy markets are also gaining traction with higher relatively stable oil prices supporting an expected wave of capital reinvestment and LNG capacity additions, which are required to replace Russian gas supply and power the energy transition. Infrastructure builds, both domestic and abroad, provide tailwinds for the nonresidential sector as it does increase customer focus on sustainability and healthy buildings. As I mentioned earlier, although we are seeing some near-term softness in e-commerce, we still believe the medium-term growth is robust.\nAs Darius mentioned earlier, we ended 2Q with a record high backlog of $29.5 billion, up 12% year-on-year. Approximately 60% of this backlog is long cycle, which grew 12% year-over-year, led by growth in commercial aviation, building projects and services and process solutions projects. This gives us ample runway to support growth for quarters to come.\nFinally, our long track record of segment margin expansion through multiple downturns and recessionary periods indicates our superior ability to streamline our fixed cost base, simplify and automate operations with our integrated supply chain transformation efforts and create efficiencies using Honeywell digital capabilities to standardize business models and use data analytics to optimize productivity and growth.\nIn fact, Honeywell Digital has proven very valuable over the last year. The tools we have built are helping us methodically and strategically implement pricing, enabling us to stay ahead of the inflation curve. This, coupled with our rigorous and proven Honeywell value creation framework should provide investors with comfort that we will remain highly resilient, perform in all economic cycles and consistently deliver superior shareholder returns.\nNow let me turn it back to Darius to talk about how we are leveraging our resources and expertise to positively impact our communities.\n\nDarius E. Adamczyk\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Honeywell International Inc.\n\nThank you, Greg. Let's turn to Slide 8 and talk of the more aspirational approach we are taking toward ESG commitments. At Honeywell, our commitment to improving the world beyond our product portfolio begins with our 4 pillars of corporate social responsibility, inclusion, diversity, employees in action, STEM education and sustainability.\nWe're embedding inclusion and diversity into all our systems and processes at Honeywell from our enterprise-wide hiring protocols to our supplier diversity program. Our 9,000 employees belong to 1 of the 8 diverse employee networks and the number is growing every day, allowing us to provide opportunities for the education and allyship to all employees. We believe this approach is not only the right thing to do, but also a fundamental enabler of improved business results. Honeywell has set the guide rails for our culture of inclusion and diversity and our employees consistently go beyond what is expected and improve that culture.\nWhen Honeywell set up the Ukraine Relief Fund to provide underground aid and employee support, the generosity of our employees helped us raise over $1 million. Our employees are active outside work in their local community as well, volunteering over 4,000 hours in 2021. Honeywell is also committed to improving our local communities through STEM education to shape the great minds of tomorrow. We're focusing on providing unserved students access to education that'll provide -- that will drive innovation.\nSome of our initiatives include education and skill development programs in high-growth regions, college scholarships for students and STEM pathways and refurbished laptop distribution programs. Another way Honeywell improves local communities is through sustainability organizations that protect our environment and create a greener world through our partnership with the Swades Foundation in America Cares India Foundation that have helped provide over 10,000 Indian homes with access to drinking water and solar electricity. These pillars allow Honeywell to use its resources to create a long-lasting positive impact in the lives of our employees and the communities they live in around the world.\nNow let's turn to Slide 9 for some closing thoughts before we move into Q&A. We continue to execute on our value creation framework, effectively managing through ongoing external difficulties and over delivering on our financial commitments. We remain optimistic about our future, including our ability to deliver differentiated results through the cycle. We raised the midpoint of our full year organic sales and adjusted earnings per share guidance as well as increased our segment margin rate, fully absorbing higher than previously anticipated foreign exchange impact.\nI'm proud of everyone at Honeywell is working hard to adapt and deliver in this challenging environment. While there is a heightened level of macro uncertainty at present, we continue to be confident in our ability to execute on the factors within our control. With that, Sean, let's move to Q&A.\n\nSean Christopher Meakim\n\nVP of IR, Honeywell International Inc.\n\nThank you, Darius. Darius, Greg, Anne and Torsten are now available to answer your questions. We ask that you please be mindful of others in the queue by only asking one question. Latif, please open the line for Q&A.",

Welcome to the Honeywell First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Sean Meakim, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nSean Christopher Meakim\n\nVP of IR, Honeywell International Inc.\n\nThank you, Shannon. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's First Quarter 2022 Earnings. On the call with me today are Chairman and CEO, Darius Adamczyk; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Greg Lewis. Also joining us are Senior Vice President and General Counsel, Anne Madden; and Senior Vice President and Chief Supply Chain Officer, Torsten Pilz.\nThis call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website at www.honeywell.com/investor. Honeywell also uses our website as a means of disclosing information, which may be of interest or material to our investors and for complying with disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. Accordingly, investors should monitor our Investor Relations website in addition to following our press releases, SEC filings, public conference calls, webcasts and social media.\nNote that elements of this presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change based on many factors, including changing economic and business conditions. And we ask that you interpret them in that light. We identify the principal risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance in our annual report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings.\nThis morning, we will review our financial results for the first quarter of 2022, share our guidance for the second quarter and provide an update on our full year 2022 outlook. As always, we'll leave time for your questions at the end.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Darius Adamczyk.\n\nDarius E. Adamczyk\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Honeywell International Inc.\n\nThank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 2. First off, our collective thoughts are to millions of Ukrainian refugees. And we hope to see a peaceful resolution quickly. Our #1 priority continues to be the safety and security of our employees and partners in the region and respond to their immediate needs.\nThat said, we delivered a very strong first quarter despite a challenging backdrop that included ongoing supply chain constraints, inflation headwinds and global unrest. I'm pleased with our disciplined execution as we navigate these dynamics and capitalize on the ongoing recovery in our end markets.\nWe met or exceeded our first quarter commitments despite these challenges with adjusted earnings per share of $1.91, down 1% year-over-year, about $0.01 above the high end of our guidance range. Organic sales grew by 1% year-over-year. And our commercial aviation aftermarket, building products, productivity solutions and services, advanced materials and recurring connected software businesses all delivered double-digit organic growth. This was partially offset by 2 percentage point impact from lower COVID-related mask sales as we lap the height of the demand in 2021.\nOur strong price realization allowed us to stay ahead of the inflation curve. We expanded segment margin by 10 basis points year-over-year, 10 basis points above the high end of our guidance range. Excluding the impact of our investment in Quantinuum, the margin expansion rate would have been 40 basis points year-over-year. Orders and backlog growth accelerated in the first quarter, indicating strong demand momentum despite macro headwinds. Led by strength in Aero, HBT and PMT, our end markets continued to recover. We'll go into more details on orders and backlog trends on the next slide.\nThe first quarter is seasonally our lowest from a cash perspective. And as we communicated, this year, it is being exacerbated by the supply chain impacts and strong collections in Q4. We generated $50 million of free cash flow in the quarter. These results do not change our full year free cash flow guidance range of $4.7 billion to $5.1 billion, which Greg will discuss later. We continue to leverage our strong balance sheet, deploying $2 billion of total capital in the first quarter, including $1 billion allocated to share repurchases as we began execution of our recently updated commitment to buy back $4 billion in shares in 2022.\nFrom an M&A perspective, we closed the acquisition of US Digital Designs, a public safety communications hardware and software solutions provider. Looking forward, I continue to be encouraged by the strength we are seeing in many areas of our portfolio as we execute our rigorous and proven value-creation framework. Our Accelerator operating system is driving outstanding shareholder value.\nNow let me turn to Slide 3 to discuss our orders and backlog trends. First quarter orders across Honeywell grew 13%, the strongest growth we have since the start of 2021 with the exception of second Q '21 growth, which benefited from 2020 COVID-related lows. Despite ongoing macro challenges over the last few years, our book-to-bill ratio has been greater than 1 for the last several quarters, indicating the strength of our demand and commercial success.\nLong cycle orders grew over 20% in the first quarter, led by strength in the overall Aerospace portfolio, PMT process solutions projects and SPS warehouse automation to help facilitate sustained growth through the coming years. First quarter backlog increased 9% year-over-year to $28.5 billion, or up 10%, excluding the impact of approximately $300 million of backlog we moved due to the Russia conflict. Backlog growth has also been accelerating consistently over the last 2 years as our end markets recover, giving us confidence in increased sales growth as the supply chain environment eases.\nNow let's turn to Slide 4 to discuss some exciting recent announcements. Last month, we announced a strategic collaboration with OTTO Motors, a division of ClearPath Robotics, that gives warehouse and distribution centers throughout North America an automated option to handle some of the most labor-intensive roles in an increasingly scarce job market. The collaboration enables Honeywell customers to increase efficiency, reduce errors and improve safety by deploying to OTTO's autonomous mobile robots in their facilities. These autonomous mobile robots handle repetitive and often time-consuming tasks and allows scarce labor resources to be shifted to higher-value jobs. This helps boost worker satisfaction while reducing injuries and turnover rates. The pandemic and its lasting effects on labor shortages is causing companies to reconsider the way they operate. And companies are more willing than ever to invest in automation.\nWe also recently announced that we will supply Hecate Energy with an Energy Storage System for a solar park located in northern New Mexico. When completed in mid-2022, a 50-megawatt solar farm will be capable of supplying enough electricity to power up to 16,000 average New Mexico homes, which will help meet the state's decarbonization goals. When combining with Honeywell's Experion Energy Control Systems, the Energy Storage Systems will enable customers to accurately forecast and optimize energy cost at the site and will support access to reliable and cost-effective clean energy. Honeywell remains on the forefront of innovation that is leading the energy transition. Energy storage will be a play -- will play a critical role in renewable power generation and will be vital to the decarbonization of global power systems.\nLastly, we are teaming up with World Energy, a carbon net zero solution provider, and Air Products, the world's largest hydrogen producer, to build one of the most technologically advanced Sustainable Aviation Fuel production and distribution sites ever constructed. The facility will produce fuels that will displace over 76 million metric tons of carbon dioxide by 2050, the equivalent of 3.8 million carbon net zero flights from L.A. to New York. World Energy and Honeywell collaborated over the past 9 years. And this long-term engagement will continue to transform the industry, support the growth of zero carbon economy and help accelerate the decarbonization of the aviation industry.\nThese exciting announcements reinforce our message at Investor Day that our innovative culture, our commitment to providing efficient and sustainable solutions to meet the needs of our customers and our new technologies will be integral to the next leg of growth. Now let me turn it over to Greg on Slide 5 to discuss our first quarter results in more detail and to provide an update on our 2022 outlook.\n\nGregory Peter Lewis\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Honeywell International Inc.\n\nThank you, Darius, and good morning, everyone. As Darius highlighted, we met or exceeded our financial commitments despite a very challenging backdrop. First quarter sales grew by 1% organically as supply chain constraints, predominantly in Aero, HBT and SPS, continue to hold back volume growth and cause our past-due backlogs to increase by approximately $500 million in the quarter. Our strong pricing was a highlight in the face of high inflation. Similar to the fourth quarter, 1Q also had difficult year-over-year comps with lower COVID-related mask demand, impacting growth by 2 percentage points, and the timing of sales in warehouse automation dampening our growth rate.\nTurning to the segments. Aerospace sales for the first quarter were up 5% organically compared to the first quarter of 2021, despite continued supply constraints as the ongoing flight-hour recovery led to more than 25% year-over-year sales growth in both air transport aftermarket and business and general aviation aftermarket. Commercial original equipment grew double digits in the first quarter as air transport original equipment returned to growth. That was partially offset by lower business and general aviation original equipment volumes.\nGrowth from commercial aerospace was partially offset by defense and space sales that were down 14% in the quarter. Aerospace segment margins contracted as expected in the first quarter to 27.4% due to higher sales of lower-margin original equipment products, the impact of inflation and the absence of a one-time gain in 2021, partially offset by our pricing actions.\nTurning to Building Technologies, where sales were up 8% organically, led by favorable pricing across the building products portfolio, partially offset by lower volume in building projects. Orders were up double digits in the first quarter as a result of strong demand for fire products and building management systems. Backlog growth continued in building solutions projects and services, giving us confidence for the remainder of 2022. In addition, our healthy buildings portfolio maintained its momentum with orders over $100 million in the first quarter. Segment margins expanded 100 basis points to 23.5% due to our pricing actions and our favorable sales mix, partially offset by cost inflation.\nIn Performance Materials and Technologies, sales grew 6% organically in the quarter despite an approximately 1% headwind from Russia sales. Growth was led by advanced materials, where the business experienced double-digit growth despite lower automotive refrigerant volumes due to supply constraints affecting automotive OE production. Process solutions sales growth was led by thermal solutions and life cycle solutions and services. Sparta Systems grew approximately 20% and turned an operating profit in the quarter earlier than expected in our acquisition model.\nUOP sales were down in the quarter due to lower process technology equipment volumes, although sustainable technology solutions continued to excel, growing over 75% organically year-over-year. Orders increased double digits year-over-year, headlined by over 20% growth in process solutions. Segment margins expanded 230 basis points in the quarter to 20.8%, driven by favorable pricing and sales mix, partially offset by cost inflation.\nIn Safety and Productivity Solutions, sales decreased 15% organically in the quarter. Remember that the first quarter of 2021 was near the height of our COVID-driven mask demand, creating a 9% year-over-year comparison headwind in the quarter. Productivity solutions and services, advanced sensing technologies and our gas detection businesses all grew at double-digit rates in the quarter despite the supply-constrained environment, highlighting the strength in much of the underlying SPS portfolio. As we expected, the timing of Intelligrated sales is shaping up to be a mirror image of 2021 with sales down in the first quarter, and we expect growth in the back half of the year. Segment margins expanded 20 basis points to 14.5%, led by favorable pricing and sales mix, partially offset by lower volume leverage and cost inflation.\nHoneywell Connected Enterprise continues to underpin the growth we are seeing across the portfolio. In the first quarter, recurring revenue grew over 15% with SaaS growth of over 50%, led by the Sparta business. We also saw double-digit growth in our connected buildings, cyber and connected industrial solutions. So for overall Honeywell, our execution allowed us to deliver 10 basis points of segment margin improvement, 10 basis points above the high end of our guide with margin expansion in PMT, HBT and SPS, ending the quarter at 21.1%. And keep in mind, this expansion is net of a 30 basis point year-over-year headwind associated with our investment in Quantinuum.\nOn EPS, we delivered first quarter GAAP earnings per share of $1.64 and adjusted earnings per share of $1.91, which was down $0.01 year-over-year. A bridge for adjusted earnings per share from 1Q '21 to 1Q '22 can be found in the appendix of this presentation. Segment profit was a $0.01 headwind, driven primarily by lower volume and supply chain constraints, partially offset by strong price realization. A lower effective tax rate, 22% this year versus 22.3% last year, drove a $0.01 tailwind.\nShare count reduction drove a $0.04 year-over-year tailwind to earnings per share. We saw a $0.05 headwind from below-the-line items, primarily due to lower pension income and increased repositioning. In response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we suspended substantially all our sales, distribution and service activities in Russia. And as a result, we recorded a charge of $183 million or a $0.27 impact to our GAAP EPS.\nMoving to cash. We generated $50 million of free cash flow in the quarter, which was closely aligned to our expectations. This decrease was driven by higher working capital, including lower payables and higher receivables from strong 4Q collections, in addition to higher inventory as we continue to work through the constrained supply chain environment. Higher cash taxes due to the impact of tax legislation and R&D capitalization were also a free cash flow headwind in the quarter, consistent with our full year guidance.\nFinally, as Darius mentioned earlier, we continue to leverage our strong balance sheet, deploying $2 billion towards high-return opportunities for our shareholders. Notably, we repurchased 5.5 million shares for $1 billion in the first quarter as we executed on our updated commitment to buy back $4 billion in shares in 2022. We also paid approximately $670 million in dividends, spent approximately $180 million in capital expenditures and invested approximately $180 million in M&A as we closed the acquisition of US Digital Designs. So overall, we executed better than expected, managing through a very difficult first quarter and accelerated our capital deployment as promised.\nNow let's turn to Slide 6 to talk about our second quarter and full year guidance. Signs of the recovery continue to unfold in our key markets, underpinned by strong orders growth across many of our businesses, as Darius highlighted in his opening. While uncertainties and persistent challenges remain in the macroeconomic backdrop, our rigorous operating principles have enabled us to demonstrate our agility and resiliency, positioning us well for the recovery ahead.\nOur end market setup continues to be strong with ongoing improvement in global flight hours, return to public spaces and elevated oil prices. Global energy production continues to transition to a low-carbon future. And Honeywell will lead that evolution with our strategically differentiated and sustainable technologies.\nWe expect supply chain impacts to remain as challenging in the second quarter as they were in the first quarter but to start to abate as capacity for electronic components comes online in 3Q. We're confident in the eventual return to normalcy in the aerospace supply chain. However, the timing remains difficult to call. Inflation will continue to be a significant headwind. However, our strategic pricing actions will continue to dampen impact to margins throughout the year.\nIn response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we suspended substantially all our sales, distribution and service activities in Russia, representing approximately 1% of total 2021 sales for Honeywell that we do not expect to return this year. In addition, we're actively monitoring and navigating the worsening COVID-19 lockdown situation in China that is creating sales and supply chain risk.\nWith that as a backdrop, we expect second quarter sales to be in the range of $8.5 billion to $8.8 billion, down 2% to up 2% on an organic basis, or flat to up 4%, excluding the 1 point impact of the mask sales decline and the 1 point impact of lost Russian sales. This sales range assumes that COVID-19 lockdowns in China alleviate in May and that the Chinese operating environment remains relatively normal.\nDespite the ongoing macro uncertainties, we now expect full year sales of $35.5 billion to $36.4 billion, which represents an increase of $100 million on the low end from our prior guidance, up 4% to 7% organically, with accelerated growth as the year progresses. That represents organic growth of 6% to 9%, excluding the 1 point impact of the lower mask demand and 1 point impact of lost Russian sales. We expect that our disciplined price actions will keep us ahead of the current inflationary environment, contributing approximately 5% to our sales growth, which is higher than we anticipated in our original guide and offsetting the majority of the approximately $400 million of lost Russia sales.\nNow let's take a moment to walk through the second quarter and full year expectations by segment. An update on our 2022 end market outlook can be found in the appendix of this presentation. Starting with Aerospace, the overall industry supply chain complex continues to be a challenge, but we do expect to see moderate improvement throughout the year. Sequential growth in flight hours will lead to another quarter of robust growth for our air transport and business and general aviation aftermarket businesses. This momentum will carry through to the end of '22 with growth led by the air transport aftermarket.\nWith build rates improving as expected, business and general aviation original equipment will grow sequentially each quarter for the balance of 2022. As '22 progresses and our comps ease, defense and space will see sequential improvement from the first quarter and return to year-over-year growth in the second half. We still expect full year organic sales growth for Aerospace to be up high single digits. Growth in the original equipment will lead to mix-related margin headwinds throughout the year. But we expect Aero margins to grow sequentially from the first half to the second half.\nIn Building Technologies, we expect momentum to continue with sales growth both sequentially and year-over-year throughout 2022 as supply chain constraints, particularly around semiconductors, begin to ease and we deliver on strong demand for fire and security products and building management systems. Our targeted pricing actions will also provide growth on top of that unlocked volume. We expect building solutions to return to growth in the second quarter and rebound well into the second half, finishing the year off strong.\nUnderpinning the growth throughout the portfolio are our healthy buildings offering, which will benefit from increased demand for air quality and touchless technologies. Higher government spending on infrastructure will provide additional growth opportunities for us as well. Overall, we now expect full year organic sales growth of high single digits to double digits, trending better than expected. We continue to work diligently to combat the current inflationary environment. And our cost controls and pricing actions will ensure that we maintain and build upon our margin expansion in both the second quarter and the back half of the year.\nIn Performance Materials and Technologies, the macro setup remains favorable for our portfolio as we are uniquely positioned to both participate in the oil and gas reinvestment cycle as well as enable the energy transition. However, PMT has the largest exposure to Russia among our segments. And our decision to substantially suspend operations in the country represents a near-term sales growth headwind, particularly in UOP. Process solutions project orders are expected to remain strong throughout the year. And volumes in the products businesses will increase as supply availability improves.\nIn UOP, we see sequential improvement in the second quarter and throughout the year as catalyst reloads increase in refining markets, and we are encouraged by the order pipeline for our sustainable technology. UOP is also a significant contributor to the liquefied natural gas capacity globally. And recent government announcements suggest incremental LNG capacity may ramp beyond what has already been committed, representing a promising opportunity for the business.\nAdvanced materials pricing will continue to be a tailwind throughout the year. And we are expanding capacity to position ourselves for further growth. In total, we still expect PMT sales to be up mid- to high single digits for the year. PMT margins will benefit from our pricing and productivity actions. And we expect sequential and year-over-year margin expansion in 2Q and continued sequential improvement in the second half.\nTurning to Safety and Productivity Solutions. We expect productivity solutions and services, advanced sensing technologies and gas detection to build on their momentum from the first quarter and continue to grow throughout the year. These businesses saw a year-over-year backlog growth of over 25% in 1Q and have demonstrated their ability to execute in difficult macro conditions, giving us confidence in the growth trajectory there, especially as the supply chain environment improves. Lower COVID-related mask demand will continue to be a year-over-year drag in 2Q. But as we enter the second half of the year, we'll lap the difficult pandemic comps and personal protective equipment sales will return to growth, led by other product offerings in the portfolio.\nIn Intelligrated, we're encouraged by the progress we have made in improving our operational efficiency and profitability. And we're increasing our focus on project selectivity, finding the right balance between top and bottom line growth as we discussed. We still expect SPS sales to be flattish year-over-year for the full year with sequential improvement each quarter. However, we anticipate margins to expand sequentially throughout the year as business mix, pricing and volume compound.\nNow let me turn to our expectations for the other core guided metrics. For second quarter segment margins, we expect to be in the range of 20.5% to 20.9%, resulting in 10 to 50 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion. Excluding the 30 basis point headwind from Quantinuum, we expect margins to expand 40 to 80 basis points. Second quarter net below-the-line impact, which is the difference between segment profit and income before tax, is expected to be in the range of $0 to $45 million with a range of repositioning between $40 million and $80 million as we continue to fund ongoing restructuring projects. We expect the second quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 24% and the average share count to be approximately 687 million shares. As a result, we expect adjusted second quarter earnings per share between $1.98 and $2.08, down 2% to up 3% year-over-year.\nTurning to the full year. We continue to expect segment margins to expand 10 to 50 basis points, supported by higher sales volumes, price/cost management and our continued rigor on fixed costs. Excluding the 30 basis point headwind from Quantinuum, we expect margins to expand 40 to 80 basis points in the year. SPS will lead the margin expansion for the company as we continue to prioritize profitability in 2022 in that business, followed by HBT and PMT with Aero about flat year-over-year.\nWe continue to expect our full year net below-the-line impact to be in the range of negative $100 million to positive $50 million, including capacity for $300 million to $425 million of repositioning in the year. We expect the full year effective tax rate of approximately 22%. And we now expect a weighted average share count to be in the range of 684 million to 687 million shares for the year, reflecting our updated commitment to repurchase $4 billion of Honeywell shares in 2022.\nWe have raised our full year earnings per share expectations to $8.50 to $8.80, up 5% to 9% adjusted, an increase of $0.10 on both ends versus our prior guidance due to our accelerated share repurchase commitment. We still expect to see free cash flow in the range of $4.7 billion to $5.1 billion in 2022 or $4.9 billion to $5.3 billion, excluding the impact of Quantinuum. So in total, we're raising our full year earnings per share guidance and increasing the midpoint of our sales range, absorbing the impact of external macroeconomic factors.\nNow let me turn it back to Darius to discuss our enhanced environmental commitment coming out of our recent Investor Day.\n\nDarius E. Adamczyk\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Honeywell International Inc.\n\nThank you, Greg. Let's turn to Slide 7 and talk about the more aspirational approach we're taking to our ESG commitments. ESG has been part of Honeywell's DNA for decades. And we have an established track record of success in this area.\nSince we stood up our sustainability program in 2004, we've achieved every one of the ambitious targets we have set for ourselves, reduced our greenhouse gas emissions intensity by approximately 90% while spending over $4 billion on remediation projects to restore thousands of acres of land for our communities. While we're thrilled in the successes we have had in the past, we believe we still have much to accomplish in the future. We're currently on track to deliver on our 10-10-10 target set in 2019, further reducing our greenhouse gas emissions while deploying renewable energy projects and improving energy efficiencies at our sites.\nIn addition, last year, we committed to achieving carbon-neutral facilities in operations by 2035, a full 15 years earlier than the Paris climate accords. While these targets are successful in reducing our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, we didn't stop there. Earlier this year, we submitted a commitment to the Science Based Targets initiative to address our Scope 3 emissions across our value chain. Lowering the environmental footprint of our products, we continue to innovate with products and services that help our customers reduce their own emissions.\nIn addition to our ambitious sustainability targets, we've also enhanced our ESG disclosures with additional metrics on our Investor Relations website. These include an ESG data sheet that has metrics for diversity, water, greenhouse gas and more, a defense and space factsheet that includes more detailed information on our sales makeup and a document that breaks down Honeywell's many ESG-oriented offerings, which comprise more than 60% of our revenue today.\nNow let's turn to Slide 8 for some closing thoughts before we move into Q&A. As always, our value-creation framework helped us successfully navigate the quarter and over-deliver on our commitments. Most of our end markets will continue to recover, and we are optimistic about our future. Despite the ongoing geopolitical challenges, including approximately $400 million of lost Russian sales, we raised the midpoint of our full year sales range and increased our earnings per share expectations. Our value-creation framework is working. With the ongoing recovery of our end market, we remain optimistic about the future of our business. While there is a heightened level of macro uncertainty at present, we remain confident in our ability to execute on the pieces within our control.\nWith that, Sean, let's move to Q&A.\n\nSean Christopher Meakim\n\nVP of IR, Honeywell International Inc.\n\nThank you, Darius. Darius, Greg, Anne and Torsten are now available to answer your questions. (Operator Instructions) Shannon, please open the line for Q&A.",

Adamczyk\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Honeywell International Inc.\n\nThank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 2. We delivered a strong fourth quarter despite a challenging backdrop that included an accelerated inflationary environment, ongoing supply chain constraints and persistent COVID-19 variants. I'm pleased for our disciplined execution as we navigate these challenges, capitalize on the ongoing recovery in our end markets.\nWe delivered on our fourth quarter commitments for sales, segment margin and adjusted earnings per share despite these headwinds, with fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.09, up 1% year-over-year and just above the midpoint of our guidance.\nOrganic sales were down 2% year-over-year, and that was heavily impacted by the COVID mass declines and fewer days in the fiscal quarter, which Greg will touch on later. Our focus on differentiated solutions drove double-digit fourth quarter organic sales growth in the commercial aerospace aftermarket, productivity solutions and services, advanced sensing technologies and recurring connected software businesses.\nSegment margin expanded 30 basis points year-over-year, led by strong pricing actions that we took again this quarter to address the headwinds we faced from inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions. These swift pricing actions allow us to stay ahead of the inflation curve, driving a 5% increase year-over-year on top line and yielding approximately 50 basis points of margin expansions net of inflation.\nWe generated $2.6 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, 4% above the 4Q 2020, achieving 178% adjusted conversion. In terms of capital deployment, we put $2.1 billion of cash to work in the fourth quarter. Looking at the entire year, orders across Honeywell grew double digits organically and backlog increased 7% to $27.7 billion driven by strength in many of our segments as we entered 2022. We finished 2021 with 4% organic sales growth, 60 basis points of margin expansion and $8.06 of adjusted earnings per share, up 14% year-over-year. We generated $5.7 billion of free cash flow in the year, resulting in adjusted conversion of 102% or 17% of revenue, a very strong result. Our earnings per share and our free cash flow performance was above our initial guidance range shared at the start of 2021, demonstrating our ability to deliver on our commitments despite unforeseen challenges and shifting economic conditions.\nIn the appendix of this presentation is a slide highlighting our guidance progression throughout 2021 as well as our performance against these guides.\nOn our capital deployment strategy, we have maintained a balanced approach over the past several years, consistently deploying more than 100% of operating cash flow to fund share repurchases, dividends, M&A and capital expenditures. This past year was no exception. In fact, 2021 marks the highest level of capital deployment in the last 6 years. Despite the challenges we faced in 2021, we deployed $8.5 billion of capital, demonstrating our commitment to investing in high-return opportunities in any environment.\nWe invested $1.6 billion in M&A, adding strategic assets to our portfolio that enhance our technology offerings, innovation and ultimately, our long-term growth potential. Specifically, we completed 4 transactions, including Sparta Systems, Fiplex, Performix and the $270 million we contribute to [Quantinuum] combination, which I'll talk about -- more about in a moment. We spent $900 million on capital expenditures to continue to build technologies to make our world safer, more efficient and more sustaining. We deployed $3.4 billion to repurchase shares, reducing our weighted average share count by 1.5%. And finally, we maintain a strong dividend policy, paying out $2.6 billion and raising our dividend again for the 12th time in 11 years. Looking forward, I continue to be encouraged by the strength we are seeing in many areas of our portfolio as we continue to execute on our rigorous and proven value creation framework, underpinned by our accelerator operating system that drives outstanding shareholder value.\nNext, let's turn to Slide 3 to discuss some exciting wins in our Sustainable Technology Solutions business. We continue to make substantial gains for our sustainability business. In the fourth quarter, we announced the commercialization of our UpCycle Process Technology, a revolutionary new process that expands the types of plastics that can be recycled. This process can produce feedstock used to make recycled plastics for a much lower carbon footprint and has the potential to increase the amount of global plastic waste that can recycle to 90%.\nIn addition, just last week, we announced our intent to form a joint venture with Avangard Innovative, America's largest plastics recycler, to build an advanced recycling plant in Texas. The facility will use our UpCycle Process Technology and is expected to have the capacity to transform 30,000 metric tons of mixed waste plastics into Honeywell recycled polymer feedstocks per year.\nWe also recently announced that we've entered into an agreement with FREYR Battery, the intent to provide smart energy storage solutions to address the needs of a wide range of commercial and industrial customers alike. FREYR will leverage Honeywell's leading technology offerings, including integrated automation, field instrumentation and security integration solutions or manufacturing processes. In turn, Honeywell will purchase 38 gigawatt hours of battery cells produced by FREYR from multiple of energy storage system applications.\nBattery energy storage systems technology development is vital to the continued decarbonization of global power system as will enable the transition to renewable energy sources. In the fourth quarter, we announced an agreement with the University of Texas at Austin that will enable the lower cost capture of carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and heavy industry. We have committed to achieve carbon neutrality in our own operations and facilities by 2035. We are committed to helping our customers use their carbon footprint as well. We'll leverage UT Austin's proprietary advanced solvent technology to help power steel, cement and other industrial plants lower their emissions and meet their sustainability goals.\nFinally, we saw tremendous traction in our green fuels business, which uses UOP's Ecofining technology to produce high-quality drop-in-fuels from sustainable sources. Over the last few months, we recorded 6 important wins, including 2 large multinational companies.\nIn addition, Diamond Green Diesel is using Ecofining technology to produce renewable diesel. They plan on having the capacity to produce over 1 billion gallons per year by the second half of 2022.\nThese are just 4 select examples from our vast portfolio of sustainable offerings. We will continue to innovate, demonstrating that Honeywell will be a key player of the oncoming energy transition.\nNow let's turn to the next slide to take a look at some of the big commercial developments and how we are aggressively investing in growth. If you've been following our press releases over the past quarters, including the examples highlighted on the previous slide, you are well aware of the successes we are having with new innovations and partnerships. We have many growth opportunities across the portfolio with new products, businesses or entirely new markets. These areas present high return opportunities to deploy our CapEx and OpEx spend to create value for the future.\nTo highlight a few examples, in 2022, we are increasing CapEx investment to expand our Solstice production capacity, commercialize our advanced plastics recycling technology and build additional generations of both commercial and development quantum computers. To fund key investment priorities in '22, we plan to spend $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion in CapEx, up $200 million versus 2021, up 25% versus the prior 3 years. Our 2022 research and development priorities will be continued innovation in sustainable topologies developing our next-generation flight deck and investment in new engine development, to name a few.\nR&D for '22 will be up approximately $200 million or 15% year-over-year and up 10% versus the prior 3 years. Our internal spending on capital projects in R&D has consistent in the highest return deployment of our capital. We'll continue to make these investments to drive our future growth.\nAlso, Honeywell Digital, one of the 3 main transformation initiatives, has fundamentally changed the way we work (inaudible) capital benefits since 2018. We'll continue to invest in our digitization efforts to drive efficiencies and produce valuable data-driven insights. While this may be a modest drag on our cash generation in '22, these investments are crucial to accelerating our growth and drive transformation across our portfolio.\nLet's turn to Slide 5 to take a closer look at Quantinuum during the major breakthrough initiatives for Honeywell. In the fourth quarter, we completed our previously announced business combination of Honeywell Quantum Solutions and Cambridge Quantum to form a new company, Quantinuum. As mentioned in our investor communications throughout 2021, this combination marries the leading Quantum computing hardware, the leading Quantum computing software to form the largest and most advanced integrated stand-alone Quantum computing company in the world. Quantinuum technology will help solve the world's most pressing challenges, including breakthroughs in drug discovery and delivery, material science and industrial optimization, to just name a few. Quantinuum cybersecurity offering launched in December. Quantum Origin is the world's first commercial product built upon Quantum computers that delivers outcomes that classical computers could not achieve. This revolutionary new product will be crucial to companies and governments, who need to ensure protection of sensitive information against adversaries and criminals.\nWith the introduction of Quantum Origin, which is already serving Fortune 500 customers today, we expect continuing to reach approximately $2 billion of sales by 2026, 1 year earlier than the estimate we provided in our leadership webcast back in November. Upon the completion of the combination, Honeywell invested $270 million into Quantinuum, and Honeywell currently owns a majority stake. We expect a slight margin headwind of 30 basis points to Honeywell in 2022 due to increased R&D spend associated with Quantinuum, as shown on the previous slide. Overall, we expect Quantinuum to be $150 million headwind to EBITDA. However, this R&D investment will yield great returns as we accelerate the commercialization of this revolutionary technology. The appendix of this presentation contains a slide explaining the 2022 financial impact to Honeywell in more detail.\nWe believe this unique opportunity for investors to gain exposure to an early-stage growth technology company at an industrial multiple. Quantinuum is the best positioned company doing Quantum computing and has all the building blocks to be the frontrunner in what is projected to be $1 trillion industry.\nNow I will turn the call over to Greg to discuss our fourth quarter results and 2022 outlook in more detail.\n\nGregory Peter Lewis\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Honeywell International Inc.\n\nThank you, Darius, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 6. As Darius highlighted, we delivered on our financial commitments despite a very difficult operating environment. Fourth quarter sales declined 2% organically as supply chain constraints continued in the quarter, predominantly in Aero, HBT and SPS. The quarter also had difficult year-over-year comps, with lower COVID-related mass demand impacting growth by 2 percentage points and 6 fewer days than fiscal 4Q 2020, which is worth approximately 3 percentage points.\nTurning to the segments. Aerospace fourth quarter sales were down 3% organically compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 as we continue to manage through the supply chain constraints we're facing. Continued flight-hour improvement led to over 20% year-over-year growth in air transport aftermarket sales and over 10% growth in business and general aviation aftermarket sales. Business and General Aviation original equipment sales also grew double digits in the quarter. Defense & Space was down 18% year-over-year in the fourth quarter with softness in U.S. defense, partially offset by international defense, which grew sequentially and year-over-year.\nSegment margins expanded 140 basis points to 29% as a result of value capture, improved business mix with higher aftermarket sales and productivity, partially offset by higher cost of materials. Building Technologies sales declined 1% organically year-over-year due to continuing supply chain constraints across the business, partially offset by pricing. Though orders were up 4% in the quarter, backlog in Building Solutions was up double digits year-over-year with growth in both projects and services positioning HBT for strong performance in 2022.\nOur healthy Buildings portfolio finished the year strong with over $200 million of orders in the quarter, bringing the total orders for 2021 to well over $400 million. Segment margins in HBT continue to be strong at 21.1% in the quarter, though it was down 30 basis points year-over-year, driven by lower volume leverage and cost inflation, mostly offset by favorable pricing.\nIn Performance Materials and Technologies, sales were up 2% organically, led by 7% growth in UOP and 5% growth in Advanced Materials. UOP sales growth was driven by higher petrochemical catalyst and gas processing shipments while Advanced Materials benefited from continued double-digit sales growth in Life Sciences and Protective and Industrial Solutions.\nProcess Solutions sales were down 3% organically with slower recovery in projects and supply availability constraining smart energy production. However, orders growth across the HPS portfolio, including double-digit orders growth in the projects businesses, provides confidence in the longer-term outlook for the business.\nOrders in UOP were up 25% year-over-year, including triple digits and Sustainable Technology Solutions, another signal for strong 2022 growth. PMT segment margins expanded 430 basis points to 23% in the fourth quarter, driven by favorable pricing and productivity, net of inflation.\nTurning to Safety and Productivity Solutions, where sales were down 6% organically, mainly due to a 12-point impact from COVID-related masks. Intelligrated was flat year-over-year and down sequentially, as expected, as the level of delivery and installation came down from its 2Q peak.\nProductivity Solutions and Services continues to be a star in the portfolio, along with the Sensing business, both of which had double-digit sales growth in the quarter. SPS backlog remains above $4 billion as declines in the mass business were mostly offset by triple-digit growth in Advanced Sensing and Technologies and over 90% growth in Productivity Solutions and Services, giving us confidence in the future growth. SPS segment margins contracted 450 basis points to 10.8%, driven by lower volume leverage and inefficiencies caused by ongoing supply chain challenges in Intelligrated, which we highlighted in our previous earnings call, and I'll touch on again in a moment.\nSo for overall Honeywell, we delivered 30 basis points of segment margin improvement with margin expansion in PMT and Aero, ending the quarter with segment margins of 21.4%, a 20 basis point sequential improvement versus the third quarter. We drove targeted pricing again in the quarter across the portfolio to combat the accelerated impacts of inflation.\nOn EPS, we delivered fourth quarter GAAP earnings per share of $2.05 and adjusted earnings per share of $2.09, which was up $0.02 year-over-year. A bridge for our adjusted earnings per share from 4Q '20 to 4Q '21 can be found in the appendix of this presentation.\nSegment profit was a $0.03 headwind, driven primarily by lower volume due to fewer days, mass volumes and supply chain constraints, offset by price and cost actions. Higher effective tax rate, 19.7% this year versus 18.9% last year, drove a $0.02 headwind. Share count reduction drove a $0.04 year-over-year tailwind to earnings per share, and we saw a $0.03 benefit from below-the-line items due to higher pension income that was partially offset by increased repositioning and other.\nRepositioning others specifically was approximately $160 million, just below the midpoint of our 4Q guidance of $140 million to $215 million and included a $105 million charge in the fourth quarter due to incremental long-term contract labor cost overages in Intelligrated caused by severe supply chain disruptions from COVID-19. The accelerating challenges of supply chain disruptions and labor shortages in the second half of '21, coupled with the hyper growth of the business and the link between material supply and installation efficiency in the Intelligrated model, drove specific identifiable nonrecurring costs, which were recorded in repositioning and other. This charge is forward-looking and accounts for projects which are yet to be completed. In 2022, we expect roughly $30 million to $50 million of carryover costs, the impact of which is incorporated into our 2022 repositioning and other guidance. Other inefficiencies were reflected in the Intelligrated and SPS P&L, as I mentioned earlier in the discussion of the SPS margins.\nMoving on to cash. We generated $2.6 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, up 4% year-over-year. This increase was driven by lower working capital, including strong collections and world-class payables, offset by higher inventory as we continue to work through the constrained supply chain environment and extended lead times.\nWe also had a $211 million accelerated cash receipt in the quarter from Garrett per our contractual claims under the plan of reorganization signed last year. As a reminder, we include cash receipts from Garrett within free cash flow in order to be comparable to prior periods, where the cash proceeds from the indemnification and reimbursement agreement were recognized.\nFinally, as Darius mentioned earlier, we deployed $2.1 billion towards high-return opportunities for our shareholders. We paid $680 million in dividends, repurchased $880 million in shares, over delivering on our commitment of a minimum 1% share count in '21, and we deployed approximately $280 million in CapEx and invested $270 million in Quantinuum. So overall, we managed successfully through another challenging quarter and closed out 2021 on a strong note.\nNow let's turn to Slide 7 to talk about our markets and segment outlook for 2022. We continue to see promising signs of the recovery unfolds as well as encouraging wins in our key markets. The backdrop for 2022 does have a number of uncertainties in it, the ongoing global pandemic, continued supply chain constraints, accelerated inflation and labor market challenges. And at each turn, our rigorous operating principles have enabled us to demonstrate our agility and resiliency battling these situations.\nAcross our end markets, the macro setup continues to be strong. Increased COVID-19 vaccination rates and higher immunity should lessen infection rates, pointing to signs of the pandemic subsiding and leading to continued improvement in global flight hours and returns to buildings. Investments will continue to flow towards transitioning global energy production to a low-carbon future, and Honeywell will continue to lead that evolution as we invest in our strategically differentiated and sustainable technologies.\nWe expect supply chain impacts to remain as challenging in the first half of the year as they were in the third and fourth quarter, and they'll start to abate as the aero supply base ramps up and capacity for electronic components comes online in the third quarter. Inflation will continue to be a significant headwind. However, our agile pricing actions will dampen the impacts to margin throughout the year. Corporate tax legislation continues to be a watch area for both earnings and cash, while I'll talk about a little bit later.\nAs for the segments, in '22, we expect Aerospace to continue to benefit from the recovery in flight hours, leading to robust growth in commercial aftermarket sales. Commercial build rates will continue to improve, especially in air transport, providing growth in original equipment sales, while creating some mix headwinds on margins.\nDefense & Space sales will experience progressively improved performance as supply chain challenges abate, returning the business to growth in the second half and ending the year roughly flat. In total, we expect Aerospace sales to be up high single digits for the year. Despite some mix pressure and the ramp-up in R&D expenses for the long-term programs, margins will expand as Honeywell Quantum Solutions business investment moves out of Aero and into corporate costs.\nHBT will see continued strong demand in '22 as the world continues to reopen and sustainable solutions see increased use. We expect end markets to gradually recover throughout the year, including government, education and office buildings. Increased government funding for infrastructure, both in the U.S. and Europe, provide further opportunities across the portfolio.\nPressure from supply chain constraints, particularly semiconductors, will impact the business, especially in the first half, but we'll continue to execute on our mitigation actions and expect the business to grow high single digits for the year. We expect our margins to expand, driven by higher sales on our streamlined cost base.\nPerformance Materials and Technologies has one of the most favorable macro setups in our portfolio, and we will see growth accelerate throughout the year. We expect Process Solutions sales to sequentially improve. Process Solutions product orders will continue to grow at a healthy rate following the double-digit order growth we saw in the fourth quarter of '21 as traditional energy projects begin to gradually recover, and we see strength across new verticals like life sciences and sustainable energy storage that are driving increased demand.\nThe increase in UOP engineering and licensing orders over the past few months gives us confidence in the follow-on Process Solutions projects growth over the medium term. UOP catalyst shipments will remain strong as demand shifts from petrochemicals to refining, where we expect a reload cycle to emerge in the energy space.\nAdvanced Materials demand remains robust, and we expect sales to increase throughout the year, especially as we complete production capacity expansion projects such as our planned increase in our Solstice line of ultra-low global warming potential solutions. In addition to Solstice, our other sustainable offerings in renewable fuels, carbon capture, energy storage and plastics recycling will benefit from the increased customer focus on environmental responsibility and efficiency. In total, we expect PMT sales to be up mid- to high single digits for the year. We expect PMT margins to expand as well as a result of continued pricing and productivity actions as well as increased volume leverage.\nIn Safety and Productivity Solutions, demand for productivity solutions and services, advanced sensing technologies and gas detection all remain strong, and their increased backlogs create strong runway for '22 growth. Lower COVID-related mass demand will affect the first quarter most heavily, driving a 9% drag on SPS in Q1 and then will abate throughout the year.\nIn Intelligrated, after ending 2021 with approximately 50% year-over-year hyper growth, we expect sales to be flattish year-over-year in '22 as we adjust our portfolio towards a better balance of growth and near-term profitability. We're targeting substantial margin expansion in Intelligrated in 2022 and expect sequential improvement throughout the year, with the second half revenue being higher than the first, the opposite dynamic versus what we saw in 2021. So overall, we expect SPS sales to be flattish year-over-year, with sales growth higher in the second half versus the first half and margins expanding materially as business mix and supply chain challenges subside.\nSo overall for Honeywell, we see improvement across most of our end markets throughout '22, and we have confidence in our continued operational execution. We'll manage through another challenging operational environment with accelerating growth as the year progresses.\nNow let's move to Slide 8 to discuss how these dynamics come together for our 2022 financial guidance. In total, for '22, we expect sales of $35.4 billion to $36.4 billion, which represents overall organic sales growth in the range of 4% to 7%. We'll continue to drive pricing actions to combat this inflationary environment, and we expect approximately 4% of our sales growth to come through price. Excluding the impact of the lower COVID mass demand, which will approximately be a 1 point headwind, we expect organic growth of 5% to 8%.\nThe first half will be slower and, as additional supplier capacity comes online, we'll see significant sequential improvement and stronger growth in the back half of the year. Segment margins are extended -- are expected to [extend] 10 to 50 basis points, despite a robust investment [year], supported by higher sales volumes, price/cost management and our continued rigor on fixed costs. Excluding the 30 basis point headwind from Quantinuum OpEx that Darius mentioned earlier, we expect margins to expand 40 to 80 basis points. We are excited about the trajectory of Quantinuum and the value creation that this investment will bring. We expect margin expansion across all of our businesses in '22, with SPS leading the pack as we prioritize profitability versus growth.\nFor the year, we expect earnings per share of $8.40 to $8.70, up 4% to 8% adjusted. We see free cash flow in the range of $4.7 billion to $5.1 billion in '22 or $4.9 billion to $5.3 billion, excluding Quantinuum, which I'll walk through in a couple of minutes.\nFor now let's turn to Slide 9 and talk through our 2022 EPS bridge. On EPS segment profit is expected to be a key driver of our earnings growth, contributing $0.58 per share at the midpoint of our guidance or about 7% growth.\nNext, below the line, which is the difference between segment profit and income before tax, is expected to be in the range of negative $100 million to positive $50 million, which reserves capacity for $300 million to $425 million of repositioning and other. This includes between $30 million and $50 million related to the carryover cost from supply chain disruptions in Intelligrated.\nOn the pension front, we expect approximately [$1,050,000,000] of pension and [OPEB] income in '22, down approximately $100 million from 2021, as we have adjusted our plans for higher discount rates due to interest rate movements and the adjustment of our expected returns.\nOur diligent management and strong returns have been an important value driver for the company, putting us in a position where our pension-funded status continues to be robust, ending the year at approximately 120%. With these inputs, below the line and other items are expected to be down $0.15 per share year-over-year at the midpoint, mainly driven by the lower pension income.\nQuantinuum will result in a headwind of approximately $0.03 per share as the net P&L investment is partially offset with noncontrolling interest. For taxes, we expect an effective rate of 22%, and our base case is that our minimum 1% share count reduction program will result in a benefit of $0.09 per share, reducing our weighted average shares from 700 million to at least 693 million.\nSo in total, we expect '22 earnings per share to be in the range of $8.40 to $8.70, up 48% year-over-year adjusted. However, excluding the impact from Quantum and below-the-line and other items, we would see year-over-year earnings per share growth of 8% at the midpoint.\nNow let's turn to Slide 10 and discuss the drivers of our free cash flow guidance for '22. As we outlined on this bridge, 2022 cash flow will be the tale of 3 dynamics: healthy net income growth, 2 meaningful nonoperational adjustments and an increase in investment in exciting growth vectors. The 2 main detractors are lower Garrett cash receipts due to an elevated payment of $375 million in 2021 and higher cash taxes between $400 million and $600 million, as current R&D capitalization, tax legislation and other law changes may result in meaningful year-over-year headwinds. While there is still a possibility that legislation will be enacted that defers the requirement to capitalize R&D, we are including higher cash taxes in our current outlook as we'll be required to make these payments unless existing law is amended by legislation before the end of March.\nAs you would expect from Honeywell, we'll continue investing in our long-term growth with between $200 million and $300 million incremental capital expenditures in '22 to build solutions that will help us solve challenging problems for our customers and address critical global sustainability issues. In addition, as Darius highlighted, we're investing an incremental $100 million in cutting-edge technology like Quantinuum. These strategically important investments are building on the momentum we have with the recent wins, both in sustainable solutions and more broadly across Honeywell, creating value for our shareholders.\nThis outlook could, of course, get better if tax law changes play out differently, and our CapEx this year should be a bit of a peak. So I'm very confident that we'll continue to be a strong cash generator prospectively.\nNow let's turn to Slide 11 for a preview of the first quarter. We're entering 1Q with a very strong backlog and a number of challenges persisting in this operating environment and some evolving economic and geopolitical uncertainties. We expect organic growth in the first quarter in the range of down 2% to up 1%, driven by the ongoing supply constraints; current COVID dynamics, which have dampened travel somewhat versus 4Q; and evolving geopolitical uncertainties. We'll continue to deploy pricing actions to combat rising costs, and we expect price increases to drive approximately 4% of sales growth in the quarter.\nThis quarter will be our toughest comp for the year as the first quarter of 2021 was near the peak of our COVID-related mass demand. Excluding the 2 percentage point impact of lower masks, we would be -- we would expect organic growth in the range of flat to up 3%. We expect segment margins in the range of 20.6% to 21% in the first quarter, down 40 basis points to flat year-over-year. Excluding the impact of Quantinuum, we expect segment margins to be down 10 to up 30 basis points as our price/cost actions and cost management mostly offset the volume leverage challenges we're facing in the supply-constrained environment.\nThe net below-the-line impact is expected to be between $30 million to $75 million expense, with a range of repositioning between $120 million and $160 million in the quarter as we continue to provide capacity to fund ongoing restructuring. We expect the effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% and average share count to be approximately 697 million shares. As a result, we expect first quarter EPS between $1.80 and $1.90, down 6% to down 1% year-over-year.\nAnd lastly, first quarter is historically our lowest from a cash perspective. And with the supply chain impacts that we have been facing, [those] will continue to drive higher inventory levels, dampening our cash generation in the short term.\nNow let's take a moment to walk through our expectations by segment. In Aero, we expect flight hours to remain relatively flat to the fourth quarter, though COVID may dampen it some. It will be up significantly year-over-year, leading to another quarter of strong growth in both Air Transport and Business and General Aviation.\nAir Transport original equipment should return to growth as build rates begin to improve. And in Defense & Space, International Defense will continue to grow and stable U.S. defense spending will lead to volumes that are relatively flat to the fourth quarter, though down slightly year-on-year.\nIn Building Technologies, we expect business conditions to remain similar to fourth quarter with strong demand but continued supply constraints. Demand for our healthy Building Solutions should remain strong as the world continues to combat COVID-19 and the Omicron variant. The business should see sequential and year-over-year growth as we execute on our robust backlog in Building Solutions and see continued demand for fire and security products.\nIn PMT, we expect continued year-over-year sales growth in the first quarter. Strong demand for Thermal Solutions will drive growth in Process Solutions, while the projects business begins to move past its pre-COVID decline comps. Increased catalyst shipments and process technologies licensing will support growth in UOP, though they'll be partially offset by lower equipment volumes due to project life-cycle timing.\nAdvanced Materials sales will continue to increase in the quarter due to sustained high demand across the product lines as well as pricing actions implemented to offset commodity inflation.\nFinally, in SPS, Q1 will be its most difficult quarter. We expect sales to be down year-over-year due to the 9-point impact of mass demand and Intelligrated sales that will be near the second half exit rate as opposed to the very strong start in Q1 of last year. We'll see strong double-digit growth in the first quarter from productivity solutions and services, advanced sensing technologies and gas detection as they execute on the robust backlog. Productivity Solutions and services has been a star in the portfolio, and we expect this business to continue to gain market share.\nSo overall, the road ahead remains challenging, but we're confident in our ability to navigate through this operating environment in the first quarter, and we're extremely optimistic about our prospects for the future.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call back over to Darius.\n\nDarius E. Adamczyk\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Honeywell International Inc.\n\nThank you, Greg. Let's turn to Slide 12 and talk about our corporate governance at Honeywell. Integrity and ethics, inclusion and diversity and workplace respect, our foundational principles, are core to our strategy at Honeywell. Our focus on these principles is evident in our corporate governance efforts throughout the entire organization from top to bottom. We have a diverse and independent Board of Directors overseeing the business and an executive team that is committed to fostering a culture built on these foundational principles.\nThrough our annual training to all of our employees, we educated on our code of business conduct and promote honest business practices, compliance to all laws and regulations and respect in the workplace. We recently launched Honeywell Accelerator and revitalized the operating system that provides a centralized source of training programs designed to further develop our employees, enhance the way we manage, govern and operate the business. Accelerator allows us to educate and standardize around our best practices and will empower our employees with the knowledge and tools needed to perform their roles.\nIn January, we announced a new addition to our Board of Directors. Rose Lee was elected to join the Board as an Independent Director. Rose is currently President and Chief Executive Officer of Cornerstone Building Brands, a leading manufacturer of exterior building products in North America. Rose is a unique blend of leadership skills, deep knowledge of operations and technology and a passion for environmental, social and governance experts. Prior to joining Cornerstone Building Brands, Rose served as President of the DuPont Water & Protection business, focusing on improving sustainability through the company's water, shelter and safety solutions. She's also spearheaded initiatives to advance minorities, women's and veterans. Rose's perspective will be a valuable addition to our Board as we further advance Honeywell's transformation.\nNow let's turn to Slide 13 for some closing thoughts before we move into Q&A. In the first year of recovery was not without its challenges. However, we effectively managed macroeconomic difficulties and over delivered our financial commitments. We didn't stay on the sidelines, but instead, we took action to grow the business, including increasing our capital deployment. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we'll continue to invest for the future of Honeywell. While several COVID-related headwinds will drag into early part of 2022, the macro setup is trending favorably for most of our end markets and are optimistic about our future.\nOur recent innovations, including new safety and sustainability offerings, will drive long-term growth and us to meet some of the world's most pressing needs.\nOne last item before we move to Q&A. I'm pleased to announce that our 2022 Investor Day will be held on March 3 at our corporate headquarters in Charlotte. At this Investor Day, I, along with members of the senior management team, will discuss Honeywell's business strategy, exciting new growth opportunities and an updated long-term growth algorithm. We look forward to sharing more with you about Honeywell's future at that time.\nWith that, Sean, let's move to Q&A.",

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Peter Flynn, Senior Director of Investor Relations and Insurance. Please go ahead.\n\nPeter Francis Flynn\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Haley, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Evergy's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. Our webcast slides and supplemental financial information are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.evergy.com. Today's discussion will include forward-looking information. Slide 2 and the disclosure in our SEC filings contain a list of some of the factors that could cause future results to differ materially from our expectations. They also include additional information on our non-GAAP financial measures.\nJoining us on today's call are David Campbell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bryan Buckler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. David will cover third quarter highlights and provide updates on economic development activities and our regulatory agenda. Bryan will cover our third quarter results, retail sales trends and our financial outlook. Other members of management are with us and will be available during the Q&A portion of the call. I'll now turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid A. Campbell\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Vistra Energy Corp.\n\nThanks, Pete, and good morning, everyone. I will begin on Slide 5. This morning, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings of $2.03 per share compared to $2 and $0.02 per share a year ago. The increase over last year was driven by a recovery of regulated investments and growth in weather-normalized demand, partially offset by higher interest and depreciation expense and dilution from convertible debt. .\nOur year-to-date adjusted earnings are $3.41 per share compared to $3.46 per share a year ago. With these results year-to-date, we are narrowing our 2025 adjusted EPS guidance range to $3.92 to $4.02 per share from our original 2025 adjusted EPS guidance range of $3.92 to $4.12 per share. The lower midpoint is primarily due to weather headwinds from below normal cooling degree days in the second and third quarters, which negatively impacted our results by $0.13 per share. I would like to compliment the team for implementing mitigating actions across the business, offsetting more than half of the weather headwinds.\nHowever, we have not been able to offset the full magnitude in what has otherwise been a strong year of regulatory and operational execution, while advancing our strategic objectives. Our fundamental long-term outlook remains very strong, bolstered by tailwinds from a generational economic development opportunity and the investment needed to enable it. Brian will discuss the quarterly drivers and our earnings outlook in more detail in his remarks. We've achieved strong operational and reliability performance through September.\nYear-to-date, our generation availability as measured by the forced outage rate as well as our overall grid reliability, as measured by SAIDI, are both favorable to target. These results demonstrate the benefits of our continued infrastructure investments and the hard work of our operations teams. I'd also like to recognize Wolf Creek as it nears completion of our 27th refueling outage with strong safety and overall performance. Wolf Creek generates around 1,200 megawatts of noncarbon meeting energy enough to power more than 800,000 homes. I'd like to thank everyone on our nuclear team for their hard work and focus on sustaining the excellent operational performance of the plant.\nI'm happy to announce a 4% increase in our quarterly dividend or $2.78 per share on an annualized basis. This increase is consistent with our updated growth outlook and working toward the midpoint of our 60% to 70% target payout ratio. Looking ahead, we will provide a comprehensive financial outlook update on our year-end call in February. We will include refreshed views on our low forecast based on large customer impacts, our 5-year capital investment plan, the related financing plan and our long-term adjusted EPS growth outlook.\nThe 5-year capital plan will incorporate expected generation investments to serve load and meet SPP's increasing reserve margin requirements as well as transmission and distribution projects to support reliability. As Bryan will discuss with respect to the long-term update, we believe there are noteworthy tailwinds to earnings power as we advance our plans to support growth and economic development that will benefit our Kansas and Missouri customers and communities.\nSlide 6 outlines our economic development pipeline and opportunities over 15 gigawatts switch relative to our size, represents 1 of the most robust backlogs in the country. Reflecting the geographic advantages of our region, the overall pipeline is strong in both Kansas and Missouri, and we are well positioned to continue to attract new businesses. Large customer interest in the energy service territory remains very strong.\nFocusing on the top 3 categories of the pipeline we outlined a 4 to 6 gigawatt opportunity, large new customer load that represents the most active part of our Q. This Tier 1 demand represents a transformative 10-year growth opportunity for Evergy. When executed, we expect these products will deliver significant regional benefits across our states, supporting a leading-edge digital economy, creating jobs and expanding the tax base, while enabling us to spread system costs over more megawatt hours helping to maintain affordability for all customers.\nWe continue to work closely with Tier 1 large low to develop and implement transmission and distribution solutions to serve their expected ramp rates over the coming years. We are confident that we will be successful in winning and serving a large portion of this queue, which would in turn transform the size and growth of our company and enhance the economic prosperity of our region. The remaining pipeline totaling well over 10 additional gigawatts highlights the robust activity and sustained interest in Kansas and Missouri.\nMany customers have already secured land or land rights, finalized site plans and are actively participating in capacity study. While not all of this load will ultimately be addressable, the ongoing dialogue underscores the depth of engagement and the readiness of customers to step in should others exit the queue. Slide 7 expands upon the 4 to 6 gigawatt Tier 1 large customer load opportunity. Beginning with the actively building category, I'm happy to report that last week, Lambda announced its plan to transform an unoccupied data center located in Kansas City, Missouri into a state-of-the-art AI factory in data center.\nTheir facility is expected to launch in early 2026 with 24 megawatts of capacity and as potential scale up to more than 100 gigawatts, 100 megawatts, excuse me, in the future. This product is a great example of a data center leveraging existing infrastructure with an ability to ramp low relatively quickly with minimal grid investment required and exemplifies why Missouri is an attractive destination for projects of all sizes. For the balance of our actively building customers, Panasonic and Meta are up and running, and our third large customer is making good progress through its heavy construction phase. Inclusive of lambda, we now anticipate peak demand at 1.2 gigawatts from these customers with over 500 megawatts to online by 2029, supporting our demand growth forecast of 2% to 3%.\nMoving to the finalizing agreements category. We remain in the final stage of the negotiation with large customers for 2 data center projects. Subject to final agreements and product announcements, we expect to see an impact on our demand growth from these customers of 2027 and '28 and into the next decade which would raise the overall company demand forecast to 4% to 5% load growth through 2029. Approval of the LPS tariffs in both states is a key next step for finalizing the negotiations.\nAdditionally, we recently added a third data center to this category, reflecting significant progress and initial executed agreements. This product was previously in our advanced discussions category and demonstrates the high interest for large customers in advancing their products. We also remain in advanced discussions with multiple customers whose load will represent approximately 2 to 3 additional gigawatts of peak demand. These customers have secured land and land rights shared site plans and in some cases, reached letters of agreement and provided financial commitments to move the evaluation forward. load from these customers is not contemplated and our upside view of 4% to 5% annual load growth and effort would be incremental.\nOverall, we continue to see an incredible level of interest in our service territories, and we are making progress with potential new large customers across all stages of the discussion. Each category reflects potential new entrants that will empower growth, investment and drive prosperity for our region. Now moving to Slide 8, I'll touch on our latest regulatory developments. 2025, as you know, has been a busy year for our regulatory team, and we've demonstrated considerable progress in advancing our strategic objectives.\nThe team's results this year reflect the constructive policy framework and economic development opportunities in both states as well as our ability to find alignment with broad groups of stakeholders and achieve constructive settlement agreements. Beginning with Kansas, we filed for and received approval of redetermination to own parcel shares of 2 new combined cycle natural gas units and the solar farm, both are all in Kansas Central. These projects were identified in our IRP preferred plan and reflect our all of the above approach to meeting growing customer demand and higher capacity margin requirements in the SPP.\nThe Kansas Corporation Commission issued an order approving a unanimous settlement agreement for Kansas Central rate case on September 25. The settlement achieved a balanced outcome for all parties, including adequate recovery for the investments needed to provide reliable and affordable electric service. A key open gen item in Kansas is the unanimous settlement agreement we filed on our large load power service tariff docket on August 18. The proposed tariff applies to customers with demand exceeding 75 megawatts and establishes a rate structure with the focus on large customers paying their fair share and being subject to additional protections that I'll describe later in my remarks.\nWe believe the LPS establishes a competitive rate at physicians Evergy to attract, serve large new loads, enabling growth and prosperity for our communities. We anticipate an order from the KCC on the settlement agreement as part of the commission's business meeting later today. Pending to Missouri, we've successfully advanced plans to construct new generating resources. The MDSC approved settlement agreements in our CCN applications for 2 solar farms, partial ownership in 2 combined cycle natural gas units and full ownership of a simple cycle natural gas plant.\nWe believe these projects form a cost-effective package of reliable energy solutions for our customers, and this outcome demonstrates alignment with the Public Service Commission's interest in securing additional generation resources for Missouri utilities. Similar to Kansas, to large load, power service tariff proceeding continues to advance in Missouri. [indiscernible] filed a nonunanimous settlement agreement earlier this fall with terms similar to those filed in Kansas including contractual protections, provisions to ensure that large customers pay their fair share of system costs and a competitive rate that supports economic development.\nWe anticipate an order from the MPSC by the end of the year. Last, the planning process for our upcoming Missouri Metro rate case is underway, and we expect to file the case in February 2026. Slide 9 highlights legislation and regulatory mechanisms that support growth in our region and helps to position Kansas and Missouri as premier destinations for infrastructure investment to assure reliability and new advanced manufacturing facilities, data centers on the large customers. These mechanisms are the product of broad-based alignment between Evergy, the governor's office, state legislators or regulatory commissions and key stakeholders as well as our shared commitment to seize on the growth opportunities ahead of us for our customers and communities.\nConstructive regulatory frameworks that enable timely infrastructure investment to meet the needs of both existing and new customers are critical to our success and the bills passed over the past 2 years in both states advance these priorities. This supportive landscape reinforces our agents position as a top destination for growth. Evergy is committed to delivering safe, affordable and reliable service to our 1.7 million customers. As large new customers join our system, all stakeholders benefit from broader cost sharing and unprecedented economic development. I'll conclude my remarks on Slide 10, which highlights the core tenets of our strategy. I'll focus specifically on affordability.\nSince the merger that created Evergy, we have achieved tremendous progress on affordability and regional rate competitiveness, driven by significant reductions to our cost structure and investing at a slower pace than peer utilities. Over that time, our rate trajectory has remained well below regional peers and far below inflation. This requires hard decisions and the full focus and dedication of everyone in our company. I'm very proud of the results that these activities enable us to deliver for all of our customers.\nIt is critical that we sustain this momentum as we enter a new era of growth and demand and economic development. This new era will require the same level of dedication and focus from our company, and that's exactly what we intend to deliver. As part of that focus, we will continue to invest in infrastructure and operate our business in a way that maintains reliability and benefits all of our communities. Higher levels of investment to serve new large customers must be fairly borne by those customers, and we designed our large load power service tariffs to do exactly that.\nUnder both LLPS tariff, new large customers, will pay a higher rate than that paid by our existing large customers. As a result, the revenues from new customers will directly mitigate future rate increases for our existing customers as we're able to spread the fixed cost of our system over a broader base. In short, new large customers will pay a reasonable premium to the cost to serve them while also maintaining a competitive rate. And all customers will benefit from a motorized grid and new highly efficient generation resources.\nThe tariffs are also designed with key safeguards in place. These include, among others, customer commitments of 12- to 17-year terms, an 80% minimum monthly bill requirement, exit fees upon early termination and collateral posting. It's important to note this tariff structure is consistent with the intent of our large new customers to be good stewards as part of our Kansas and Missouri communities. In the LLPS dockets, they were active participants throughout the process and along with many other stakeholders, contributed to and signed on to the settlement agreement.\nAs I noted earlier, these agreements are currently pending approval by the Kansas Corporation Commission and Missouri Public Service Commission with the KCC's decision expected later today. Collaboration with large customers does not stop at paying their fair share. Their projects will create construction jobs, permanent jobs, and expanded property tax base and community health development benefits. As an example, 1 of our customers announced it will bring its skilled trades and readiness or STAR program to the Kansas City area. The company is collaborating with the Missouri Works initiative and the Urban League to help increase the entry-level pipeline in the skilled trades with a focus on underrepresented communities.\nAll Star preimplement programs are paid training programs, and offer networking opportunities to help participants move directly to employment on local construction products. We hope and expect that this example will be just 1 of many. The vitality of our region has made it an attractive destination for advanced manufacturing and data center customers and their investments in turn have tremendous potential to drive a virtuous cycle of growth and prosperity in Kansas and Missouri for years to come.\nI will now turn the call over to Brian.\n\nW. Bryan Buckler\n\nCFO, OGE Energy Corp.\n\nThank you, David. Thank you, Pete, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 12 with a review of our results for the quarter. For the third quarter of 2025, Evergy delivered adjusted earnings of $475 million or $2.03 per share compared to $465 million or $2.02 per share in the third quarter of 2024. As shown on the slide from left to right, the year-over-year drivers are as follows: First, a 2% increase in weather-normalized demand growth drove the majority of the increase of $0.06 per share and the margin shown on the slide and recovery of and return on regulated investments contributed an additional $0.11 of EPS.\nOffsetting these favorable drivers are higher depreciation and interest expense related to our infrastructure investments, leading to a $0.07 decrease in EPS and dilution from our convertible notes led to a $0.03 decrease for the quarter. Turning to Slide 13, I'll provide more detail on our sales trends. On the left-hand side of the page, you'll see weather-normalized demand increased by 2% in the third quarter as compared to last year, following the 1.4% year-over-year increase we experienced in the second quarter. This continued strong momentum was driven by increases in both residential inimercial usage, including load from the meta data center in Missouri that is reflected in our commercial customer class.\nAt a macro level, the continued robust customer demand in our service areas is supported by a strong labor market. as the Missouri, Kansas and Kansas City metro area and employment rates remain below the national average of 4.3%. Moving to Slide 14. I'll provide some further detail on our expectations for full year 2021 results. As David mentioned, we are narrowing our guidance range to $3.92 to $4.02 as compared to the original guidance range of $3.92 to $4.12. Our mitigation efforts of approximately $0.10 of EPS benefit are expected to offset a substantial portion of the $0.13 of headwinds experienced by below normal cooling degree days in the second and third quarters. In addition, we now anticipate an incremental $0.02 of dilution related to our convertible notes given our recent strong stock performance. We have forecasted incremental dilution from the convertible notes in our 2026 EPS modeling and continue to expect to achieve the top half of 4% to 6% growth in EPS in 2026, off of the midpoint of our 2025 original guidance range.\nAs I'll discuss shortly, Evergy's fundamental long-term outlook remains stronger than it has been in decades, bolstered by tailwinds from a generational economic development opportunity and the investment needed to enable it, which will benefit all future years in our financial plan. Slide 15 outlines a recap of our long-term financial expectations. and considerations for our comprehensive growth update, we will share with you during our fourth quarter call in February. First, we highlight our Tier 1 customer opportunity of 4 to 6 gigawatts of peak load. As a reminder, our current 5-year plan incorporates low growth of 2% to 3% annually through 2029, reflecting solid growth in our current customer base and buoyed by the Panasonic, Meta and Google projects.\nThis loan growth expectation is further bolstered by rapid development data centers, such as the [indiscernible] facility discussed by David earlier, which is able to scale more quickly than the mega data centers via the use of existing buildings and existing electric infrastructure. Also, we are nearing final agreements with 2 data center customers that could drive an incremental 600 megawatts by 2029. And which would raise our loan growth forecast substantially to 4% to 5% on a CAGR basis through 2029.\nWe've also made great progress with customers in the advanced discussions category which represents a 2 to 3 gigawatt opportunity, driving even more low growth toward the back half of our 5-year plan. We certainly believe we have 1 of the most compelling customer growth opportunities in the entire industry that we expect will drive robust growth, not just in our 5-year forecast, but into the next decade for Evergy and for the communities we serve.\nNext, I'll discuss our capital expenditure and rate base growth forecast. The foundational earnings power of the company will be fortified by our capital investment program. Higher levels of infrastructure investment are needed for grid modernization and incremental generation capacity to support the expansion of our existing customer base and new large load customers. These are tailwinds to our current $17.5 billion capital plan and corresponding 8.5% rate base growth through 2029. On the regulatory front, to maintain the credit profile of our utilities, and to incorporate the affordability benefits of large loads, which allow us to spread system costs over a broader base, we plan to be on a somewhat regular cadence of rate case proceedings.\nWith the large infrastructure plan comes regulatory lag and over the past couple of years, the states in which we operate have taken proactive steps to help utilities better manage elevated depreciation and interest expense through the use of plant and service accounting mechanisms. We also utilized natural gas sale provisions in both Kansas and Missouri. These constructive mechanisms helped to reinforce our solid credit profile. There in this phase of significant infrastructure build out, we will utilize equity and equity content financing options to fund a portion of our capital requirements and to support our strong investment-grade credit rating and FFO to debt threshold of 14%.\nIt is important for you all to know that we will continually evaluate the overall level of equity funding needs, recognizing that large load customers in our pipeline could significantly improve our cash flows from operations. beginning in 2026 and accelerating throughout the next several years. Thus, there is a real opportunity to moderate our equity needs for the current $17.5 billion capital investment plan. Now our company can only be successful when our communities strive and we maintain affordability for our customers. We are committed to staying laser-focused throughout the years ahead on affordability for our current customers, and we believe our long-term plan will be successful in doing so. As we look to rolling out our updated 5-year plan in February, I'll mention again the many tailwinds to our current adjusted EPS growth outlook and a transformational opportunity for us here at Evergy.\nWe're excited for us to come and look forward to sharing details with you on our year-end call. And with that, we will open up the call for your questions."

Welcome to the Q2 2025 Evergy, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Peter Flynn, Senior Director of Investor Relations and Insurance. Please go ahead.\n\nPeter Francis Flynn\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Evergy's Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. Our webcast slides and supplemental financial information are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.evergy.com.\nToday's discussion will include forward-looking information. Slide 2 and the disclosures in our SEC filings contain a list of some of the factors that could cause future results to differ materially from our expectations. They also include additional information on our non-GAAP financial measures.\nJoining us on today's call are David Campbell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bryan Buckler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. David will cover second quarter highlights and provide updates on economic development activities recent regulatory outcomes and our generation plans. Bryan will cover in more detail our second quarter results, retail sales trends and our financial outlook. Other members of management are with us and will be available during the Q&A portion of the call. I will now turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid A. Campbell\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Vistra Energy Corp.\n\nThanks, Pete, and good morning, everyone. I will begin on Slide 5.\nThis morning, we are pleased to report second quarter adjusted earnings of $0.82 per share, exceeding our internal budget for the quarter and overcoming approximately $0.09 of unfavorable weather. Our results through June put us on target for the midpoint of full year 2025 adjusted EPS guidance of $3.92 to $4.12 per share. Bryan will discuss the year-over-year quarterly earnings drivers in more details in his remarks.\nIn terms of reliability, we've demonstrated strong performance through the first half of the year. Our average outage duration of frequency, as measured by SAIDI and SAIFI, are trending favorably relative to our targets demonstrating the benefits of our continued grid investments and the hard work of our transmission and distribution teams. I'd also like to recognize our generation team for the strong operational performance of the nuclear, fossil and renewables sleep during the first 6 months of the year.\nWe achieved several important regulatory milestones in the second quarter, demonstrating the collaborative regulatory environments in which we operate. In Kansas, the Kansas Corporation Commission approved settlement agreements and our predetermination request to construct new natural gas plants in a solar farm, and we filed a unanimous settlement agreement in our Kansas Central rate case.\nIn Missouri, the Missouri Public Service Commission approved settlement agreements for our certificates of convenience and necessity, or CCN, for new natural gas plants and 2 solar farms. These outcomes reflect continued success in finding broad-based alignment with stakeholders to support economic development and advance our all of the above generation strategy, always with a focus on our strategic pillars of affordability and reliability and sustainability for our customers and communities.\nWe are reaffirming our long-term growth target of 4% to 6% through 2029 based on the 2025 midpoint of $4.02 per share. From 2026 to 2029, we anticipate being in the top half of this guidance range relative to the 2025 baseline with significant additional tailwinds for potential large new customers and investments to serve them.\nMoving on to Slide 6. We were pleased to reach the unanimous settlement agreement with stakeholders in our pending Kansas Central rate case, which, if approved by the KCC, would provide a balanced outcome for customers and for all parties. The settlement provides for a net revenue increase of $128 million.\nWhile the black box settlement does not explicitly address return on equity or capital structure, expenses [indiscernible] 9.7% and return on equity to be utilized in transmission delivery charge filings. This settlement also includes a provision implementing earnings review surveillance reports. Beginning in March of next year and until the next rate case, Evergy will file annually a surveillance report detailing Kansas Central's earned return.\nSimilar to the mechanism in place after the 2018 merger, if our earned return is higher than authorized, excess earnings will be shared 50-50 between customers and the company. While a return to Kansas Central have historically been below authorized levels, this provision reflects the potential for improvement in earned ROEs as Panasonic ramps up its production.\nIf approved, we believe this settlement achieves a balanced outcome. And as we enter a new era of growth and investment, we remain committed to affordability and reliability. There is a clear need to invest in grid modernization to replace aging infrastructure and support reliability, as well as the new generation resources that support higher capacity margin requirements to the Southwest Power Pool and coincide with low ramps from potential large new customers.\nThose load profiles will allow us to spread system costs over a broader base. Appropriately Timing our request to recover our investments remains critical to our success as a company, and we will continue to be thoughtful in our pace of capital expenditures relative to our peers and in relation to low growth coming on to our system.\nWe'd like to thank KCC staff, curb, industrial customers and many others for their participation and willingness to work toward this agreement. We anticipate an order from the KCC by September 29.\nSlide 7 describes our expanding 15 gigawatt plus economic development pipeline in greater detail. Reflecting the geographic advantages of our region, the overall pipeline is strong in both Kansas and Missouri, we are well positioned to continue to track economic development.\nRelative to our size, our backlog is one of the most robust in the country, a testament to the competitiveness and vitality of our states. Focusing on the top 3 categories from the pipeline, we outlined a 4 to 6 gigawatt opportunity of new large customer load that represents the most active part of our queue.\nServing these customers will provide regional and community benefits in Kansas and Missouri through a robust digital economy, construction jobs, permanent jobs and a significantly expanded tax base. And by attracting and serving these large load customers, we can further enhance affordability by distributing system costs across a broader load base.\nOur team is working closely with these customers to develop and implement transmission and generation solutions to serve their expected ramp rates over the coming years. We are confident that we will be successful in winning and serving a large portion of this queue which will in turn transform the size and growth of our company and enhance the economic prosperity of our region.\nThe remaining balance of our pipeline of over 10 additional gigawatts demonstrates the significant activity and continued strong interest in Kansas and Missouri. Many of these customers have acquired land or land rights, completed their site plans and are engaging in capacity studies with our utility companies and are eager to move up in our queue.\nSlide 8 takes a closer look at the 4 to 6 gigawatts in our Tier 1 large customer load pipeline. Beginning with the actively building category 2 of these customers, Panasonic and Meta have now completed construction and are ramping up their facilities. The customer is making steady progress through a heavy construction phase and expect to commence operations in the first half of 2026.\nBased on the latest schedules from these customers, we continue to anticipate peak demand of 1.1 gigawatts with 500 megawatts online by 2029, supporting our estimated demand forecast of 2% to 3% through 2029.\nRegarding Panasonic, we are excited to attend their grand opening in July in [ DeSoto ] Kansas. Their facility stands as the largest EV battery factory in the world. Many of you may have seen headlines from various news outlets regarding production targets and time line for Panasonic. Importantly, Panasonic's latest schedule is substantially consistent with the low [ gram ] reflected in our existing 5-year forecast.\nMoving to the finalizing agreements category. We are in the final stages of negotiations with large customers for 2 data center projects representing 1 to 1.5 gigawatts of peak load. In the first half of 2025, we executed various service agreements with significant financial commitments and credit support from these customers.\nWe are very excited about the economic development that these customers will deliver to our region and remain on track to share announcements regarding our plans later this year. Subject to final agreements and project announcements, we expect to see an impact on our demand growth from these customers in 2027 and 2028 and into the next decade, essentially raising the overall company demand forecast of 4% to 5% through 2029.\nWe also remain in advanced discussions with multiple customers whose logo represent approximately 2 to 3.5 gigawatts of peak demand. Although these customer projects aren't as far along as others in the pipeline, they have already secured land or land rights, shared site plans and in some cases, reach letters of agreement and provided financial commitments to move the evaluation forward.\nOverall, we see an incredible level of interest in our service territories, and we are making progress with potential new large customers across all stages of discussions. Each category reflects strong customer interest and increasing commitments that will empower growth investment and drive prosperity and affordability for our region.\nWe achieved several important regulatory milestones that I'll describe in more detail on Slide 9. As previously discussed, we anticipate an order on our unanimous Kansas Central rate case settlement by September 29. On July 7, the KCC approved settlement agreements in our predetermination requests down partial shares of 2 new combined cycle natural gas units and a [ solar farm ] at Canada Central.\nThese projects were identified in our IRP preferred plan and reflect our all-of-the-above approach to meeting growing customer demand and capacity margin requirements in the SPP. We're excited to advance the construction phase and appreciate the feedback and dialogue with intervenors throughout the approval process.\nIn our Kansas large load power service tariff proceeding, we continue to advance settlement discussions. Staff recently requested an extension for several dates on the procedural schedule to facilitate continued dialogues. If the new schedule is approved, KCC staff and intervenor testimony would be due August 25, with a second settlement agreement date of September 22, followed by hearings running October 8 and 9.\nPanning to Missouri, the Missouri Public Service Commission approved settlements for our CCN request related to 2 solar farms, partial ownership and 2 combined cycle natural gas units and full ownership of a simple cycle natural gas plant. We'd like to thank MPSC staff, OPC and other interveners for their collaboration.\nWe believe these projects form a cost-effective package of reliable energy solutions for our customers, and this positive outcome demonstrates alignment with the Public Service Commission's interest in securing additional generation resources for Missouri utilities.\nSimilar to Kansas, a large load power service tariff proceeding in Missouri continues to progress. [indiscernible] testimony is due by September 12, followed by a settlement conference on September 23, and hearings from September 29 to October 3. We look forward to ongoing collaboration with the parties as we work toward a solution that supports economic development and is fair and reasonable for all customers.\nOn Slide 10, we highlight legislation and regulatory mechanisms that firmly position Kansas and Missouri have premier destinations for infrastructure investment in support of new advanced manufacturing facilities and data centers. The PISA natural gas sewer provisions serve to mitigate regulatory lag and support our strong credit profile as we execute on our long-term capital investment plan, while data center incentives, packages, both through the business-friendly environments for which Kansas, Missouri are already known, which have been instrumental in attracting new customers.\nAll told, the supportive backdrop will continue to attract the investment of major industry players and prove that Kansas and Missouri are top destinations for new business and growth. For our part, Evergy remains committed to investing to provide safe, affordable and reliable electric service to our 1.7 million existing customers and the new customers we are bringing online. All of our stakeholders stand to benefit from this unprecedented economic development and investment opportunity.\nOn Slide 11, we provide a summary of our new generation resources under development in Kansas and Missouri. Overall, our approach is aligned with our 2025 IRP preferred plant. It reflects in all of the above strategy for new generation development that will allow Evergy to take advantage of best-in-class efficiency and ensure a balanced generation portfolio for current and future generations of Kansas and Missouri customers.\nThese projects will expand the tax base of our communities and bring both construction and permanent jobs in our local economies. These investments are critical to ensuring we can affordably and reliably serve our customers and support growth in our region.\nRegarding impacts of the 1 big beautiful Bill Act, we believe that we are well positioned to realize the solar tax credits for the benefit of our customers in all 3 of our approved solar funds. For future unannounced renewables projects that were identified in our 2025 IRP. Over the balance of the year, we will continue to evaluate a robust set of options, including the results of our pending all-source RFP.\nAs part of this review, we will also assess the additional natural gas and storage additions that were identified in the most recent [ RP ] as well as retirement time lines. Our expectations for the go-forward plan will be reflected and the capital plan update that we will provide during the year-end call in February and in future IRP updates.\nAs we develop solutions to meet the generation capacity needs of our customers, we are committed to a flexible approach that evaluates multiple scenarios and incorporate stakeholder feedback with an ultimate goal of ensuring reliability and affordability for our customers.\nI'll conclude my remarks with Slide 12, which highlights the core tenets of our strategy. By prioritizing affordability, we contribute to the robust economic development pipeline ahead of us and lay the groundwork for continued support of the substantial economic potential within our states.\nEnsuring reliability is also a core element of our strategy, as reflected by SAIDI, SAIFI, grid resiliency and generation fleet availability. This also includes a focus on metrics relating to customer service, safety in all facets of our operations and infrastructure investment.\nWith respect to sustainability, about half the power generated by Evergy comes from emission-free resources. Since 2005, we have reduced carbon emissions by 57% and reduced sulfur dioxide and nitrogen [ oxide ] emissions by 98% and 90%, respectively. Our integrated resource plan embraces an all of the above strategy for future resource additions, supporting a responsible transition of our generation portfolio.\nWe look forward to continuing to advance a balanced mix of resource additions over the coming years. as part of our constant focus on affordability, reliability and sustainability. I will now turn the call over to Bryan.\n\nW. Bryan Buckler\n\nCFO, OGE Energy Corp.\n\nThank you, David. Thank you, Pete, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by saying this was a quarter of strong execution. And given our results through June, we are firmly on plan and forecasting to be at the midpoint of our $3.92 to $4.12 of adjusted EPS guidance.\nLet's now begin on Slide 14 with a review of our results for the quarter. For the second quarter 2025, Evergy delivered adjusted earnings of $191 million or $0.82 per share compared to $207 million or $0.90 per share in the second quarter of 2024.\nAs we disclosed in our first quarter slides, we had forecasted approximately $0.76 to $0.84 of adjusted EPS for the second quarter of 2025. And thus, our results for this quarter came in a bit higher than the midpoint of our forecast overcoming the mild weather.\nAs shown on the slide from left to right, the year-over-year drivers are as follows: first, a cooler start to the summer led to a 26% decrease in cooling degree days which drove a $0.15 decrease in EPS when compared to the prior year. By normalizing weather in both Q2 2024 and Q2 2025, you can see we experienced solid year-over-year total company earnings growth in second quarter 2025.\nNext, the net impact of pricing and weather normalized demand, which grew 1.4% and a $0.08 per share. recovery of and return on regulated investments contributed $0.09 of EPS driven by new rates in Missouri West that were effective in January of this year. Higher [ O&M ] drove a $0.05 negative variance in EPS compared to Q2 2024.\nIt is important to note that O&M came in on plan in the second quarter, and we expect to come in under budget for O&M for the full year 2025. Infrastructure investment resulted in higher depreciation and interest expense, leading to a $0.07 decrease in EPS.\nAnd finally, other items netted to a positive $0.02 variance. I'd also like to touch on our decision to exit our Evergy Ventures business that holds small nonregulated investments in early-stage clean energy and energy solution companies. This business was launched in 2015, and the majority of investment commitments were made in the first 5 years.\nGiven Evergy's focus on our regulated utilities, we have made limited new investments in recent years. And in the second quarter, we initiated a process to sell the portfolio. We recorded losses related to these investments of approximately $0.08 in the second quarter, which are excluded from adjusted earnings.\nThe remaining book value of these investments was approximately $100 million as of June 30, and cash proceeds from the sale of this portfolio will be used to reduce holding company debt. Importantly, we assume no annual earnings contributions from these investments in our 5-year plan.\nTurning to Slide 15, I'll provide more detail on our sales trends. On the left-hand side of the screen, you'll see weather-normalized demand increased by 1.4% in the second quarter as compared to the -- as compared to last year, this growth was primarily driven by increases in both residential and commercial usage.\nLooking ahead, we continue to expect strong commercial loan growth for the remainder of the year, supported by Meta's data center ramping its operations. Additionally, as David mentioned earlier, Panasonic's latest low ramp schedule remains largely consistent with our assumptions in our 5-year forecast, which should support a pickup in industrial demand through the balance of the year. In fact, for the month of June, we saw a year-over-year increase in industrial sales, which we hope portends well for the rest of 2025.\nI will close on Slide 16 with a recap of our long-term financial expectations. As I previously mentioned, with solid second quarter results and strong operational execution through the first half of the year, we are reaffirming our 2025 adjusted EPS guidance range of $3.92 to $4.12. And with normal weather, the remainder of the year, we believe we are on track to achieve the midpoint of that range.\nWe are also reaffirming our long-term adjusted EPS growth target of 4% to 6% through 2029, and we continue to expect to grow in the top half of that range off of the 2025 adjusted midpoint of $4.02. And I want to reiterate that we continue to see strong tailwinds to our forecast, including potential additional large customer announcements.\nLastly, we expect to provide an update on our 5-year load forecast, capital and financing plans and earnings outlook on our year-end call in February. Evergy's employees and leaders remain focused on consistent business execution of our operational and financial goals as we advance our strategic objectives of affordability, reliability and sustainability for our customers. And with that, we will open up the call for your questions."

Welcome to the Evergy Q1 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker, Peter Flynn.\n\nPeter Francis Flynn\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Corey, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Evergy's First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. Our webcast slides and supplemental financial information are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.evergy.com. Today's discussion will include forward-looking information.\nSlide 2 and the disclosure in our SEC filings contain a list of some of the factors that could cause future results to differ materially from our expectations. They also include additional information on our non-GAAP financial measures.\nJoining us on today's call are David Campbell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bryan Buckler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. David will cover first quarter highlights, recent legislative outcomes, provide updates on economic development activities, our 2025 integrated resource and regulatory updates. Brian will cover our first quarter results, retail sales trends and our financial outlook. Other members of management are with us and will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.\nI will now turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid A. Campbell\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Vistra Energy Corp.\n\nThanks, Pete, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 5. This morning, we reported first quarter adjusted earnings of $0.54 per share compared to $0.54 per share a year ago. Relative to last year, this quarter's results were driven recovery of regulated investments, partially offset by lower industrial demand and higher interest and depreciation expense. And while absolute retail demand grew 2.7% and heating days increased 18%, the volume benefits from the cold weather did not manifest into margin given declining block pricing in the winter months.\nWe also saw weakness in sales due to scale back activities following 2 significant heavy snow events as well as a large industrial customer outage caused by an unplanned maintenance shutdown at their refinery. Fortunately, this customer has returned to normal operations this month.\nAs we look forward to full year 2025, we continue to see strength in our underlying operations to keep us on track to deliver on our earnings expectations. We are reaffirming our 2025 adjusted EPS guidance range of $3.92 per share to $4.12 per share with a midpoint of $4.02 per share. Brian will go into more detail regarding our financial results as part of his remarks.\nThe long-term outlook for our business is as strong as it has been in decades, bolstered by strong demand from large new customers, 1 of the most robust customer pipeline in the industry and constructive regulatory frameworks and supportive legislation in both Kansas and Missouri. We are reaffirming our long-term earnings growth target of 4% to 6% through 2029 based on the 2025 midpoint of $4.02 per share.\nFrom 2026 to 2029, we anticipate being in the top half of this guidance range relative to the 2025 baseline with significant additional tailwinds from potential large customers and investments to serve them.\nMoving to operations. Our teams drove solid performance in the first quarter. Our average duration and frequency, as measured by SAIDI and SAIFI are performing favorably relative to targets. Our generation team achieved strong availability and ran well through extreme weather, including the blizzard in early January and record-breaking cold over consecutive days in late February.\nThe latter cold spell drove a new winter peak load record of over 48 gigawatts in the Southwest Power Pool surpassing the previous record that was set in December of 2022. These outcomes demonstrate the benefits and need for our continued investment in energy infrastructure, including grid modernization projects -- grid monetization projects and new dispatchable generation. I'd like to thank all of our frontline employees for their unwavering dedication and hard work in maintaining the reliability of our system and keeping the lights on for our customers.\nOn the legislative front, constructive bills were passed in both Kansas and Missouri that enhance our strong regulatory frameworks and further enable infrastructure investment to drive growth and prosperity for our region. On Slide 6, we highlight recent legislation that will empower growth and investment in our region and firmly position Kansas and Missouri as premier destinations for new advanced manufacturing facilities and data centers.\nThese outcomes are the product of broad-based alignment between Evergy, the governor's offices, state legislators, our regulatory commissions and key stakeholders as well as our shared commitment to seize on the growth opportunities ahead of us for our customers and communities.\nConstructive regulatory frameworks that enable timely infrastructure investment to meet the needs of both new and existing customers are critical to our success and the bills passed this year in both states as well as last year in Kansas directly advance these priorities.\nThe PISA natural gas CWIP provisions serve to mitigate regulatory lag and support our strong credit profile as we execute on our $17.5 billion capital plan. While data center tax incentive packages bolster the business-friendly environments that Kansas and Missouri are already known for which have been instrumental in attracting new customers. All told, these legislative advancements will attract the investment of major industry players and prove that Kansas and Missouri are top destinations for new business and growth.\nWe'd like to thank stakeholders for the engagement and participation that made this possible. For our part, Evergy remains committed to investing to provide safe, affordable and reliable electric service to our 1.7 million existing customers and the new customers we are bringing online. All of our stakeholders stand to benefit from this unprecedented investment opportunity as large new customers set out fixed cost over a broader base. Our communities benefit from job creation, development of ancillary business services, improved economic resiliency with a more diversified industrial base and a larger tax base.\nSlide 7 describes our pipeline in greater detail. As I just described, we are well positioned to continue future economic development. Relative to our size, our backlog of growth opportunities is one of the most robust in the country, reflecting the competitiveness and vitality of our region. Of course, the environment for new economic development projects is competitive, and we do not expect to win all projects in the queue.\nSince our fourth quarter call, our pipeline has expanded by 1 gigawatt to 12.2 watts. We have also moved 300 megawatts out of the finalized category and into the active -- actively building category. This reflects the expansion of the data center project in Missouri, and we expect this load to ramp beginning in 2030. This customer has signed agreements, and we are actively building on the site.\nWe are in final stages of negotiation with 2 large customers for 2 data center projects representing 1.3 gigawatts of load. One of these customers is evaluating our Kansas service territory and the other, an existing data center customer, is evaluating expansion in Missouri. We are very excited about the prospects of serving these new projects and bringing economic development to our communities. Both customers remain on track to share announcements regarding their plans later this year.\nSubject to final agreements and project announcements, we expect to begin to see an impact on our demand growth from these customers in 2027 and 2028 and into the next decade. Brian will cover this demand profile in more detail as part of his remarks.\nWe also remain in advanced discussions with customers whose load would represent approximately 3 gigawatts. While these customer projects are not as far along as the others in the pipeline that I've described, they have acquired land or land rights, presented a site plan and in some cases, signed letters of agreement to advance the evaluation process.\nThe remaining balance of our pipeline, which grew from 6 gigawatts to 7 reflects initial conversations with potential customers. While all of this load may not be addressable, the continued interest, nonetheless demonstrates significant activity and interest in Kansas and Missouri and customers who stand ready if others drop out of the queue.\nMoving to Slide 8. We provide a consolidated summary of our 2025 integrated resource plan filings which we submitted in Missouri in March and in Kansas last week. This year's IRP reflects the impact of updating our long-term expected demand growth, including the addition of potential large loads in our finalizing agreements pipeline category as well as other important inputs such as reserve margin requirements of the Southwest Power Pool have changed, construction cost estimates and commodity price workouts.\nOverall approach reflects an all of the above strategy for new generation development and adds approximately 2.1 gigawatts of new generation from 2025 through 2035 relative to last year's IRP. Earlier this week, we issued an all-source request for proposals to solicit bids for projects through 2032 to identify and help serve these needs. This process will complement our self-developed opportunities.\nOur planning process involves identifying the most cost-effective and plan that reliably serves our customers across uncertain future scenarios. We believe that the renewable and natural gas additions, as shown in our IRP, are being planned in a manner that will allow Evergy to take advantage of best-in-class and support economic development in our service territory, while at the same time helping to minimize the impact on affordability and ensuring that we provide reliable electric service.\nYou'll also note that our preferred plan delays the retirement of certain facilities and factors in potential conversions to natural gas. While there are risks and uncertainties for these plants given their age, the limited availability of replacement parts, and potential future investment requirements to maintain reliability, we are committed to a flexible approach that best serves our customers.\nEvergy has managed our generation fleet to operate efficiently, meet environmental standards and be available when called upon. The ultimate goal of our IRP is to ensure reliability and affordability for our customers as we advance a balanced all of the above generation portfolio. This view is reflected in the slide, which includes solar, wind, batteries and natural gas.\nMoving to Slide 9, I'll provide a brief update on our regulatory priorities and activities in Kansas and Missouri. On the Kansas side, we continue to work through our pending Kansas Central rate case. The procedural schedule calls for intervenor testimony by June 6, followed by rebuttal testimony on July 3. Settlement conferences will be held on July 8 and 9 with hearings commencing on July 21.\nWe look forward to working with our regulators and stakeholders over the coming months to achieve a constructive outcome for our Kansas Central customers. As a reminder, Kansas rate case is run on an 8-month clock and we anticipate final resolution in late September.\nWe also have pending requests before the KCC for predetermination on partial ownership of 2 combined cycle natural gas plants as well as a new solar farm. We are pleased to reach settlement agreements for these 3 projects. We appreciate the dialogue and participation from KCC staff, industrial consumers and other stakeholders all as part of the process. We anticipate a commission order by July 7.\nThe KCC recently approved a procedural schedule for our request to approve a large load power service tariff that would apply to prospective data center customers. We believe the tariff allows for adequate cost recovery associated with large new loads while being competitive with rates in neighboring states. The procedural schedule calls for an early settlement offer by June 20, settlement discussions on June 23 and the settlement agreement due by July 3.\nIf an early settlement is not reached, there will be opportunities for additional discussions in the fall ahead of hearing starting on October 8.\nPivoting to Missouri, we have pending requests for certificates of convenience and necessity, or CCNs related to 2 solar farms' partial ownership and 2 combined cycle natural gas units and full ownership of a simple cycle natural gas plant. In April, the Missouri Public Service Commission staff recommended approval of construction for all of these facilities with certain conditions.\nWe believe these projects, which are part of our IRP for Missouri, form a cost-effective package of reliable energy solutions for our customers and demonstrate alignment with the Missouri Public Service Commission's interest in securing additional generation resources from Missouri utilities. For both the solar and gas projects, settlement conferences began on May 22, followed by hearings for solar on May 27 and natural gas on May 29.\nSimilar to Kansas, in February, we filed a request in Missouri to approve a large load of our service tariff. Parties proposed a joint procedural schedule that would call for intervener rebuttal testimony on July 25 and a settlement conference on September 23 and hearings from September 29 to October 3. We're also working with Missouri stakeholders to have advanced settlement discussions similar to the Kansas schedule.\nI'll conclude my remarks with Slide 10, which highlights the core tenets of our strategy. Our efforts to enhance affordability have yielded significant progress in improving regional rate competitiveness over the past few years. Our strategic plan is designed to sustain this momentum by keeping our long-term rate trajectory in line with the rate of inflation while investing in infrastructure to support growth across our region.\nBy prioritizing affordability, we support prosperity within our states and contribute to our robust economic development pipeline. Ensuring reliability is also a core element of our strategy as measured by SAIDI, SAIFI, grid resiliency and generation fleet availability. This also includes a focus on metrics relating to customer service, safety in all elements of our operations and infrastructure investment.\nAnd with respect to sustainability, we continue to advance the transition of our generation fleet as detailed in our 2025 IRP updates. We look forward to continuing to advance a balanced all of the above mix of resource additions over the coming years to support growth and prosperity in our states.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nW. Bryan Buckler\n\nCFO, OGE Energy Corp.\n\nThank you, David. Thank you, Pete, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 12 with a review of our results for the quarter. For the first quarter of 2025, Evergy delivered adjusted earnings of $125 million or $0.54 per share compared to $124.7 million or $0.54 per share in the first quarter of 2024.\nAs shown on the slide from left to right, the year-over-year drivers are as follows: First, the net impact of retail sales volumes, pricing and weather drove a $0.01 benefit. While colder winter weather produced an 18% increase in heating degree days, the volume benefits from this weather manifested into a limited margin benefit given the declining log pricing, where rates in the winter decline as customer usage enters higher tiers.\nOur results also reflect the roll-off of the leap year impact in 2024, which benefited the prior year by approximately $0.03. Further impacting results was a large unplanned customer outage as I'll speak to shortly. Next, recovery of and return on regulated investments, driven by new retail rates at Evergy Missouri West and FERC regulated investments contributed $0.13 of EPS. Higher depreciation and interest expense due to increased infrastructure investment drove a $0.10 decrease in EPS. And finally, other items negatively impacted results by $0.04.\nTurning to Slide 13. I'll provide more details on our sales trends. On the left-hand side of the screen, you'll see total demand grew 2.7%, while weather demand decreased by 3%. The colder winter weather led to increases in residential and commercial usage, but major snowstorms limited the business activity in January and to some degree in February.\nOn the industrial side, as I briefly alluded to, the year-over-year decline in demand was driven primarily by a large industrial customer going offline for most of the first quarter due to a temporary unplanned maintenance shutdown. Importantly, in April, this customer began to resume operations, and we expect them to be at normal production levels this month.\nWhile the combination of these factors had an outsized impact on the weather normalized load in the first quarter, we continue to anticipate healthy growth for the balance of the year. Our forecast is supported by strong underlying increases in customer numbers, which were up 1% compared to last year, as well as the expected ramp of Meta and Panasonic in the second half of the year.\nAs we move to Slide 14, I'd like to discuss year-to-go consideration supporting our 2025 adjusted EPS guidance. With the unusual items I noted earlier, the first quarter was a slower start to the year than anticipated. We have analyzed the balance of the year drivers and without litigation, we would be approximately $0.05 below our 2025 adjusted EPS guidance midpoint. Fortunately, the foundational earnings drivers of the company remains strong, and we anticipate meeting the midpoint of our EPS target with normal weather the rest of the year.\nThere are a few factors that give us confidence in achieving our target. For example, year-to-date, our operational performance, including O&M cost management, has been strong. As we look to the balance of the year, we remain laser-focused on driving cost efficiencies and pulling O&M levers as necessary to achieve our financial targets. Additionally, as obviously described, we anticipate a rebound in weather-normalized demand growth in the third and fourth quarters, which we expect to be supplemented by growth in revenue from recovery of our state and FERC regulated investments.\nIn short, we are committed to executing our plan and achieving our financial goals. Let's now turn to our financing plan on Slide 15. Our projected capital investments over the 5 years through 2029 stand at $17.5 billion, consistent with our capital plan update we provided on the fourth quarter earnings call. In fact, there's no change in our messaging from the previous quarter with respect to our financing plan through 2029. We anticipate funding our investment prudently targeting an FFO to debt ratio of approximately 15% throughout the forecast period.\nOur strong cash flows from operations will be supplemented by an issuance of debt, equity and equity-like instruments. Our forecasted equity issuances 2026 to 2029 remain at $2.8 billion, and as a reminder, our 2025 guidance does not contemplate new equity issuances this year, and we anticipate $1.2 billion of equity issuances in total across 2026 and 2027 combined.\nAs I mentioned during our fourth quarter call, the EPS and financing plan we are sharing with you again today only includes load growth expectations from the first set of large customer additions. We are optimistic that our equity needs will be lower for this $17.5 billion capital plan if additional large customers begin to come online by 2028, which as previously discussed, is becoming increasingly likely.\nIn short, our customer pipeline has a potential to not only increase Evergy's earnings power, but would also provide a substantial benefit to operating cash flow, allowing us to moderate equity issuance in the future, assuming the $17.5 billion capital plan is unchanged. You may soon see us take steps to begin to address our future equity needs. We would expect any equity issuance activity in 2025 to settle no earlier than 2026. These steps will allow us to be nimble in our approach assessing the capital markets.\nTurning to Slide 16. Here, we profile our demand growth outlook in tandem with the tremendous large customer opportunities in front of us. As a reminder, our 2% to 3% demand growth forecast through 2029 only reflects large customer announcements to date. We expect a combination of Panasonic, Meta and Google's load ramps to contribute approximately 500 megawatts of new load by 2029, with the balance driving growth into the early 2030s. This is incremental to our traditional base repo planning assumption of 0.5% to 1%.\nAs David described earlier, both customers in the finalizing agreements category would be additive to 2% to 3% demand growth forecast reflecting approximately 600 megawatts of incremental demand by 2029. This would potentially drive our total retail sales growth to 4% to 5% through 2029 with further additional upside in those years for the next customer pipeline that we have termed to be in the advanced discussion stage.\nTo step back again and relative to our size, we continue to believe we have one of the most compelling customer growth opportunities in the entire industry that could drive robust growth not just in our 5-year forecast, but into the next decade for Evergy and for the communities we serve.\nI'll close on Slide 17 with a recap of our long-term financial expectations. As David stated, Evergy's long-term business outlook is as strong as it's been in decades. We are reaffirming both our adjusted EPS guidance range for 2025 as well as our long-term adjusted EPS growth target of 4% to 6% through 2029. From the baseline midpoint of $4.02 in 2025, we expect to grow in the top half of our 4% to 6% adjusted EPS target range through 2029 with additional tailwinds through this plan including potential additional wins from our large customer pipeline.\nOur employees remain focused on consistent execution of our customer, operational and financial goals as we advance our strategic objectives of ensuring affordability and reliability in driving a sustainable business model for the long-term prosperity of our customers and our communities.\nThank you for joining us today, and we will now open the call up for your questions."

Welcome to the Q4 2024 Evergy, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Pete Flynn, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nPeter Francis Flynn\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Jill, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Evergy's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Our webcast slides and supplemental financial information are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.evergy.com. Today's discussion will include forward-looking information. Slide 2 and the disclosures in our SEC filings contain a list of some of the factors that could cause future results to differ materially from our expectations. They also include additional information on our non-GAAP financial measures. Joining us on today's call are David Campbell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bryan Buckler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Dave will cover 2024 highlights, provide updates on economic development activities and discuss our regulatory and legislative agendas. Bryan will cover our fourth quarter and full year results, retail sales trends and our financial outlook. Other members of management are with us and will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.\nI will now turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid A. Campbell\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Vistra Energy Corp.\n\nThanks, Pete, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 5 by first thanking our employees who worked tirelessly throughout the year, to advance our strategic objectives of affordability, reliability and sustainability. I'm proud and honored to lead the Evergy team. And with respect to 2024 results, I'm pleased to report that we had a solid year. Overcoming weather headwinds in the fourth quarter and throughout the year, we reported adjusted earnings of $3.81 per share compared to $3.54 per share a year ago.\nStrong cost management helped to offset the impact of the mild weather. Bryan will discuss earnings drivers in more detail as part of his remarks. In 2024, we also executed on our capital investment plan to improve reliability and resiliency, investing $2.3 billion in infrastructure to modernize our grid and replace aging equipment.\nAs we look ahead, executing on our 5-year $17.5 billion capital plan is a great challenge and a great opportunity to support and enable the economic prosperity of our region. Our success will come from the tremendous teamwork we have within Evergy. 2024 also proved to be a strong year in regulatory execution and advancing initiatives that allow us to invest for growth in Kansas and Missouri to the benefit of the customers and communities we serve.\nIn Kansas, the passage of House Bill 2527 demonstrated the support of Kansas legislators, regulators and stakeholders for infrastructure investment to power economic development. It also underscores the importance of a competitive and constructive regulatory framework, helping to mitigate regulatory lag and supporting our credit profile. In Missouri, we are pleased to reach unanimous settlement with stakeholders in our Missouri West rate case, which included the addition of a joint ownership interest in the Dogwood Energy Center, a low-cost energy solution for our customers.\nThe settlement provided a balanced outcome for customers and communities we serve and reflects the broad-based alignment around our infrastructure investments while ensuring we continue to provide reliable and affordable electric service. We also requested to go ahead to construct 3 new natural gas facilities and 3 solar farms. If approved by our Kansas and Missouri regulators, these will represent the first new dispatchable resources we've built in over 10 years, and our first utility-scale solar farms. In aggregate, these plants totaled just over 2,100 megawatts.\nAs we outlined in our 2024 integrated resource plans, our overarching goal is to identify the most cost-effective and resilient plan that reliably serves our customers. We expect to file our annual updates to our IRPs in March and April in Missouri and Kansas, respectively.\nIn targeting top-tier performance in operations, 2024 was another solid year. After achieving significant improvements in reliability in 2023, we matched and maintained that strong performance during the year with unusually severe weather. Through the summer, we experienced 10 severe storm events with wind gust in excess of 50 miles per hour, downing trees and causing extensive damages -- extensive damage to equipment and structures across our territories.\nOur line crews who are the bedrock of safely delivering affordable and reliable power to our customers, worked tirelessly through the extreme weather to restore power to our customers and we thank them for their contributions. In November, we raised our dividend 4% to an annualized $2.67 consistent with our 60% to 70% target payout ratio and gradually lowering the payout ratio within that range, which is a trend that we expect to continue.\nAs noted on Slide 5, we are reaffirming our 2025 adjusted EPS guidance range of $3.92 per share to $4.12 per share with a midpoint of $4.02 per share. We're also reaffirming our long-term growth target of 4% to 6% through 2029 based on the 2025 midpoint of $4.02 per share. From 2026 to 2029, we anticipate being in the top half of this guidance range relative to the 2025 baseline.\nMoving to Slide 6, we highlight our 3 major economic development wins, Google, Panasonic, Meta and 2 traditional data centers in Missouri. In total, their demand represents 800 megawatts of load. Based on these announcements, we are reaffirming our weather-normalized demand growth forecast of 2% to 3% through 2029. Additional large customers will be additive to this forecast.\nSlide 7 describes our economic development pipeline in greater detail. Reflecting the economic vitality and geographic advantages of our region, the overall pipeline remains robust in both Kansas and Missouri and has grown from roughly 6 gigawatts to over 11 gigawatts, including the customers announced to date.\nAs a point of reference, our projected peak summer demand for 2025 is approximately 10.6 gigawatts, so relative to our size, this makes our backlog of growth opportunities, one of the most robust in the country, reflecting the competitiveness of our region. Of course, the environment for new economic development projects is competitive, and we do not expect to win all projects in the queue.\nAs we discussed in our third quarter earnings call, we remain in advanced stages of negotiation with 2 large customers. We have identified generation and transmission solutions for both. We previously shared with you that the load from these projects could total 500 megawatts to 1,000 megawatts in aggregate, which we now anticipate will be 1.6 gigawatts. One of these customers is evaluating our Kansas service territory and the other, an existing data center customer is evaluating an expansion in Missouri.\nSubject to final agreements and project announcements, we expect to begin to see an impact on our demand growth from these customers in 2027 or in 2028 and into the next decade. We'll be very excited to add these new projects and further establish our region as a leading player in the U.S. digital and advanced manufacturing e-com. Both customers are tracking to share announcements regarding their plans later this year.\nIn addition, we are actively working with customers whose loads would represent approximately 3 gigawatts. These are customers that have acquired land or land rights, presented a site plan and, in some cases, signed letters of agreement to advance the evaluation process. The remaining 6 gigawatts in our pipeline are associated with preliminary conversations had with potential customers. While all of this load may not be addressable, the dialogue nonetheless demonstrates the significant activity and interest in Kansas and Missouri and customers who stand ready if others drop out of the queue.\nWe're very excited about the economic impact and prosperity that these large customers will bring, including construction jobs, permanent jobs and expanded tax base and many other benefits such as helping us to advance our affordability and reliability goals. It is truly a transformative time for our company, reflecting and further advancing the vitality of Kansas and Missouri.\nAs a reminder, our capital investment and load growth forecast only reflect the projects announced today that are shown on Slide 6. Many of you will ask about the timing of revising our plans to reflect new large customers. As a general rule, we will announce specifics on these projects in tandem with customer announcements regarding their plans.\nOur focus on affordability and regional rate competitiveness is an important contributor to this pipeline and provides the foundation for supporting the tremendous growth in our region. As part of the exercise alongside the economic development rates that are in place in both Kansas and Missouri, we have filed large load power service tariffs in both states to ensure that there is appropriate and adequate recovery associated with large new loans. While the procedural schedules have not yet been finalized, we anticipate resolution in both states, in the third quarter.\nSlide 8 lays out our updated capital expenditure forecast. Our latest rolling 5-year investment plan totals approximately $7.5 billion from 2025 to 2029, which represents a $1.3 billion increase relative to the revised 5-year forecast we provided on our third quarter earnings call. This quarter's update primarily reflects the assignment of 1/2 of a combined cycle natural gas plant to Missouri West, which was previously unallocated across our operating companies and excluded from our capital forecast. It also incorporates an updated cost estimate for the natural gas combustion turbine facility we announced last year, along with some minor shifts across divisions.\nTo summarize, our revised capital forecast includes a significant portion of the 2024 integrated resource plans, and we'll continue to evaluate incremental projects, pending our 2025 IRP updates, including a third combined cycle unit at Kansas Central, and a combustion turbine unit at our metro jurisdiction.\nOur 5-year investment program is expected to result in 8.5% annualized rate base growth through 2029, which compares to our prior forecast of approximately 8%. We'll take a prudent approach to financing the tremendous growth opportunity this investment plan represents, utilizing a balanced mix of debt, equity and equity-like securities as well as internally generated cash flow to support our balance sheet and strong investment-grade credit rating.\nWe'll take a flexible approach to equity financing with optionality around timing and execution of. Bryan will provide more details on our financing strategy in his remarks. Alongside these new generation investments, the majority of our 5-year capital plan is focused on transmission and distribution projects and other investments that advance our strategic objectives of affordability, reliability and sustainability and enable us to support economic prosperity and growth in our state.\nTurning to Slide 9. We highlight our adjusted EPS growth outlook, which projects 4% to 6% growth off the 2025 adjusted EPS guidance midpoint of $4.02 with an expectation to grow in the top half of the 4% to 6% range through 2029. The midpoint of 2025 guidance represents a 5% increase over the 2024 guidance midpoint, consistent with our prior target. Our growth outlook is driven by our $17.5 billion 5-year capital plan, which includes the investments to serve the 2% to 3% load growth that we expect through 2029. We anticipate a regular cadence of rate case filings across our jurisdictions, approximately every 18 months, though that won't be true every cycle or in every jurisdiction. Importantly, our growth outlook only reflects the new customers announced today and any new announcements will be additive to this forecast.\nMoving to Slide 10. I'll provide a brief update on our regulatory and legislative priorities in both Kansas and Missouri. In a nutshell, it's been a busy and productive start to the year. On January 31, we filed our Evergy Kansas Central rate review, requesting a $196 million revenue increase, premised on a 10.5% return on equity, an approximate 52% equity ratio and a projected $6.7 billion rate base as of the proposed March 31, 2025 through a period. We believe this rate request is straightforward and reflects the capital plan and infrastructure investment priorities that we've communicated to Kansas regulators and stakeholders in workshops in other settings over the past few years.\nThe principal items include recovery of and return on our grid modernization and infrastructure investment since our last rate review in 2023. The procedural schedule calls for staff and intervenor testimony by June 6, rebuttal testimony on July 3, settlement conferences on July 8 to 9 and hearings beginning on July 21. As a reminder, Kansas rate case is run on an 8-month block. We look forward to working with our regulators and stakeholders over the coming months to achieve a constructive outcome for our Kansas customers.\nWe also have pending request for predetermination on partial ownership of 2 combined cycle gas plants and a solar farm in Kansas. Next up in the predetermination procedural schedule is staff testimony, which is due March 14 followed by rebuttal testimony on April 4, a settlement conference on April 9 and hearings beginning on April 21. We anticipate an order from the KCC by July 7.\nAnd as I mentioned earlier, we have filed a request to approve a large load power service tariffs that would apply to prospective data center customers. We are currently awaiting a procedural schedule and anticipate resolution in the third quarter. We believe the tariff allows for adequate cost recovery associated with large new loads while being competitive with rates in neighboring states. The filing presents a strong framework that will advance the prosperity of our region, and we look forward to working with KCC staff and all of our stakeholders to the approval process.\nNow switching to the legislative front, we introduced House Bill 2107 in Kansas this year. If past, this bill would codify and statute the legal framework around wildfire damages and call for a workshop before the KCC to assess wildfire mitigation strategies and cost recovery. We view wildfire mitigation to the lens of safety and reliability, which are driving principles behind our transmission and distribution capital plan.\nAlong with the limit on punitive damages, the legislation requires potential lawsuits, to prove that a wildfire was caused by utility negligence and calls for a wildfire focused workshop at the KCC, providing an opportunity for constructive dialogue with Kansas stakeholders to explore additional risk mitigation and cost recovery options.\nThe bill passed unanimously out of committee and was recommended favorably for passage in the house yesterday afternoon. Later today, in fact, we expect the house to bring HB 2107 up for final action in the house. The bill would then be sent to the Senate. We appreciate the engagement from legislative committee members, the Kansas Farm Bureau, Kansas Livestock Association and many others in advancing this legislation.\nPivoting to Missouri. Earlier this week, Senate Bill 4 cleared a major hurdle and was passed out of the Senate. It has now been sent to the house where to wait for further action. Key provisions include amending the PISA statute to include new natural gas units an extension of the PISA sunset to the end of 2025 as well as allowing for recovery of construction work in progress, or CWIP from new natural gas plant investment and base rates, similar to that in Kansas.\nThere are also provisions that would streamline the generation resource planning process and ensure we have sufficient capacity to serve our customers. In addition, SB4 expands CWIP to all forms of generation as part of a new integrated resource planning process, replacing a nearly 50-year-old prohibition on CWIP put in place by a statewide boat way back in 1976.\nIf pass this legislation will be transformative for the Missouri regulatory framework. We are grateful for the collaboration with the Missouri Public Service Commission, legislative leadership, the Governor's Office, Commission staff, the Office of Public Counsel, our utility partners and our key stakeholders in making the significant progress that we've achieved thus far. This bill positions Missouri to support infrastructure investment, resource adequacy, reliability and growth.\nAs a reminder, the legislative session of Missouri is scheduled to wrap up in May. On the Missouri regulatory front, we have pending requests for certificates of convenience and necessity, or CCN, related to 2 solar farms, partial ownership and 2 combined cycle natural gas units and full ownership of a simple cycle natural gas plant, all of Missouri West. Staff recommendation in the solar case is due on March 7 -- March 17 and staff report and rebuttal in the natural gas case is due April 25.\nSimilar to Kansas, we filed a request in Missouri to approve a large load power service tariff on February 14, and we are currently awaiting a procedural schedule. We anticipate resolution in the third quarter.\nI'll conclude my remarks with Slide 11, which highlights the core tenets of our strategy. Our efforts to enhance affordability have yielded significant progress in improving regional rate competitiveness over the past few years. Our strategic plan is designed to sustain this momentum by keeping our long-term rate trajectory in line with the rate of inflation while investing in infrastructure to support growth across our region.\nBy prioritizing affordability, we contribute to the robust economic development pipeline ahead of us and support the substantial economic potential within our state. As outlined in our capital plan, we will continue to invest in good modernization to ensure reliability, strong customer service and strong performance in safety, safety, public safety and grid resiliency. This includes a focus on metrics related to personnel safety, customer service, generation availability and infrastructure investment.\nOur primary sustainability goal is to lead a cost-effective energy transition, as reflected by our investments in new natural gas plants and solar farms in support of our Kansas and Missouri customers. We look forward to continuing to demand a balanced mix of resource additions over the coming years to support growth and prosperity in our states.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Bryan.\n\nW. Bryan Buckler\n\nCFO, OGE Energy Corp.\n\nThank you, David. Thank you, Pete, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 13 with a review of 2024 financial results. For the full year 2024, Evergy delivered adjusted earnings of $878 million or $3.81 per share compared to $816 million or $3.54 per share for the same period last year.\nAs shown on the slide from left to right, the year-over-year increase in adjusted EPS was driven by a few factors. First, a cooler summer and mild winter weather drove a 5% decrease in cooling degree days and a 4% decrease in heating degree days, leading to a $0.13 decline in EPS versus 2023. When compared to normal, weather drove an estimated $0.11 unfavorable impact.\nNext, load growth was strong, increasing 1.1%, driven by higher residential and commercial sales volumes, which added $0.14 per share. Recovery of and return on regulated investments, driven by new retail rates and FERC regulated investments contributed $0.48 of EPS for the year, unfavorable variances for the year included operations and maintenance expense, which drove a $0.05 negative variance for the year. As expected, O&M costs were approximately 1.8% higher than the prior year, demonstrating continued excellence and cost management, and higher depreciation and interest expense due to increased infrastructure investment drove a $0.17 decrease in EPS.\nTurning to Slide 14. I'll provide a brief update on sales trends. As I mentioned, 2024 weather-normalized retail sales increased 1.1%. This trend has been primarily driven by solid growth in both residential and commercial usage, including load results that are beginning to benefit from the start-up of Meta's data center operations. At a macro level, the continued robust customer demand in our service areas is supported by a strong labor market as the Missouri, Kansas and Kansas City metro area unemployment rates remain below the national average.\nAs referenced on the slide, our 2025 load demand growth forecast contemplates a 2.4% growth relative to 2024. This includes solid contributions from all customer classes and reflects the resilient growth of our local economies. We expect Meta and Panasonic operations to contribute a little less than half of this 2025 total load growth with Panasonic expecting substantial operations to begin by midyear.\nAs David noted in his earlier remarks, we expect weather-normalized demand growth through 2029 of 2% to 3% when factoring in the impact of the announced new large customers with upside potential as additional customer wins come to fruition.\nLet's move to Slide 15 to lay out how we expect to deliver on our previously announced 2025 EPS guidance midpoint of $4.02. Starting on the left-hand side, and beginning with 2024 adjusted EPS of $3.81, we've modeled a reversion to normal weather in 2024, which would add $0.11 per share. Next, we expect a $0.19 increase from weather-normalized load growth in 2025, reflecting the 2.4% increase in kilowatt hour sales. Of the $0.19, we expect a contribution of about $0.04 from the new commercial and industrial large load customers as Meta and Panasonic begin to come online.\nRecovery of and return on our regulated investments from new rates is expected to contribute $0.41 of EPS for the year, primarily related to new rates that came into effect January 1 related to last year's Missouri U.S. rate case, as well as the recovery of FERC regulated infrastructure investments. Offsetting these improvements in earnings is an expected increase in O&M as well as the combined impact of higher depreciation and interest expense, net of AFUDC, which is expected to drive a $0.31 unfavorable impact.\nLastly, we assume $0.04 a drag related to our $1.4 billion of convertible debt that matures in December 2027. This reflects our assumption around a share price higher than the threshold price in the convertible note option, which would increase diluted shares outstanding for accounting purposes. The impact of this dilution is reflected in our long-term forecast. As a reminder, we continue to assume no common stock capital market issuances in our 2025 guidance.\nIn relation to the entirety of this 2025 EPS forecast, we believe this financial plan is highly achievable. Our teammates across the company are hard at work on its effective implementation including the deployment of the 2025 infrastructure investments to the benefit of our customers and communities.\nLet's now turn to our updated financing plan on Slide 16. As David mentioned, our projected capital investments over the 5 years through 2029 now stand at $17.5 billion, which is $1.3 billion higher than the plan we discussed in our last quarter call. This plan now reflects the addition of 355 megawatts of our new combined cycle, which is being a sand Missouri West, along with updated cost estimates for Mullen Creek CT unit.\nWe plan to fund our investments prudently, targeting an FFO to debt ratio of approximately 15% throughout the forecast period. Our strong cash flows from operations will be supplemented by the issuance of debt, equity and equity content instruments. As a result of the $1.3 billion increase in capital investments, our forecasted equity issuances across 2026 to 2029 is now forecasted to be $2.8 billion. This represents a $600 million increase over our previous forecast, equal to approximately 50% of the capital investment increase, which is consistent with the approach we described on our third quarter call.\nAs stated earlier, the EPS and financing plan we are sharing with you today only includes load growth expectations from the first set of large customer additions. We are optimistic that our equity needs will be lower for this $17.5 billion capital plan if additional large customers begin to come online by 2028, which as previously discussed, is becoming increasingly likely.\nIn short, our customer pipeline has the potential to not only increase Evergy's earnings power, but would also have to provide a substantial benefit to operating cash flow, allowing us to moderate equity issuances in the future.\nAs I stated earlier, our 2025 guidance does not contemplate new equity issuances this year. That being said, you may soon see us set up the structure to begin to address our future equity needs. This could include an ATM program and equity distribution agreement of up to $1.2 billion, representing a little less than half of our 5-year need, and is roughly equivalent to our expected issuances in '26 and 2027 combined.\nWe would expect any activity in 2025 under such a program to settle no earlier than 2026. These steps will allow us to be nimble in our approach to accessing the capital markets. And one last reminder on equity. While we have conservatively forecasted common stock as the form of equity to be issued, we will continue to evaluate other forms of equity content instruments as we execute on the plan in the years ahead.\nI will close on Slide 17 with a recap of our financial expectations. We are reaffirming our 2025 adjusted EPS guidance range at $3.92 to $4.12 per share. From the baseline midpoint of $4.02 in 2025, we expect to grow in the top half of our 4% to 6% adjusted EPS target range through 2029 with tailwinds to the plan, including potential additional wins from our large customer pipeline.\nOur updated 5-year capital plan for 2025 through 2029 totaled $17.5 billion, allowing us to build the infrastructure for a resilient and reliable grid with capacity for strong economic development in Kansas and Missouri. Our rate base growth trends upward throughout the 5-year period with average rate base growth of approximately 8.5% from 2024 to 2029. This is a plan in which we have high confidence. Our employees are focused on consistent execution of our customer, operational and financial goals as we advance our strategic objectives of ensuring affordability and reliability and driving a sustainable business model for the long-term prosperity of our customers and communities.\nThank you for joining us today. We will now open the line for your questions."

Welcome to the Q2 2024 Evergy, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nPlease be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Peter Flynn, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nPeter Francis Flynn\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Didi, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Evergy's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Our webcast slides and supplemental financial information are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.evergy.com. Today's discussion will include forward-looking information. Slide 2 and the disclosure in our SEC filings contain a list of some of the factors that could cause future results to differ materially from our expectations. They also include additional information on our non-GAAP financial measures.\nJoining us on today's call are David Campbell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Geff Way, acting Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. David will cover second quarter highlights and an update on our regulatory and legislative agendas. Geff will cover our second quarter results, retail sales trends and our financial outlook for 2024. Other members of management are with us and will be available during the Q&A portion of the call. I will now turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid A. Campbell\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Vistra Energy Corp.\n\nThanks, Pete, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 5. This morning, we reported second quarter adjusted earnings of $0.90 per share compared to $0.81 per share a year ago. The increase in adjusted earnings over last year was driven primarily by demand growth, weather, new retail rates and higher transmission margin, partially offset by higher operations and maintenance costs, D&A and interest expense. Geff will discuss these earnings drivers in more detail in his remarks.\nNow as you all know, Kirk Andrews resigned from his role as Chief Financial Officer on June 4. We were excited to appoint Geff Ley as acting CFO on June 7, while we conduct an internal and external search. We expect to conclude the search this year. Geff worked closely with Kirk and me, and he brings an outstanding capability set to the role, which has enabled a smooth transition. We'd like to thank Kirk for his leadership, and we wish him all the best in his next chapter of his career closer to home.\nIn May, we filed our triennial Integrated Resource Plan in Kansas following a similar filing from Missouri in April. In aggregate, the 2024 preferred plan includes 5,800 megawatts of resource additions through 2033, representing an increase of 1,500 megawatts over the next 10 years, when compared to the 2023 preferred plan.\nOur IRP and its underlying analysis reflect the benefits of a diverse fuel mix. Renewables have low or negative marginal costs and no emissions but they are intermittent depending on mother nature or large-scale storage deployment for reliability. New and existing thermal resources are emitting and have higher marginal cost for fuel and O&M, but they can be dispatched to meet customer demand when they are needed most.\nThe ultimate goal of having a balanced mix is to ensure reliability and affordability for our customers as we advance a responsible fleet transition. This transition will require sustained investment over the coming years and will incorporate the most recent IRP and its high levels of new generation when we provide an update to our capital plan on the third quarter earnings call.\nShifting back to the quarter, since the beginning of April, we experienced 10 severe storm events that produce wind gusts in excess of 50 miles per hour. Wind speeds at this level down countless trees and tree limbs and caused extensive damage to equipment and structures across our service territory. I'd like to thank our customers for their patience during outages caused by this unusually severe weather and thank our transmission and distribution teams, contractors, personnel from neighboring utilities in our call center, and customer service employees for their hard work throughout our storm restoration efforts.\nOur frontline employees are a bedrock of safely delivering affordable and reliable power to our customers and communities. We're extremely proud of their contribution as it worked long shifts through hot and humid conditions. Our team's execution has enabled solid performance in the first half of the year, and we are reaffirming our 2024 adjusted EPS guidance range of $3.73 to $3.93 per share as well as our target long-term annual adjusted EPS growth target of 4% to 6% from 2023 to 2026.\nOn Slide 6, we highlight 3 major economic development wins that we have featured, Google, Panasonic and Meta. In aggregate, their demand represents approximately 750 megawatts of load and each will be the largest customer in their respective jurisdiction by a wide margin. The overall economic development pipeline remains robust in both Kansas and Missouri with projects representing more than 6 gigawatts, a of demand actively considering our service territories.\nAs a reminder, our capital investment and load growth forecast only reflect projects announced to date. Now many of you will ask us about timing as a general rule, we will announce specifics on these projects in tandem with customer announcements regarding their plans. Of course, the environment for new economic development projects is competitive. And while we do not expect to win all of these projects in our pipeline, we are excited by the very active dialogue we are having with these potential customers as they consider our region.\nOur strategic focus on affordability and reliability and regional great competitiveness are important contributors to this pipeline and provide a foundation for the tremendous potential in our region, building on our success with Panasonic, Meta and Google. As part of the exercise, alongside the economic development rates that are in place in both Kansas and Missouri, we are looking at rate design elements to ensure that there is appropriate and adequate recovery associated with large new [ loans ].\nMoving to Slide 7, based on the announcements of Google's data center, Panasonic's EV battery manufacturing facility and Metis Data Center, along with other announced industrial projects, we expect a solid 2% to 3% weather-normalized demand growth through 2028.\nMoving to Slide 8, I'll provide an update on our regulatory and legislative priorities in both Kansas and Missouri. First, I'm pleased to highlight House Bill 2527 in Kansas, which became effective on July first of this year. The bill incorporated multiple provisions to establish a competitive framework for electric infrastructure investment including the use of Plant-in-Service Accounting, or PISA, and a construction work in progress mechanism that applies to new natural gas units. The PISA provisions in HB 2527 served to mitigate regulatory lag between rate cases, very similar to how it works in Missouri, there with a 90% deferral in Kansas. Overall, the passage of HB 2527 signals in support of Kansas legislators, regulators and stakeholders for infrastructure investment in support of economic development and the importance of a competitive and constructive regulatory framework for infrastructure investment. It is an exciting time in our region as reflected by our significantly higher sales growth forecast relative to recent history.\nWe are also looking forward to our capital structure workshop in Kansas, which we expect to occur in the fourth quarter. This workshop, which was born out of our legislative discussions with Kansas stakeholders earlier in the year, presents an opportunity for constructive dialogue around the importance of a clear and stable framework for regulatory capital structure and authorized returns outside the confines of litigated proceeding. This framework serves an important backdrop for providers of capital to invest in Kansas and for Evergy to attract competitively priced capital, much like the constructs that exist in Missouri and other neighboring states.\nAs always, we are committed to advancing the generational economic development opportunity ahead of us in concert with Kansas policymakers and stakeholders. Now pivoting to Missouri, we continue to work our way to our pending rate case in Missouri West. In late June, staff and other interveners filed direct testimony. And earlier this week, all parties filed rebuttal testimony, true-up and surrebuttal testimony will be filed on September 10.\nIn our upcoming filings, we anticipate that our overall revenue request will decrease as a result of lower fuel and power costs, reflecting lower commodity prices and higher market revenues. As a reminder, changes in fuel and power costs are not earnings drivers in the rate case. The expected reduction in fuel costs would be a pass-through benefit to customers in base rates. Any subsequent increases or decreases in these costs after the new base rates are set, will be reflected in the fuel clause between rate cases.\nAfter true-up and surrebttal testimony are filed, a settlement conference will be held on September 23, followed by hearings beginning on September 30 and running through early October. Revised rates of Missouri will go into effect by January 1, 2025. We look forward to working collaboratively with the Missouri Public Service Commission staff and our stakeholders to achieve a constructive outcome for Missouri West customers. As we described, we expect our cadence of rate cases going forward to be roughly every other year. So that will be true for every jurisdiction, some may be more frequent, others less.\nI'll conclude my remarks with Slide 9, which highlights the core tenets of our strategy: affordability, reliability and sustainability. On the affordability front, advancing regional rate competitiveness is one of our primary objectives. Our focus on delivering benefits to our customers is demonstrated in the comparative EIA data on rate trends across the Central United States over the past 5 years. Kansas and Missouri stand out positively in that comparison. Our strategic plan is designed to sustain this positive trajectory by keeping our long-term rate trajectory at or below the rate of inflation.\nBy prioritizing affordability, we contribute to the robust economic development pipeline ahead of us, and lay the groundwork for continued support of the substantial economic potential within our states. Insuring reliability is also a core element of our strategy encompasses state, safety, grid resiliency and public safety. This also includes a focus on metrics related to customer service, the commercial availability of our generation fleet, safety and all elements of our operations, including infrastructure investment.\nWith respect to sustainability, almost half the power generated by Evergy comes from emission-free resources. Since 2005, we have reduced carbon emissions by 53% and sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions by 98% and 90%, respectively. Our integrated resource plan includes a balanced mix of resource additions going forward as we manage the responsible transition of our generation portfolio.\nEvergy is committed to delivering safe, reliable, affordable and sustainable energy to customers while being a great place to work for a diverse workforce and supporting the communities we serve. With that, I will now turn the call over to Geff.\n\nGeoffrey T. Ley\n\nVP, Acting CFO, Corporate Planning & Treasurer\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Before we walk through our financial results, I wanted to take a moment to mention what an honor and privilege it is for me to have this opportunity to serve as the acting CFO for Evergy. The transition has been a smooth one, due to the support that I have received throughout from David, our Board and the entire Evergy team, for which I am very grateful. I would be remiss if I also didn't thank my family for their continued support of my career.\nBack to the business at hand. I'll start by turning to Slide 11 with a review of our results for the quarter. For the second quarter of 2024, Evergy delivered adjusted earnings of $207 million or $0.90 per share compared to $186.1 million or $0.81 per share in the second quarter of 2023. As shown on the slide from left to right, the year-over-year increase in second quarter adjusted EPS was driven by the following: first, a warmer start to the summer resulted in increased cooling degree days, which drove a $0.03 increase in EPS when compared to the second quarter of 2023 and it was an estimated $0.06 above normal.\nNext, weather-normalized demand grew 2.2%, driven by growth in residential and commercial demand, which added $0.06 per share. Also, new retail rates in Kansas contributed $0.06 of increased EPS for the quarter. Another $0.06 increase was driven by higher transmission margins resulting from ongoing investments to enhance our transmission infrastructure. There was a $0.03 negative variance in EPS compared to Q2 2023, driven by higher O&M expense. Approximately $0.01 of this variance was driven by swarming outage restoration costs, which were related to the severe storms that impacted our service territory. The rest of the variance was due to expected timing of expenditures compared to the second quarter of last year.\nNext, higher depreciation and amortization expense due to increased infrastructure investment drove a $0.04 decrease. Additionally, higher interest expense drove a $0.02 decrease in EPS for the quarter. And finally, other items drove a $0.02 decrease as well.\nI'll turn next to the year-to-date results, which you'll find on Slide 12. Through the first 6 months of 2024, Evergy delivered adjusted earnings of $331.7 million, or $1.44 per share compared to $322.2 million or $1.40 per share for the same period last year. Again, moving from left to right on the slide, our year-over-year EPS drivers compared to the year-to-date period last year include the following: weather contributed a $0.03 increase in EPS as a warmer start to the summer in Q2 was partially offset by warmer weather, winter weather in Q1. When compared to normal, the impact of weather was a $0.01 decrease in EPS through the year-to-date period. Weather-normalized demand increased 0.8% and driven primarily by higher residential and commercial demand, adding $0.06 of EPS. New retail rates in Kansas contributed $0.11 through the second quarter.\nIncreased transmission margin resulting from beneficial investments in our transmission infrastructure drove a $0.10 increase. Higher O&M expense drove a $0.09 negative variance through the second quarter. The timing of this variance was embedded in our full year guidance and is primarily attributable to implementation of an early retirement program, which significantly reduced O&M in the first half of 2023. We remain confident in our ability to manage costs in the context of our guidance.\nNext, we had an $0.08 decrease from higher depreciation and amortization expense resulting from infrastructure investments. In addition, there was a $0.06 decrease in EPS due to increased interest expense. And finally, there are other items which collectively drove a $0.03 decrease in EPS through the year-to-date period.\nTurning to Slide 13, I'll provide a brief update on our recent sales trends. On the left side of the screen, you'll see that weather-normalized retail sales increased 2.2% in the second quarter as compared to last year, primarily driven by increases in both residential and commercial usage. Year-to-date, weather-normalized demand was up by approximately 0.8% with a similar pattern of residential and commercial demand driving growth.\nWe continue to see lower demand from industrial customers despite a recovery among those larger customers who had weaker demand in 2023. Overall, we expect industrial demand to recover as we continue to move through 2024. This will be further augmented as we expect load from large new customers resulting from recent economic development wins to start coming online later this year.\nWe expect to see a more notable pickup in demand beyond 2024 and as we anticipate Panasonic, Meta and Google to reach their full run rates in 2026, 2027 and 2028, respectively. As David noted in his earlier remarks, we expect weather-normalized demand growth through 2028 of 2% to 3% as these new large customer loads are added to our base customer demand growth. The continued robust customer demand growth in our service territories is supported by a strong local labor market.\nAs the Kansas City and Kansas Metro-- Kansas City Metro in Kansas areas, unemployed rates remain below the national average of 4.1%. Finally, on Slide 14, I'll wrap up with an overview of our long-term financial expectations. With our solid start to the year, we are reaffirming our 2024 adjusted EPS guidance range of $3.73 to $3.93 per share. We are also reaffirming our long-term adjusted EPS growth target of 4% to 6% through 2026, which is based on our original 2023 adjusted EPS guidance midpoint of $3.65 per share.\nCurrently, our 5-year capital investment plan includes $12.5 billion of infrastructure investment through 2028, with the expectation that we will fund this program without the need to issue new equity through 2026. This $12.5 billion investment plan does not yet incorporate the impact of changes related to our 2024 IRP filed in the second quarter or other changes in our planned investments since the beginning of the year.\nOn our third quarter earnings call, we will provide updated capital investment and financing plans, which will incorporate these developments. While we are excited for these investments, which are expected to support a generational economic development opportunity for our region, we remain focused on consistent execution of our operational and financial goals as we advance our strategic objectives of maturing affordability, reliability and sustainability for our customers. And with that, we will open up the call for questions."

Welcome to the Q1 2024 Evergy, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Pete Flynn, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nPeter Francis Flynn\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Brianna. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Evergy's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Our webcast slides and supplemental financial information are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.evergy.com.\nToday's discussion will include forward-looking information. Slide 2 and the disclosures in our SEC filings contain a list of some of the factors that could cause future results to differ materially from our expectations. They also include additional information on our non-GAAP financial measures.\nJoining us on today's call are David Campbell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Kirk Andrews, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. David will cover first quarter highlights, our updated integrated resource plan and provide an update on our regulatory and legislative priorities. Kirk will cover in more detail our first quarter results, retail sales trends and our financial outlook for 2024. Other members of management are with us and will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.\nI'll now turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid A. Campbell\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Vistra Energy Corp.\n\nThank you, Pete, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 5. This morning, we reported first quarter adjusted earnings of $0.54 per share compared to $0.59 per share a year ago. Relative to last year, this quarter's results were driven by higher operations and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense, partially offset by new retail rates and transmission margin.\nUnseasonably warm weather was also a factor. Heating dry days were 11% below normal for the quarter, negatively impacting our results by an approximate $0.07 per share. Kirk will discuss these earnings drivers in more detail in his remarks. In terms of reliability, we've experienced a good start to the year through March, our average outage duration and frequency measured by [indiscernible] Safety are trending favorably relative to our targets, demonstrating the benefits of our continued grid modernization investment and the hard work of our transmission and distribution teams. I'm also pleased to report that we're nearing completion of their 26 Wolf Creek nuclear refueling outage, consistent with our plans.\nWolf Creek generates around 1,200 megawatts of non-carbon emitting energy enough to power more than 800,000 homes. The plant employs over 700 people, and that number effectively doubles during outages. I'd like to thank everyone involved for their hard work and focus on sustaining the excellent operational performance of the plant.\nOur team's execution has enabled a solid start to the year despite the mild weather, and we are reaffirming our 2024 adjusted EPS guidance range of $3.73 to $3.93 per share as well as our target long-term annual adjusted EPS growth target of 4% to 6% from 2023 to 2026.\nSlide 6 highlights our triennial Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP, which was filed on April 1 in Missouri and will be filed on May 17 in Kansas. This year's IRP reflects the impact of updating our long-term expected load growth, including the addition of the recently announced Google data center in Missouri as well as other important inputs such as resource adequacy requirements of the Southwest Power Pool, construction cost estimates and commodity price forecasts.\nI'd like to briefly touch on the new rules recently issued by the Environmental Protection Agency. Our IRP process includes consideration of environmental rules, [indiscernible] rules and other regulatory requirements. So the EPA's newly issued rules will play a role in our resource planning going forward.\nOur overarching goal in the IRP process is to identify the most cost-effective and resilient plan that reliably serves our customers across uncertain future scenarios. We believe that renewable and natural gas additions, as shown in our IRP, are being planned in a manner that will allow Evergy to reduce carbon emissions, take advantage of best-in-class efficiency and support economic development in our service territory while striving to minimize the impact on affordability and ensuring that we can provide reliable electric service.\nWe are assessing the potential impact of the new EPA rules from an affordability and reliability perspective as the rules would likely require significant incremental investment relative to what is currently in our IRP. For example, carbon capture and storage is an important element in the new greenhouse gas rule. At present, carbon capture and storage technology is not commercially demonstrated at scale on existing plants, along with costly and as yet unproven retrofitted control equipment, it require pipeline and storage infrastructure, which are not in place in our region. The EPA rules are expected to face legal challenges, and we will monitor those developments closely.\nAs a reminder, in 2023, nearly half of the energy that we generated for retail customers came from carbon-free resources reflecting the contributions of our Wolf Creek nuclear plant and the 4,600 megawatt portfolio of renewable resources that we either own or contract through long-term power purchase agreements.\nEvergy has invested significantly to enable our fossil units to meet existing environmental standards, operate reliably and be available to support our customers when called upon. We continue to take a balanced forward view of generation needs as shown through our IRP, which includes significant new solar, wind and natural gas balanced against the pace retirements of our coal fleet.\nIn aggregate, the 2024 preferred plan includes 5,800 megawatts of resource additions through 2033, representing an increase of 1,500 megawatts over the next 10 years, when compared to the 2023 preferred plan. As our generation fleet evolves, we are focused on achieving a responsible balance between renewables, which are nonemitting and have low or negative marginal costs, but are intermittent and both new and existing thermal resources, which have higher marginal cost for fuel and O&M, but can be dispatched to meet customer demand when they are needed most.\nThe ultimate goal of this balance is to ensure reliability and affordability for our customers as we advance a responsible transition of our generation fleet. This transition will require sustained investment over the coming years and will incorporate the most recent IRP and its higher levels of new generation when we provide an update to our capital plan in the third quarter earnings call later this year.\nOn Slide 7, we highlight details about 3 customers, Google, Panasonic and Meta, which represent major economic development wins in 3 of our 4 jurisdictions. In aggregate, demand from these 3 customers represents approximately 750 megawatts of load and each will be the largest customer in their respective jurisdiction by a wide margin.\nThe overall economic development pipeline continues to show promise in both Kansas and Missouri with more than $10 billion of projects considering locating in our service territories. We are very excited to work with these potential customers as they consider our region. As part of the exercise alongside the economic development rates that are in place in both Kansas and Missouri, we are looking at rate design elements to ensure that there is appropriate and adequate recovery associated with large new loans.\nMore broadly, our strategic focus on affordability and regional rate competitiveness, is an important contributor to this large pipeline and provides a foundation for our support of the tremendous economic potential in our states.\nAs shown on Slide 8, when factoring in economic development in these large new loads, including the recently announced Google Data Center, we are extending our weather-normalized demand growth forecast of 2% to 3% to 2028 off of the 2023 base, which previously ran through 2026.\nMoving to Slide 9, I'll provide an update on our regulatory and legislative priorities in both Kansas and Missouri. I'm very pleased to start by discussing House Bill 2527 in Kansas, which becomes effective on July 1 of this year. The passage of HB-2527 signals the support of Kansas legislators, regulators and stakeholders for infrastructure investment in support of economic development and the importance of a competitive and constructive regulatory framework for that infrastructure investment. It is an exciting time in the region as reflected by the significantly higher sales growth forecast relative to recent history of the business pride.\nIn terms of financial impact, the piece of provisions in HB 2527 served to mitigate regulatory lag between rate cases, very similar to how it works in Missouri. The construction work in progress provisions that apply to new natural gas units also demonstrated Kansas' support for our plans to invest in new gas-fired generation.\nFor our current capital expenditure plan, many of you have asked to quantify the financial impact relative to not having HP 2527 in place and how it helps to reduce the gap between allowed returns and actual realized returns. Under the provisions of the new law, in the first year following a rate case at our current investment levels, the impact is roughly $0.03 to $0.04 per share. If we go 2 full years between rate cases, the impact is roughly $0.10 in the second year. And as we've described, we expect our cadence of rate cases going forward to be roughly every other year, though that won't be true for every jurisdiction.\nOf course, that estimated impact is a stand-alone view of a single item and does not factor in any other potential drivers, such as changes in interest rates or changes to the capital plan just to cite 2 examples. Overall, the most important aspect of the passage of HB 2527 is the alignment that it reflects in Kansas about a competitive framework for investment as we respond to historic economic development opportunities.\nI'd like to thank legislative leaders, Kansas Corporation Commission staff, representatives from CURB, industrial stakeholders, the Governor's office and many other stakeholders as well as the Evergy Public Affairs team for their participation and engagement in getting this legislation passed.\nI also want to highlight the passage of Senate Bill 410, which provides a 10-year property tax exemption for newly constructed natural gas units. The benefits of this exemption will be shared with our customers. This bill further reflects Kansas' support for our planned natural gas investments, which are a crucial aspect of our long-term resource planning to meet the demands of our growing customer base and ensure reliability.\nOn May 17, we will file our 2024 IRP with the Kansas Corporation Commission. We abide our outlook for Kansas Central, similar to what we provided in our Missouri IRP filing.\nNow pivoting to Missouri, we continue to work our way through our pending general rate case in Missouri West. On June 27, staff and other interveners will file their direct testimony and rebuttal testimony is due by August 6. During the subsequent weeks, parties will file true-up and [indiscernible] testimony followed by a settlement conference around September 23. Hearings will occur in late September through early October and revised rates in Missouri West will go in effect January 2025.\nWe look forward to working collaboratively with the Missouri Public Service Commission staff and our stakeholders to achieve a constructive outcome for Missouri West customers. Regarding Missouri legislative initiatives, Language to amend the piece of statute has passed the house and awaits further action in the set. Key provisions would amend the piece of statute to include new natural gas units and a 90% deferral and extend the piece of sunset to 2035.\nDiscussions around the topic and the need for new gas generation have been positive, reflecting broad support. However, given the schedule and overall session dynamics, it will be hard to get any new legislation passed in the short time remaining for the 2024 session. This initiative is no exception.\nI'll conclude my remarks on Slide 10, which highlights the core tenets of our strategy, affordability, reliability and sustainability. Our efforts to enhance affordability have yielded significant progress in improving regional rate competitiveness over the past few years. Our strategic plan is designed to sustain this positive trajectory. By prioritizing affordability, we contribute the robust economic development pipeline ahead of us and support the substantial economic potential within our states.\nEnsuring reliability is also a core element of our strategy as reflected by SAIDI safety -- excuse me, SAIDI SAIFI, grid resiliency and public safety. This also includes a focus on metrics relating to customer service, the commercial availability of our fleet, safety in all elements of our operations, including infrastructure investments.\nWith respect to sustainability, we continue to advance the cost-effective transition of our generation fleet. Since 2005, we have reduced carbon emissions by 53% and reduced sulfur dioxide and NOx emissions by 98% and 90%, respectively. We look forward to ongoing progress along this path. Our mission is to empower a better future, and our vision is to lead the responsible energy transition in our region, always with an eye on affordability and reliability as well as sustainability.\nI will now turn the call over to Kirk.\n\nKirkland B. Andrews\n\nChief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director, NRG Yield, Inc.\n\nThanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 12. I'll start with a review of our results for the quarter. For the first quarter of 2024, Evergy delivered adjusted earnings of $124.7 million or $0.54 per share compared to $136.1 million or $0.59 per share in the first quarter of 2023.\nAs shown on the slide from left to right, the year-over-year decrease in first quarter adjusted EPS was driven by the following: First, similar to the first quarter of 2023, we saw milder-than-normal weather, particularly in the months of February and March this year. And while the year-over-year adjusted EPS impact was flat, compared to normal weather was an estimated $0.07 unfavorable.\nNext, compared to the strong demand recovery we saw in the first quarter of 2023, weather-normalized retail sales declined by 0.5% primarily driven by lower commercial and industrial demand remain neutral to EPS. New retail rates in Kansas contributed $0.05 to the quarter. Higher transmission margins resulting from our ongoing investments to enhance our transmission infrastructure drove a $0.04 increase and O&M drove a $0.06 negative variance for the quarter. This was driven by significantly lower O&M in the first quarter of 2023, which resulted from the implementation of an early retirement program as well as timing of expenditures in '24. And overall, our O&M outlook is flat for the balance of the year versus 2023.\nNext, higher depreciation and amortization expense due to increased infrastructure investment drove $0.04 decrease. Higher interest expense drove a $0.03 decrease and based on our expected capital investments and the current outlook for interest rates, our expectation for interest expense for the full year remains on target. And finally, other items drove a $0.01 decrease.\nTurning next to Slide 13. I'll provide a brief update on our recent sales trends. On the left side of the screen, you'll see weather-normalized retail sales decreased by 0.5% over the first quarter of 2023, driven primarily by decreases in both commercial and industrial usage. While we did see further recovery from our largest refining customers in industrial, we also continued to see lower demand for other industrial customers. This was driven in part by plant retooling and expansion projects being undertaken by our customers in the food processing and additive sector, which began in late 2023.\nAs these events are expected to be temporary, with demand from these customers recovering thereafter, we expect industrial demand to recover as we move through 2024. This will be further augmented by the expected uptick as large customers from our recent economic development wins begin to come online later this year and we expect a more notable pickup from these new customers beyond 2024 as we expect Panasonic, Meta and Google will fully ramp their usage to full run rates in 2026, 2027 and 2028, respectively.\nAs David noted in his remarks, in total, we are extending our weather-normalized demand growth forecast of 2% to 3% now through 2028. Our demand projections continue to be supported by a strong local labor market as Kansas and Kansas City metro area unemployment rates remain below the national average.\nAnd finally, on Slide 14, I'll wrap up with an overview of our long-term financial expectations. We are reaffirming both our adjusted EPS guidance range for 2024 as well as our long-term adjusted EPS growth target of 4% to 6% through 2026 based on the original 2023 adjusted EPS guidance midpoint of $3.65 and continue to expect to achieve this growth without the need for new equity.\nOur recently updated capital investment plan, which includes $12.5 billion in infrastructure investment does not yet reflect and incorporate the impact of changes that were reflected in our 2024 IRP. And as David mentioned earlier, we will provide you an update on our capital plan on our third quarter earnings call.\nIn addition to allowing us to achieve our financial targets executing on our investment plan advances our key objectives of ensuring affordability, reliability and sustainability over the long term.\nAnd with that, I'm happy to open the call for questions."

Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Peter Flynn, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nPeter Francis Flynn\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Valerie, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Evergy's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call.\nOur webcast slides and supplemental financial information are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.evergy.com. Today's discussion will include forward-looking information. Slide 2 and the disclosure in our SEC filings contain a list of some of the factors that could cause future results to differ materially from our expectations. They also include additional information on our non-GAAP financial measures.\nJoining us on today's call are David Campbell, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kirk Andrews, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. David will cover 2023 highlights, discuss the economic development outlook and provide an update on our regulatory and legislative agendas. Kirk will cover fourth quarter and full year results, retail sales trends and our financial outlook for 2024. Other members of management are with us and will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.\nI'll now turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid A. Campbell\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Vistra Energy Corp.\n\nThanks, Pete, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, we'd like to extend our deepest sympathies to the family of Lisa [indiscernible] and all those who were impacted by the tragic events during the Chief Super Bowl parade, Kansas City and Chiefs Kingdom are grieving, but if there's one thing that I've learned during my time here, it's at both are very strong and very resilient.\nMoving to Slide 5, I'll open by describing the drivers for our fourth quarter earnings falling below our guidance. While we plan for normal weather, we know the importance of consistent financial execution, we are disappointed by these results. As you know, on the third quarter call, we narrowed our guidance range to $3.55 per share to $3.65 per share from our initial range of $3.55 to $3.75, due primarily to the timing of the Persimmon Creek wind farm shifting back a year.\nAs shown on Slide 5, results for the year were $3.54 per share. Weather at the end of the year was the driver of the shortfall. For both November and December and December in particular, with a 23% decrease in heating [ degree ] days relative to last year, weather was warmer than normal, resulting in a variance of $0.06 in these 2 months alone. As Kirk will describe, weather-adjusted demand was also soft in the fourth quarter relative to expectations, but we were able to offset those impacts leaving milder-than-normal weather as a driver.\nOur full year results reflect strong cost management with savings well beyond what was in our financial plan, which enabled us to offset the negative drag created by higher interest rates and lower-than-expected industrial load. In 2023, we reduced our O&M expenses by $129 million, equal to a year-over-year reduction of 12%. These efficiency gains reflect the hard work of the entire Evergy team who worked tirelessly throughout the year to advance our plan and our strategic objectives.\nIn 2023, we also executed on our capital investment plan to improve reliability and resiliency, investing $2.3 billion in infrastructure to modernize our grid, replace aging equipment and advance our sustainability and affordability goals with the addition of the low-cost for Persimmon Creek wind farm.\nIn early December, we completed a $1.4 billion convertible note financing to mitigate interest rate and refinancing risk at the holding company. Of note, this financing was contemplated in and supportive of our updated growth outlook that we announced on our third quarter earnings call.\nLast year, we made strong progress on reliability as well as is shown on Page 6. Relative to 2022, average outage duration and frequency as measured by [ SADI ] and [ SAFE ] improved by 10% and 9%, respectively. I'd like to commend the outstanding work from our distribution and transmission teams and keeping the lights on for our customers and communities, as the reliability gains reflect improvements to our outage management processes and the impact of our ongoing grid investments.\nSlide 6 also highlights the nearly 30% reduction in total costs that we have achieved since 2018. These cost savings involved a comprehensive multiyear program that touched every aspect of our business. Change is hard and involves tough decisions and efficiency gains of this magnitude necessarily involved major changes across Evergy over the past 5 years. The result of this hard work was affordability gains that we delivered to our customers. I am proud and honored to lead the Evergy team that made this happen.\nOn Slide 7, we introduced our 2024 GAAP and adjusted EPS guidance of $3.73 per share to $3.93 per share. The midpoint represents a 5% increase over the original $3.65 midpoint of our 2023 baseline year. We remain confident in our ability to deliver annual 4% to 6% adjusted EPS growth through 2026, and we are reaffirming that target today.\nEvergy's cost savings were the major enabler of the improvements in regional rate competitiveness that are shown on Slide 8. When factoring in the 2023 rate case settlements, Evergy has been able to limit cumulative rate increases in both Kansas and Missouri to 1% since 2017. That compares to an average increase in rates across our region of more than 11% and cumulative inflation of nearly 23%. Without question, the merger has delivered affordability gains and significant benefits to our customers and the communities we serve.\nOn Slide 9, we highlight the outlook for economic development and demand growth in Kansas and Missouri, which is robust as it has been in decades. Our focus on affordability and regional rate competitiveness is an important contributor to this large pipeline and provides a foundation for our ongoing support of the tremendous opportunity in our states. There are currently $12 million of active development projects evaluating our service territories, representing 1.3 gigawatts of potential additional demand. The largest additions announced under construction so far are the Panasonic electric vehicle battery manufacturing plant in Kansas and the meta data center in Missouri. The Panasonic plant for its construction is already well underway is expected to be the largest EV battery plant in the world.\nAs I will describe further for these successes to continue, the grid will require competitive access to capital and significant investment. In turn, ongoing successes will drive economic growth, which benefits all of our customers and helps to cover the fixed cost of our system more efficiently.\nBased on Panasonic meta and projects announced to date, we expect 2% to 3% weather-normalized annual demand growth through 2026, off of the 2023 base, above our traditional base planning assumption of 0.5% to 1% annually. This includes incremental load from Panasonic and Meta starting in 2024 and continue to expand to an expected full run rate in 2026.\nSlide 10 lays out our updated capital expenditure forecast, which has been extended through 2028. Our latest 5-year investment plan totals approximately $12.5 billion, which represents a nearly $900 million increase relative to our prior 5-year forecast through 2027. The program is expected to result in 6% annual rate base growth. The revised capital forecast incorporates the Integrated Resource Plan filed in June of last year, which reflect a balanced approach that enables fuel diversification and a responsible portfolio transition. Nearly 55% of our planned investment is targeted towards transmission and distribution projects as we continue to modernize our grid to improve reliability and enhance resiliency. By replacing aging equipment, investing in smart technologies will also enable further efficiency gains and serving our customers, which has been a hallmark of Evergy strategy since our formation in 2018.\nMoving to Slide 11, I'll provide an update on our regulatory and legislative priorities in both Kansas and Missouri. As I discussed in our call last quarter, we have been working with stakeholders to position Kansas to take advantage of an unprecedented growth environment. Evergy is a key participant, and we are doing our part to ensure that the state has affordable competitive rates. In Kansas alone, we have delivered over $360 million in operating efficiencies and customer bill credits. For this success to continue, the state's infrastructure will require significant capital investment to ensure sufficient capacity, competitive levels of reliability and resiliency and a modern grid that delivers the flexibility and benefits to customers' demand.\nIn our discussions with stakeholders in the past few months, we have emphasized that attracting the necessary investment cannot be done without a regulatory environment that enables the flow of competitively priced capital. Investors have a choice where they direct capital. And for Evergy in Kansas to compete, Investors require debt and equity returns commensurate with current market conditions and competitive with peers, a clear and stable framework around regulatory capital structure to guide how we capitalize our utilities, an opportunity to earn the returns we are authorized and timely recovery invested capital, both now and in the future. Without these elements, our investment proposition loses attractiveness relative to our peer utilities, who benefit from more robust capital programs, more attractive realized returns and more predictable and stable regulatory mechanisms.\nAn imbalanced investment proposition challenges our ability to have the infrastructure in place to compete for economic development and by extension, challenges the shared goal of Kansas stakeholders to attract new businesses and their jobs and investment. The best way to [indiscernible] competitive rates over the long term is economic growth. To further that goal, Evergy and a coalition of economic development organizations, business interests and customers, introduced House Bill 2527 in Kansas earlier this year. The bill incorporated multiple elements to establish a fair and competitive framework for electric infrastructure investment, including provisions allowing for the use of plant and service accounting, or PISA, construction work in progress for large power plant investments and enhanced large customer economic development rates among other features. Discussions relating to HB 2527 are ongoing, and we are working with parties toward achieving a constructive compromise that supports our shared goal of advancing economic development and growth in Kansas. We would like to thank the legislative leaders involved in these discussions, Kansas Corporation Commission staff, representatives from [ Curb ], industrial stakeholders, the Governor's office, and many other stakeholders for their participation and engagement.\nI know that many of our investors and analysts follow the legislative proceedings closely. So please stay on the lookout as the process advances in the coming weeks. And of course, we will provide a further update on next quarter's call.\nBy May, we also expect to file our triennial Integrated Resource Plan in both states. The planning process is well underway, and given the significant changes we factored into our 2023 IRP, including IRA tailwinds, updated construction costs and higher capacity requirements in the Southwest Power Pool, we anticipate a filing similar to last year's, though with some adjustments to reflect ongoing changes in marketing conditions and economic development prospects.\nPivoting to Missouri, we filed the Missouri West rate case on February 2. The procedural schedule was jointly filed by the parties earlier this week. Subject to approval of the schedule, we anticipate intervenor direct testimony in June followed by rebuttal testimony in August, a settlement conference in the second half of September and potential hearings in late September and October. We look forward to working collaboratively with the Missouri Public Service Commission staff and our stakeholders to achieve a constructive outcome from Reserve West customers.\nAn element of our rate request is our potential investment in the Dogwood Energy facility and operating combined cycle gas plant identified in our 2023 IRP. Last November, we entered into an agreement to purchase a 22% share of the plant or 143 megawatts of summer capacity, and we subsequently filed a request for an operating CCM. Earlier this week, on February 26, a stipulation and agreement with no parties opposed was filed requesting that the Missouri Public Service Commission grant the operating CCM. [indiscernible] is a low-cost generation resource with a solid operating history to support our Missouri West customers. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter, subject to commission approval.\nOn February 23, we closed a financing to securitize extraordinary costs from Winter Storm Uri being carried at Missouri West, providing $323 million in net proceeds. As a result, the costs incurred from the storm will be spent over 15 years to better manage the impact on customer bills. This was a lengthy process, and we appreciate the hard work of our treasury team, PSC staff and other parties and getting it over the finish line. Bills have been proposed in Missouri House and Senate that would extend PISA to 2040 and modify a provision of the statute to cover new natural gas generation. House Bill 2541 passed out of committee and Senate Bill 1422, awaits for their action.\nSimilar to our efforts in Kansas, we'll continue to engage with our Missouri stakeholders, regarding constructive mechanisms that support natural gas investments as these are important resources identified in our integrated resource plan.\nI'll conclude my remarks with Slide 12, which highlights the core tenets of our strategy. Affordability, reliability and sustainability. Keeping rates affordable for our customers remains at the forefront. We advanced affordability in 2023 with our Kansas rate case settlement, maintaining the momentum of the past 5 years. We have saved more than $1 billion in operating costs since the merger, enabling Evergy to offset steep inflationary pressures, while at the same time, ramping up investment and reliability and helping to bolster economic development. We're pleased by our progress in improving regional rate competitiveness and keeping our rate trajectory well below the rate of inflation.\nAs our capital plan outlines, we continue to invest in grid modernization to ensure reliability and strong customer service, building on the momentum reflected in our significant improvements in [indiscernible] and [indiscernible] in 2023. Our overriding sustainability goal is to lead a responsible, cost-effective energy transition. In 2023, we added for [indiscernible] Creek, a low-cost emissions free resource to serve our Kansas Central customers. We remain committed to a long-term strategy to reduce CO2 emissions in a cost-effective and reliable manner. Our goal is to achieve net 0 emissions -- carbon emissions by 2045, with an interim target of a 70% reduction both relative to 2005 baseline. Achieving our targets will no doubt be dependent on external factors such as new policies and regulations and the advancement of new technologies. Our mission is to empower a better future, and our vision is to lead their responsible energy transition in our region, always with an eye on affordability and reliability along with sustainability.\nI will now turn the call over to Kirk.\n\nKirkland B. Andrews\n\nChief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director, NRG Yield, Inc.\n\nThanks, David, and good morning, everyone.\nTurning to Slide 14, I'll start with a review of our results for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2023, Evergy delivered adjusted earnings of $61.1 million or $0.27 per share, and that's compared to $68.6 million or $0.30 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022. As shown on the slide from left to right, the year-over-year decrease in fourth quarter earnings was driven by the following: first, a 14% decrease in heating degree days led to a $0.05 decrease in EPS for the quarter. This impact was driven by warmer-than-normal weather over the final 2 months of 2023, which drove a $0.06 variance to our plan. December weather was particularly mild, which led to a 23% reduction in heating degree days in that month alone. Weather-normalized demand declined by 2.4%, primarily driven by lower residential and industrial demand, contributing to a $0.06 decrease in EPS. The a $29.5 million decrease in adjusted O&M reflecting continued execution on driving cost efficiencies, drove a $0.10 increase.\nThe net impact of higher depreciation and amortization was $0.07 for the quarter, which includes the partially offsetting impact of new retail rates. Higher interest expense drove a $0.07 decrease.\nThe fourth quarter 2022 charge associated with the Kansas earnings review and sharing program, or ERSP, which is no longer in effect, drove a $0.06 positive variance. And finally, the net impact of tax items drove a $0.06 increased.\nI'll turn next to full year results, which you'll find on Slide 15. For the full year 2023, adjusted earnings were $815.6 million or $3.54 per share that's compared to $853.8 million or $3.71 per share for the same period last year. Again, moving from left to right, our full year EPS drivers compared to 2022 include the following: Our 2023 results reflect a 6% year-over-year decrease in cooling degree days and a 13% decrease in heating degree days, which drove a $0.28 decrease in EPS versus 2022. When compared to normal, weather drove an estimated $0.02 favorable impact in '23.\nWeather-normalized demand contributed $0.02 year-over-year, primarily driven by a 0.8% and 1% increase in residential and commercial demand, respectively, which were partially offset by a 3.6% decline in industrial demand. I'll provide more context around demand later in the presentation.\nHigher transmission margins resulting from our ongoing investments to enhance our transmission infrastructure drove a $0.04 increase and to help offset challenges from higher interest expense, regulatory lag, weather and demand, we accelerated cost management initiatives, which drove a positive $0.41 variance year-over-year. A $0.26 decrease from higher depreciation expense and then higher interest expense of $0.41 and a $0.05 decline in AFUDC drove a $0.46 decrease. $0.10 of higher year-over-year proceeds from company-owned life insurance, a $0.09 positive variance related to the nonrecurring ERS charge in 2022, and which was subsequently reduced in 2023 based on the final refund amount. And finally, tax items drove an increase of $0.17.\nTurning to Slide 16, I'll provide a brief update on our recent sales trends. Overall, 2023 weather-normalized demand growth was flat relative to last year. Despite some falloff in the fourth quarter, which may in part reflect the art form of weather normalization. Residential and commercial growth were both solid for the year with 0.8% and 1% positive annual growth, respectively, on a weather-normalized basis. In contrast, industrial demand was down 3.6% for the year. Through the first 3 quarters, this decline was driven by lower usage at 2 of our largest refining customers. One of which was off-line in early 2023 for a planned outage, while the rest of our industrial customer base's usage was generally in line with expectations. This dynamic reversed in the fourth quarter. While demand from refining customers began to recover, we saw a contraction in demand from other industrial customers during the fourth quarter. That was driven in part by plant retooling and expansion projects being undertaken by a number of our industrial customers in the food processing and additive sector.\nGiven that several of these events are expected to be temporary, we expect industrial demand to partially recover as we move into 2024, though not all the way back to 2022 levels. Net next year, we project approximately 1.1% growth in industrial load on a same-store basis. We also expect to see an uptick from new large customers beginning in 2024, with a more notable pickup in '25 and '26 as Panasonic, Meta and others come fully online. As David outlined earlier, in total, we're forecasting 2% to 3% annualized weather-normalized growth in demand from 2023 to 2026, reflecting the impact of those large new customers on top of base demand growth of 0.5% to 1%. Our demand projections continue to be supported by a strong local label market as Kansas and Kansas City metro area unemployment rates remained below the national average of 3.7%.\nMoving to Slide 17, I'll review the expected year-over-year drivers, which lead to the midpoint of our 2024 EPS guidance range, which is $3.73, and to $3.93 per share. Starting on the left of the slide and beginning with 2023 adjusted EPS of $3.54, we expect a $0.15 increase from demand in 2023 and which includes the impact of demand growth, net of the EPS contribution from weather in 2022. We expect a 1.8% increase in total weather-normalized demand which includes the contribution from new industrial load as customers like Meta and Panasonic begin to come online. Excluding the load from these new customers, we expect same-store demand growth of approximately 1.2%. The $0.25 of EPS from new retail rates, which reflects both a net revenue increase of $41 million in Kansas as well as the impact of the amortization of the company-owned life insurance regulatory liability. Higher transmission margins are expected to deliver $0.12 in 2024 as we continue to make investments to improve our transmission infrastructure. We expect a year-over-year increase in O&M of less than $20 million driving a $0.06 of lower EPS, primarily due to onetime items in 2023, driven by changes in capitalization. Net of these items, we retain the benefit of over $100 million in incremental O&M savings achieved last year as we move into 2024. The remaining drivers consist of increased D&A, small increase in interest expense and a $0.03 net decrease from other items.\nAnd finally, on Slide 19, I'll wrap up with an overview of our long-term financial expectations. We're reaffirming our long-term adjusted EPS growth target of 4% to 6% through 2026 based on the original 2023 adjusted EPS guidance midpoint of $3.65 and continue to expect to achieve this growth without the need for new equity. Our updated 5-year capital plan for 2024 through 2028 totals $12.5 billion and implies rate base growth of approximately 6% from '23 to '28. We've included some additional disclosures in the appendix of today's presentation, including a breakdown of planned expenditures by category and by utility, which we hope you'll find helpful. We remain focused on and committed to executing on our operational financial targets, continue to enhance reliability and regional rate competitiveness while advancing constructive regulatory policies to support competitiveness and economic development.\nAnd with that, we're happy to open the call for questions."

Welcome to the Third Quarter 2023 Evergy Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Peter Flynn. Please go ahead.\n\nPeter Francis Flynn\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Michelle, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Evergy's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call.\nOur webcast slides and supplemental financial information are available on our Investor Relations website. at investors.evergy.com.\nToday's discussion will include forward-looking information. Slide 2 and the disclosure in our SEC filings contain a list of some of the factors that could cause future results to differ materially from our expectations. They also include additional information on our non-GAAP financial measures.\nJoining us on today's call are David Campbell, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kirk Andrews, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. David will cover our third quarter highlights, provide an update on our regulatory and legislative agenda and discuss updates to our financial outlook. Kirk will cover in more detail the third quarter and year-to-date results, retail sales trends and our long-term guidance. Other members of management are with us and will be available during the question-and-answer portion of the call. I will now turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid A. Campbell\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Vistra Energy Corp.\n\nThanks, Pete, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 5. I I'm pleased to report that Evergy had a solid quarter as we delivered adjusted earnings of $1.88 per share compared to $2 per share a year ago. The decrease was driven by milder weather and higher depreciation and amortization and interest expense, partially offset by lower O&M expenses, higher corporate-owned life insurance proceeds or COLI and tax items. Results for the quarter were also impacted by over $9 million in excess O&M storm costs in July, driven by a mid-month storm, which brought straight-line wins of over 80 miles per hour over much of our service territory. Overall, I'm pleased to report that our reliability metrics held strong for the quarter. Relative to last year, average outage duration and frequency, measured by [ Satyan Seifi ], have improved greater than 5% through September and remained favorable relative to our targets. This is a strong testament to the work of our distribution and transmission teams to restore power and keep the lights on. as well as the investments that we have made in our system.\nWith these results year-to-date, we are narrowing our 2023 adjusted EPS guidance range to $3.55 per share to $3.65 per share. While we've offset the excess storm costs and delivered O&M savings well beyond our initial guidance for the year, we have not been able to offset the full magnitude of headwinds elsewhere, most notably from higher interest expense and the shift of Persimmon Creek from Missouri to Kansas. Kirk will discuss these drivers and net onetime effects in more detail.\nLooking beyond 2023, we are establishing a new long-term adjusted EPS growth target of 4% to 6%, off of the midpoint of our original 2023 adjusted EPS guidance range of $3.65 per share.\nSince the completion of the Evergy merger in 2018, we've delivered solid earnings growth, driven in large part by a highly successful O&M reduction plan. This program has enabled us to deliver significant cost savings to our customers. while at the same time, increasing our pace of investment to modernize our grid and improve service to customers.\nNotwithstanding this progress, two factors, in particular, have negatively impacted our ability to meet the earnings growth target we previously laid out. First, challenging rate case outcomes. And second, a higher interest rate environment. Most significantly, the Kansas rate cases fell short of expectations. In the context of a challenging position taken by the Kansas Corporation Commission staff on our proposed revenue requirement as well as the level of attention focused on our first rate case since the merger that created Evergy more than 5 years ago, we ultimately negotiated unanimous settlement that is currently pending approval by the commission.\nHowever, the Kansas rate case settlement negatively impacted our forward plan by approximately $0.15 a share. The dynamics in the rate case are a reflection of the singular focus that Kansas has had on improving regional rate competitiveness. And without question, Evergy has delivered against that objective.\nGoing forward, we know that state policymakers and stakeholders are excited by an unprecedented economic development pipeline in Kansas. To help the state capitalize on this opportunity and enable beneficial investment, we have important work to do to ensure that Kansas offers a competitive cost of capital and the potential to earn a competitive return. I'll discuss that further in a moment.\nWith respect to Missouri, the context is different. Following our successful motion for rehearing, the Missouri rate case outcomes in 2022 were more constructive with respect to the key economic terms. The main challenges in the rate case is related to legacy issues that have now been resolved and put behind us, most notably relating to the 2018 Subley plant retirement.\nHigher interest rates are also dragging the forward plan. Most significantly, they impact the refinancing that will occur in 2024 and for $800 million of holding company debt. In addition, our plan includes some additional holding company debt by 2025 for which we are expecting to refinance our $500 million term loan. The revised long-term growth rate target of 4% to 6% extends through 2026 and reflects our trajectory after the wave step function cost savings that we have delivered since the 2018 merger.\nOver the long term, our growth rate will reflect our rate base growth and the related financing plan. Our current rate base growth level is expected to be 6% annually. In addition to the projects currently included in our capital plan, we see a significant backlog of additional projects that will benefit customers across the T&D system and in the ongoing transition of our generation fleet.\nHowever, in Kansas, in particular, we will shape our capital plan to reflect the policy objectives of our key decision-makers and stakeholders. We will be actively pursuing mechanisms that we think align with those objectives and that will enhance our ability to partner in support of state priorities and earn a competitive return with timely recovery. While our long-term target has changed, our culture will not, we remain laser-focused on operational and financial execution for the items within our control and achieving constructive regulatory outcomes and a more regular cadence of rate cases, after the long stay outs that were agreed to as part of the 2018 merger.\nIn both of our states, we expect to file rate cases roughly every 2 years, similar to the cadence of our peer utilities. We know the importance of consistent execution, and we recognize that today's update falls short of that. However, we are confident in our ability to execute our strategic plan going forward at the revised target. In addition, we see opportunities to work with our stakeholders to advance constructive regulation in both states.\nAs part of today's update, we also announced a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend to [ $64.25 ] per share or $2.57 per share on an annualized basis. This increase is consistent with our updated growth outlook as well as our 60% to 70% payout ratio target. Combination of our annual growth outlook and our dividend yield positions Evergy to deliver a competitive total annual return of 9% to 11%.\nMoving to Slide 6. As I mentioned, we reached unanimous settlement and the pending Kansas rate cases. If approved, the resulting rate increases are far below those regional peers in inflation. The settlement calls for a net revenue increase of $41.1 million across our Kansas jurisdictions, reflecting a $74 million increase at Kansas Central and a $32.9 million decrease at Kansas Metro. The settlement includes the addition of the Persimmon Creek wind farm and our 8% interest in Jeffrey Energy Center into Kansas Central's rate base. These additions provide low-cost generation solutions to meet our customers' growing demand and energy needs.\nThe settlement also provides final resolution to the rate discounts that were provided to customers through the COLI program, which was first put in place nearly 40 years ago, when the Wolf Creek nuclear plant came online. The settlement sets a $96.5 million rate credit to be amortized over 3 years, after which the program is removed entirely from the regulatory construct. With this settlement, our COLI program has provided tremendous savings for customers, $750 million in total since the mid-1980s.\nWhile the settlement is silent on return on equity and capital structure, it specifies a 9.4% return on equity to be utilized for purposes of the transmission delivery charge filings required by legislation passed last year. We've included more details on this in the appendix. If this settlement is approved, we expect the Kansas Corporation Commission will issue an order, implementing new rates by December 21.\nAs shown on Slide 7, when factoring in the rate case settlements, Evergy has been able to limit cumulative rate increases in Kansas to 1% since 2017. In contrast, rates increased in our regional peer states by 12.7% over the same time period. Many of our peer utilities have rate cases pending or planned, which will further widen the gap. Our rate increase is even further below the rate of inflation since the merger. Advancing and improving regional rate competitiveness has been top of mind for many of our stakeholders in Kansas and were primary drivers for the 2018 merger, and that's exactly what we've delivered.\nOn Slide 8, we highlight the outlook for economic development in Kansas, which is as promising as it has been in decades. As the largest utility in Kansas, Evergy plays a vital role in enabling growth. Over the past 5 years, the state's economic development pipeline has grown to previously unseen levels. In 2022, the best year for economic development in Kansas in Evergy's history, we helped to land 13 major projects, representing more than $5.2 billion of capital investment, 6,000 new jobs with the Panasonic electric vehicle battery plant, a leading example. The future looks even brighter with more than $10 billion of active economic development projects, evaluating our Kansas service territories, representing 650 megawatts of potential additional demand.\nThe state's recent track record and large economic development pipeline, in part reflect the success of our focus on ensuring affordability and regional rate competitiveness. Through a highly successful cost savings program following the merger, we have delivered over $360 million in operating efficiencies in customer bill credits in Kansas.\nI would like to thank the dedication and focus of the entire Evergy team in making this happen. It has taken a tremendous amount of sustained effort. At the same time, the team achieved record safety results last year, along with strong generation commercial fleet availability and ongoing reliability improvements in 2023. The results the team has achieved have directly supported and advanced stay priorities.\nFor this success to continue, the grid will require significant capital investment to ensure sufficient capacity competitive levels of reliability and resiliency and a modern grid that delivers the flexibility and benefits that a customers increasingly demand. This cannot be done without a regulatory environment that enables the flow of competitively priced capital in Kansas. Cost of capital parameters, regulatory capital structure and timely recovery investment are crucial importance when utility investors make capital allocation decisions. Investors have a choice where they direct capital and for Evergy in Kansas to compete for that capital, investors require debt and equity returns, commensurate with current market conditions and competitive with peers, a clear and stable framework around regulatory capital structure, to guide how we capitalize our utilities, an opportunity to earn the returns we are authorized and timely recovery of invested capital, both now and in the future.\nWithout these elements, our investment proposition loses attractiveness relative to our peer utilities to benefit from more robust capital programs, more attractive authorized and realized returns as well as more predictable and balanced regulatory mechanisms. An imbalanced investment proposition challenges our ability to put the infrastructure in place to effectively partner and compete for economic development and by extension challenges the shared goal of Kansas stakeholders to attract new businesses and their jobs and investment. We see a bright future for Kansas, and we are honored by the privilege to play a key role in that future.\nTo capitalize on the state's economic development potential, we believe that the focus must include constructive regulatory mechanisms for the investment necessary to enable that growth. This is a priority for Evergy, and going forward, we will work with regulators and policymakers to ensure that Kansas is competitive with peer states and seizes on the unprecedented opportunities that are before us.\nMoving to Slide 9. I'll provide an update on our regulatory and legislative priorities in both Kansas and Missouri. As I mentioned, we expect a final order on the settlement agreement filed in our Kansas rate cases by December 21. On September 1, the commission conditionally approved a settlement in our energy efficiency document, otherwise known as Kia. Kia was established to support the state's goal of promoting the implementation of cost-effective demand-side programs, such as home energy assessments and rebates for energy saving appliances. We expect the first key programs will begin in 2024.\nOn the policy front, our efforts will focus on cost of capital and capital structure as well as recovery mechanisms supporting our grid and generation investments. One area of focus will be provisions applying to new dispatchable generation.\nHeading to Missouri, the commission order approving our request to securitize extraordinary costs from Winter Storm [ Yuri ] was affirmed in the Missouri Court of Appeals in late September. The Missouri Office of Public Council of OPC, filed a motion for rehearing, which was denied on October 24. It is possible that OPC will further appeal to the Missouri Supreme Court. Consistent with the appellate court's decision, we believe the Missouri Commission's decision and support of securitization is well supported by the record, and we anticipate resolution by the end of the year.\nAs a reminder, we will complete the securitization financing after the appeal plays out, but incremental carrying costs incurred prior to approval will ultimately be recovered when we issue the debt. Similar, our efforts in Kansas work to engage with our Missouri stakeholders regarding constructive regulatory mechanisms to support timely recovery in new dispatchable generation investments as these have been identified as important new resources, in our integrated resource plan. Last, we began the planning process for Missouri West rate case, which we expect to file in February 2024.\nI'll conclude my remarks with Slide 10, which highlights the core tenets of our strategy. affordability, reliability and sustainability. Keeping rates affordable for our customers has been and will continue to be at the forefront of our thinking. Nailed by the merger, Evergy has now saved more than $1 billion in operating costs over the past 5 years. These savings allow the company to offset steep inflationary pressures while also helping to attract and bolster economic development in our region. We're pleased by our progress in improving regional rate competitiveness and keeping our rate trajectory well below the rate of inflation. Affordability is and will always be an area of focus. Ensuring reliability is also a core element of our strategy, along with SAIDI, Safety, grid resiliency and public safety. This includes a focus on metrics relating to customer service, the commercial availability of our fleet, safety and all elements of our operations, including infrastructure investment.\nWith respect to sustainability, we continue to advance the responsible transition of our generation fleet with investments such as the Persimmon Creek wind farm. We expect to add over 3 gigawatts of renewable resources through 2032 and 1.5 gigawatts of new hydrogen cable gas generation, advancing our decarbonization goals, ensuring day-to-day grid demands and customer needs are met. Our mission is to empower better future, and our vision is to lead the responsible energy transition in our region, always with an eye on affordability and reliability as well as sustainability. I will now turn the call over to Kirk.\n\nKirkland B. Andrews\n\nChief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director, NRG Yield, Inc.\n\nThanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 12, I'll start with a review of our results for the quarter. For the third quarter of 2023, Evergy delivered adjusted earnings of $432.3 million or $1.88 per share compared to $460.8 million or $2 per share in the third quarter of 2022. As shown on the slide from left to right, the year-over-year decrease in third quarter earnings was driven by the following: first, a 5% decrease in cooling degree days as compared to last year, drove a $0.07 decrease in EPS. Compared to normal, weather for the third quarter was favorable by approximately $0.08 per share. Weather-normalized demand declined by 0.8% and driven by lower industrial demand, contributing to a $0.01 per share negative variance. The $11 million increase in adjusted O&M -- or decrease, rather, excuse me, in adjusted O&M reflecting continued execution on driving cost efficiencies, drove a positive $0.02 variance year-over-year.\nThe net impact of higher depreciation and amortization was $0.07 for the quarter, which includes the offsetting impact of new retail rates. The combination of higher interest expense and lower AFUDC drove a $0.14 decrease with higher interest expense representing $0.12 of the variance. Higher COLI proceeds drove a positive $0.07 variance year-over-year. And finally, other items, both positive and negative, drove a net increase of $0.08, primarily driven by tax items.\nI'll turn next to year-to-date results, which you'll find on Slide 13. Through the 9 months ended September 30, adjusted earnings were $754.5 million or $3.27 per share. compared to $785.2 million or $3.41 per share for the same period last year Again, moving from left to right, our year-over-year EPS drivers include versus 2022 include the following: when combined with mild weather in the first half of this year, our year-to-date results reflect an approximate 7% decrease in cooling degree days and a 13% decrease in heating degree days, driving a $0.23 decrease in EPS versus 2022. When compared to normal, weather was approximately $0.04 favorable through the third quarter. Weather-normalized demand growth of 0.7%, driven by the residential and commercial sectors contributed $0.08 per share. Higher transmission margin resulting from our ongoing investments to enhance our transmission infrastructure showed a $0.04 increase. Decreased O&M drove a positive $0.31 variance year-over-year driven by continued execution on achieving cost efficiencies, which we have further accelerated in 2023. A $0.19 decrease from higher depreciation expense due to increased infrastructure investment, which is net of the offsetting impact of new retail rates, $0.11 of year-to-date proceeds from company-owned life insurance, or COLI, Higher interest expense and lower AFUDC equity drove a $0.39 decrease with interest expense representing $0.34 of that variance. The increase in interest expense was driven by a number of factors, including rising rates, a shift in Persimmon Creek to Kansas, a delay in securitization proceeds and higher capital investment.\nWe have accelerated our cost management initiatives as reflected in the year-to-date uplift in O&M savings, combined with other actions to help offset the higher interest cost and associated lower AFUDC equity earnings. I'll discuss all of these items in further detail shortly. Finally, other items with positive and negative drove a net increase of $0.13 and was primarily driven by other income and income tax items.\nTurning to Slide 14. I'll provide some further detail on the headwinds and tailwinds driving our year-to-date and expected full year 2023 results. On the left side of the slide, as I mentioned previously, higher interest costs, combined with lower AFUDC equity earnings is a primary driver of our year-to-date variance to plan. Through the third quarter, we've seen a $0.39 impact from higher interest costs and lower AFUDC equity earnings versus 2022, and that's compared to a 21% increase in these costs for the full year reflected in our original guidance. This higher-than-expected variance is driven by a number of items. First, rising rates impacted the cost of our short-term borrowings as well as our long-term debt issuances to date. Short-term borrowings were only partially offset by AFUDC and due to the regulatory timing lag and short-term interest cost recovery, which was exacerbated by the sharp increase in realized short-term rates. Second, due to the delay in the securitization of 2021 storm cost at Missouri West, we continue to carry $300 million in additional short-term debt through all of 2023. Third, the decision to ship the Persimmon Creek wind farm from Missouri to Kansas required us to forgo the offsetting benefits of PSA interest deferral available in Missouri and reflected in our original plan for 2023. This also resulted in lower than forecasted AFUDC rates applied to our other Kansas Central investments as we funded for Persimmon Creek with short-term debt while it was pending review during the Kansas rate case. Finally, we expect to exceed our original capital investment plan for 2023 by approximately $200 million, leading to higher borrowing costs prior to recovery in our Missouri rate case planned for 2024. All of these factors also led to balance sheet changes versus plan, which drove lower AFUDC equity earnings.\nOur plan beyond 2023 has consistently anticipated this shift to lower AFUDC equity earnings and higher AFUDC debt recovery, which manifested earlier and expected into 2023. To offset this impact this year, as shown on the right side of the slide, we've successfully accelerated our cost management efforts across the business leading to a $0.31 EPS benefit year-to-date as compared to our original expectation of $0.20 full year improvement in the original plan. In addition, we've supplemented the impact of these O&M savings by capturing higher-than-expected margins on our 8% stake in the Jeffrey Energy Center coal plant, driven by a proactive hedging program put in place to optimize financial performance prior to transitioning this 8% stake in Jeffrey to rate base beginning in 2024, and as a result of the unanimous settlement in Kansas. And finally, we've realized approximately $0.02 of higher COLI proceeds year-to-date versus our full plan for 2023.\nOverall, while we expect to offset higher interest costs, with higher O&M savings, improved performance at Jeffrey and higher COLI proceeds. The onetime item, which remains, and this is a net driver of the $0.05 reduction in our midpoint 2023 guidance is the Persimmon Creek Wind project. Our original plan reflected the benefits of PSA and Missouri and shifting this asset to Kansas drove a $0.05 reduction in earnings versus plan this year. However, as a result of the unanimous settlement for Persimmon Creek will be part of the Kansas Central rates beginning in 2024, and the $0.05 impact to plan is limited to 2023.\nTurning to Slide 15, I'll provide a brief update on our recent sales trends. Weather-normalized demand increased 0.7% year-to-date as compared to last year, driven by strong residential and commercial growth. For the third quarter, we experienced a decline of 0.8%, which was primarily due to lower industrial demand driven by two refining customers. Demand growth continues to be supported by a strong local labor market with Kansas and Kansas City Metro area unemployment rates of 2.8% and which continue to remain below the national average of 3.8%. And we expect to see industrial demand recovery as we move into 2024.\nFinally, on Slide 16, I'll wrap up with an overview of our long-term financial expectations. For 2023, we're narrowing our adjusted EPS guidance range to $355 million to $365 million. As although we are delivering additional O&M savings beyond our initial guidance, we do not expect to fully offset the headwinds of higher interest and the impact of Persimmon Creek shift from Missouri to Kansas. As David mentioned earlier, we've revised our new long-term adjusted EPS growth target of 4% to 6% through 2026, using a baseline of the original 2023 adjusted EPS guidance midpoint of $3.65 reflecting the impact of higher interest rate environment, regulatory outcomes and our expected rate base growth of 6%. We will provide a 2024 adjusted EPS guidance on our fourth quarter call.\nToday, we've also announced a 5% increase in our dividend, consistent with the midpoint of our revised growth update and in line with our target 60% to 70% dividend payout ratio. We also expect to provide an updated capital plan for 2024 through 2028 on our fourth quarter earnings call, which will continue to be driven by new infrastructure investment improve customer service and enhance reliability and resiliency as we transition our generation fleet while continuing to advance regional rate competitiveness and meet the evolving needs of our customers and our communities. And with that, we'll open the call up for questions."

Welcome to the Q2 2023 Evergy, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Pete Flynn, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nPeter Francis Flynn\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Gigi, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Evergy's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Our webcast slides and supplemental financial information are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.evergy.com. Today's discussion will include forward-looking information. Slide 2 and the disclosures in our SEC filings contain a list of some of the factors that could cause future results to differ materially from our expectations. They also include additional information on our non-GAAP financial measures.\nJoining us on today's call are David Campbell, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kirk Andrews, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. David will cover our second quarter highlights, our integrated resource plan and regulatory and legislative priorities. Kirk will cover in more detail the second quarter results, retail sales trends and our financial outlook for the year. Other members of management are with us and will be available during the question-and-answer portion of the call.\nI will now turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid A. Campbell\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Vistra Energy Corp.\n\nThanks, Pete, and good morning, everyone. I will begin on Slide 5, and I'm pleased to report that Evergy had a solid second quarter as we delivered adjusted earnings of $0.81 per share compared to $0.84 per share a year ago. The decrease was driven by less favorable weather as well as higher depreciation and amortization interest expense partially offset by growth in weather normalized sales, transmission margin and lower O&M expenses. Kirk will discuss these earnings drivers in more detail in his remarks. Our reliability metrics were strong for the year, through June as average, average duration and frequency, otherwise known as [ Satyan Safety ], were favorable to relative to our target.\nI'd like to call out the work of our distribution and transmission teams for the improvements in system resiliency that we're seeing. Weather has been less cooperative to start the third quarter and on July 14, our service territory experienced a severe storm. The storm produced 80 to 100-mile per hour winds resulting in our most impactful storm in recent history. As the storm's peak, nearly 200,000 Evergy customers were without power, as high winds down countless turbulence and damaged or destroyed nearly 500 power poles. We estimate total O&M costs of $6.5 million for the storm recovery efforts.\nI'd like to thank the nearly 3,500 Evergy employees contractors and personnel from neighboring utilities that assisted in making repairs, working with customers and restoring power. Our crews worked 16-hour shifts through hot and human conditions as well as follow-on storms that disrupted the restoration efforts, and our customer teams also worked over time to field calls and support our customers. Our front-line workers are the bedrock of safely delivering affordable and reliable power to our customers and communities. We're extremely proud of and grateful for their contributions to these challenging conditions. Our team's consistent execution has resulted in a solid start to the year, and we are reaffirming our 2023 adjusted EPS guidance range of $3.55 to $3.75 per share as well as our target long-term annual adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 8% from 2021 to 2025.\nSlide 6 highlights our annual integrated resource plan updates, which were filed on June 15 in both Kansas and Missouri. This year's updates reflect the impacts of the renewable support provided by the Inflation Reduction Act, revised load forecast, increase Southwest Power Pool capacity margin requirements, potential changes to environmental regulations and updated commodity price forecasts. As a reminder, in 2022, nearly half of the energy that we generated for our retail customers came from carbon-free resources. Reflecting the contributions of our Wolf Creek nuclear plant and the 4,400 megawatt portfolio of renewable resources that we own or contract with long-term power purchase agreements.\nOver the next 10 years, taking advantage of the ample resource potential of our region as well as substantial federal subsidies, we plan to add more than 3,000 megawatts of new end and solar resources. The timing of these additions reflects the outputs of our recent all resource request for proposal, which was no doubt, affect the global supply chain challenges impacting solar wind and battery project availability and costs. Tightening capacity conditions in the Southwest Power Pool and higher demand also factored into the annual IRP update, reflecting higher capacity needs, this year's preferred plan includes the introduction hydrogen capable combined cycle gas turbines in the latter half of the decade. We now expect to cease all coal operations in [ Lawrence ] units 4 and 5 and to convert Lawrence Unit 5 to natural gas in 2028.\nIn aggregate, the 2023 preferred plan includes 4,800 megawatts of new resource additions through 2032, an increase of 1,200 megawatts when compared to the 2022 Integrated Resource Plan update. As our generation fleet evolves, we are focused on achieving a responsible balance between noncarbon emitting intermedian resources typically with low or negative marginal costs and older firm dispatchable generation with higher marginal costs, all while ensuring reliability and affordability for our customers and communities. We're excited about the potential investment opportunities ahead of us as we continue to transition our portfolio over the coming years.\nMoving to Slide 7, I'll provide an update on our regulatory and legislative priorities. In Kansas, we're awaiting intervenor testimony, which is due to be filed by August 29 and our pending Kansas Central and Kansas Metro rate cases. Activity in September picks up with rebuttal testimony due September 18 and the settlement conference scheduled for September 21. Should an agreement be reached, we'd be required to file it by September 29. Otherwise, hearings would run from October 9 through the 13. We look forward to working with all parties to achieve a constructive outcome and advance regionally competitive rates for our Kansas customers and communities.\nShifting to Missouri, the order approving our request to securitize extraordinary costs from Winter Storm Uri remains in the state of pellet process with oral arguments to be held September 7. We believe the Missouri Commission's decision and support of securitization is well supported by the record. As a reminder, we will complete the securitization financing after the appeal plays out, but incremental carrying costs incurred prior to approval will ultimately be recovered when we issue the debt. We anticipate resolution later this year.\nI'll conclude my remarks with Slide 8, which highlights the core tenets of our strategy, affordability, reliability and sustainability. On the affordability front, advancing regional rate competitiveness is one of our primary objectives. Our focus on delivering benefits to our customers since the 2018 merger is reflected and demonstrated in the EIA data on rate trends across states in the Central United States over the past 5 years. In addition, direct market evidence is provided by ongoing wins in economic development in our territory. We're pleased by our progress in improving regional rate competitiveness and keeping our rate trajectory well below the rate of inflation. Affordability is and will always be an area of focus.\nEnsuring reliability is also a core element of our strategy. And along with [ Saidi and Seifi ], this includes a focus on metrics relating to customer service, the commercial availability of our fleet, safety and all elements of our operations, including infrastructure investment. This summer has brought resiliency and reliability to the forefront as storm activity in our service territory has been more prevalent than normal. Including the July 14 storms, of straight-line wins in excess of 80 miles an hour. These types of conditions reinforce the importance of our ongoing transmission and distribution investments.\nAnd with respect to sustainability, we continue to advance the transition of our generation fleet as detailed in our 2023 IRP update and continuing the progress of the last 2 decades. Since 2005, we significantly and cost effectively transformed our generation fleet, reducing carbon emissions by nearly half, reducing sulfur dioxide and NOx emissions by 98% and 88%, respectively, and we look forward to the ongoing portfolio transition. Our mission is to empower a better future, and our vision is to lead the responsible energy transition in our region, always with an eye on affordability and reliability as well as sustainability.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Kirk.\n\nKirkland B. Andrews\n\nChief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director, NRG Yield, Inc.\n\nThanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 10, I'll start with a review of our results for the quarter. For the second quarter of 2023, Evergy delivered adjusted earnings of $186.1 million or $0.81 per share and that's compared to $194.5 million or $0.84 per share in the second quarter of 2022. As shown on the slide from left to right, the year-over-year increase in the second quarter adjusted EPS was driven by the following: first, a 13% decrease in cooling degree days compared to last year, drove an $0.08 decrease in EPS. Compared to normal, weather for the second quarter was favorable by approximately $0.03 per Share. Weather-normalized demand growth of 1.1%, driven by the residential and commercial sectors contributed $0.04 per share. Higher transmission margins resulting from our ongoing investments to enhance our transmission infrastructure, drove a $0.02 increase.\nA $53 million decrease in adjusted O&M drove a positive $0.17 variance year-over-year. This was partially due to the continued execution on operational efficiencies and partially the result of timing of O&M expenditures within 2023. The net impact of higher depreciation and amortization was $0.07 for the quarter, which includes the offsetting impact of new retail rates. The combination of higher interest expense and lower AFUDC drove a $0.13 decrease with interest expense representing about $0.12 of that variance. The increase in interest expense also reflects the lower rate environment comparatively in early 2022. And finally, other items, both positive and negative, drove a net increase of $0.02.\nI'll turn next to the year-to-date results, which you'll find on Slide 11. Through the first 6 months of 2023, adjusted earnings were $322 million or $1.40 per share compared to $324 million or $1.41 per share for the same period last year. Again, moving from left to right, our year-to-date EPS first drivers that is versus 2022 include the following: when combined with the mild winter weather in the first quarter of this year, our year-to-date results reflect an approximate 13% decrease in heating degree days and in cooling degree days, driving a $0.16 decrease in EPS versus the first half of 2022. And as compared to normal, weather was approximately $0.04 unfavorable through the first half of 2023. Solid weather-normalized demand growth of 1.6% year-to-date, in line with our annual estimate, driven by the residential and commercial sectors contributed $0.09 per share. Higher transmission margins resulting from our ongoing investments drove a $0.04 increase.\nDecreased O&M drove a positive $0.29 variance year-over-year. As I mentioned earlier, the decrease is partially a result of timing of O&M expenditures within 2023, a $0.13 decrease from higher depreciation expense due to increased infrastructure investment which again is net of the offsetting impact of new retail rates. $0.04 of year-to-date proceeds from company-owned life insurance and higher interest expense and lower AFUDC, which drove a $0.26 decrease with interest expense representing $0.22 of that variance. The increase in interest expense again reflects both a higher carrying balance and the lower rate environment in the first half of 2022. We expect rate-driven variances to decrease in magnitude as we move through the year, consistent with the original assumptions of our guidance. And finally, other items but positive and negative drove a net increase of $0.08, which was primarily driven by other income and income tax items.\nTurning to Slide 12. I'll provide a brief update on the recent sales trends. Weather normal [ Ital ] sales increased 1.1% in the second quarter as compared to last year. This was primarily driven by increases in both residential and commercial usage. While year-to-date weather-normalized demand is up by approximately 1.6%. The Lower industrial demand continues to be driven primarily by 2 refining customers. Excluding these 2 customers, remaining industrial weather-normalized demand would have increased during the first half of this year. Demand growth continues to be supported by a strong local labor market with Kansas and Kansas City Metro area unemployment rates of 2.8% each, which continue to remain below the national average of 3.6%.\nAnd finally, on Slide 13, I'll wrap up with an overview of our long-term financial expectations. With a solid start to the year, we are reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance range of $3.55 to $3.75 for 2023. We are also reaffirming our long-term compounded annual EPS growth rate target of 6% to 8% from 2021 to 2025. And we expect to address our outlook for earnings growth beyond 2025 on our year-end call in February. Our $11.6 billion 5-year capital plan through 2027 is focused on new infrastructure investment to improve customer service, enhance reliability and resiliency as we transition our generation fleet while continuing to advance regional rate competitiveness and meet the evolving needs of our customers and our communities.\nWith that, we'll open up the call for questions."

Welcome to the Q1 2023 Evergy Conference Call -- Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker for today. Peter Flynn, you may go ahead.\n\nPeter Flynn\n\nCo-Founder & COO, Artiva Biotherapeutics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Evergy's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Our webcast slides and supplemental financial information are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.evergy.com. Today's discussion will include forward-looking information. Slide 2 and the disclosures in our SEC filings contain a list of some of the factors that could cause future results to differ materially from our expectations. They also include additional information on our non-GAAP financial measures.\nJoining us on today's call are David Campbell, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kirk Andrews, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. David will cover our first quarter highlights provide regulatory and legislative updates and discuss our ESG progress. Kirk will cover in more detail the first quarter results, retail sales trends and our financial outlook for the year. Other members of management are with us and will be available during the question-and-answer portion of the call.\nI will now turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid A. Campbell\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Vistra Energy Corp.\n\nThanks, Pete, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 5, and I'm pleased to report that Evergy had a solid first quarter as we delivered adjusted earnings of $0.59 per share compared to $0.56 per share a year ago. The increase was driven by weather-normalized sales growth, transmission margin and lower O&M expenses, partially offset by the impact of a mild winter, an increase in depreciation and amortization and higher interest expense. Kirk will discuss these earnings drivers in more detail in a few minutes.\nIn 2022, we achieved our historically best safety year, and I'm pleased to report that our OSHA recordables and days away and restricted time events are trending favorably relative to those '22 results through the first quarter of this year. These improvements are a testament to the work of the entire Evergy team. I'd like to thank my fellow employees for their unwavering commitment to safety. With the solid start to the year, we are reaffirming our 2023 adjusted EPS guidance range of $3.55 to $3.75 per share as well as our target long-term annual adjusted EPS growth target of 6% to 8% from 2021 to 2025.\nOn Slide 6 and 7, I'll discuss our recently filed Kansas rate reviews, beginning with Kansas Central on Slide 6. On April 25, we filed an application requesting a $204 million revenue increase, premised on a 10.25% return on equity, a 52% equity ratio and a projected $6 billion rate base as of the proposed June 30, 2023 true update. As shown on Slide 7, in Kansas Metro, we requested a $14 million revenue increase, premised on a 10.25% return on equity a 52% equity ratio and a projected $2.6 million rate base as of the proposed June 30 true update. We believe these rate requests are straightforward and reflect the communications we've had with our Kansas regulators and stakeholders in workshops and other settings over the past few years.\nThe principal items include recovery and return on our grid modernization and infrastructure investments since our last rate reviews in 2018 as well as passing on to our customers the benefits of the substantial cost savings we've achieved since the merger that formed Evergy 5 years ago. Across our 2 Kansas jurisdictions, these cost savings reduced the combined revenue increase request by 37%. We are pleased that the hard work of the Evergy team resulted in cost savings that are significantly higher than projected during the merger approval process. These efforts have been a major contributor to successfully advancing our regional rate competitiveness.\nSince the end of 2017, our rates in Kansas have remained virtually flat, while our regional peers have, on average, increased their rates by double digits and cumulative inflation has been over 20%. As a reminder, Kansas rate cases run on an 8-month schedule, so new rates will go into effect by year-end 2023. We'll provide an updated time line when a procedural schedule has been issued. We look forward to working with our regulators and stakeholders over the coming months to achieve a constructive outcome for our Kansas customers and communities.\nMoving on to Slide 8. I'll provide an update on our other regulatory and legislative priorities. In Kansas, Governor Kelly signed House Bill 2225 into law in April and will become effective in 2024. The bill includes provision that matches the return on equity for our locally planned FERC transition projects to the return on equity established by the state for our other infrastructure investments. This law applies specifically to current and future transmission projects that are not subject to notifications to construct from the Southwest Power Pool. [ HB 2225 ] keeps our transmission delivery charge rider mechanism, or TDC, unchanged and fully intact. This bill provides savings to customers and was a product of constructive dialogue with Kansas regulators, legislators and other stakeholders.\nIn Missouri, the order approving our request to securitize extraordinary costs from Winter Storm Uri is in the state of pellet process. We believe the commission's decision in support of securitization is well supported by the record. As a reminder, we will complete the securitization financing after the appeal plays out, but incremental carrying costs incurred prior to approval will ultimately be recovered when we issue the debt. We anticipate resolution later this year.\nOn the legislative side, we're tracking the progress of Senate Bill 275 in Missouri, which would create a state and local sales tax exemption for the production of electricity. If signed into law, these savings will be passed on to customers and our next Missouri rate case. And bill has passed out of the Senate and currently waits debate on the House floor. Other bills relating to the energy sector may also receive attention this month. For example, the build it enhances state oversight of transmission and improve the consistency of transmission operations and planning. Referred to in shorthand as right of first refusal legislation continues to be an area of focus. The benefits of this legislation are reflected by similar laws that are in effect in the majority of states across our region. However, as the Missouri legislative session is scheduled to adjourn on May 12, timing is tight, and we expect that the discussion of ROFR and other energy-related bills may continue into next year.\nAs a final note on Slide 8, we remain on track to file our annual integrated resource plan updates in both Kansas and Missouri by mid-June. This year's IRP updates will include significant changes in assumptions, most notably updated cost estimates for new generation as well as substantial subsidies in the Federal Inflation Reduction Act for carbon-free resources.\nMoving to Slide 9. I'll profile another element of our corporate strategy related to environmental, social and governance measures. We continue to enhance our ESG practices and disclosures and our efforts have been recognized and reflected in significant improvements and third-party ESG ratings for Evergy. For example, Slide 9 profiles the comprehensive progress that we've made in the ESG ratings provided by ISS and by S&P Global's corporate sustainability assessment. From a disclosure perspective, 2022 marked the first year Evergy completed full CDP climate and water security questionnaires as well as the global reporting initiative report. We've also joined the Electric Power Research Institute's Climate Ready Initiative, a research partnership aimed at developing a collective approach to identifying and managing physical climate risks.\nOver time, we expect this effort to support the optimization of our grid investment priorities, utilizing a common framework around cost benefit analysis, risk mitigation and adaptation strategies.\nFinally, we continue to integrate climate-related risks into our enterprise risk management system. This is the best practice, which will allow us to identify and mitigate the impact of current and future risks in our business enhancing our ability to provide safe, reliable and affordable power.\nI'll conclude my remarks with Slide 10, which highlights the core tenets of our strategy: affordability, reliability and sustainability. On affordability front, advancing regional rate competitiveness is one of our primary objectives. Since 2017, we have reduced rates by 0.8% across our service territories, while regional rates have risen by double digits, and inflation rose 20% over the same time period. The impact of these efforts is reflected by ongoing wins in our region and economic development. And while we're pleased by our progress in improving regional rate competitiveness and keeping our rate trajectory far below the rate of inflation, affordability will always be an area of focus. We target top-tier performance and reliability, customer service and generation through modernization of our transmission and distribution lines, investing in smart grid technology and developing systems capabilities that meet customer needs and enable the increasingly active customer engagement with their electric service.\nReliability also encompasses operational excellence in our generation fleet, leveraging the skills and capabilities of our high-performing team and important assets like our Wolf Creek nuclear plant. Reliability is all the more important given the increasingly central role that electricity plays in so many aspects of daily life. We recognize the responsibility that comes with our role, and we embrace the challenge of delivering power at the cost and service level that our customers expect and demand. With respect to sustainability, we continue to advance the transition of our generation fleet, a process that has been underway for 2 decades. Since 2005, we reduced carbon emissions by nearly half, while reducing sulfur dioxide and [ NOx ] emissions by 98% and 88%, respectively. Additionally, nearly half of the energy that we generated for our retail customers came from carbon-free resources in 2022. Our mission is to empower a better future, and our vision is to lead the responsible energy transition in our region, always with an eye on affordability and reliability as well as sustainability.\nAnd with that, I will now turn the call over to Kirk.\n\nKirkland B. Andrews\n\nChief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director, NRG Yield, Inc.\n\nThanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 12, I'll start with a review of our results for the quarter. For the first quarter of 2023, Evergy delivered adjusted earnings of $136 million or $0.59 per share, that's compared to $130 million or $0.56 per share in the first quarter of 2022. As shown on the slide from left to right, the year-over-year increase in first quarter adjusted EPS was driven by the following: First, mild winter weather resulted in an approximate 11% decrease in heating degree days compared to last year, driving an $0.08 decrease in EPS. The strong weather-normalized demand of 2.1%, driven by the residential and commercial sectors contributed $0.04 per share. Higher transmission margins resulting from our ongoing investments to enhance our transmission infrastructure drove a $0.02 increase. A $36 million decrease in O&M drove a positive $0.12 variance year-over-year. This was partially the result of timing of O&M expenditures within 2023.\nThe net impact of higher depreciation and amortization was $0.07 for the quarter, which includes the offsetting impact of new retail rates. Proceeds from company-owned life insurance contributed $0.04 during the quarter. And the combination of higher interest expense and lower AFUDC drove a $0.13 decrease with interest expense representing $0.11 of that variance. The increase in interest expense reflects the lower rate environment in early 2022, and we expect rate-driven variances to decrease in magnitude as we move through the year, consistent with the assumptions in our guidance. And finally, other items, both positive and negative, drove a net increase of $0.09, which was primarily driven by other income and income tax-related items.\nTurning to Slide 13, I'll provide a brief update on our recent sales trends. On the left side of the slide, you'll see that total retail sales increased 2.1% over the first quarter of 2022. The driven primarily by increases in both residential and commercial usage. The decrease in industrial demand is primarily attributable to 2 refining customers, one of which experienced a high demand a year ago, and the other offline this past quarter due to a planned outage. Excluding these 2 customers, however, remaining industrial weather-normalized demand increased. Demand growth continues to be supported by a strong local labor market with Kansas and Kansas City Metro by area unemployment rates of 2.7% and 2.9%, respectively, which remained below the national average of 3.6%.\nI'll conclude my remarks with Slide 14. Our focus remains on continuing to demonstrate a strong track record of execution. As David mentioned earlier, based on solid first quarter results, combined with our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are reaffirming both our adjusted EPS guidance range for 2023 and as well as our long-term compound annual EPS growth rate target of 6% to 8% from 2021 to 2025 based on the midpoint of our original 2021 EPS guidance of $3.30. We also remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders and target dividend growth in line with earnings growth with a dividend payout ratio of between 60% to 70%. In addition to allowing us to achieve these financial targets, executing on this investment plan advances our key objectives of ensuring affordability, reliability and sustainability over the long term.\nAnd with that, we'll open the call up for questions."

(Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to hand the call over to Peter Flynn, Director Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nPeter Flynn\n\nThank you, Latif, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Evergy's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Our webcast slides and supplemental financial information are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.evergy.com. Today's discussion will include forward-looking information.\nSlide 2 and the disclosures in our SEC filings contain a list of some of the factors that could cause future results to differ materially from our expectations. They also include additional information on our non-GAAP financial measures. Joining us on today's call are David Campbell, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kirk Andrews, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nDavid will cover 2022 highlights, provide upcoming regulatory and legislative updates and discuss our upcoming integrated resource plan. Kirk will cover our fourth quarter and full year results, retail sales trends as well as our financial outlook for 2023. Other members of management are with us and will be available during the question-and-answer portion of the call.\nI will now turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid A. Campbell\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Evergy, Inc.\n\nThanks, Pete, and good morning, everyone. I'd be remiss if I did not start with the recognition of the Kansas City Chiefs and their victory in Super Bowl 57. For football fans, who have never been to Arrowhead Stadium, definitely add it to your list. Chiefs Kingdom is quite something to behold.\nI'll begin on Slide 5, and I'll start by thanking our employees who work tirelessly throughout the year to advance our strategic objectives of affordability, reliability and sustainability. I'm proud and honored to lead the Evergy team. With respect to 2022 results, I'm pleased to report that we had another solid year. We delivered adjusted earnings of $3.71 per share compared to $3.46 per share in 2021. These results reflect another year of strong execution relative to our objectives.\nWe entered 2022 with a guidance range of $3.43 per share to $3.63 per share and our results came in $0.08 higher than the top end of the range. Kirk will discuss the drivers of our 2022 results in more detail. Last year, we executed on our capital plan to further improve reliability and resiliency, investing $2.2 billion in infrastructure to modernize our grid and replace aging equipment. I'd like to recognize the hard work of our regulatory staff as we completed our first 2 Missouri rate cases since the merger in 2018.\nWe reached partial settlements on key economic issues at both Metro and Missouri West delivering significant O&M savings back to our customers. These rate cases underscore our continued progress in maintaining affordability for our customers and increasing our regional rate competitiveness. Through November 2022, we've limited cumulative rate increases to 2.7% since 2017, well below the rate of increase for our regional peers and the prevailing rate of inflation over the 5-year period.\nSlide 6 profiles the significant improvement that we've made in customer satisfaction as measured by J.D. Power's annual survey of utility customers. Since 2018, we've climbed 10 spots in J.D. Power's Midwest large utilities category, coming in at fifth out of 15 companies in 2022. Customer satisfaction remains at the forefront of our strategy.\nSafety tops our list of core values and Slide 7 highlights the considerable progress we've made in limiting safety-related events. Both OSHA recordables and DART cases have declined by over 50% since 2018. Promoting a culture of safety and focusing on every employee going home safely every day are paramount to our success as a company. On Slide 8, we introduced our 2023 GAAP and adjusted EPS guidance of $3.55 per share to $3.75 per share.\nWe know the importance of consistent execution, and we recognize that 2023 falls short of the midpoint relative to our long-term targets, reflecting regulatory lag in our Kansas jurisdiction and our commitment to a 5-year rate case stay out as part of the merger. But we remain confident in our ability to deliver annual 6% to 8% adjusted EPS growth through 2025 off of the 2021 baseline, and we are reaffirming that target today.\nMoving to our 5-year capital plan on Slide 9. We have updated and extended our forecast through 2027. Our new 5-year investment plan totals $11.6 billion from 2023 to 2027, which represents a $900 million increase relative to our 2022 to 2026 forecast for 9%. Nearly 60% of our planned investment is targeted towards transmission and distribution projects as we continue to modernize our grid to improve reliability and enhance resiliency for our customers.\nBy replacing aging equipment and investing in smart grid technologies we'll also enable further efficiency gains and serving our customers, which has been a hallmark of Evergy's strategy over the last 5 years.\nSlide 10 profiles our progress in driving cost savings. Despite historically high inflation in 2022, we held adjusted O&M flat relative to 2021, representing $232 million in cumulative savings since 2018 or 18%. The work is not done yet, and we remain laser-focused on our target of an additional 11% reduction in adjusted O&M through 2025. As part of this effort, the company implemented a voluntary retirement program fall of 2022, which combined with ordinary course retirements and attrition, resulted in an 8.5% reduction in the size of the organization by year-end.\nI can't say enough about the hard work of the Evergy team in delivering against and exceeding the savings for customers that were promised as part of the merger that formed our company. As shown on Slide 11, Evergy has been able to limit cumulative rate increases to 2.7% since 2017 based on the latest available data from the EIA, which runs through November 2022. This compares favorably to our regional peer states and the prevailing rate of inflation over the same time frame.\nAdvancing and improving regional rate competitiveness are priorities in our long-term plan and are front of mind for many of our stakeholders and that's exactly what we've accomplished over the past 5 years. Moving to Slide 12, I'll provide an update on regulatory and legislative priorities, beginning with our rate case filings in Kansas.\nIn mid-April, we'll file our first rate cases at Kansas Central and Kansas Metro since completion of the Evergy merger in 2018. We believe these rate reviews will be relatively straightforward, requesting recovery and return on our grid modernization and infrastructure investments over the past 5 years and passing on the benefits of the cost savings we've achieved to our customers.\nWe look forward to working with our regulators and stakeholders to achieve a constructive outcome for our Kansas customers and community. In Missouri, this year, we anticipate quiet legislative session relative to last year, which saw the extension and amendment of PISA further supporting the constructive regulatory environment in the state. On the regulatory front, we have open dockets for the approval of an operating certificate of convenience and necessity for our acquisition of Persimmon Creek Wind Farm as well as the securitization from winter storm Uri costs incurred at Missouri West.\nInitial post-hearing briefs are due on March 6 in the Persimmon Creek docket with an order requested by April 6. We firmly believe Persimmon Creek is the lowest cost solution to serve Missouri West customers, consistent with the IRP preferred plan, and we'll continue to work collaboratively with our regulators to secure the necessary approvals. Missouri Public Service Commission's approval of our request to securitize extraordinary costs from Winter Storm Uri was appealed to the Missouri Court of Appeals by the Office of Public Counsel in early January.\nOPC's initial briefs are due by early April, 90 days following the appeal day. We believe the commission's decision to approve our request is well supported by the record. While we cannot complete our securitization financing until the appeal plays out, incremental carrying costs incurred prior to approval will ultimately be recovered when we issued the debt. The last item on the regulatory agenda that I'll reference is the expected June filing of our annual integrated resource plan updates in both Kansas and Missouri, which I'll cover more as you turn to Slide 13.\nThe planning process for our IRP filings is well underway as we continue to assess the beneficial impacts of the Inflation Reduction Act on our generation resource planning. The longer-term certainty the IRA provides around renewable energy tax credits, will enhance our ability to tap the abundant renewables potential in our region and deliver savings to our customers by replacing higher cost energy.\nWe expect our Wolf Creek nuclear plant to be eligible for the IRAs nuclear production tax credit, the benefits of which will accrue to our customers in years with low realized prices for Wolf Creek. In addition to these IRA tailwinds, we'll be incorporating updated commodity projections, construction costs, and higher capacity requirements in the Southwest Power Pool into the annual updates.\nWe are excited to advance our integrated resource plans to deliver additional benefits to our customers. I'll conclude my remarks on Slide 14, which summarizes the Evergy value proposition. The left side of the page covers the core tenets of our strategy to advance affordability, reliability and sustainability through a relentless focus on our customers, supported by stakeholder collaboration, sustainable investment and financial and operational excellence.\nThe right-hand side features what we believe are particularly attractive and distinctive features for Evergy given our business mix, and geographic location. We are excited about the opportunities for our company, and we are committed to the sustained effort required to deliver against our high performance objectives.\nI will now turn the call over to Kirk.\n\nKirkland B. Andrews\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, NRG Energy, Inc.\n\nThanks, David. Good morning, everyone, and I'll start with the results for the quarter on Slide 16. For the fourth quarter of 2022, Evergy delivered adjusted earnings of $68.6 million or $0.30 per share compared to $32.9 million or $0.14 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021. As shown on the slide, the year-over-year increase in fourth quarter EPS was driven by the following: first, an increase in heating degree days, partially offset by lower demand drove a net $0.08 increase in EPS compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.\nHigh transmission margins resulting from both our ongoing investments to enhance our transmission infrastructure and higher volumes drove a $0.04 increase. A decrease in O&M versus the fourth quarter of 2021 drove an $0.08 increase in adjusted EPS for the quarter. These positive drivers were partially offset by $0.03 of higher D&A expense and $0.09 from the combination of higher interest expense and lower AFUDC equity.\nIncome tax related items, including increased wind and other tax credits and the timing of the use of tax credits compared to the prior year, drove $0.06 of higher EPS in the quarter. And finally, other items, both positive and negative, drove a net $0.02 of year-over-year increase. These items consist of higher COLI proceeds and other margin, which were partially offset by $0.06 from the Kansas earnings sharing program, which was one of our merger commitments, which expired in 2022. Warmer weather through the summer and into the fall drove our earned ROE at Kansas Metro above our current authorized 9.3%, requiring us to refund half of that excess back to customers. I'll turn next to year-to-date results, which you'll find on Slide 17.\nFor the full year 2022, adjusted earnings were $853.8 million or $3.71 per share, which compares to $795.2 million or $3.46 per share in 2021. Again, moving from left to right, our full year EPS drivers versus '21 include the following: Weather contributed $0.21 versus 2021. Relative to normal, weather drove an estimated $0.29 of favorability in 2022. Weather-normalized demand was 1.1% higher than 2021, driving an $0.11 increase. Higher transmission margins from increased investment as well as higher volumes, drove a $0.15 year-over-year increase and lower O&M drove adjusted EPS $0.02 higher versus 2021.\nThese positive drivers were partially offset by $0.11 of D&A and $0.14 of increased interest expense and lower AFUDC equity, with higher interest expense accounting for $0.11 of the $0.14 decrease in adjusted EPS.\nFinally, other items drove a net $0.01 of favorability consisting primarily of $0.04 from the expiry of merger bill credits, $0.02 from tax credits and $0.01 of other items, which were partially offset by $0.06 from the earnings sharing program or ERSP, at Kansas Metro, which I mentioned earlier in my fourth quarter remarks.\nTurning to Slide 18. I'll provide a brief update on our recent sales trends. On the left-hand side of the slide, you'll see that total retail sales increased 3.5% in 2022, driven primarily by a strong increase in residential usage and supported by healthy commercial and industrial growth. Looking to the right-hand side of the slide, after adjusting for the estimated impact of weather, retail sales increased 1.1% for the full year. These results were bolstered by strong industrial demand from the oil and chemical refining sectors.\nThe 1.7% increase in weather-normalized commercial demand was driven by customer growth and a continued return to normal, post COVID. Underlying the continued growth in residential and commercial customers is a strong labor market, highlighted by Kansas and the Kansas City Metro area unemployment rates of 2.9% and 2.4%, respectively, as of year-end.\nThese remain below the national average of 3.4%. Overall, in 2022, we saw continued recovery following the pandemic and our economy is well positioned to extend that positive trend. As a result, adjusting for 30-year weather, we expect an approximate 1.6% increase in weather-normalized demand in 2023, which I'll discuss as part of our 2023 EPS guidance, which you'll find on Slide 19.\nStarting on the left side of that slide and beginning with 2022 adjusted EPS of $3.71, we expect an $0.11 decline from demand or just under 1% decrease in total demand. This $0.11 decrease is the net impact of removing that estimated $0.29 impact in '22 from weather, partially offset by an $0.18 increase in weather-normalized demand. Removing the largely weather-driven impact of the earnings sharing program, or ERSP at Kansas Metro in 2022, results in a $0.06 increase.\nWe expect an approximate $60 million reduction in pretax O&M to deliver a $0.20 EPS increase as we continue to execute on our cost savings programs as part of our focus on and commitment to affordability and operational excellence. Higher transmission margins are expected to add $0.13 in 2023 as we continue to make investments to improve our transmission infrastructure.\nThe pending acquisition of the Persimmon Creek Wind Farm is expected to drive $0.05 of EPS. These positive drivers are expected to be partially offset by the following: increased D&A of $0.16 as we continue to invest in infrastructure and execute our capital plan, increased interest expense of $0.21 due to higher debt balances at higher rates, and $0.02 of other items, primarily driven by lower year-over-year earnings from a combination of the expiry of a wholesale contract in Kansas and the onetime true-up of Uri carrying costs in 2022 which were partially offset by higher expected COLI proceeds.\nTurning next to Slide 20. Our strong results in 2022 reflect our ongoing focus on and continuing to build a track record of consistent execution. As David mentioned earlier, we're reaffirming our long-term compound annual EPS growth rate target of 6% to 8% from 2021 to 2025 as we remain confident in achieving that trajectory. And as we continue to progress on that path, we also remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders and target dividend growth in line with earnings growth with that dividend payout ratio of 60% to 70%.\nOur updated 5-year CapEx plan from 2023 to 2027 totals $11.6 billion and implies rate base growth of approximately 6% from 2022 to 2027. We've included some additional disclosures in the appendix of today's presentation, including a breakdown of planned expenditures by category and by utility, which we hope you will find helpful.\nIn addition to allowing us to achieve these financial targets, executing on this investment plan also advances our key objective to advance affordability, reliability and sustainability over the long term. I'll conclude by reviewing some specific 2023 objectives as you turn to Slide 21. Building on the positive momentum from our strong results over the past 2 years, we remain focused on meeting or exceeding our financial targets in 2023. This year, we'll be working collaboratively with our Kansas regulators and stakeholders to achieve a constructive outcome in our first Kansas Central and Metro rate cases since the merger in 2018.\nAs a key factor in achieving our goal of affordability, we look forward to providing our Kansas customers with the benefits of significant O&M savings we've achieved over the last 5 years. Consistent with the needs identified in our integrated resource plan, we are focused on closing the acquisition of the 200 megawatt Persimmon Creek Wind Farm this year, which is PISA eligible and will serve our Missouri West customers with clean low-cost energy.\nFinally, we've recently launched a new renewables RFP, focused on sourcing the balance of our 2024 renewables as well as our 2025 and 2026 investment objectives, and we will look to complete this process later this year to begin executing agreements to achieve those objectives. We will also update our integrated resource plans in both states in June, which will, for the first time, incorporate the benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions."

Welcome to the Third Quarter 2022 Evergy Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions). Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Lori Wright, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead.\n\nLori A. Wright\n\nVP of IR & Treasurer, Evergy, Inc.\n\nThank you, [Alyssa]. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Evergy's third quarter call. Thank you for joining us this morning.\nToday's discussion will include forward-looking information. Slide 2 and the disclosure in our SEC filings contain a list of some of the factors that could cause future results to differ materially from our expectations and include additional information on non-GAAP financial measures. The releases issued this morning, along with today's webcast slides and supplemental financial information for the quarter, are available on the main page of our website at investors.evergy.com.\nOn the call today, we have David Campbell, Evergy's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kirk Andrews, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. David will cover our third quarter highlights, provide an update on ongoing and upcoming regulatory proceedings and our recent sales trends, as well as an update on our resource planning and the Inflation Reduction Act. Kirk will cover in more detail the third quarter and year-to-date results and our financial outlook for the remainder of the year. Other members of management are with us and will be available during the question-and-answer portion of the call.\nI will now turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid A. Campbell\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Evergy, Inc.\n\nThanks, Lori, and good morning, everyone.\nI'll begin on Slide 5, and I'm pleased to report that we had another solid quarter as we delivered adjusted earnings of $2.01 per share compared to $1.97 per share in 2021. The increase in adjusted earnings over last year was driven primarily by favorable demand, above normal weather and higher transmission margin, partially offset by higher D&A and interest expense. For year-to-date, September 30, adjusted earnings were $3.43 per share compared to $3.35 per share a year ago.\nWith these strong results, we are raising the midpoint of our guidance from $3.53 per share to $3.58 per share, and revising our adjusted EPS guidance range to $3.53 to $3.63 per share from $3.43 to $3.63 per share. Kirk will detail the drivers of our third quarter performance and upward guidance revision.\nI would also like to call out and complement the strong work of the entire Evergy team in providing safe and reliable power to our customers and communities through a hot summer and early fall. In particular, I'll call out our team's strong safety performance with a 66% reduction in DART events and a 62% reduction and OSHA recordables compared to the first 9 months of 2021.\nOn August 9, we announced an agreement to acquire Persimmon Creek Wind Farm, a 199-megawatt operating wind farm in Western Oklahoma, for $250 million. This investment satisfies 2/3 of our planned 300 megawatts of renewal additions in 2024. Persimmon Creek will deliver low-cost power to our Missouri West customers, subject to approval from the Missouri Public Service Commission, and supports our carbon reduction and net zero emission targets.\nWe also announced a 7% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.6125 per share or $2.45 per share on an annualized basis. This increase is consistent with our recent growth trajectory and long-term targets. We remain laser-focused on executing our plan and advancing our strategic objectives of affordability, reliability and sustainability in the context of historically volatile economic conditions and inflation. We remain confident in our long-term plan, and we are reaffirming our target annual EPS growth rate of 6% to 8% from 2021 to 2025.\nNow moving to Slide 6 in Missouri, we are pleased to reach partial stipulations and agreements with our stakeholders in the pending Metro and Missouri West rate cases, which we expect will provide a balanced outcome for customers and shareholders. The approved agreements call for a $67.5 million revenue increase across our Missouri jurisdictions. Not all of the relevant details are public in the Black-box settlement, but I'll highlight the 8.25% pre-tax rate of return for plant and service accounting, or PISA, as a helpful data point. This will apply to go-forward investments. While the settlement resolved most of the key economic issues, there are several items that the Missouri Commission will resolve in the coming weeks. Revised rates will go into effect on December 6.\nWe're pleased that we were able to find common ground with our stakeholders in these settlements. We continue to view Missouri as a very attractive jurisdiction to invest in, as evidenced by the rate case and the constructive extension and changes to the PISA legislation that were enacted earlier this year.\nTurning to Slide 7, I'll provide a summary of other key regulatory and legislative milestones and ongoing constructive developments in both Kansas and Missouri.\nI'm happy to report the Missouri Commission issued a financing order in October that approved our request to recover and securitize approximately $300 million of Winter Storm Uri costs at our Missouri West jurisdiction. We expect to go to market in the first half of 2023 to complete this financing.\nFor the Persimmon Creek acquisition, we filed for a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity, or CCN, in August. We expect this investment to qualify for PISA treatment at our Missouri West jurisdiction. Missouri Commission staff will issue its recommendation by November 18, and we requested approval by year-end.\nOn the other side of the state line, the Kansas Corporation Commission issued an order in mid-September that determined our 2022 capital investment plan meets the requirements of the capital investment plan framework. Consistent with prior years, the commission also requested Evergy attend a workshop to explain the impact of the proposed capital spending and to answer questions for the commissioners, KCC staff and the Citizens' Utility Ratepayer Board or CURB. The workshop will take place on December 13.\nWe look forward to the opportunity to highlight the benefits of our planned transmission and distribution investments in a system with a lot of older infrastructure, the addition of renewables consistent with our integrated resource plan, the benefits of which are now further enhanced by the federal subsidies in the IRA, as well as upgrades to technology and customer service platforms that will help us to serve customers more effectively and efficiently. In addition, we'll cover our ongoing progress in advancing the regional rate competitiveness of Evergy's system, which is a core element of our strategic focus on affordability.\nAlso in Kansas, preparation is underway for our 2023 rate cases, which we will file in late April. This will be our first request for new base rates in Kansas since we formed Evergy in 2018. Key drivers of the case will include return on equity, capital structure, review of our reliability and efficiency-focused distribution, customer and technology infrastructure investments since our last rate case, as well as passing on the significant O&M savings we've generated for customers since the completion of the merger.\nWe look forward to working constructively with our regulators and stakeholders just as we have in multiple forms of the past few years in campus, to advance the 2023 rate cases and deliver against our strategic objectives of ensuring affordability, reliability and sustainability for our Kansas customers and communities.\nTurning to Slide 8. I'll review our demand growth and comment on economic trends and developments. For the third quarter, total weather-normalized retail demand increased by approximately 1.7%, driven by a robust increase in industrial demand for the chemical and oil and gas sectors. Year-to-date, weather-normalized demand is up approximately 2%. Total demand is up 2.4% for the quarter and approximately 3% for the year. While 2021 was warmer than average, temperatures were even higher than the third quarter of 2022.\nOur regional economy has remained healthy as the unemployment rate in both Kansas and Missouri continues to track below the national average. We are also excited by the ongoing growth that we've seen as reflected in the numbers I just shared, as well as the large project announcements such as Meta's Data Center and Panasonic's new electric vehicle battery manufacturing plant.\nI'll conclude my remarks with a few comments on the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, on Slide 9. There's no question that the IRA is a very consequential piece of legislation. We are assessing the key impacts of the IRA through the economic and customer affordability lenses as the bill provides longer-term certainty and visibility for significant renewable energy tax credits and emerging technologies. This economic support will further enhance our ability to take advantage of the abundant renewable potential of our region and deliver savings to our customers by replacing energy produced from resources with higher fuel and O&M costs. We also expect the Wolf Creek nuclear plant to be eligible for the IRA's nuclear production tax credit, which will have a beneficial impact for customer bills in years with low realized prices for Wolf Creek.\nWe expect to provide an update on our future renewable generation plans by mid-2023 when we file our revised annual integrated resource plans in Kansas and Missouri. This update will incorporate the impact of the IRA, updated commodity projections and higher capacity requirements in the Southwest Power Pool. We are excited to advance the program that will further enhance our affordability, reliability and sustainability goals.\nI will now turn the call over to Kirk.\n\nKirkland B. Andrews\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, NRG Energy, Inc.\n\nThanks, David, and good morning, everyone.\nI'll start with the results for the quarter on Slide 11. But before I turn to the drivers behind our third quarter adjusted EPS, I'd like to summarize one item on our GAAP results for the quarter related to the deferral of certain revenues from our retired Sibley coal plant in Missouri.\nAlthough rate treatment for Sibley is among the items the Missouri Public Service Commission will resolve in the coming weeks, a decision by the commission issued in August related to a plant retirement by another Missouri utility established a regulatory precedent, which led us to change the accounting for Sibley. Since retiring Sibley in 2018, we've collected approximately $3.1 million in revenues each quarter associated with the return on the Sibley rate base. Based on the regulatory precedent in the third quarter, we deferred the cumulative amount of these revenues collected in rates since the plant retirement, totaling $47.5 million, to a regulatory liability with a corresponding reduction to operating revenues in the quarter.\nIn order to allow our adjusted EPS to reflect the impact of the accounting change in the periods in which revenues were collected, we've excluded the amount of the deferral associated with the revenues collected prior to the third quarter and prior to 2022 from our third quarter and year-to-date adjusted EPS, respectively. As a result, within the quarter and year-to-date, the net impact of the change in Sibley accounting reflected in our adjusted EPS was approximately $0.01 for the quarter and $0.03 year-to-date. For comparative purposes, we've also recast the adjusted EPS for 2021 to reflect the $0.01 per quarter impact.\nNotwithstanding this change in accounting, we remain confident that the retirement of Sibley was prudent as reflected in the Commission Order in the Missouri West securitization proceeding, which addressed prudence. As such, we continue to believe the inclusion of ongoing return on rate base per Sibley in our general rate case filing was appropriate. Although the ultimate rate treatment of Sibley, including the ongoing return on rate base, remains to be decided upon by commission, and this decision may have an impact on future revenues.\nThe third quarter deferral of revenues in and of itself does not impact our expected earnings going forward. For the third quarter of 2022, Evergy delivered adjusted earnings of $462 million or $2.01 per share compared to $452 million or $1.97 per share in the third quarter of 2021.\nThe year-over-year increase in third quarter EPS was driven by the following. First, a 3% increase in cooling degree days drove a $0.03 increase in EPS compared to third quarter '21. Adjusting for the warmer-than-normal weather experienced in the third quarter of '21, however, the third quarter of this year also saw $0.15 of EPS versus normal weather assumed in our original plan. As David mentioned earlier, we also saw a 1.7% increase in weather-normalized demand this past quarter, which drove $0.06 per share. Higher transmission revenues resulting from our ongoing investments to enhance our transmission infrastructure and higher volumes drove about a $0.01 increase.\nThese positive drivers were partially offset during the quarter by higher operation and maintenance expense as well as increased depreciation expense, which impacted our EPS by $0.01 and $0.03 per share, respectively. Additionally, we have incurred $0.03 of higher interest expense due to increased debt outstanding at higher rates.\nI'll turn next to year-to-date results, which you'll find on Slide 12. For the 9 months ended September 30, adjusted earnings were $790 million or $3.43 per share compared to $768 million or $3.35 per share for the same period last year.\nAgain, moving from left to right, our year-to-date EPS drivers versus '21 include the following. When combined with above normal weather in the first 2 quarters, our year-to-date results now reflect a $0.09 benefit from weather versus last year. When compared to normal weather, weather this year contributed $0.26 year-to-date. Weather-normalized demand increased about 2% year-to-date, driving approximately $0.15 of EPS. Higher transmission revenues driven by ongoing investments, combined with an increase in transmission delivery charge revenues due to higher volumes, led to $0.12 year-to-date increase versus '21.\nAnd these items were partially offset by increased O&M expense due to higher generation maintenance driven by weather and outages as well as increased vegetation management, leading to approximately $0.07 per share. $0.08 of higher depreciation expense due to increased infrastructure investment, $0.05 of increased interest expense and lower AFUDC equity, again, primarily driven by higher debt outstanding at higher interest rates. $0.02 of income tax smoothing driven by timing differences within the year. And finally, we had $0.06 of other items, primarily from lower COLI proceeds and higher property taxes incurred prior to the implementation of the new Missouri property tax tracker in late August.\nTurning to Slide 13, I'll provide greater details on the drivers of our increased midpoint and narrowed guidance range for 2022. Starting with our previous guidance range on the left of the slide, and again, moving from left to right.\nFirst, we incorporate the $0.26 of weather impact year-to-date, assuming normal weather for the fourth quarter. Higher transmission revenues driven by an increase in TDC revenues due to higher volumes drives a $0.09 increase versus original expectations. These items are partially offset by an $0.11 per share increase in O&M driven by increased generation maintenance to maximize fleet availability due to higher-than-expected demand and power prices year-to-date and higher vegetation management spend. $0.09 per share from COLI driven by immaterial COLI proceeds year-to-date and assuming no further COLI proceeds in the fourth quarter. $0.06 driven primarily by higher interest expense. And lastly, we've incorporated the $0.01 per quarter impact of the Sibley deferral or $0.04 for the year into our updated guidance.\nAnd finally, turning to Slide 14, having raised our midpoint guidance for 2022 and increased our dividend by $0.07 to $2.45 per share annualized, we are reaffirming our 2021 to 2025 long-term annualized EPS growth target of 6% to 8% and continue to target dividend growth in line with EPS at a 60% to 70% payout. We'll be providing 2023 adjusted EPS guidance on our fourth quarter call in February, and we'll be filing our Kansas rate case in late April of next year, with rates effective in late December. We continue to plan $10.7 billion of infrastructure investments from 2022 to 2026, and we'll provide an update to our CapEx plan on our fourth quarter call as we maintain focus on making investments to ensure we provide affordable, reliable and sustainable service to our customers and communities.\nWith that, operator, we'd be happy to take questions."

I'm pleased to report that we had a solid second quarter as we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.86 compared to $0.85 in 2021. The increase in adjusted earnings over last year was driven primarily by favorable weather, an increase in weather-normalized demand and higher transmission margin, partially offset by higher planned operations and maintenance expense and lower other income net of expense. Kirk will discuss the second quarter drivers in more detail.\nOn our first quarter earnings call, I highlighted that we had just participated in a safety roadshow and that our focus on safety contributed to strong safety performance in the first quarter. Our employees continued this positive trend through midyear reducing work-related injuries, including recordable and restricted events by 60% compared to the same period last year. And our customer reliability has been solid despite challenging weather, reflecting the beneficial impacts of our ongoing grid investments.\nCompared to the 5-year trend in our service territory, so far this year, the number of days with sustained wins over 25 miles per hour increased 89% to 65 days, and days with wind gust over 40 miles per hour increased nearly 50% to 78 days. 2021 was in line with this 5-year average for both measures, so 2022 has been a clear outlier. In contrast, relative to the 5-year trend, average daily outage events have decreased by 14% in the first 6 months of 2022, notwithstanding the more extreme weather, indicating improved system resiliency. I would like to thank all Evergy employees for their focus on safety and their dedication to providing safe, reliable and affordable power to our customers.\nI would also like to highlight a recent generation milestone. As you know, we have been expanding our wind portfolio for over a decade. With about 4,400 megawatts of owned and contracted wind generation, our portfolio recently marked 100 million-megawatt hours of cumulative wind energy production. And in 2021, factoring in the production from our Wolf Creek nuclear plant, our emission-free generation was equivalent to 56% of our total retail customers' usage. Our team's consistent execution has resulted in a solid start to the year, and we are reaffirming our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance of $3.43 per share to $3.63 per share as well as our target long-term annual EPS growth rate of 6% to 8% from 2021 to 2025.\nSlide 6 highlights our annual Integrated Resource Plan update, which was filed in June for both Kansas and Missouri. Our preferred plan for the next decade is consistent with the resource plan laid out in last year's Triennial IRP filing and the renewables development plan Kirk discussed during our Investor Day last September. The minor tweaks in the plan reflects updates to the sequencing of our near-term investments. Specifically, we shifted the 190-megawatt solar edition and the Lawrence coal retirements to 2024, primarily due to the dynamic market conditions facing the solar supply chain and the benefits to customers of keeping Lawrence online with current high natural gas prices.\nIn 2026, we shifted a planned solar project to wind and increased the capacity assumption for the project by 100 megawatts. Beyond 2026, we slightly reduced megawatt assumptions for our solar projects, which on a net basis offset some upward pressures on pricing. Overall, by the end of 2032, our preferred plan now includes 3,500 megawatts of renewable additions while also responsibly retiring nearly 2,000 megawatts of coal, balancing both affordability and reliability as we advance our fleet transition and advance toward achieving our sustainability and emissions reduction goals.\nMoving on to Slide 7, I'll provide a summary of key regulatory and legislative milestones and ongoing constructive developments in both Kansas and Missouri. In Missouri, we continue to work our way to the pending general rate case. In early June, staff and other interveners filed their direct testimony. And mid-July, all parties filed rebuttal testimony. In the next few weeks, parties will file true-up and surrebuttal testimony with a settlement conference to follow around August 22 and hearings later this month through early September. Revised rates in Missouri will go effective on December 6. We look forward to working with the parties to constructively resolve the case.\nAt Missouri West, we have also been advancing the securitization process to recover the roughly $300 million of winter storm Uri costs. Earlier this week, we filed a nonunanimous settlement that resolves all key issues with the Missouri Commission staff. In terms of timing, hearings are wrapping up this week, and we expect a commission financing order in mid-October.\nOn the legislative front of Missouri, Senate Bill 745, which modifies Plant In Service Accounting, or PISA, was signed by the governor and became law in late June. The modifications reduced the revenue requirement cap to a 2.5% annual compounded growth rate and narrow the calculation to consider PISA deferrals only. Importantly, this bill also puts into a law a property tax tracker effective later this month, which will eliminate a historical source of lag in our Missouri jurisdictions.\nThe PISA extension marks the second consecutive year of passing new legislation in Missouri that will benefit customers and stakeholders. In 2021, HB 734 was signed into law, authorizing the securitization of extraordinary costs and the unrecovered book value of our retired generation plants.\nMoving to Kansas. I'm pleased to report that in June, the Kansas Corporation Commission approved the nonunanimous stipulation agreement for winter storm Uri costs. The order allows us to recover roughly $120 million of deferred extraordinary fuel purchase power and nonfuel costs at Kansas Central over a 2-year period beginning in April 2023. Similarly, the $37 million of net benefits at Kansas Metro will be returned to customers over a 1-year period, also beginning in April next year. Preparations are underway for our Kansas Central and Kansas Metro rate cases, which we will file in April 2023. We expect the test year ending September 30, 2022 and the true-up date around June 30, 2023, with new rates becoming effective in December of next year.\nOther important milestones in Kansas include the passage and signing of securitization legislation in mid-2021 as well as the completion last November of the docket before the Kansas Corporation Commission relating to the Sustainability Transformation Plan.\nIn both Kansas and Missouri, the Triennial Integrated Resource Plans have completed their review process. The Missouri Public Service Commission approved the IRP in March of this year and the Kansas Corporation Commission accepted the IRP in May. We will continue to work collaboratively with regulators and interveners in both states to achieve constructive outcomes that advance our core objectives of delivering affordable, reliable and sustainable power to the customers and the communities that we serve.\nOverall, we are pleased with the strong start to the year, the progress that we have achieved in working closely with regulators and stakeholders to enhance our service to our customers and the ongoing consistent execution of our business plan.\nI will now turn the call over to Kirk.\n\nKirkland B. Andrews\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, NRG Energy, Inc.\n\nThanks, David. And good morning, everyone. I'll start with the results for the quarter on Slide 9. For the second quarter of 2022, Evergy delivered adjusted earnings of $198 million or $0.86 per share compared to $195 million or $0.85 per share in the second quarter of 2021.\nThe year-over-year increase in second quarter EPS was driven by the following. First, a 16% increase in cooling degree days drove a $0.06 increase in EPS compared to second quarter 2021. Adjusting for the warmer-than-normal weather experienced in the second quarter of '21, however, the second quarter of this year saw an $0.11 increase in EPS versus normal weather assumed in our original plan. We also saw a 4% increase in weather-normalized demand this past quarter, which drove $0.10 per share. Higher revenues driven by our transmission investments, combined with an increase in TDC revenues due to higher-than-expected volumes, drove a $0.06 increase. These positive drivers were partially offset during the quarter by O&M expense, which was approximately $29 million higher or $0.10 per share driven primarily by planned generation maintenance outages and higher transmission and distribution contractor expense. We saw $0.02 of higher depreciation and amortization expense due to increased infrastructure investment; $0.02 of higher interest expense due to increased debt outstanding at higher interest rates; and finally, we had $0.07 of lower other income, net of expense, due primarily to lower COLI proceeds year-over-year as well as lower AFUDC equity.\nI'll turn next to year-to-date results, which you'll find on Slide 10. For the 6 months ended June 30, 2022, adjusted earnings were $332 million or $1.44 per share compared to $320 million or $1.40 per share for the same period last year. Again, moving left to right on the slide, our year-to-date EPS drivers include -- versus 2021, rather, include the following.\nWhen combined with relatively normal weather in the first quarter of this year, our year-to-date results reflect the $0.06 impact from weather during the second quarter. Weather-normalized demand year-to-date increased about 2%, driving approximately $0.10 of EPS. Higher transmission revenues driven by ongoing investments, combined with an increase in TDC revenues due to higher volumes, led to an $0.11 year-to-date increase versus 2021.\nYear-to-date, these items were partially offset by the following: O&M expense due to higher planned generation maintenance outages and increased T&D contractor expense incurred during the second quarter drove approximately $0.05 per share; $0.06 of higher depreciation expense due to increased infrastructure investment; $0.09 of lower other income net of expense driven by COLI proceeds and AFUDC equity; and finally, we had $0.03 of higher income tax expense, and that was primarily due to tax smoothing, which reflects a shift in intra-year timing of the recognition of certain tax items in order to maintain our projected effective tax rate for the year, and this is not expected to result in a variance in our full year results.\nTurning to Slide 11. I'll review a bit more detail behind the weather-normalized demand growth for the quarter and year-to-date as well as an update on economic trends and developments. For the second quarter, as I mentioned previously, total weather-normalized retail demand increased by approximately 4% led by a robust year-over-year increase in industrial demand driven in particular by the chemical and oil and gas sectors. Year-to-date, weather-normalized demand increased approximately 2%. Over the balance of the year, we expect a more moderated increase in year-over-year weather-normalized demand given the second half of 2021, largely reflected post-pandemic working conditions. Overall, total retail demand is now above pre-pandemic levels.\nOn the economic development front, in July, Panasonic announced plans to build a new electric vehicle battery manufacturing facility in De Soto, Kansas, which is just outside the Kansas City metro area. This facility, which will be one of the largest of its kind in the U.S., represents an estimated investment of approximately $4 billion and is expected to create up to 4,000 new jobs. The facility will be located in the Evergy Kansas Central jurisdiction and when fully constructed and operational is expected to be one of our largest customers.\nAnd finally, on Slide 12, I'll wrap up with an overview of our long-term financial expectations. With our strong start to the year, we are reaffirming our adjusted 2022 EPS guidance of $3.43 to $3.63. We plan on giving our 2023 annual guidance on our typical time line as part of the year-end call early next year. As David noted earlier, we are also reaffirming our long-term compound annual EPS growth rate target of 6% to 8% from 2021 to 2025 based on the midpoint of last year's original adjusted EPS guidance of $3.30. We continue to expect growing the dividend in line with our long-term earnings and target a 60% to 70% dividend payout ratio. Our $10.7 billion 5-year capital plan through 2026 is focused on new infrastructure investment to improve customer service, enhance reliability and resiliency and transition our generation fleet while at the same time continuing to advance regional rate competitiveness and meet the evolving needs of our customers and communities.\nWith that, I'll hand the call back over to David.\n\nDavid A. Campbell\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Evergy, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kirk. We appreciate your time with us today, and we now would be happy to take your questions."

Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.\nI would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Lori Wright, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Thank you. Please go ahead.\n\nLori A. Wright\n\nVP of IR & Treasurer, Evergy, Inc.\n\nThank you, Blue. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Evergy's first quarter call. Thank you for joining us this morning.\nToday's discussion will include forward-looking information. Slide 2 and the disclosure in our SEC filings contain a list of some of the factors that could cause future results to differ materially from our expectations and include additional information on non-GAAP financial measures. The releases issued this morning, along with today's webcast slides and supplemental financial information for the quarter, are available on the main page of our website at investors.evergy.com.\nOn the call today, we have David Campbell, Evergy's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kirk Andrews, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. David will cover our first quarter highlights, our regulatory and legislative priorities and our enhanced ESG profile. Kirk will cover in more detail the first quarter results, the latest on sales and customers, and our financial outlook. Other members of management are with us and will be available during the question-and-answer portion of the call.\nI will now turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid A. Campbell\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Evergy, Inc.\n\nThanks, Lori, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 5. I'm pleased to report that we had a solid first quarter as we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.58 compared to $0.55 in 2021. The increase in adjusted earnings over last year was driven primarily by higher transmission margin and lower operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization and higher income tax expense. Kirk will discuss these first quarter drivers in more detail.\nOne of our objectives is to become widely recognized for operational excellence, which includes safety. Our strong safety culture drives both discipline and consistency in performance as well as cost management. During the first quarter, our employees participated in a safety roadshow that included presentations at 70 sessions throughout our service territory. This continued focus on safety has contributed to a 68% reduction in OSHA recordable safety events relative to the first quarter of 2021. I would like to thank all Evergy employees for their focus on safety and their dedication to providing safe, reliable and affordable power to our customers.\nI would also like to congratulate our Wolf Creek nuclear plant for completing a project to store spent fuel in a concrete bunker adjacent to the plant. This is Wolf Creek's first dry cask fuel storage campaign, and the team did an excellent job managing the project.\nWith a solid start to the year, we are reaffirming our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance of $3.43 to $3.63 per share as well as our target long-term annual EPS growth rate of 6% to 8% from 2021 to 2025.\nSlide 6 highlights the core tenets of our strategy, affordability, reliability and sustainability. Keeping rates affordable is at the forefront of our thinking, given its importance to our customers, especially given current economic conditions. We've made clear progress in advancing the competitiveness of our regional rates over the last few years, and our plan is constructed to continue this trajectory.\nWe are closely monitoring and managing inflation in all aspects of our business, and regarding fuel cost inflation, in particular, we are well positioned relative to many other utilities, given our relatively lower level of natural gas exposure as natural gas comprises typically 5% or less of our generation fuel mix annually. We, like many of our peers, have revisited our commodity procurement and hedging practices in light of the increased volatility, which are at levels not seen for more than a decade.\nEnsuring reliability is also a core element of our strategy, along with SAIDI and SAIFI, this includes a focus on metrics relating to customer service, the commercial availability of our fleet, safety and all elements of our operations, including infrastructure investment. This spring has brought resiliency to the forefront as high winds in our service territory have been significantly more prevalent than normal, including several days in recent weeks with wind gusts in the 50 to 60 miles per hour range. These types of conditions reinforce the importance of our ongoing transmission and distribution investments.\nWith respect to sustainability, our track record includes reducing our carbon emissions by nearly 50% versus 2005 levels and providing nearly half of our energy from carbon-free sources. In January, we announced plans to build a 10-megawatt solar array at our Hawthorne Plant pending regulatory approval. And in February, Evergy's cumulative wind power generation passed the 90 million-megawatt hour milestone. That's enough wind power to fuel more than 300 billion miles of electric vehicle travel. We will continue our generation transition towards cleaner energy, while always balancing affordability and reliability.\nOn Slide 7, I'll profile another element of our corporate strategy related to environmental, social and governance measures. Since forming Evergy in 2018, we've enhanced our ESG practices and disclosures, which have yielded significant progress in our third-party ESG scores, as reflected on the slide.\nFor example, last year, we introduced our 2045 net-zero carbon target, with an interim goal of 70% reduction by 2030, building on our track record and trajectory of historical emissions reductions. Beyond environmental policy, we've also taken a comprehensive approach to reviewing and updating our social and governance policies and related disclosures. Examples include a corporate human rights policy, improved board governance bylaws, expanded shareholder rights and a formalized water policy among many others.\nIn addition, our Board has linked executive compensation to the successful execution of both environmental and diversity, equity and inclusion aspects of our business. We're proud of the advancements we've made to further demonstrate our commitment to leading ESG practices. We are focused on maintaining this momentum as we execute our plan and deliver sustainable results in the years ahead.\nNow before handing it over to Kirk, I'll conclude by discussing some of our key regulatory and legislative priorities on Slide 8. In Kansas, we recently reached a nonunanimous stipulation and agreement with key interveners for the winter storm Uri costs from February 2021. The settlement calls for the roughly $120 million of deferred extraordinary fuel, purchase power and nonfuel costs at Kansas Central to be recovered through our fuel costs over a 2-year period beginning in April of next year. Similarly, the $37 million of net benefits of Kansas Metro will be returned to customers via the same method over a 1-year period, also beginning in April 2023.\nWe remain on track to file this summer, the annual update to our Kansas and Missouri integrated resource plans. We expect that the annual filing will be consistent with the resource plan that we laid out in last year's triennial IRP filing and the renewable development plan that Kirk discussed during our Investor Day last September.\nIn Missouri, we initiated the securitization process to recover the approximately $300 million of winter storm Uri cost in Missouri West. If approved, securitization will extend the recovery period for these costs over 15 years and thereby, significantly moderate the impacts on customers.\nIn terms of timing, we expect an order and the securitization proceeding in the fall of this year. And last month, we began flowing the approximately $25 million of net benefits from Uri back to Missouri Metro customers. This benefit will be shared over a 1-year period.\nI'll wrap up the slide with an update on our legislative efforts to enhance and extend the planned and service accounting law known as PISA in Missouri. The bill under consideration sets an annual revenue requirement cap at 2.5%, applicable only to PISA-related deferrals. Bill also includes a property tax tracker and extends the law through 2028 with the opportunity for extension through 2033 with commission approval. We are encouraged by the support the bill has received in both the Senate and House, and we'll continue to work with legislators and parties to secure passage over the next 10 days.\nWith respect to the pending Missouri rate case, we expect to receive intervenor direct testimony on June 8 related to revenue requirements and on June 22, relating to rate design aspects, with rebuttal testimony due mid-July and surrebuttal testimony due mid-August. A settlement conference is scheduled for August 22, with hearings later that month through early September. Revised rates in Missouri will go effective on December 2. We look forward to working with parties to constructively resolve the case.\nI will now turn the call over to Kirk.\n\nKirkland B. Andrews\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, NRG Energy, Inc.\n\nThanks, David, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the results for the quarter on Slide 10. For the first quarter of 2022, Evergy delivered adjusted earnings of $134 million or $0.58 per share, and that's compared to $125 million or $0.55 per share in the first quarter of 2021.\nFirst quarter adjusted EPS was driven by the following items, as shown on the chart from left to right: as expected, higher margin driven by our transmission investments drove a $0.05 increase; adjusted O&M expense was approximately $13 million lower or $0.04 per share due to reduced credit loss expense, lower transmission and distribution expense as well; $0.03 of higher depreciation and amortization expense due to increased infrastructure investment; and finally, we had a $0.03 of unfavorable income tax expense, which was an inter-year timing impact related to income tax smoothing, which will reverse throughout the year.\nI will also note, our first quarter adjusted EPS excludes a $0.05 loss on one of our Evergy ventures investments, which went public via SPAC in the fourth quarter of 2021. As you may recall, our fourth quarter 2021 EPS similarly excluded a larger mark-to-market gain associated with the same investment. On a cumulative basis, relative to our original investment, this results in a net gain of approximately $0.04.\nFinally, as David mentioned, given the solid first quarter results, combined with our outlook over the balance of this year, we're reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance range of $3.43 to $3.63 per share for 2022. And consistent with historical patterns, we expect our second quarter adjusted earnings to contribute approximately 20% of our total adjusted EPS for the full year.\nTurning to Slide 11, I'll provide a brief update on recent sales and customer trends. On the left-hand side of the slide, you'll see that overall, our weather-normalized retail sales for the quarter were up about 40 basis points, which drove a small positive variance in earnings, largely in line with expectations.\nDemand by subcategory, as expected, continues to reflect the reversal of the impact of COVID in the prior year as we return to more normal conditions with lower residential demand as fewer customers are working from home, while commercial and especially industrial demand trend higher. As summarized on the lower right of the slide, on the economic development front, Meta, formerly known as Facebook, chose the Kansas City region for a new $800 million data center, which is expected to bring over 1,400 construction jobs to the area. Additionally, Northeast Kansas was selected as the site for a new $650 million biomanufacturing facility, which is expected to add 500 jobs to our service territory.\nAnd finally, last month, Bombardier announced that Wichita, Kansas, the Air Capital of the world will be the new home of its U.S. headquarters and will bring along hundreds of new jobs to that region.\nAnd finally, on Slide 12, our focus remains on continuing to demonstrate a strong track record of execution. We reaffirmed our adjusted EPS guidance for 2022 as well as our long-term compounded annual EPS growth rate of 6% to 8% from 2021 to 2025 based on the midpoint of last year's original EPS guidance of $3.30. And we expect to return a meaningful portion of our earnings growth to our shareholders by maintaining our dividend payout ratio to keep that dividend growth in line with earnings.\nWe continue to invest in our infrastructure to improve affordability, enhance reliability and customer service, while advancing our sustainability and transitioning our generation fleet, as reflected in our $10.7 billion 5-year CapEx plan through 2026, which is consistent with the targeted rate base growth of 5% to 6% from 2021 to 2026.\nWith that, I'll hand the call back to David.\n\nDavid A. Campbell\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Evergy, Inc.\n\nWe would now welcome your questions."

(Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to hand the call over to Lori Wright, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead.\n\nLori A. Wright\n\nVP of Corporate Planning & IR and Treasurer, Evergy, Inc.\n\nThank you, Latif. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Evergy's fourth quarter call. Thank you for joining us this morning. Today's discussion will include forward-looking information. Slide 2 and the disclosure in our SEC filings contain a list of some of the factors that could cause future results to differ materially from our expectations and include additional information on our non-GAAP financial disclosures. The release was issued today, along with today's webcast slides and supplemental financial information for the quarter and full year are available on the main page of our website at investors.evergy.com.\nOn the call today, we have David Campbell, Evergy's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kirk Andrews, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. David will cover our 2021 highlights and overview of our recently filed Missouri rate cases, along with other regulatory and legislative priorities. Kirk will cover in more detail the fourth quarter and full year financial results, information on sales trends and provide an outlook of our 2022 objectives. Other members of our management are with us and will be available during the question-and-answer portion of the call.\nI will now turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid A. Campbell\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Evergy, Inc.\n\nThanks, Lori, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 5. This morning, we reported full year 2021 GAAP earnings of $3.83 per share compared to $2.72 per share in 2020. Adjusted earnings per share were $3.54 in 2021 compared to $3.10 in 2020. These results reflect strong execution relative to our objectives for the year. We entered 2021 with a midpoint guidance of $3.30 per share, in line with our 6% to 8% target growth rate range. We were able to deliver $3.54 per share, representing a 14% increase over 2020 and a 7% increase over our initial guidance midpoint. Kirk will discuss the drivers of this year's results as part of his remarks.\nA critical part of the company's 5-year sustainability transformation plan involves a comprehensive program to modernize our grid and invest in infrastructure. We advanced this capital plan in 2021, deploying $2.05 billion or $100 million higher than our Investor Day estimate to replace aging equipment and improve reliability, resiliency and security. We also maintain our focus on advancing affordability and regional rate competitiveness.\nSince 2017, we have delivered a 4.2% overall average rate reduction to our customers. At the same time, we have reduced our total operating and maintenance expenses by 18% since 2018, enabling us to pass on these cost savings in our upcoming Missouri and Kansas rate cases. In 2021, our total CO2 emissions were 46% below 2005 levels, reflecting strong progress relative to our long-term emissions reduction targets. And last but certainly not least, we continue to prioritize constructive interactions with our key regulatory and legislative stakeholders. In 2021, we wrapped up the STP dockets in both Missouri and Kansas and securitization legislation was enacted in both states. We expect that securitization will serve as a helpful tool in managing the company's ongoing fleet transition in the coming years.\nOn Slide 6, you'll see our recent earnings and dividend growth trends. As we've emphasized over the past year, consistent execution remains at the forefront of everything we do. The $3.53 midpoint of our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance tracks with a 7% compound annual growth rate from 2019, which was Evergy's first full year as a company. This is squarely in line with our targeted long-term annual earnings growth of 6% to 8%. Alongside the earnings, you'll see the attractive dividend growth that has tracked within our 60% to 70% dividend payout policy.\nI'd like to thank my fellow Evergy employees for their continued focus and teamwork in driving these results, overcoming the challenges of another unprecedented year, including extreme weather during Winter Storm Uri and the ongoing pandemic. We look forward to working together to further advance this track record of execution.\nAs noted on Slide 7, we've made significant progress on emissions reductions as we've transitioned our generation fleet over the last 1.5 decades. Since 2005, we've reduced carbon emissions by nearly half while reducing sulfur dioxide and NOx emissions by 98% and 88%, respectively. Our renewable energy portfolio is approaching 4.5 gigawatts, and we've responsibly retired nearly 2.5 gigawatts of fossil generation over the last 15 years. Our updated integrated resource plans, which were filed last spring, outlined our intention to add nearly 4 gigawatts of renewable generation and retire nearly 2 gigawatts of coal over the next decade.\nIn 2021, nearly half of the electricity we provided to customers came from [carbon free] resources, and we are on pace to reach our goal of 70% reduction in CO2 emissions from 2005 levels by 2030 with a long-term objective of net 0 carbon by 2045. Slide 8 summarizes our 5-year capital expenditure plan, which totals $10.7 billion from 2022 to '26. On a comparative basis, the current 2021 to '25 plan is in line with what we presented at our Investor Day last September, with some timing shifts reflected in higher base CapEx in 2021 and 2023 and slight reductions in the other years, netting to a roughly $100 million increase overall.\nWith the addition of 2026, the rolling 5-year capital expenditure plan is $235 million higher than the 2021 to '25 plan. The largest portion of our infrastructure investment is targeted towards transmission and distribution. The program is focused on replacing aging equipment and modernizing the grid, driving benefits to our customers by improving reliability, enhancing resiliency and the ability to withstand extreme weather, upgrading customer systems and the customer experience and increasing security. As we advance the use of smart grid technologies and transition towards a lower cost, lower emissions generation fleet, our investments will also enable us to reduce cost to serve customers, which helps to create a virtuous circle as we pass on these savings.\nSlide 9 summarizes our progress in driving cost savings and capturing efficiencies in how we work. Enabled by the 2018 merger and a comprehensive program across the business, we have reduced costs by $233 million or 18% since 2018. We're laser-focused on operational excellence as we leverage investments in technology to operate more effectively and efficiently. We're also building more and more flexibility into our generation operating model in the Southwest Power Pool market, which continues to see an increasing penetration of renewables generation. And we're not done as we are targeting a further 11% reduction in total O&M by 2025 as part of our 5-year plan. Thus far, we've been able to manage the impacts of inflation on our O&M costs, and we have developed plans to capture the vast majority of our targeted savings.\nThe back half of 2021 brought increasing pressures on fuel and purchase power costs as it's been seen across the country typically at higher levels elsewhere than what we've seen in our jurisdictions. And it appears that those trends may continue in the current macro environment and geopolitical context. Affordability and improving regional rate competitiveness are core elements of Evergy's strategy.\nAs shown on Slide 10, since 2017, Evergy has been able to reduce rates by an average of 4.2%, outpacing regional peers and at a level well below inflation. On the slide, we lay out how we've been able to deliver these savings across each of our 4 jurisdictions from 2017 to 2021. This topic remains at the forefront for our customers and stakeholders and going forward, maintaining affordable rates will continue to be featured as a priority objective in our 5-year plan.\nTurning to Slide 11. I'll give an update on our ongoing Missouri rate reviews which we filed in January. Starting on the left-hand side with Missouri Metro, we have requested a $44 million rate increase, including the base -- excuse me, excluding the rebate of fuel based on a 10% return on equity, a 51.2% common equity ratio and a projected $3.1 billion rate base as of the proposed May 31, 2022, crew update. The primary drivers of the rate request include our increased infrastructure investments which improve reliability, enhance customer service and enable the company's transition to cleaner energy resources, updated depreciation rates that better align with the estimated remaining (inaudible) assets and increased property taxes. These increases are significantly offset by roughly $55 million of lower annual operating costs savings that we are pleased to be able to pass on to customers.\nMoving on to Missouri West. We requested a $28 million rate increase, excluding the rebates of fuel and based on a 10% return on equity at 51.8% common equity ratio and a projected $2.5 billion rate base as of the proposed update. Missouri West rate request drivers are similar and include an increase from infrastructure investments, updated depreciation rates and increased property taxes, partially offset by ongoing customer savings and cost reductions of roughly $57 million per year. These savings effectively lowered the rate increase request by more than 60%. The Missouri West case also includes the handling of our previously retired Sibley power plant. We've been deferring the revenues associated with the foregone O&M resulting for the plant's retirement in 2018. As part of this case, we've offered to return these revenues back to customers over the next 4 years, which would reduce annual revenues by roughly $10 million but with no impact on earnings.\nTo summarize, we believe that the pending Missouri rate reviews are relatively typical and straightforward with 2 main elements: first, passing on the benefits of cost savings; and second, adding infrastructure and grid modernization investments that are consistent with and advance the objectives of Missouri policymakers and stakeholders. We're excited about the benefits that these investments will deliver to our Missouri customers.\nNow the procedural schedule is not yet final but on the bottom of Slide 11, you'll see our estimated time line from here. We expect staff and intervenor testimony will be filed in June, with rebuttal testimony in July, potential hearings in early September and finally, commission orders in November. If approved as filed, excluding fuel, the rate request would represent an increase of 5.2% from Missouri Metro customers and a 3.8% increase from Missouri West customers, both of which are well below the rate of inflation we've seen since our last rate cases.\nMoving to Slide 12, I'll provide an update on other regulatory and legislative priorities beginning with our predetermination docket in Kansas. As a reminder, last September, we initiated a proceeding to approve the elimination of coal at the Lawrence Energy Center retirement of Lawrence Unit 4 with recovery through securitization and the addition of 190 megawatts of solar generation in Kansas. Later in the year, last year, we filed a request to temporarily suspend the procedural schedule to allow time to develop more clarity on solar tariffs, the potential for tax incentives to improve customer economics, and the resolution of supply chain and customs issues that could impact pricing and availability. Given the lingering uncertainty around those issues rather than keeping this docket on hold, we have withdrawn the filing and plan to file a new application once definitive agreements are reached with the solar developer. The elements of the plan are unchanged, and we still expect to see predetermination approval for the cessation of coal, retirement of Lawrence 4 and the addition of 190 megawatts of solar. While this may impact the timing of the solar farm addition, it does not have a meaningful impact on our earnings expectations as the structure for the new solar farm was expected to contribute less than $0.01 to annual adjusted EPS in both 2024 and 2025. This is due to the market-based rate construct that was pursued in this case under which the earnings profile is tied to the time that Evergy can monetize the value of the ITC tax benefits of the project in the back half of this decade.\nIn parallel, we're in the process of evaluating competitive proposals for up to 1 gigawatt of new owned wind resources that would come online in the 2024 to '25 time frame. Kirk and his team are overseeing our renewables efforts, and he will highlight our priorities in his remarks. Other regulatory items include recovery of costs incurred during Winter Storm Uri.\nIn Missouri, we are awaiting commission approval of our request to defer approximately $300 million at Missouri West, with plans to securitize the costs and smooth the impact on customers over multiple years. We are also seeking approval to defer and return approximately $25 million of net benefits to Missouri Metro customers. We expect to reach resolution on the deferral request in the second or third quarter and a commission decision on the securitization of the Missouri West cost by the end of the year. In Kansas, last month, the KCC staff, filed its recommendation to approve our recovery plan of approximately $115 million of Uri costs in Kansas Central and the return of approximately $35 million of benefits in Kansas Metro.\nWe are working closely with all parties, and we expect to finalize the details of the path forward in the first half of this year. In 2021, we filed our integrated resource plans in Missouri and Kansas, providing an updated 20-year road map for our generation fleet transition in conjunction with our announcement of our long-term emissions reduction targets. We will file our annual update to the IRP in both states by July 1. I'll wrap up this slide with a legislative update focusing on Missouri. Bills have been introduced to extend and update legislation that was passed in 2018, widely referred to as plant and service accounting, or PISA. We've been utilizing this legislation since 2019, supporting our investments in grid modernization and improved reliability. We believe that the bill is good policy and enjoys wide support, but whether it ultimately advances this year will depend most likely on unrelated issues that may receive the bulk of legislative attention.\nWe are focused on working with key stakeholders to advance the PISA extension this spring, but given the provisions of the currently existing PISA legislation, this is an initiative that we would also be able to pursue next year. In addition, in Missouri, we are pursuing mechanisms to enable the efficient recovery of costs outside of our control, notably property taxes. Before handing it over to Kirk, I'll wrap up on Slide 13, which summarizes the Evergy value proposition.\nThe left side of the page covers the core tenets of our strategy to advance affordability, reliability and sustainability through a relentless focus on our customers, supported by stakeholder collaboration, sustainable investment and financial and operational excellence. The right-hand side of Slide 13 features what we believe are particularly attractive and distinctive features for Evergy given our business mix and geographic location. We are excited about the opportunities for our company, and we are committed to the sustained effort required to deliver against our high-performance objectives.\nI will now turn the call over to Kirk.\n\nKirkland B. Andrews\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, NRG Energy, Inc.\n\nThanks, David, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with results for the quarter on Slide 15. For the fourth quarter of 2021, Evergy delivered adjusted earnings of $37 million or $0.16 per share compared to $64 million or $0.28 per share in the fourth quarter of 2020. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was driven by the following items as shown on the chart from left to right. First, we had unseasonably warm weather across the end of the quarter, particularly in December, resulting in significantly fewer heating degree days as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 and driving $0.07 of unfavorable contribution from weather. When compared to normal weather assumed in our original plan, the mild weather negatively impacted our results by $0.10. The unfavorable weather was offset by a 4% increase in weather-normalized demand or approximately $0.08 per share. Relative to our expectations for the quarter, weather-normalized demand was approximately $0.04 favorable as we began to see demand recovery, which we previously forecasted to be delayed into 2022.\nStronger performance in our Evergy Ventures and power marketing businesses drove $0.03 of EPS versus the fourth quarter of 2020, which offset $0.03 of lower EPS from COLI, as we did not receive proceeds during the fourth quarter of 2021, while the prior fourth quarter included the majority of our COLI proceeds in 2020. Income tax-related items drove a net decrease of $0.04 per share. This was primarily due to the impact of the Kansas income tax rate exemption, which led to a lower tax shield in the fourth quarter as well as the expiry of certain tax credits in November of 2020.\nFinally, shown in the final 2 bars, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.09 lower due to the expected timing and phasing of certain cost items. $0.06 of this variance was due to the realization of higher O&M, including bad debt expense during the fourth quarter, resulting from timing shifts within the year. The remaining $0.03 as shown in the final bar was the result of pulling forward certain cost items from future years.\nOf note, our fourth quarter and adjusted EPS for the full year excludes the mark-to-market impact of one of our Evergy Ventures investments which went public during the quarter via a SPAC acquisition. We continue to expect to monetize this investment when the lockup restriction expires later this quarter and have elected to adjust the gains and losses related to investments, which are subject to a temporary sales restriction such as this one.\nI'll turn next to full year results, which you'll find on Slide 16. For 2021, adjusted earnings were $813 million or $3.54 per share compared to $716 million or $3.10 per share in 2020. As shown on the slide from left to right, the key drivers of this 14% year-over-year increase include the following: favorable weather, which benefited us through the first 3 quarters of the year, was partially offset by the warmer-than-normal fourth quarter and drove a $0.17 higher EPS in 2021 versus 2020. Weather was $0.08 favorable compared to normal weather assumed in our original 2021 plan.\nWeather-normalized demand increased about 1.6% and contributed $0.07 versus 2020. As expected, revenues from higher FERC transmission investment resulted in a $0.13 increase. Favorable income tax-related items of $0.07 were primarily driven by the impact of the Kansas income tax exemption and higher amortization of excess deferred income taxes, partially offset by lower tax credits. As shown in the next 3 gray bars, higher depreciation and increase in property taxes, lower year-over-year COLI proceeds and a slight year-over-year increase in share count combined led to a $0.12 year-over-year decrease. And finally, stronger year-over-year performance in Power Marketing and Evergy Ventures, partially offset by the pull forward of costs from future years I mentioned during my fourth quarter comments, combined to drive EPS $0.12 higher.\nWhile the net effect of these items help us drive our strong year-over-year results into 2021, we don't expect this outperformance to be recurring, and our guidance for 2022 reflects a more typical earnings contribution from these areas.\nTurning to Slide 17, I'll provide a brief update on the recent sales and customer trends. On the left-hand side of the slide, you'll see that partially aided by weather, our retail sales increased 3.1% in 2021, with all 3 sectors experiencing year-over-year increases led by a more robust increases in particular, in commercial and industrial. Looking to the right side of the slide, after adjusting out the effects of weather, retail sales increased 1.6% for the full year. The industrial sector, which is least weather-sensitive saw the largest increase, primarily driven by the oil and petrochemical industries. Commercial demand also increased nearly 3% year-over-year as both employees and customers return. Weather-normalized residential sales decreased in 2021 as some employees return to in-person office work. The overall 1.6% demand increase was below our original expectation of 2%, which assumed a more accelerated pace of return to pre-COVID conditions, in particular, in the commercial sector.\nUnderlying the continued growth in residential and commercial customers is a strong labor market. Highlighted by Kansas and Kansas City Metro, unemployment rates of 2.2% and 2.5%, respectively, beating the national unemployment rate of 3.7%. Manufacturing and logistics industries, in particular, have seen strong employment growth that continued to a solid economic recovery. Although as I mentioned last quarter, the Ford plant in our jurisdiction has been experiencing headwinds from chip shortages, the plant has begun to ship its all-new electric e-transit cargo van produced right here in Kansas City. Overall, we experienced a positive bounce back in the second year of the pandemic, and our economy is well positioned to continue the trend back towards prepandemic levels. As a result, we expect about a 1% increase in weather-normalized demand in 2022, which is part of the bridge to our reaffirmed 2022 adjusted EPS guidance of $3.43 to $3.63, which I'll review next on Slide 18.\nStarting on the left side of Slide 18 and beginning with 2021 adjusted EPS of $3.54, we removed the $0.08 impact of weather compared to normal from our 2021 results as well as the $0.12 impact from the outperformance of our power marketing and Evergy Ventures businesses, again, net of the cost that we pulled forward into 2021. Although we expect these businesses to continue to contribute earnings going forward, this adjustment is merely associated with the outperformance in 2021, leaving their expected contribution in our 2022 guidance.\nAfter adjusting for these items, the drivers to our 2022 guidance midpoint include $0.08 of increased retail demand. And overall, again, this represents about 1% increase in year-over-year weather-normalized demand. About half of this increase reflects the realization of more normal demand in 2022, which we had originally expected to occur in '21, and this shift is due to the observed delay in returning to a normal demand mix due to lingering COVID effects in the past year. The remaining portion reflects normal year-over-year load growth in 2022.\nWe expect approximately $0.09 of additional earnings from transmission revenue as we continue to make investments to improve transmission infrastructure. And finally, additional O&M savings and the expiry of merger-related bill credits contributed $0.06 and $0.04, respectively. And when combined, served to offset the impact of higher depreciation expense not yet reflected in rates, while other items, both positive and negative, drive the remaining $0.02 of the year-over-year increase.\nTurning next to Slide 19. Our strong results in 2021 reflect our ongoing focus on continuing to build a track record of consistent execution. We've reaffirmed our adjusted EPS guidance of $3.43 to $3.63 in 2022 as well as our long-term compounded annual EPS growth rate of 6% to 8% from 2021 to 2025, which is based on the midpoint of our original 2021 guidance. As David mentioned earlier, our updated 5-year CapEx plan from 2022 to 2026 totals $10.7 billion and is consistent with a targeted rate base growth of 5% to 6% from 2021 to 2026.\nThese financial targets enable us to achieve our overarching objective to improve affordability, enhance reliability and customer service while advancing our sustainability and transitioning our generation fleet. In order to realize these objectives over the multiyear plan, we are focused on achieving our key goals in 2022, which I'll summarize on Slide 20. Building on the positive momentum from our strong 2021 results that exceeded our original guidance, we remain focused on continuing to meet or exceed our financial targets, including our reaffirmed 2022 guidance range while driving operational efficiencies and maintaining our balance sheet strength. Over the last few years, we've worked hard to invest in our utilities to improve reliability and enhance customer service. Our successful efforts in driving efficiencies to reduce operating costs since the merger now allow us to pass approximately $110 million of annual savings back to our customers in Missouri to help offset a significant portion of the rate request, allowing us to deliver the benefits of those needed investments while keeping rates affordable for customers.\nThis year, we look forward to a constructive outcome in the Missouri rate cases as the next important step in achieving our objectives for the benefit of all stakeholders. On the renewables front, as David mentioned earlier, we've recently withdrawn our predetermination filing in Kansas, which included the addition of 190 megawatts of solar. We're actively working with the developer to resolve remaining issues to finalize the definitive agreement for this project and file a new application with the KCC later this year. Since our initial filing last fall, we've completed much of the documentation associated with the project. The only significant items, which remain relate to issues arising from global supply chain uncertainty and customs enforcement leading to importation delays.\nWe are focused on resolving these remaining issues while ensuring certainty of schedule and affordable cost for the benefit of our Kansas customers. And should the expansion of tax incentives for solar, including the PTC and Direct Pay ultimately see passage, this could serve to improve project economics for our customers as well.\nTurning to wind. In the fourth quarter of [2020], we launched a request for proposal process for up to 1 gigawatt of new wind in order to achieve our targeted 300 megawatts in 2024 and 500 megawatts in 2025. We saw robust participation and have since shortlisted our initial bids to a select group of projects, which when combined represent a multiple of our targeted 800 megawatts. The proposals received provide us the opportunity to select the projects that offer the best balance of risk and price for our customers. We are targeting completing due diligence and negotiating definitive agreements through mid-'22 with this notification to proceed on construction issued to developers in the first half of 2023.\nAnd finally, since we introduced the concept of potential PPA buy-ins on Investor Day, we've made progress in engaging with project owners and continue to believe that there is a path to make this opportunity a win-win-win for our customers, shareholders and counterparties. While we saw the viability of this strategy as being enhanced by potential federal renewable tax reform and the proposed refresh of the 100% PTC, we believe there is potential for this opportunity even if tax reform does not see passage. We're currently involved in active discussions with multiple counterparties with the objective of executing at least 1 buy-in this year. With that, I'll hand the call back to David.\n\nDavid A. Campbell\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Evergy, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kirk. So for those on the call, we appreciate your time today, and we'd like to open it up to questions."

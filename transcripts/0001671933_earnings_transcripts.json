Welcome to the Trade Desk Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn the conference over to your host, Chris Toth. You may begin.\n\nChris Toth\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Hello, and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today are CEO and Co-Founder, Jeff Green; and Chief Financial Officer, Alex Kayyal. A copy of our earnings press release is available on our website in the Investor Relations section at thetradedesk.com.\nPlease note that aside from historical information, today's discussion and our responses during the Q&A may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and reflect our views and assumptions as of the date such statements are made. Actual results may vary significantly, and we expressly disclaim any obligations to update these forward-looking statements made today. If any of our beliefs or assumptions prove incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements.\nFor a detailed discussion of risks, please refer to the risk factors mentioned in our press release, and our most recent SEC filings. In addition to our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures is available in our earnings press release. We believe that presenting these non-GAAP measures, alongside our GAAP results, offers a more comprehensive view of the company's operational performance.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to CEO and Co-Founder, Jeff Green. Jeff?\n\nJeffrey Terry Green\n\nFounder, President, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Trade Desk, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. As you have seen from our press release, we again posted strong growth in the third quarter. Revenue grew approximately 18% compared with Q3 of last year, and when excluding political spend compared to last year's Q3, our revenue grew by 22%. CTV remains our largest and fastest-growing channel, continuing to grow at a faster rate than our overall business. The shift to biddable CTV is accelerating, and we expect decision CTV will become the default buying model in the years ahead. .\nThe advantages of decision buying compared to traditional programmatic guaranteed or insertion order models are so significant in terms of flexibility, control and performance that the choice for advertisers is becoming increasingly obvious. Retail Media continues to scale rapidly as well, and we are seeing strong adoption across verticals as more shopper marketing budgets flow into programmatic and more retailers turn to us as their trusted partners.\nTo begin, let's take a step back and provide some context about the state of our industry. So far, 2025 has been a year of innovation and change for our industry and our company. The change in landscape has created amazing upgrades to our business and our industry. Compared to last year, our TAM has grown significantly, including expansion from CTV and AI chatbots and growth in premium content. The supply chain is much more efficient, and our products have been enhanced with AI across the board. The Trade Desk is adding more value than ever before.\nBut the changes of 2025 are much more interesting and significant when you consider how they will change the trajectory and opportunity for the open Internet for the next several years. A reminder, the open Internet is the portion of the Internet where price discovery and competition exists. On the open Internet, every transaction is arm's length, whilst Gardens are built around owned and operated inventory instead of third-party inventory. Price discovery comes when the buyer and seller are different entities. Of course, premium content is largely created by those who focus on content excellence. So the open Internet is where the most loved content and the most premium content lives.\nBecause the open Internet has continued to win more and more consumer time in places like premium TV, movies, music consumption in places like Spotify, live sports, and journalism, we continue to see a growing desire for the open Internet to get the first dollar of any media plan and also to get the lion's share of any media plan. Because advertising is about helping consumers feel something about product, service or an opportunity, using great video and audio ads are essential to most brand building, customer loyalty efforts and all performance efforts, including Performance TV.\nI contend that supply has always been greater than demand in digital advertising. And because it is so much easier to create more supply than it is to create a bigger marketing budget, the supply growth continues. This imbalance has grown steadily. And as a result, the market continues to strengthen for buyers. It's a buyer's market. All of this ripens the opportunity for The Trade Desk and the open Internet. In order for the open Internet to grow faster than closed ecosystems that are mostly filled with user-generated content and without price discovery, the efficiency of competitive supply chains and the benefits of competition in time must work for the market and not against it. This shift has happened in 2025.\nTo this end, AI is accelerating the improved effectiveness of the open Internet. Of course, every significant AI innovation and AI product needs quality data. The most valuable data to an advertiser is their own conversion and customer data. We will win long term because we built a business where buyers can own their future, which requires them to own, protect and use their own data. AI is fast tracking progress for companies that are eager to put their data to work and can leverage automation intelligently. Big brands are increasingly and rightfully leary of walled gardens as the AI-fueled future materializes.\nAdvertiser and agency data is more valuable in this AI world than ever. It is also less defensible in the hands of our big tech competitors who are written with conflict of interest and have insatiable appetite to own advertisers' data. AI is accelerating the path to the open Internet having vastly superior price discovery and fungibility. A world with better price discovery and better open Internet supply chains for the quality content will decrease the value of user-generated content destinations and other similar apps and sites that are full of ads and unsafe content.\nPremium content and deliberate data-driven targeted buying is the only way for the biggest brands and advertisers to remain competitive. Nearly every big tech player in advertising, Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, is primarily focused on expanding and monetizing their owned and operated inventory and content. Google is clearly focused on search, their AI chat by Gemini and YouTube. Amazon's primary advertising efforts are focused on growing sponsored listings and then secondarily on Prime video. Both are putting Amazon owned and operated inventory first.\nFacebook continues to focus on monetizing the Instagram and Facebook as destinations and TikTok the same, none of these companies are focused on monetizing the open Internet. This was helpfully made public throughout the antitrust trial of the Department of Justice versus Google. When they revealed numbers that Google normally does not report on exhibits and industry experts estimated that in 2019, the open Internet and owned and operated inventory on YouTube were equally split in share of wallet on DV360. However, between 2019 and today, roughly all of the incremental dollars and growth from DV360 has gone to YouTube.\nYouTube spend increased by about 800% while Google's buying of the open Internet stayed essentially flat for the same period of time. During that time, The Trade Desk seems to have surpassed Google in the amount bought on the open Internet, again, according to others. The industry is evolving at a rapid pace. However, no one is driving that change with more force or focus than The Trade Desk. With that backdrop, I want to focus today on 3 key areas of progress.\nFirst, let's walk through the foundational improvements and the upgrades we've made across the company over the last year. Since March, we've welcomed a new COO, a new CFO and a new CRO, who we just announced last week and began this week. Our COO, Vivet Kundra, has already driven operational progress and continues to improve our operations. Under his leadership, we've brought greater structure, discipline and clarity to how we operate. Streamlining our go-to-market organization, improving coordination across regions and teams and instilling stronger operating cadences that enhance accountability and performance. While we've always been data-driven in running campaigns and servicing our customers, we're building a more data-driven culture that emphasizes measurable outcomes for our employees and consistent execution.\nThese changes are helping us scale more predictably and efficiently while fostering the culture of ownership and operational excellence that will serve us well in the years ahead. Many of our largest clients are among the world's leading advertisers and they operate at global scale, often through multiple agencies. To manage this complexity, we have put new systems in place so we can execute account plans with thoroughness and rigor. This rigor helps every part of our business, from our engineers who can identify key innovation opportunities as they ship product every week all the way to our commercial services team who can help our clients take advantage of key opportunities as they emerge.\nLet me give you one example. One of the most influential data analytics companies in the world recently ran a competitive test between The Trade Desk and a major walled garden, which offered to run campaigns with 0 fees. But because we're objective, data-driven and focused on measurable outcomes, we won the opportunity securing about $20 million more in incremental spend through the end of 2025.\nLast year, we spoke about investing more resources to pursue closer relationships with the biggest brands. We've seen incredible results from this effort. JBPs continue to grow significantly faster than non-JBP accounts. Importantly, we've grown our relationships with top brands while simultaneously creating more growth and stickiness for the agencies. I'm confident that with Anders Mortenson coming to Board as our new Chief Revenue Officer, we will continue to improve effectiveness of our go-to-market organization.\nI'm thrilled that he's joined the team. In fact, this week, he's become the latest executive to join our ranks from the likes of Google, Amazon and Meta in recent quarters across all parts of our business. Anders will help us scale our sales effectiveness. At Google, he was 1 of 2 executives who ran their ad business from a sales perspective. Anders oversaw their mid-market ad business covering more than 5,000 advertisers and their agencies and successfully grew that business at a pace that significantly exceeded broad market growth.\nAnders will help us continue to grow within our established client base, and they will also help us expand to a broader range of advertisers and agencies around the world. The second area that I'd like to highlight is the innovation we're delivering in our platform. This year has really been the year of innovation for us. We've launched some of the most market-changing products that we ever have. And as you know, we have a track record of changing this industry with new product innovations. Prior to this year, over and over again, we've done things that people have told us we couldn't pull off. As a few examples, we weren't even one of the first 10 companies to get funding as a DSP, but we did it anyway. We lost bit factors, which proved to be a better system of targeting that was more expressive and enabled so many businesses to be built on our platform. That system also laid the foundation for an AI-powered platform.\nAlso, nearly a decade ago, we were the first to move the third-party data market usage to a percentage of spend. We created the largest cookie pool for the open Internet when our unified ID efforts were successful. Then Google changed the game with their war on cookies, and then we launched UID2. Now UID2 is the primary identity currency of ads for the open Internet around the world. It's ubiquitous. This is similar for things like global placement ID and transaction ID. These are metadata standards for the open Internet that have become standards because of our innovations and insistence. We've also enabled an entire ecosystem of innovation without our APIs and log level reporting, there are entire categories of companies that wouldn't be viable. None of the walled gardens enable businesses like this.\nIn 2018, we launched [indiscernible]. Our early focus on AI and machine learning has positioned us to upgrade our platform as the rise of AI tools has made upgrading our platform easier than any other DSP. At TTV, we are very focused, and we have a very clear North Star. This is a race to create the best performing ads and the best competitive supply chain, digital advertising has ever seen and thereby win the trust and investment of the biggest advertisers in the world.\nToday, nearly all of our clients have tried Kokai with nearly 85% using Kokai as their default experience. When we build a new iteration of our platform, our primary goal is to deliver more value to our customers by increasing their performance. By this standard, Kokai is the best upgrade we have ever made to our product. relative to all previous versions and certainly relative to Solimar. Campaigns that have switched to Kokai are seeing impressive results. Since its launch, Kokai delivered on average better cost per acquisition, 58% better cost per unique reach and a 94% better click-through rate compared to Solimar. These are incredible performance improvements on top of what was already considered the most performant DSP in the world.\nKokai has a number of features in it that are game changers for our clients and for the open Internet. We've used the industry's most advanced AI to enhance our system with an architecture we call distributed AI. We break down every function and create separate AI models for each of them from valuing impressions to managing identity to choosing supply paths to predicting a price required to clear and to forecast the performance and reach of a campaign before a single dollar is even spent. This effort to distribute allows us to parallelize all AI efforts and enables checks and balances between these disparate functions. It cannot be overstated how much AI has changed and will change our business and the open Internet.\nThis year, we've launched and grown several products that are solely focused on substantially upgrading supply chains so that buyers get more for their money. Open Path is an integration between TTD and a direct source of inventory. Openpath plugs into options we trust. It is a collection of clean types of connections that are directly into inventory. We have grown OpenPath by many hundreds of percentage points this year. which means our clients are getting clear views of exactly what they're buying and publishers have a clearer sense of what advertisers are willing to pay when they describe their inventory in a transparent and accurate way. OpenAP Ad is an auction that we develop and sometimes host as an option for publishers. We then bid into a fair auction and even enable other buyers or DSPs to do the same thing, too.\nThe market needs a healthy auction and some sell-side players have continually weakened the integrity of the option. So we're developing an open source option that raises that bar. We just launched it, and we're already working to integrate with more than 20 of the biggest publishers on the web. We expect this to dramatically improve the supply chains of mobile in-app ads and browser-based ads, which, of course, can use the help in an AI scraping world.\nPubdesk is improving the supply chain by publishing data for the sell side, resellers, sellers and publishers can log into the platform and see what we paid the supply chain, what signals we value and adjust their sites and inventory to get more. This is largely fueled by the Sensera team and data that we acquired earlier in the year. Deal desk is a better way to manage one-to-one deals. Not only does it facilitate the buy, but using AI, it predicts how a deal will perform relative to the open market. This product enables them to do deals, but also gives them the unprecedented data and tools to avoid bad deals. It is important to note that this product will be foundational to a healthy forward market that can replace the outdated upfronts.\nSo far, deals on deal desk are performing about 35% better than those running on Solimar, which is more similar to the way they run everywhere else in the programmatic ecosystem. Digital advertising supply far exceeds demand. It always has and frankly, it always will. That dynamic makes digital advertising a true buyer's market where advertisers have unprecedented choice. At the same time, because Google has historically made it almost impossible for most SSPs to do true yield management, many tech players on the sell side of advertising that sit between us and content owners have been incentivized to duplicate their ad inventory, obfuscate it or sometimes even misrepresented. As advertisers increasingly gravitate to the premium advertising opportunities that are consistent with their brand, they want better tools to be able to distinguish between premium ad environments and ensure that their ads are not being placed on recipe sites with 20 different ads popping up for competing users' attention.\nLooking against recipe sites, but I found recently that this example reminds people of how much room there is to actually creating better ad experiences. Key to this is the option a clean, credible option ensures that advertisers can understand exactly what they are buying and value it appropriately. Many of the largest premium publishers run their own actions, such as Disney with its draft platform. OpenPath connects directly into many of these premium publisher auctions. And companies like Disney do this because they want to ensure that their premium inventory can be correctly assessed and valued.\nA healthy auction is not an inherently sell side or buy side consideration. It sits in between as the referee between the buy side and the sell side. And in order to have a healthy marketplace both sides have to trust the auction. In order to establish that trust, we started with the open source version of the prebid auction. Then we innovated and made it better to ensure it contains some key elements such as transaction ID and a Sincera signature to better reduce duplication and detect opuscation by sellers. We will open source key elements of open ads, and we will expose its mechanics for review.\nJust like recent innovations such as UID2 or OpenPath, or Ventura, our intent here is to incentivize a more transparent competitive marketplace for all. In Q4, we announced 3 additional product features and upgrades that will be some of the most significant contributors to our growth for years to come. The first is the system upgrade and the other 2 are product launches. We have overhauled our data marketplace. We have reviewed the mechanics, incentives and market dynamics over our third-party marketplace and made significant upgrades. The result is a more competitive AI-driven marketplace with more data, more data segments and more reward for those who bring quality to the market.\nSecond, we're introducing trading modes. This is a bit like driving modes in a car where the user can decide how they would like to engage with the system, would they prefer to have control, where they have more decisions and a greater burden of work or would they prefer to simply optimize the performance and lean on the machine. In both cases, we're introducing Agentic AI as a copilot to ensure optimal campaign performance. But its role and engagement will differ based on the trading modes. This new feature will accelerate the adoption of the Agentic AI in our platform.\nAnd third, in Q4, we introduced a new product called Audience Unlimited. This enables our users to use third-party data for a single fee, and that single fee will make it easier for them to layer on much more data and improve the efficacy of their campaigns. The third area that I'd like to cover is the momentum we're seeing in our business as we close out 2025 and prepare for 2026. Since our last earnings call, I've spent much of the time on the road. I hosted 11 Trader town halls with programmatic traders at our top agencies and brands in various cities around the world. I've met with dozens of major client CMOs and many of the world's leading publishers. What is clear across all of these communities is the confidence that everyone has in the potential of the open internet.\nWe maintain that the independent and objective DSPs will have the majority of open Internet spend at end state Today, all of our biggest competitors are conflicted, so it is ours for the taking. There are so many places that we are seeing progress. Here are just a few of them. Our research shows that the average consumer now spends 2/3 of their digital time on the open Internet, even though most budgets today still go through Facebook, Google and TikTok. This imbalance will correct over time.\nOutside the U.S., our business is growing significantly faster than the United States. Given that 60% of the TAM is outside of the U.S., this movement is in the right direction of capturing the TAM. Audio has become 1 of the fastest-growing channels as consumers spend an average of 3 hours a day listening to their favorite music and podcasts. Bayer recently added Spotify to their omnichannel campaigns on Kokai and saw a 15% growth in their incremental reach. Adoption of Kokai is driving significant performance improvements for our clients. Specsavers in the U.K. saw a 43% reduction in the cost of securing customer appointments using Kokai while also cutting the conversion time by almost 50%. To announce our conversion rates go up by 1/3 for their Actimel yogurt product, leveraging the retail data marketplace and omnichannel strengths of Kokai.\nSpend under JVPs are growing significantly faster. Open Path has grown by many multiples in this year. Publishers like [indiscernible] are seeing a 4x improvement in ad fill rates and 23% revenue increase when integrating Open Path. We are seeing enthusiastic interest in Open ads. We just launched Open Ad and we already have 20 publishers committed to integrating. On the supply side, SSP such as PubMatic are integrating with Deal desk using the new price discovery provisioning an API that helps sellers better understand and identify how sellers can increase the quality of their inventory. The injection of AI into our supply path optimization is finding better paths to publishers with double-digit percentages of efficiency. To bring this to a close, I just want to reiterate that we are building our business for the long term. The upgrades we've made to our company over the past year put us in the best possible position to execute on the opportunities that are right in front of us today and continue to scale and lead the open Internet in the years ahead.\nI want to share a few of the principles that we've had for a very long time that continue to be critical to us continuing to lead the open Internet. First, we will always only represent the buy side of digital advertising. Everything we do that interacts with the supply side, such as Open Path and Open Ads is intended to drive better signal and a more transparent marketplace for our advertiser and agency clients. But we are hopeful that they also drive efficiencies that benefit the entire ecosystem.\nSecond, the digital advertising market will inevitably bend towards efficiency. Every market does over time. It's just a question of how fast we get there. There are still some in our industry who will say things like why shouldn't I be allowed to duplicate or [indiscernible] aspects of what I'm selling? Over time though, the survivors and the thrivers will be those who figure out how to win and a fair fight. We will always be advocating and advancing a fair price wherever we can.\nAnd last, the open Internet offers compelling value in contrast to walled gardens. The open Internet is where most consumers spend most of their time. It is where they engage with the Internet's most premium content. Advertising on the open Internet is not the same as advertising in a walled garden. On the open Internet, an advertiser gets to select ad impressions across all opportunities, with objectivity and efficacy. It's not possible in a walled garden or using a walled garden DSP. For most marketers, these are 2 very different value propositions.\nThe work we do in any of these areas is not easy, let alone all of them, but that's our mission. We know that transparency, objectivity and innovation drive performance for us. But more than that, we know they are essential for our clients, and we're just getting started. I've never been more excited about the road ahead. And with that, I'll hand it over to Alex to walk you through the financials.\n\nAlex Kayyal\n\nCFO & Director\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm honored to be speaking to you as our CFO. It's been an incredible few months working closely with our leadership team and a world-class finance organization. I have even more confidence in our business today with the outstanding team that we have in place, and I'm grateful that they have made my transition so smooth. When I first met The Trade Desk 13 years ago, the company was generating less than $10 million in annual revenue. Over that time, I've been grateful to serve our Board of Directors over 2 distinct periods. As I reflect on the journey over all those years, what strikes me most is how much opportunity still lies ahead, which is exactly why it chose to step into this role.\nMy priorities as CFO are clear. helped grow the Trade Desk share of the $1 trillion advertising TAM as more dollars shifted programmatic, identify and prioritize the right investments to expand our leadership position, convert that growth into durable long-term free cash flow through disciplined operating leverage. And lastly, insurer business remains tightly aligned with agencies and advertisers over the long term. I am bringing a growth mindset to my role as CFO here. Our focus on profitable growth means that we can invest to ensure we are always innovating and delivering premium value to our clients.\nAs our TAM expands and given the AI opportunity, I am working with our team to take a fresh look at every aspect of the business so we can make the right investments and further accelerate our flywheel. That includes evaluating how innovation investments fuel growth, how we go to market, how we structure incentives in the organization and how our products and features are being adopted and creating value. We are already leading the way here with all the product innovations we've announced in the last quarter.\nThe Trade Desk is uniquely positioned with a large and growing addressable market, a differentiated market position, anchored and objectivity for advertisers, strong secular tailwinds, the best technology [indiscernible] tech and the business model built to deliver highly profitable growth. I believe the power of the open Internet combined with the foundational improvements the company has made throughout 2025, across leadership, operations and engineering has strengthened our position for the long term.\nAcross the company, and as you've heard from Jeff, we see significant opportunities to drive outsized growth, and we are committed to doubling down in those areas. With that, let's go through the numbers. In Q3, we delivered revenue of $739 million representing 18% year-over-year growth. Excluding political spend related to last year's U.S. elections, revenue increased approximately 22% year-over-year. Our strong performance in Q3 reflects our continued capture of incremental advertiser wallet share among large global brands during this period.\nWith the strong top line performance in Q3, The Trade Desk generated approximately $317 million in adjusted EBITDA or about 43% of revenue. CTV has been consistently growing at a faster rate than the overall business which was the case again in the third quarter. Video, which includes CTV represented around 50% of our business in Q3 and continues to grow as a percentage of our channel mix. Mobile represented a low 30 percentage share of the business during the quarter, while display represented a low double-digit share in audio represented around 5%.\nOver time, I expect CTV and audio will grow as a percentage of mix, fueled by the premium authenticated nature of these channels. With supply significantly outstripping demand in our industry, our clients can be very deliberate in which ad impressions they select, which means those authenticated audiences become more attractive, especially in an objective buying platform like The Trade Desk. Geographically, North America represented 87% of our business in Q3 and international represented about 13%. Our strong momentum in both EMEA and APAC is a reflection of the investments we have made in these regions over the last several years. Our growth across our international business continues to outpace our growth in North America.\nAmong verticals that represent at least 1% of our business, we saw particularly strong growth in medical health, automotive and the technology sector. We have been making a concerted effort to continue to diversify our business across a larger number of verticals and we are seeing major client wins in verticals such as insurance, financial services and telco, for example. Q3 operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, were $457 million, up 17% from a year ago.\nDuring the quarter, we continued to make investments in our team and platform, particularly in areas like platform operations. Income tax expense was $64 million in the third quarter, driven primarily by our profitability and stock-based awards. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $221 million or $0.45 per diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $225 million, and free cash flow was $155 million in Q3. DSOs exiting the quarter were 92 days, up 3 days from a year ago. DPOs were 77 days, up 3 days from a year ago. We ended the quarter with a strong cash and liquidity position. Our balance sheet had about $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. We had no debt on the balance sheet.\nIn Q3, we used $310 million of cash to repurchase our Class A common stock via our share repurchase program. Going back to our first authorization in 2023, the company has repurchased nearly $2 billion through our repurchase program, effectively offsetting dilution and reducing shares outstanding over that time. In October, we deployed the remaining amount from our January authorization and the Board of Directors subsequently approved a new authorization of $500 million. We have a strong balance sheet, and we'll continue to evaluate opportunistic repurchases as part of our capital allocation strategy.\nFor Q4, we expect revenue to be at least $840 million. Excluding the benefit of U.S. political ad spend in Q4 of 2024, our estimated growth in Q4 of this year would be approximately 18.5% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA for Q4 to be approximately $375 million. As we look toward 2026, we remain well positioned to grow our share of the advertising TAM, generate significant profitability and cash flow and deepen the value we're delivering to advertisers. The Trade Desk sits squarely at the forefront of CTV transformation, a powerful application of AI, the expansion of retail media and the proliferation of programmatic buying internationally.\nWith these structural growth drivers and our focus on operational rigor at scale, we believe we've never been better positioned to capture the massive opportunity ahead across the open Internet and advertising more broadly. I look forward to engaging more with our customers, partners and our shareholders in the months and years ahead. I'm also more confident than ever that we have the right team in place to capitalize on this moment.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions."

Welcome to The Trade Desk Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call.\n[Operator Instructions]\nPlease note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Chris Toth. You may begin.\n\nChris Toth\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Hello, and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today are CEO and Co-founder, Jeff Green; and Chief Financial Officer, Laura Schenkein.\nA copy of our earnings press release is available on our website in the Investor Relations section at thetradedesk.com. Please note that the aside from historical information, today's discussion and our responses during the Q&A may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and reflect our views and assumptions as of the date such statements are made. Actual results may vary significantly, and we expressly disclaim any obligations to update the forward-looking statements made today. If any of our beliefs or assumptions prove incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements.\nFor a detailed discussion of risks, including the most recent economic volatility caused by tariffs, please refer to the risk factors mentioned in our press release and our most recent SEC filings. In addition to our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures is available in our earnings press release. We believe that presenting these non-GAAP measures, alongside our GAAP results offers a more comprehensive view of the company's operational performance.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to CEO and Co-Founder, Jeff Green. Jeff?\n\nJeffrey Terry Green\n\nFounder, President, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Trade Desk, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today.\nAs you've seen from our press release, we again posted strong growth in the second quarter. Our revenue grew about 19% compared with Q2 last year, and we continue to outpace the digital advertising market, driven by the innovation and value we deliver to our clients every day. CTV continues to be our fastest-growing channel with no signs of slowing down. Partners like Disney, NBCU, Walmart, Roku, LG, Netflix and many others are deepening their relationships with us around the growing decision programmatic opportunity in CTV, which delivers the most effective and highest return on ad spend compared to insertion order or programmatic guaranteed buying.\nI could not be more excited about our position in CTV and the size of the growth opportunity for us in the years ahead. With our leadership in CTV as well as other areas such as retail media, digital audio, identity, measurement, and data, we are winning more business with both new and existing customers. We are signing more multiyear JBPs, or joint business plans, than ever before with leading agencies and brands. In fact, the number of live JBPs is at an all-time high, and we continue to see spend under JBPs significantly outpace the rest of our business. What's even more encouraging is the strength of our JBP pipeline with nearly 100 JBPs in progress, many of them in the late stages of development. And while many of our JBPs are signed directly with brands, we are working hand-in-hand with their agencies almost in every case to bring these partnerships to life. It is not an either/or.\nI want to start by giving you an update on our business, but I also want to take the time to describe our vision and where we're heading. We see clearly what is on the horizon for our space, and we're convinced we're the best positioned company in ad tech to accelerate our growth in 2026, but it is important we share the opportunity we see because we think aligning our vision and efforts with our team, our clients, our partners and our investors will maximize our ability to capture the unprecedented and unique opportunity in front of us.\nSo first, an update on the business. There are several key areas of progress to highlight here. First, we are delivering on Kokai, our most significant platform upgrade to date and one that represents a new frontier in digital advertising trading. Kokai gives advertisers unprecedented power to drive precision and relevance in everything they do, all powered by the industry's most advanced AI technology, Koa. We have injected AI into so many parts of the system, the clients that have adopted Kokai have seen tremendous performance improvements. Samsung was able to drive a 43% improvement in reaching its target audience for an omnichannel campaign in Europe.\nCash Rewards saw a 73% improvement in cost per acquisition for campaigns in Asia using Kokai. In the aggregate, we are seeing more than a 20-point improvement across key KPIs and for campaigns running in Kokai. What's even more encouraging is the clients who have transitioned the majority of their spend on Kokai are increasing their overall spend on The Trade Desk by more than 20% faster than those who have not. This is precisely what we believed was possible when we launched Kokai. Advertisers are getting meaningfully better returns on their ad dollars and they are doubling down on the open Internet and on us as a result. Around 3/4 of all client spend is now running through Kokai, and we expect all of our clients to be using Kokai by the end of this year.\nSecond, we are trying to create the most efficient supply chain possible for digital advertising, and we are seeing great progress with OpenPath. OpenPath allows publishers to directly integrate with The Trade Desk if they choose to and it enables publishers to see more clearly how much our clients are willing to pay for their ad impressions, and it gives our clients a direct line of sight into what they are buying. And today, a material amount of spend on our platform is now flowing through OpenPath, and it is doing exactly what we expected. OpenPath is both a canary in the coal mine and a stocking horse. We don't expect 100% of spend to flow through OpenPath, but we do expect it to one way or another, make the supply chain better and more efficient. And the benefits have been exceptional, not just for our clients, but for the publishers, too. By providing our clients with clearer signal, they have more confidence in what they're buying and they're typically willing to buy more.\nWe have a long-standing partnership with News Corp, for example, and the New York Post has been one of the pioneers of OpenPath, and they've seen a 97% boost in their programmatic display revenue as a result. Also in the journalism field, Hearst newspapers have adopted OpenPath, and has seen a 4x improvement in their fill rate since deploying it. As Amanda Gomez, SVP of Revenue Operations and Ad Technology at the New York Post said, and I quote, \"The New York Post is always driving for ways to simplify our connection to advertisers to help fill our ad spots more efficiently and transparently. We partnered with The Trade Desk to test OpenPath to help achieve this goal with great success over the past year, ultimately helping to fuel programmatic revenue growth.\"\nOpenPath is not an attempt by The Trade Desk to get into the supply side of digital advertising. We're not getting into the yield management business. Our clients are exclusively the buyers. OpenPath is simply an effort to improve the quality of the supply chain for everyone in the ecosystem. Key to our supply chain work is our Sincera acquisition earlier this year. We have already made a tremendous amount of supply chain data available to the ecosystem for free via OpenSincera. There, anyone can log in and see the quality of advertising on thousands of publisher sites. Since launching OpenSincera just a few weeks ago, we've already had many publishers contact us to say they didn't realize some of the quality dynamics of the ad experience on their own destinations, and they are improving those ad experiences as a result. But as important as OpenSensera is, I'm even more excited to embed the full scope of Sincera data across our platform as one of the most important metadata sources, and signals for the way that we value individual impressions and work on behalf of the buyers.\nFor instance, we might see the same ad impression from hundreds of supply paths. We don't want to burden our clients with figuring out which one is best, and it is not efficient to manage that challenge by defaulting to deals. Instead, Kokai does that work for our clients, leveraging AI and data from sources like Sincera, so advertisers can obsess about buying the right impression rather than the delivery mechanism.\nBut I do want to talk about deals for a second. One additional innovation that will help accelerate our supply chain work is Deal Desk. It is one of the major final pieces of Kokai, and it is in beta now. Deal Desk leverages AI, especially AI forecasting to reshape how we think about deals between advertisers and publishers and intermediaries such as SSPs. It helps advertisers and publishers understand how deals are performing, how they are pacing, whether the right impressions are being delivered and so on, but perhaps just as important when deals are underperforming, Deal Desk will help those deals get back on track, and it will showcase open market and premium Internet alternatives.\nWe are seeing very strong appetite for Deal Desk across both advertisers and publishers. Everyone recognize the limitation of deals and wants innovation that can help improve them. Disney is one of the first publishers to lean into Deal Desk. Jamie Power at The Walt Disney Company, has said, several times over the past couple of years that they intend to shift 75% of their ad revenue to biddable programmatic by 2027. I'm thrilled that our innovation will help them achieve this goal. And she said when talking about Deal Desk, and I quote, \"As more buyers shift toward biddable activation, we're focused on ensuring they have the tools, access and flexibility they need to drive results. Our relationship with The Trade Desk reflects our commitment to meeting advertisers where they are and evolving how we transact to deliver greater efficiency and performance.\"\nThe third area I'd like to focus on is work we've been doing to advance objectivity in everything we do and across the ad tech ecosystem. If the DuPont antitrust trial taught us one thing, it's that big tech walled garden advertising platforms have a vested interest in guiding spend to their owned and operated media. So what Google, it's YouTube; with Amazon, its Prime Video. And of course, they can make it seem really cheap from a platform perspective because they make up that cost and much more on the other side of the transaction, because they own the media. But if you want to reach your audience with objectivity and with no thumb on the scale across the best of the Internet, you are more likely to come to The Trade Desk.\nWe are seeing more and more clients understand the importance of objectivity and the power of the premium open internet to reach their target audience as precisely and cost efficiently as possible. Live sports is a great case study. It's where advertisers get to act with precision and objectivity in reaching their audience where they are most engaged. A few years ago, just after the pandemic, I was on an industry panel in New York City, where many of my peers on stage made the argument that live sports would be the linchpin that keeps viewers on linear TV for years to come. I think many of you may have even been at that event. If you fast forward through the impact of a global pandemic, now all live sports are available via streaming TV and represent one of the most valuable pillars of the open internet. And we continue to innovate with our partners to bring the full value of live sports to our clients.\nOne of the promises of live sports in a biddable CTV environment is that advertisers can target key moments like over time in an NBA game or the PKs at the end of a [ softer ] game. When the audience has most leaned in, well, now we will be offering this capability with new tooling in Kokai and partnerships with companies such as Disney, Sky TV and Omnicom, which we announced at Cann a few weeks ago.\nAnother major pillar of objectivity on the open internet is the ability to measure business outcomes of marketing campaigns with Precision. Kokai already has the industry's most advanced retail media marketplace. But we've recently launched expanded partnerships with leaders such as Instacart and Ocado to provide even more granular data on actual consumer purchases, so advertisers can measure with even greater precision. Again, objectivity is a major factor here. Unlike others in the market, our goal is to drive the use of retail data across as many advertiser campaigns as possible. We do not compete with retailers and only an independent objective partner like us can truly help advertisers unlock this opportunity. In Q2, a record amount of spend was influenced by retail data both on our platform and on the Walmart DSP as more shopper marketing budgets flow into programmatic.\nAnd fourth, I'd just like to reiterate that underpinning all of our success this year is a strong focus on operational rigor. This includes strengthening our leadership team. As you know, Vivek Kundra, joined us as our COO in March. I'm also pleased to announce here that Alex Kayyal will be joining as our new CFO. You may know Alex as he's on our Board, but his relationship with this company spans over a decade, initially as an early investor in 2014. He's also been a leader in the digital space for more than 2 decades. I'm thrilled that he's agreed to join our leadership team as I believe there are a few in our industry who have Alex's experience and strategic mindset in finance in a way that [ ascends ] and drives growth for the organization. This shift has been made possible by Laura working with Alex to facilitate this transition. She will remain in the seat until August 21st and then stay on the team through the end of the year.\nI have worked with Laura for more than a decade, and I have nothing but tremendous respect and admiration for her work and her expertise. We wouldn't be here without her contribution to this point. Laura's contribution and passion will live in The Trade Desk for the entire future of its existence. I love that we joined the S&P 500 during her last full quarter, what a milestone and what a note to end on. We are also enhancing the Board of Directors, and I couldn't be more excited to announce that Omar Tawakol, will also be joining the Board. Over the years, Omar has been one of the real innovators in AdTech, whether it was founding BlueKai in 2007 or more recently founding Rembrand, one of the leaders in creative AI in advertising. I look forward to his innovators vision as a part of our Board work.\nIn addition to strengthening our leadership team, we have improved the structure and clarity of our go-to-market organization, particularly in how our media traders, account management and business development teams work together. This ensures that our clients experience the full power of our platform with clear roles and responsibilities across our teams.\nLastly, I think this is a unique and important moment to remind our investors, our clients, our partners and the rest of our industry about our mission, our vision and our collective opportunity. Global advertising is a trillion-dollar industry today, and that TAM is all up for grabs. Additionally, AI is changing everything and creating new opportunities. Quality AI requires quality data and to trust AI-driven buying long term requires objectivity. A black box that just sells owned and operated media will struggle far beyond what ad networks have struggled with for decades. Our vision is to define clearly the category of DSP. Access is not at the core of our value proposition, simply getting access to inventory. Database decisioning and measurement is at the core of our offering. Some have mistakenly thought our ambitions are about display. Some have mistakenly thought our ambitions were only about CTV or branding budgets. Our goal is to buy the entire open internet objectively for buyers, big and small. We've started with the biggest, and we serve them well. We think we've done the best job in the history of ad tech of aligning our interest with buyers. This enables them to trust us with their data.\nAnd on that topic, one of the biggest flaws with walled gardens is that they measure their own performance. We believe it is in the best interest of every retailer, including Amazon, to have the measurement of the open Internet based on something more auditable, more independent and more transparent than what happens today. We partnered already with hundreds of retailers around the world to measure in this more objective way. Our retail partnerships play a very significant role in making it so that the premium open internet gets the first dollar of budget and not the last dollar.\nThere are a tremendous number of inefficiencies in the open internet supply chains for both media and data and we have big plans to change those. AI is currently changing the world. It is also changing the world of advertising and media buying. There are so many specific tasks where AI can massively level up the status quo. What is an impression work to a specific brand? What is the price that this auction is likely to clear up? What is the best supply chain to maximize transparency and minimize unnecessary costs. These applications of AI are already in our product. Koa is what powers Kokai's forecasting, which is predicting the reach and performance of a campaign before a single dollar is spent. Distributed AI is foundational in Kokai, and this is only the beginning. There are many tasks where agents can improve performance in part because they're always on. As you consider the power of AI in these specific applications, you can see how winning the trust of buyers is so critical. It is a buyer's market.\nAnd as a result, premium inventory matters more than ever. Again, our value-add isn't that we merely have access to the best of the Internet, which is what we refer to as the big 5. These big 5 are the best of TV, the best of movies, the best of music, the best of journalism and the best of sports. Currently, consumers spend most of their time on these big 5, but most of the money goes to search and social. It is our aim to make the open Internet, the lion's share of spend and the highest efficacy ad spend in digital.\nAs I've said for over a decade, the lines between brand and performance are artificial and will go away over time. Everything is performance, but some performance is optimized for awareness and top of the funnel outcomes and others are pointed at the bottom of the funnel outcomes. Nevertheless, everything that can be quantified will be and most spend will be pointed at outcomes.\nBefore I wrap up, I want to take a moment to speak to the proposed extension of our dual-class share structure, which was included in our most recent proxy filing. There will be plenty of opportunities to engage in more detail in the weeks ahead. But I think it's important to provide some perspective now on why the Board is making this recommendation. From the day that Trade Desk was founded, we believe that long-term thinking is our greatest advantage. The vision that we described is a long-term North Star that we think about in nearly every major decision we make. Dual class helps maintain that long-term North Star orientation.\nWhen we went public in 2016, we chose a dual-class structure because we knew building something transformative, something that could truly redefine the open internet would require conviction, patients and freedom from the short-term pressures that weigh on public companies or are the one-size-fits-all approach, often promoted by some governance analysts and major proxy advisory firms. Our belief has proven correct. Since then, we've grown from below a $1 billion market cap to about $40 billion today and included in the S&P 500. And we've helped shape the future of identity with UID2, built leadership in CTV and Retail Media expanded globally and invested in innovations like Kokai, Sincera and our TV operating system, all of which require decisions that didn't pay off in a quarter or even a year, but instead positioned us to lead for years to come. We're now at another inflection point. The digital advertising landscape is evolving rapidly with ongoing regulatory scrutiny of walled gardens, the rise of AI and growing demand for transparency and independence.\nWe believe the next decade will be pivotal in determining the winners and losers in our space and that staying true to our long-term vision is more important now than ever. This proposed extension isn't about entrenchment. It's about ensuring that the founder-led strategy that got us here can continue to guide us forward. We deeply value the trust our shareholders have placed in us, and we remain committed to earn unit every day and for the long term.\nLet me wrap up by bringing some of these points together. We continue to earn a growing share of the total advertising pie. That momentum is a direct result of the innovation and execution we're delivering week in and week out and the value our clients consistently realized by working with us. About 3/4 of our spend is using the Kokai platform. It is the best platform we have ever shipped, and we are confident it will buy better than every other platform pointed at the open internet. We have always prioritized helping brands find their target audience with precision and relevance across the breadth of the open internet. The Trade Desk empowers brands with the tools to control and own their own future. We do that by prioritizing objectivity in everything we do and with a relentless focus on driving a clean, transparent and competitive marketplace. I believe it's these principles and the performance they ultimately drive that attract major brands to our platform. And it's our dedication to those principles that's keeping them here.\nAll of this positions The Trade Desk to lead through what we believe will be another defining period of growth. We are building right now for this next chapter, not just for this year but for the long-term future of the open internet. AI is yet another force separating the great platforms from the weak ones. We've proven time and again that our alignment with advertisers, our focus on innovation and our commitment to transparency and objectivity sets us apart and with the upgrades we've made across our company, our platform and our partnership, I'm more confident than ever that The Trade Desk will continue to capture more than our fair share of this growing market.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Laura to walk through the financials.\n\nLaura Anne Martin\n\nSenior Analyst, Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division\n\nThank you, Jeff, for the kind words, and good afternoon, everyone. I've been at The Trade Desk since 2014, and I'm proud of what we've accomplished together from our early days as a start-up to going public to joining the S&P 500. It's been an honor to work alongside and as part of the leadership team. There were and are so many talented people across this company. I've also truly valued the relationships and conversations I've had with many of you in the investment community over the years.\nAs I transition to a new challenge, I leave knowing the company is in a strong position for the future. Our finance and accounting teams are as capable and energized as ever, and I'm committed to supporting a smooth transition for Alex as he steps into the CFO role. I met Alex in 2014 when [indiscernible] was one of the company's earliest investors. He is respected and I have confidence in him as he takes on this new role.\nWith that, let's move on to our results. We delivered a strong second quarter with revenue of $694 million, representing 19% year-over-year growth. Excluding political spend related to the U.S. elections last year, revenue increased around 20% year-over-year. During the quarter, we continued to build momentum across our key growth areas as advertisers increasingly value the efficiency and measurable results of their media investments. Growth was particularly strong within CTV and Retail Media fueled by the continued shift into decision channels for buying TV and the rapid adoption of retail media across verticals and regions.\nWith over 70% of spend now on Kokai, we continue to see strong results from the new platform. We look forward to completing the Kokai transition and continuing to innovate on behalf of the industry and our clients. With the strong top line performance in Q2, we generated approximately $271 million in adjusted EBITDA or about 39% of revenue. From a scale channel perspective, CTV led our growth again during the quarter. In Q2, video, which includes CTV, represented a high 40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a mid-30s percentage share of spend during the quarter, while display represented a low double-digit share and audio represented around 5%. Geographically, North America represented about 86% of spend, and international represented about 14% of spend for the quarter. We're pleased that international growth once again outpaced North America as we continue to execute our growth playbook globally, led by CTV.\nWe remain optimistic that our business outside North America will continue to be a strong contributor to our overall growth throughout the remainder of this year and in the years to come. In terms of verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, we saw double-digit growth in the majority of our verticals with particularly strong growth in technology and computing and medical health. Home & Garden and Style & Fashion were below average. We continue to see significant opportunities for us to gain share in all of the verticals we serve.\nTurning now to expenses. Q2 operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, were $448 million, up 23% from a year ago. During the quarter, we continued to make investments in our team and platform, particularly in areas like platform operations as the AI and machine learning tools embedded in Kokai continue to drive greater campaign performance. Income tax expense was $43 million in the second quarter, driven primarily by our profitability and stock-based awards. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $203 million or $0.41 per diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $165 million and free cash flow was $117 million in Q2. DSOs exiting the quarter were 91 days, up 1 day from a year ago. DPOs were 77 days, up 2 days from a year ago. We ended the quarter with a strong cash and liquidity position. Our balance sheet had about $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter.\nIn Q2, we used $261 million of cash to repurchase our Class A common stock via our share repurchase program. Given our strong balance sheet and consistent cash flow generation, we plan to continue opportunistic share repurchases while also offsetting dilution from employee stock issuances.\nTurning to our outlook. Assuming the macro environment remains stable and we don't see disruptions from large global brands, which make up a significant portion of our business due to tariff uncertainty, we expect Q3 revenue to be at least $717 million, reflecting 14% year-over-year growth. Excluding the benefit of U.S. political ad spend in Q3 of 2024, our estimated growth rate in Q3 of this year would be approximately 18% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA for Q3 to be approximately $277 million.\nIn closing, we are pleased with our strong performance in Q2 and throughout the first half of the year. The opportunity ahead has never been more compelling. We're operating in a large and expanding market supported by a business model that consistently delivers strong top line growth, solid profitability and healthy cash flow. I remain confident and optimistic as we look to the second half of this year and beyond.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions."

Welcome to The Trade Desk Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn the conference over to your host, Chris Toth, you may begin.\n\nChris Toth\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator.

Jeff?\n\nJeffrey Terry Green\n\nFounder, President, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Trade Desk, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. 2024 was a record-breaking year for The Trade Desk. Total spend on our platform exceeded $12 billion, the highest in our history.\nRevenue for the year surpassed $2.4 billion, growing nearly 26% year-over-year as we continued to significantly outpace the broader digital advertising market. We generated over $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA and delivered more than $600 million in free cash flow. These accomplishments underscore both the strength of our platform and our ability to drive value for our clients in the fast-evolving digital advertising landscape.\nWhile we're proud of these milestones, I want to acknowledge upfront that for the first time in 33 quarters as a public company, we fell short of our own expectations. During COVID, we revised our expectations once along with the rest of the markets, but for the first time in 8 years, we missed the expectations we set, and it was our fault.\nWhen we were first contemplating going public about 10 years ago, many people advised me not to IPO. The most common reason was the valuations would be too low, because no adtech company had ever won Wall Street's trust and confidence for any reasonable period of time. I view that as a challenge then and I still do now. I knew we had the business model, the TAM, the vision, the grit and the people to break that mold to do something that had never been done before. And the only way to do that was to make promises and keep them.\nMany people told us it couldn't be done. Our success to this point has been fueled at least in part by our ability to win trust with investors, partners, our industry and our customers. There are very few things that rival that, an importance to us. I want you to know that we take this moment seriously, and we want to assure our investors, partners and customers that their trust is well placed and deserved. Our brightest days are still ahead of us.\nBut before I talk about that, I want to spend a few minutes sharing what we got wrong and the changes we are making to meet this moment and maximize our unique and growing opportunity. Starting off, let me explain it as I see it. What falling short of our own expectations does not represent. This didn't happen because the opportunity isn't as big as we thought. In this case, it isn't because of our competition either. For Q4, the reality is that we stumbled due to a series of small execution missteps, while simultaneously preparing for the future. If this were a sporting event, we'd still have a championship caliber team. But in this particular game, we turned over the ball too many times. That said, we see a larger and faster-growing market than we originally expected which is why we have been making changes and will continue to do so.\nSimply put, as you've seen before, as companies grow and become increasingly complex, they need recalibration to unlock new opportunities. We are recalibrating our larger company for an even stronger future. In that effort, I want to highlight 4 major changes we've made at The Trade Desk in the last few months and some related initiatives that accompany them.\nFirst, we did the largest reorganization in company history in December. While we often make structural changes at the end of the year to improve our business, this was bigger than usual. For most people in the company, we provided a much clearer view of their roles and responsibilities and for most, that also meant a change in reporting structure. Additionally, we streamlined client-facing teams, reducing complexity and clarifying responsibilities, some team focus on brands, while others focus on agencies. Our commitment to agencies remain strong, but we are also expanding brand direct relationships, particularly through joint business plans, which grow 50% faster than the rest of our business.\nThe second, beyond structural improvements, we placed a stronger emphasis on internal effectiveness and scalability. Over the past 2 months, leadership has spent more time discussing operational improvements than at any other point in our history. While we've historically been focused on external opportunities, we understand that this moment requires us to scale our internal operations and continue hiring senior talent to support long-term growth. These changes position us to execute at a higher level and capitalize on the expanding market opportunities ahead.\nThird, we have increased our resource allocation on brands. A broader shift is occurring in the industry. Advertisers are becoming more strategic and data-driven in their media buying decisions, and that's great for us. While this shift has caused short-term fluctuations, it's ultimately aligned with our long-term strength. We recognize that advertising will ebb and flow.\nAt the same time, as advertisers prioritize precision and efficacy, our programmatic data-driven platform is becoming more essential than ever to brands and agencies. This is evident in the growing number of joint business plans, or JBPs, that we've secured with over 100 of the world's leading brands, many of them in the second half of last year. JBPs provide a structured mutually beneficial framework for brands, their agencies and The Trade Desk and they reinforce the long-term value we bring to the industry. They also historically grow faster than the rest of our business.\nFourth, we revamped our product development process, shifting back to smaller agile teams that release updates weekly instead of drifting towards waterfall methods, which are less conducive to our fast-paced and changing industry. Our engineering team is now divided into nearly 100 scrum teams with a system to more easily ship and collaborate with the business team on what has shipped and what will ship and when. I expect this to continue to accelerate Kokai enhancements and complete the transition of 100% of our clients from Solimar to Kokai during this calendar year.\nIn Q4, there were a series of decisions we could have made to enhance the short-term performance of the company and neglect the long term. We consistently choose to focus on the long-term opportunity and maximize our market share over the long term as I believe this is in the best interest of all of our stakeholders. We are keeping our focus on the massive TAM and long-term opportunity. That makes this a good opportunity to bring up 2 other important and related initiatives.\nFirst, we continue to improve and protect the supply chain. First, we announced the Ventura operating system for connected television, which will create a better supply chain for all OEMs, content owners, consumers and advertisers. Secondly, we announced in January the acquisition of Sincera. Sincera is a metadata company that is dedicated to improving the supply chain of the open Internet. Joining Sincera's work with ours will accelerate a cleaner supply chain for the open Internet and accelerate the work of OpenPath, which is one of our biggest efficiency efforts, both internally and externally. A better supply chain will free up resources internally and improve the ecosystem.\nThe second major accompanying initiative I want to talk about are the investments we're making in AI. Of course, AI is providing next-level performance in targeting and optimization, but it is also particularly game-changing in forecasting and identity and measurement. We continue to look at our technology stack and ask, where can we inject AI and enhance our product and client outcomes. Over and over again, we are finding new opportunities to make AI investments.\nThese changes have helped us start 2025 on solid footing. Not only is our platform the most advanced data-driven decision-making platform in our industry, the ramping of Kokai is advancing the ability of advertisers to find value and precision as they expand their audiences and grow their businesses.\nIn last quarter's earnings report, we itemized 10 macro conditions that are working in our favor. Today, I want to briefly highlight 15 big things we're doing to benefit from those secular tailwinds. Last time we talked about trends, today, I want to talk about what we're doing about it. First, we're focused on scale. More accurately, we're obsessing about scale. We control $12 billion of ad spend in an approximately $1 trillion advertising industry. With every success we have and with every efficiency we find, operationally and technologically, we follow it with a question, how can we make that scale quickly? While our share is growing faster than perhaps any scaled competitor, our opportunity is growing too. We can accelerate growth when we sufficiently orient around scale.\nSecond thing, we are preparing for a world where Google exits the open Internet. I'm confident that one way or another, Google will exit the open Internet. I think they should. Most of their antitrust and regulatory problems come from the draconian ways they have engaged with the open Internet in the past.\nIn April of 2024, Facebook shut down their news program thereby distancing itself further from one of the most important pillars of the open Internet. Some evidence suggests the substantial majority of spend going through DV360, Google's DSP, and is routed to the Google owned and operated platform of YouTube. Regardless of what happens with the pending trial decision, Google will likely distance itself from the open Internet. If and when Google exits the open Internet, they will leave a big hole and a big opportunity for the rest of us.\nRelatedly, let's move to number 3. Third, we will promote and protect our objectivity more than ever. More and more, the only competitors we encounter today have the worst objectivity problems. Amazon is asking advertisers big and small, for their advertising budgets. Meanwhile, Amazon competes with most of the Fortune 500 companies in some way, whether we're talking about Microsoft in cloud or PNG and CPG products or UPS or Nike or all the rest, in our very first business plan 15 years ago, we argued that the objective independent DSP should get the lion's share of the marketplace. They'd be the only company that can be trusted. We have a mantra that we've repeated again and again internally for years, and it's this. Every day that goes by, objectivity matters more and more.\nThe fourth thing we'll do, leverage the supply and demand imbalance to make the ecosystem better. In advertising, there is more supply than demand. There always has been and there always will be. This, by definition, makes it a buyer's market. By focusing exclusively on the buy side, we are in the strongest position in the market. Unlike so many players attack, we are not using our position of strength to become draconian we are trying to use our ever-growing influence and impact on the industry to make it better and to improve the supply chain.\nThis is why we expect 2025 to be the year OpenPath enters the steep acceleration phase of its S-curve growth. This is because many of the major CTV players around the world are aggressively implementing OpenPath now. They understand that a more efficient supply chain means more money in their pockets. I would argue that higher CPMs through more efficient supply chains are the only way most of the streamers will get to sustainable and scaling profitability.\nTo this end, Disney was among the first of the CTV scale players early last year to embrace OpenPath when they deployed it as part of Disney's Real-time Ad Exchange, or Drax. As Disney's SVP of addressable advertising said recently, they are working towards 75% of their ad sales being automated by 2027, with the vast majority of those impressions being biddable. Media leaders like Disney realized that the best way to fund their incredible content is through biddable programmatic advertising, which, of course, is great news for us and our partnership. And the best way to help advertisers value impressions and show publishers what they're willing to pay is an open market. And it is through a clear supply chain with tools such as OpenPath, that, that can be realized.\nThis also extends to the OEMs. Another CTV leader that has embraced OpenPath is VIZIO, which has more than 24 million active devices in the United States and more than 300 ad-supported CTV channels. VIZIO wanted clear line of sight into advertiser demand with as few intermediaries as possible. They deployed OpenPath and immediately saw impressive results, including 39% improvement in revenue from our platform and an 8x improvement in fill rate.\nRelatedly, Goodway Group is one of our largest independent agency clients. They've been working in Kokai to create a blue list which is a custom market that they can curate using our tools on our platform to provide their customers to the best opportunities in the market as they see it. With their blue list in Kokai, Goodway was able to prioritize impressions with better, clearer signal around factors such as genre, show title and content quality.\nIn addition, they were able to measure the number of supply chain hops in those transactions. They found that 94% of the impressions they bought had only one supply chain hub, which is well ahead of the industry benchmarks. All of this means that more campaign dollars can now be put to work more effectively in driving incremental reach.\nThese examples provide great background for the pending acquisition of Sincera, which we announced a few weeks ago, I don't think there's any other company in the ad tech ecosystem that thinks about the digital advertising supply chain as passionately as Sincera, except perhaps The Trade Desk. Over the past few years, Sincera has established itself as an objective data company for the entire ad ecosystem, all with a mission of shining a much clearer light on where the value is, where value is being obscured and what signals advertisers value the most in making effective decisions. For us, embedding those data signals into our platform will help encourage the right behaviors that leads to the best outcomes for our clients.\nFor example, one of the most compelling use cases is showing in our platform, which signals advertisers want publishers to provide so they can value ad impressions as accurately as possible. Using these data signals to improve the supply chain for digital advertising could not be more important as we head into 2025. And of course, that's even more important as Google likely becomes less involved with the open Internet.\nThe fifth action we'll take make CTV the most effective channel and programmatic advertising by layering more data, better auction mechanics and capitalizing on the fact that CTV is the only channel that has nearly 100% of traffic logged in. CTV is the kingpin of the open Internet. CTV should be the first place all brand advertiser spend, not walled gardens. If we expand Sincera's charter and capabilities to CTV and audio, CTV and premium video can reach its potential as a channel. It can be half the pie of the advertising TAM. So many companies like Disney, Netflix, Paramount, MAX, Fox and Peacock need to get the best out of programmatic advertising in order to maximize their opportunity.\nIn order to do that, almost all of the streaming leaders have deployed UID2 as a way of providing advertisers with precision and addressability. This has laid the foundation for them and us to continue the expansion of CTV advertising around the world. CTV continues to be our fastest-growing channel. And as you know, it is also our largest channel. However, neither us nor any content owner thinks the status quo is anywhere close to what end state looks like.\nThe sixth thing we'll do, make 2025 the best year audio has seen yet. I maintain that audio is still the most on-sale corner of the open Internet. Companies like Spotify have been making changes to embrace the potential of programmatic advertising. They're making changes and we're using AI partnerships to bridge the creative creation gap. I think this is one of the biggest opportunities in programmatic and one of the biggest opportunities for a company like Spotify to take their company to the next level.\nThe seventh action item will move 100% of our clients to Kokai this year. Now the majority already have. But today, we're maintaining 2 systems, Solimar and Kokai. This slows us down. Kokai is more effective in almost every way. We are producing case study after case study as clients continue to lean into the features of our Kokai platform. Every one of them showing the enhancements and effectiveness that goes up with the use of Kokai. As you know, Kokai represents our largest and most important platform overhaul ever. Some clients are still transitioning from our previous platform, Solimar, but well before the end of this year, I expect that all of our clients will be using Kokai exclusively.\nIn all of the case studies coming out of Kokai, the consistent theme is accessing and acting on better data and signal. In CTV, advertisers act on authenticated logged-in user data rooted in UID2. The same is also happening in digital audio, where companies such as Spotify, SiriusXM, Pandora and iHeartMedia have all recently embraced UID2 so that advertisers can act with precision on their logged-in audiences. And with retail data, advertisers can understand conversion rates and the impact of every ad dollar more clearly.\nEight, we will change the way the industry manages deals. We'll help advertisers and agencies avoid bad deals, which generally consider too few ad impressions and force advertisers to buy impressions that they wouldn't otherwise want, and we can avoid these bad deals by using AI-powered forecasting. To do this, we are enhancing Kokai with some of the most game-changing parts, like Deal Manager, which lays groundwork for the forward market, which we think in the future will change the ecosystem and eventually upgrade the upfronts.\nNinth, we will continue to invest in AI with provable upgrades and auditable results. We started our ML and AI efforts in 2017 with the launch of Koa, but today, the opportunities are much bigger. We're asking every scrum inside of our company to look for opportunities to inject AI into our platform. Hundreds of enhancements recently shipped and coming in 2025 would not be possible without AI. We must keep the pedal to the metal, not to chest them on stages, which everyone else seems to be doing, but instead to produce results and win share.\nTenth, we will simplify our retail offering in 2025. So far, it's been powerful and a significant driver of our growth, but it has often been too complicated. We've studied what works and understand the changes needed to help retail media continue to meaningfully outpace our business. Achieving this will require a closer collaboration with our retail partners. In Kokai, we have the industry's richest retail data environment, including data for many of the world's leading retailers to help advertisers understand the connection between campaign spend and consumer action. We will make this easier to adopt for our clients, both endemic and non-endemic to our retail partners.\nConsider the fact that our objectivity may be our greatest asset in this corner of our business as well where retailers are reluctant to partner with walled gardens who are competing with them. While, of course, our objectivity as well as our clear mission, which makes it easy for them to know how we will partner and what our motives are, makes it easy for us together to create the greatest environment of retail data for advertisers on the open Internet.\nWe had some great case studies in Q4 around the world. Boiron, a world leader in homeopathic products was able to measure a 267% return on ad spend, or ROAS, on Kokai when using Kroger retail conversion data. This was well ahead of their typical benchmarks. In addition, of the almost 2 million households that their recent campaign reached on our platform, 94% of them were new to the brand.\nIn Hong Kong, high-end skin care brand, Sulwhasoo, leveraged UID2 in Kokai to look-alike model prospective new audiences based on their most loyal customers. In doing so, they were able to engage with those prospects across the customer journey at all steps of the marketing funnel across a range of digital channels. As a result of this campaign approach, they were able to measure a 6x improvement in physical store visits, a 380% improvement in conversion rates and an 80% lower cost per acquisition.\nNumber 11, we will simplify our platform. As platforms mature, they add features, but that can make it more complex. We will continue to add features and powerful controls for the most sophisticated buyers in the world. However, we're finding ways to improve the experience and make decisions easier and also more intuitive for our users.\nTwelfth, we'll use more data. We have another mantra. Data-driven buying is better than guessing. Across all parts of our platform, we're using AI to help clients make better decisions, whether it is in making sense of complex data in real time when it may have previously taken weeks or bringing retail conversion data to bear more often and enriching bid requests.\nThirteenth, as I said at the beginning, we will focus on joint business partnerships or JBPs. JBPs are joint innovation partnerships where agencies and brands collaborate with us to grow our relationship and drive programmatic innovation. They grow about 50% faster than the rest of our business. Brands will generally continue to work with agencies, but they also understand that programmatic is becoming a larger and more important element of their campaign planning. As a result, programmatic decision-making is happening at a higher and higher level within brands, and this presents a tremendous opportunity for The Trade Desk to grow our brand relationships and share.\nNumber 14, on our action item list. We have already revised and will continue to revise our product process. As we grow, it is essential that our product development process remains agile. Even as it has to ingest more inputs for more stakeholders. We'll do this with a clear focus on what we're delivering week by week, which continues to be at the bleeding edge of adtech innovation.\nAnd then lastly, number 15, we'll hire senior leadership to take us to the next level. I believe that over the next few years, we will double the number of senior leaders in the company at the VP level and above, especially, including some very key senior level appointments in [ my org ]. This is a natural part of a high-growth company's journey. We want to scale The Trade Desk significantly in the years ahead. and that means ensuring we have the right kind of leadership rigor across the company while preserving the best elements of what we've done so well so far.\nTo wrap up, the opportunity is bigger than ever. We need to keep evolving our company structure to meet that opportunity and realize our potential and the potential of the open Internet. We are obsessing about ways to drive differentiation and growth. We are constantly innovating our platform in order to do that, most recently with constant upgrades to Kokai. We are able to make these investments because of the profitability of our business model. That focus on constant innovation ensures that we are always prioritizing value for our clients and never standing still. We will always have a long-term view of where the value in our industry is shifting and how we can then innovate to deliver that value to our clients as rapidly as possible.\nI believe 2024 will be remembered as a pivotal year for our industry, where the premium open Internet was beginning to transform as the clear choice for advertisers seeking data-driven precision and performance. But we've only just turned the corner on this shift, and it is why we are adjusting the company to be bigger and move the market in positive ways.\nI am not happy with our results in the fourth quarter, but there is so much opportunity in 2025 and the years ahead to help our clients take full advantage of data-driven advertising on the premium Internet to drive growth and brand loyalty for their businesses. And that's why I'm confident that Trade Desk will eventually resume acceleration and continue the path we've been on for over 33 quarters as a publicly-traded company. We are also the clear leader in the DSP race and perhaps the leader of the open Internet.\nThank you. And with that, I'll hand it over to Laura to discuss our financials.\n\nLaura Schenkein\n\nExecutive Vice President of Financial Planning & Analysis\n\nThank you, Jeff. Before discussing our results, I want to expand on Jeff's sentiments about some of the significant strides we made over the past year, positioning us well for the future.\n2024 was a year of landmark partnerships, particularly in CTV, where we saw outsized growth. Retail media continued its rapid expansion, establishing a material foundation for the years ahead. International growth accelerated, showing promising momentum beyond the U.S. Additionally, 2024 marked our largest and most successful year ever for political ad spend, the biggest year for UID2 since its launch 4 years ago, and a leap forward for digital audio and programmatic.\nWhen I look across our list of growth drivers, most of them are still in their early stages compared to where we expect them to be in the next 5 to 10 years. CTV advertising remains a small fraction of total TV ad spend relative to linear. Retail media is scaling rapidly, evolving from an emerging trend into a core digital advertising channel as brands are recognizing its ability to drive both performance and measurement. And in most global markets, decision programmatic is still in early stages of adoption with tremendous long-term growth potential.\nTurning to our results. Q4 revenue was $741 million, a 22% year-over-year increase. We generated $350 million of adjusted EBITDA during the quarter, representing a 47% margin. However, for the first time in our 8.5 years as a public company, excluding the first quarter of 2020, our results came in below our expectations. As a company, we take great pride in our ability to forecast accurately, and we take full ownership of the shortfall. Importantly, this miss was not due to a lack of opportunity or increased competition. It was on us. We are implementing the strategic changes Jeff outlined in our business, and I believe that will give us an opportunity to continue delivering strong revenue growth throughout this year and beyond.\nFor 2024, we ended the year with $12 billion in spend on our platform and $2.4 billion in revenue, representing a 26% increase in revenue year-over-year. Full year adjusted EBITDA margin was above 41% and full year free cash flow was over $630 million.\nAs expected, our take rate in 2024 once again remained within a very consistent historical range. The shift of advertising dollars to CTV continues to be a core driver of our business. From a scale channel perspective in Q4, video, which includes CTV, represented a high 40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a mid-30s percentage share of spend during the quarter. Display represented a low double-digit share of our business and audio represented around 5%.\nGeographically, North America represented about 88% of spend, and international represented about 12% of spend for the fourth quarter. International growth again outpaced North America for the eighth quarter in a row. CTV growth across international regions was particularly strong during the fourth quarter and throughout 2024.\nIn terms of verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, growth was broad-based again this quarter. We saw strong performance in the majority of our verticals, particularly in automotive, shopping and technology and computing. Political spending was also strong in Q4 as expected. Home & Garden and pets were both below average. We continue to believe there is significant opportunity for us to gain share in all of the verticals we serve.\nTurning now to expenses. Q4 operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, were [ $416 million ], up 23% from a year ago. During the quarter, we continued to make investments in our team and platform. particularly in areas like sales and marketing and technology and development as we position the organization for long-term growth. Income tax expense was $39 million in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by our profitability and stock-based awards.\nAdjusted net income for the quarter was $297 million or $0.59 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $199 million and free cash flow was $177 million in Q4. DSOs exiting the quarter were 97 days, down 4 days from a year ago. DPOs were 80 days, down 3 days from a year ago.\nWe ended the year with a strong cash and liquidity position. Our balance sheet had about $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. We have no debt on the balance sheet.\nIn Q4, we repurchased $57 million of our Class A common stock via our share repurchase program. As you saw in our press release, we announced an additional authorization under our share repurchase program, bringing the total to $1 billion, inclusive of the amount remaining from the existing authorization. Given our strong balance sheet and consistent cash flow generation, we plan to continue opportunistic share repurchases while also offsetting dilution from employee stock issuances.\nNow turning to our outlook for the first quarter. We expect revenue to be at least $575 million, reflecting 17% year-over-year growth. Our Q1 growth estimates also reflect the impact of lapping the extra day from the 2024 leap year as well as political ad spend, which contributed approximately 1% of our Q1 2024 revenue. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $145 million in Q1.\nTurning to our expense outlook for the year. While we are not providing a full year expense guidance, we anticipate a modest increase in the growth rate of our operating expenses in 2025 compared to previous years. As a result, we would expect modest deleverage for the year. Our investments are focused on key areas such as infrastructure and talent. Our incremental investments align with the recalibration efforts Jeff outlined in his remarks.\nOur capital intensity remains low, and we expect CapEx to be approximately 5% of our total revenue. We expect another strong year of cash flow generation. We continue to manage the business with a balanced perspective that allows us to weigh investment opportunities while retaining flexibility for margin improvement.\nIn closing, while the back half of 2024 did not end exactly as we had hoped, our long-term trajectory remains strong. I'm optimistic about 2025. We continue to lead in a rapidly growing industry, delivering profitable growth and gaining significant market share. Our momentum is fueled by a strong set of growth drivers, including ongoing secular shift to CTV, enhanced measurement through retail data, international expansion, a robust identity framework, supply chain improvements and the ability to drive long-term leverage in our model.\nAs we look ahead, we remain confident in our ability to sustain this growth and capitalize on the opportunities before us. While we are not providing a full year 2025 revenue outlook, we expect that our recalibration efforts and strategic investments will position us for continued strong growth throughout 2025 and beyond. That concludes our prepared remarks.\nAnd with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions."

Welcome to The Trade Desk Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to Chris Toth, you may begin.\n\nChris Toth\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Hello, and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today are Founder and CEO, Jeff Green; and Chief Financial Officer, Laura Schenkein. A copy of our earnings press release is available on our website in the Investor Relations section at thetradedesk.com.\nPlease note that aside from historical information, today's discussion and our responses during the Q&A may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and reflect our views and assumptions as of the date such statements are made. Actual results may vary significantly, and we expressly disclaim any obligation to update the forward-looking statements made today. If any of our beliefs or assumptions prove incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements.\nFor a detailed discussion of risks, please refer to the risk factors mentioned in our press release and our most recent SEC filings. In addition to our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures is available in our earnings press release. We believe that presenting these non-GAAP measures, alongside our GAAP results offer a comprehensive view of the company's operational performance.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\n\nJeffrey Terry Green\n\nFounder, President, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Trade Desk, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris, and thank you to everyone for joining the call. As you've seen from the press release, we delivered very strong growth once again in the second quarter. Revenue was up 26% to $585 million. Our growth rate significantly outpaced the rest of the digital marketing industry just as it has every quarter for the last few years.\nI'm convinced that our success has been forged on the back of consistent strong 20%-plus revenue growth year after year for the past several years. By comparison, our ad-funded peers have gone through periods of much lower growth and even stagnation, in some cases. That means we are consistently gaining market share quarter after quarter and year after year. And I firmly believe that's because we continue to bring the best innovation and best value to the market. And perhaps more important, I believe that we will continue to outpace the market in the years to come, led by areas such as Connected TV, which are only getting stronger.\nIn fact, one of the most bullish things happening in advertising today are evident in our performance. Through the first half of this year, CTV growth has accelerated versus the first half of last year. Before I get into the core of my remarks, let me make a macro observation about the marketing and advertising industry. I've recently been meeting with many CMOs from the world's leading brands around the world, including at the recent Cannes Lions Festival in France.\nThrough all of these meetings, one thing has become very clear to me. These leaders are dealing with a lot of uncertainty. They are looking for answers and they are looking for partners who can help them. The pandemic was the nucleus of a great deal of change for them. The pandemic has been followed by several years of economic uncertainty whether it's inflation or dramatic changes in fiscal and monetary policies around the world where supply shortages or unpredictable consumer demand.\nOne top CMO talks about the difficulty of what he described as the \"illusion of growth\" where it appears that companies are doing well, stock prices are up, but the average consumer feels more constrained than ever in terms of purchasing power. That has significant implications on how companies market products from pricing to packaging to advertising. And perhaps more than anything else, it's putting a premium on the efficacy of marketing.\nMore than ever, CMOs have to prove that what they are doing is working. And increasingly, that means revising traditional dependencies on cheap reach and all the legacy mechanisms and beliefs that support cheap reach. It means embracing the power of programmatic data-driven advertising. We are convinced that the only scaled response to all the changes CMOs and the agencies are facing is to embrace data-driven buying.\nTo get a healthy and competitive global economy, all roads require scaled programmatic advertising, and that bodes well for the long-term prospects of this company, The Trade Desk. As a result of these trends, our relationships with the world's leading brands and their agencies are only getting stronger. It's one of the key reasons we continue to significantly outperform the market and why I believe we'll continue to gain share in the years ahead.\nI'd like to spend the bulk of my time unpacking this a little, because, I think, for most leading CMOs, there's a growing bifurcation in the market. It's being driven by efficacy of new channels such as CTV, by the emergence of new conversion data such as retail data, by a growing focus on premium inventory, and by rapid advances in the innovation of our industry.\nLet me start with this point around efficacy. I often talk about how we compete against walled gardens, and to give them due credit, it's very easy for companies to work with big tech walled gardens. They offer easy on-ramps to massive scale in terms of ad impressions with the promise of easy mass reach. And of course, for the most part, they also control the scorecard. So it's very easy for walled gardens to take credit for things like last touch attribution or last-click attribution, while in the process, disintermediating a brand and their customer and giving little or no credit to the rest of the marketing funnel.\nFor many marketers dealing with macro uncertainty over the last few years, this cheap reach solution has been attractive. But more and more CMOs, especially those at the world's leading brands, have become concerned with the flaws in this strategy for a number of reasons. A few of those. First, much of the mass scale is predicated on cheap, owned and operated content, which is often just user-generated videos or social content that is essentially free to produce and ultimately mostly lower quality and higher risk for large advertisers.\nThe big tech owners of this content have an inherent incentive to direct demand to work because the margins on it are so significant. But it's often not where the marketers' target customers spend most of their time nor where they're the most leaned in.\nSecond, after several years of uncertainty, the business flaws of cheap reach are more apparent than ever. If a CMO has been going to the CEO or CFO and saying, \"Look, I was able to drive down costs, and the scorecard says it's working.\" But then a couple of years later down the road, business results are not consistent with those marketing metrics. And as a result, there's a disconnect.\nThis is arguably one of the main reasons that CMOs have the shortest tenure on the C-suite, marketing performance data predicated on cheap reach that doesn't match up with the business outcomes over time. And last, leading CMOs at large brands have been leaning into alternatives to this cheap reach that offer much greater efficacy, and by extension, a much closer correlation to business performance.\nAt the center of this is the revolution in TV advertising, driven by the mass shift to streaming TV where advertisers get to target based on authenticated logged-in users. And building on that is the emergence and availability of new kinds of marketing conversion data such as retail data, where advertisers can understand the impact of campaign spend on actual customer outcomes much more clearly.\nTake HP. They recently came to us to test the efficacy of CTV advertising using UID2. Buying on Disney+ and Hulu on our platform, they were able to drive a 23% reduction in cost per unique household reach, with much greater precision and frequency management.\nAs HP's North America Head of programmatic, Caitlin Nardi said, and I quote, \"Using the Trade Desk UID2 solution with our first-party data helped us increase our unique audience reach, boost our cost efficacy and improve how we measure conversions and sales.\" That's a really great affirmation of the case for the efficacy of CTV, in part because of the embrace of UID2 by most of the major streaming companies.\nBut layer in new data elements such as retail conversion data, and the story gets even stronger. [ Rothman ] is one of the largest retailers in Germany. It's something like CVS in the United States. They work with us to drive demand for one of their diaper ranges. Using CTV, they were able to drive 170% incremental reach improvement. In addition to that, they were able to understand with precision that every 1,000 impressions served resulted in 20 actual sales. That's a very impressive return on ad spend.\nThey were also able to see the impact of using their own first-party data. When they use that data as they're targeting seed, every dollar was between 3 to 4x more likely to drive a sale. When you compare these kinds of efficacy results to the murkiness of cheap reach, it's easy to understand why CMOs are increasingly looking to unlock the power of programmatic on the open premium Internet.\nLet me touch on this point too, the open premium Internet. Since we last spoke, we put out a report, the Sellers and Publishers Report. The report kicked off more discussion in our industry than anything we'd ever put out there, and I encourage you to download it if you haven't already. The level of industry discussion actually surprised me, in part because I think the report highlighted many of the trends we've been talking about for some time, in particular, where value is shifting on the Internet.\nOne of the trends that, that report showcases is the massive shift over the last 4 years in terms of where consumers are spending their digital time. It used to be that consumers spend about 60% of their time within walled gardens and 40% on the open Internet. That trend has completely reversed since the pandemic. Why? Well, in large part, it's because of the mass consumer shift to emerging premium open Internet channels such as CTV and digital audio.\nIn the U.S., over the last decade or so, consumers have doubled the time they spend in these 2 channels alone to around 5 hours per day, significantly more than they spend on social media. Companies like Spotify, Netflix, Disney, Warner Bros, Discovery and others have fundamentally changed the way that consumers behave. I would also add that the time that consumers spend in these channels is much more leaned in and engaged than the time spent on channels such as social media. You're much more lean in when watching the latest hit show or the Olympics or listening to your favorite podcast than you are watching endless short videos of teenagers pulling wheelies on the West Side Highway.\nTo come back to my earlier point, while walled gardens have always done a good job of providing easy access to ad impressions at scale with their own reporting system, today, advertisers have an alternative. For large brands, the premium open Internet now rivals walled gardens in terms of scale, thanks to advances in key channels like CTV and audio.\nBut that's where the similarities end. On the open Internet, advertisers get to showcase their brands against premium content where their targeted audience is highly engaged, and they get to measure campaign performance with much greater rigor based on high levels of authentication and actual consumer conversion data.\nSo while wall gardens still account for the bulk of global advertising spend, we're starting to see many cases where the open Internet is commanding the first [indiscernible]. CMOs of the world's leading brands also recognize that certain channels, especially digital audio, represent tremendous value, considering the amount of consumer engagement in those channels.\nOn average, in the U.S., consumers spend around 3 hours per day listening to music, podcasts and other types of digital audio. And yet digital audio commands a small fraction, by comparison, of advertising demand. But that's beginning to change, especially as companies like Spotify make investments to enable more programmatic and automated buying as they highlighted in their most recent earnings call.\nI would be remiss not to touch on the ever-evolving identity landscape in the context of all of this. What I hope you've noticed in many of our recent reports, including recent earnings reports, is that UID2 has been embraced across the digital advertising ecosystem, but perhaps most aggressively by channels that never relied on cookies to begin with, particularly in CTV.\nUID2 has never been a direct cookie replacement. UID2 has always been about building an identity framework that is much better than cookies could ever aspire to be. It's addressing much bigger issues and is expected to have more ubiquity than cookies ever did or do, an identity framework that works across all digital advertising channels, not just display, and distributes control among many advertisers, publishers and consumers, not just a couple of walled gardens that own browsers.\nUID2 improves consumer privacy controls while preserving the value exchange of relevant advertising for free content, the essential value exchange of the Internet. As most of you probably know, recently, Google announced a change in their long-promoted plans. They reversed their plans and suggested they're no longer getting rid of third-party cookies.\nI have long predicted that Google would never deprecate cookies. I've never believed it would make much strategic sense for them to do so, and we're seeing that play out now. It's really hard to claim leadership on privacy while also consolidating control over identity, especially when that control is so important to preserving your ad demand in channels such as YouTube all derived from search.\nI don't know where Google goes from here. We've gone from cookie deprecation to [indiscernible] to Privacy Sandbox and that to no cookie deprecation. If you're a company in the ad business that's dependent on Google, and there are many of them, this must be maddening. Understandably so. Google offered are not very compelling and often repeated argument to both the advertising industry and the regulators, both regulators addressing privacy and competition. They argued that Privacy Sandbox complexity and deprecation of Internet functionality was good for everyone.\nBut for The Trade Desk, it doesn't really matter. Our plans haven't changed. We, along with many others, have created the new identity fabric of the open Internet, one that is so much more fit for purpose than cookies could ever be. UID2 has already reached a critical mass of adoption, which has made it an essential identity signal, and UID2 continues to gain strong adoption across publishers, data partners and advertisers.\nFor example, FOX is scaling UID2 and OpenPath deployment across their entire digital portfolio, having started with Tubi 3 years ago. And in recent weeks, we've seen Roku and DIRECTV adopt UID2. These are significant steps forward. Similarly, in Europe, EUID is gaining momentum, with adoption from publishers such as Media Figaro in France, and Reach in the U.K., a publisher who boast more than 130 U.K. newspapers, including The Mirror and The Express.\nAll of this brings me to my third point: the value of innovation in our business in order to help advertisers think about efficacy in new ways and to help them take advantage of the premium open Internet where consumers are most leaned in. After years of development, we launched our most ambitious platform to date: Kokai. Kokai allows our clients to deploy data about their most loyal customers and then use that data as a seed to grow and harvest the next generation of loyal customers.\nKokai helps them target those new audiences across the many thousands of destinations that comprise the best of the open Internet, and it leverages AI to help them make sense of the roughly 15 million ad opportunities we see every second and the hundreds of variables associated with each one of them. And all of this happens in the context of what any given client's unique business growth goals are.\nI've been incredibly encouraged by the early results from Kokai. For those campaigns that have moved from Solamar to Kokai in aggregate, incremental reach is up more than 70%. Cost per acquisition has improved by about 27% as data elements per impression have gone up by about 30%. In addition, performance metrics have improved by about 25%, helping to unlock performance budgets on our platform for years to come. So our clients are getting more precise, more cost efficient and then they're able to reinvest for even more reach and drive a much better return on ad spend.\nGiven everything I said about what CMOs today are trying to accomplish and the pressures that they are under, I firmly believe that we have met the moment with Kokai. We are still in the very early days of programmatic advertising. We are just getting started in terms of how data-driven precision will help advertisers optimize every dollar of their ad spend. At end state, all of the rapidly approaching $1 trillion advertising TAM will be digital or at least transacted digitally, and the vast bulk of it will be transacted programmatically.\nAnd we are thrilled and thankful to be partnering with the world's most forward-thinking marketers as we bring that value to life. We believe we've aligned our interest with theirs, creating a very bright future for both of us.\nLet me bring my remarks to a close by summarizing what all of this means for us and why I believe The Trade Desk is positioned so well to capture more than our fair share of that $1 trillion TAM. We're in the midst of a period of tremendous change in our industry, change that's the result of macro market pressures as well as rapid innovation, such as Kokai. A powerful open Internet advertising ecosystem is coming of age, one that provides a compelling alternative to the cheap reach dynamics of walled gardens.\nThat ecosystem includes the world's leading streaming TV and digital audio companies, almost all of whom are partnering with us in new ways. From Disney to Netflix to Roku to FOX to NBC with the Olympics, these companies are trusting The Trade Desk to bring them the most valuable advertising demand. The world's leading retailers and commerce data companies are partnering with us to help advertisers close the loop on campaign spend to consumer purchase. Partners across the ecosystem are working with us to build the new identity fabric of the open Internet, and we're pioneering new innovations that help advertisers take advantage of their data, target new audiences with efficacy, leverage AI as a copilot and embrace the very best of the open Internet.\nIn doing so, we are offering premium value to our clients. And as a result, we are solidifying our position as the default DSP of the open Internet. As I've said many times before on these calls, our profitable business model gives us incredible flexibility to make investments and continue to drive growth and to always think about driving innovation and value for the long term, not just this year or next. Working with our clients and with their needs in mind, we are not afraid to make the big calls. And you see that every day in how we develop our partner ecosystem, how we innovate and how we help clients harness the value of the open Internet.\nI could not be more excited and confident about the powerful alternative we provide to the marketplace today. With that, I'll hand it over to Laura, who will take you through more of the financial details.\n\nLaura Schenkein\n\nExecutive Vice President of Financial Planning & Analysis\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered a strong second quarter with revenue of $585 million, representing 26% year-over-year growth. During the quarter, we benefited from a relatively stable digital advertising environment supported by both agencies and brands. We continue to gain market share as more advertisers stock greater efficiency and measurable results, particularly in CTV and Retail Media.\nOur business model, with its wide range of large advertisers and vertical markets, also contributed to our success. Additionally, our growing access to premium inventory, including major events like the Olympics for the first time through NBCU as well as gaining access to platforms like Roku and Netflix, also help ensure long-term durability and success, something we take great pride in.\nWith the strong top line performance in Q2, we generated approximately $242 million in adjusted EBITDA or about 41% of revenue. When we outperform on the top line, we often see that outperformance throughout our financial statements as was the case again in Q2. I'm proud of our focused efforts to consistently generate meaningful positive EBITDA and free cash flow while continuing to invest in the critical areas of the business that will drive our future growth.\nFrom a scale channel perspective, CTV, by a wide margin, led our growth again during the quarter. In Q2, video, which includes CTV, represented a high 40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow as a percentage of our mix. Local represented a mid-30s percentage share of spend during the quarter. Display continued to represent a low double-digit percent share of our business, and audio represented around 5%.\nGeographically, North America represented about 88% of our business in Q2, and international represented about 12%. We're pleased that international growth outpaced North America for the sixth quarter in a row. Across both EMEA and Asia Pacific, CTV continued to drive our growth. While still small relative to the share of CTV spend produced in North America, we see significant opportunities to capture share in these verticals.\nIn terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, growth was broad-based again this quarter. We saw strong performance in the majority of our verticals, particularly in home and garden, food and drink and shopping. Family relationships and healthy living verticals were both below average. Overall, we continue to see healthy trends across our verticals, and we continue to believe there is opportunity for us to gain share in the verticals we serve.\nTurning now to expenses. Excluding stock-based compensation, operating expenses in Q2 were $363 million, up 19% year-over-year. While there are ample opportunities to achieve more leverage within our operating expenses, our primary objective remains on growing spend on our platform and gaining more share of the global advertising market.\nDuring the second quarter, we continued to invest in our team, our platform and our infrastructure to support sustained growth. Thanks to our careful management of operating expenses in recent years, we are well positioned to innovate our platform, invest in cutting-edge technologies like AI, expand our teams and further distance ourselves from competitors.\nIncome tax expense was $27 million for the second quarter, driven primarily by our pretax profitability and nondeductible stock-based compensation. Adjusted net income was $197 million or $0.39 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $81 million for Q2, and free cash flow was $57 million. DSOs exiting the quarter were 90 days, down about 2 days from a year ago. DPOs were 75 days, down about 1 day from a year ago.\nWe exited the second quarter with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.5 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet. In Q2, we did not repurchase any shares of our Class A common stock. We will continue to approach the repurchase program opportunistically depending on market conditions and capital priorities.\nNow turning to our outlook for the third quarter. We continue to see strong spend in key areas, including CTV and retail media. We estimate Q3 revenue to be at least $618 million, which would represent growth of 25% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $248 million in Q3.\nIn closing, we are extremely pleased with our strong performance in the second quarter and throughout the first half of the year. The opportunity ahead of us has never been more promising. We are positioned within a large and expanding market, supported by a business model that consistently delivers robust top line growth, significant profitability and strong cash flow.\nWith key growth drivers such as CTV, retail media, international expansion, a strong identity strategy and a major product upgrade with Kokai, we remain confident and optimistic about our future as we navigate the second half of this year and look forward to 2025 and beyond.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions."

Welcome to The Trade Desk First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn the conference over to your host, Chris Toth. You may begin.\n\nChris Toth\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Hello, and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today are Founder and CEO, Jeff Green; and Chief Financial Officer, Laura Schenkein. A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section.\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind you that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements, which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. Actual results may vary significantly, and they assume no obligations to update any of our forward-looking statements.\nShould any of our beliefs or assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provides a more meaningful representation of the company's operational performance.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\n\nJeffrey Terry Green\n\nFounder, President, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Trade Desk, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. As you have seen from the press release, we are off to a very promising start once again this year. For the first quarter, revenue grew 28% compared to last year, marking strong revenue growth acceleration on both a sequential and a year-over-year basis. Outpacing the industry for a quarter or 2 is a great accomplishment, but I'm so proud of our team for now having outpaced the digital advertising industry for a couple of years straight.\nI believe our revenue growth acceleration in the first quarter speaks to the innovation and value that we are delivering to our clients with [ Coke ]. It also reflects growing awareness among the world's leading advertisers of the value and power of the best of the open Internet. To put a finer point on this, more than 90% of the Ad Age Top 200, the largest 200 advertisers in the world have run advertising campaigns on our platform over the last 12 months.\nEven with this considerable size, CTV continues to be our fastest-growing channel. Over the past few months, industry giants like Disney, NBCU, Walmart, Amazon and now Roku and LG Electronics have all made deeper pivots into CTV. Many of them in partnership with us, bringing more opportunity for advertisers.\n[ UID2 ] has become ubiquitous across the premium parts of the open Internet and along with greater first-party data deployment and advances in emerging data markets, especially retail data, we are building the new identity and authentication fabric of the Internet. In doing so, the open Internet is getting replumbed and revalued, especially in contrast to the value offered by walled gardens.\nAnd the innovations in our Kokai platform will help our clients take advantage of this revaluation and fully leverage data-driven buying to fuel their own business growth. As a result, I've never been more optimistic about the future of the open Internet and our ability to gain more than our fair share of the nearly $1 trillion advertising TAM.\nLet me dig into this a little deeper. I'd like to frame my remarks with just a little context on how our industry has advanced over the years, at least in part because of some of the significant and disruptive events today. I think this framing is important because I believe we may be in the midst of another period of major disruption right now. And perhaps most important I believe our ability to anticipate and innovate in these moments positions us very well moving forward.\nI've often said that the programmatic industry as we know it today, came to life as a result of the global financial crisis just over 15 years ago. At that time, there was tremendous pressure on all businesses to do more with less and to find new ways to differentiate, automate and grow more efficiently. With those pressures, the precision and value of programmatic became more immediately apparent to major brand advertisers and this proved to be a fertile environment for our business and so many others.\nSimilarly, the rapid rise of CTV as the driving force of programmatic would not have happened so quickly were it not for the COVID pandemic. With state home directives around the world, consumers shift en mass for the convenience of streaming and the media world hasn't been the same sense. TV has always been the central element of major brand advertising campaigns, so the shift from linear to CTV was always going to be disruptive.\nWhat's perhaps more important is how quickly the TV industry has evolved as a result. CTV is now a driving force in how we think about things like authentication, identity, the use of retail data relevance and attribution in advertising. And while it may not be as apparent as a global financial crisis or a global pandemic, I believe we're now in the middle of another great disruption in our industry. This disruption is very different because it is driven from major tectonic shifts within our own industry instead of from macroeconomic and pandemic forces.\nToday's shift is largely driven from the conflict Apple and Google are having with governments and domino effects that are coming from new draconian policies and tactics coming from wounded tech. For the last couple of years now, we've delivered consistent, durable revenue growth over 20%, significantly outpacing the broader market, including the major walled gardens. And it's because of the contrast between the best of the open Internet, what you might call the premium Internet and the content and characteristics of walled gardens has never been more apparent.\nThe details of the Texas Attorney General suit against Google and the approaching trial of the Department of Justice versus Google have shined a light on a few things inside of Google, but it's created a lot of clarity on things outside of Google as well. There is a wider understanding of a few immediate themes facing advertising. First, there is a broader understanding of the role that walled gardens are playing as major purveyors of low-grade made for advertising inventory.\nSecond, there is a much wider understanding of how bad ad to content ratios within walled gardens and the brand suitability risk of user-generated content or UGC. This is in part due to the stark contrast that premium content has right now to UGC. The industry has growing awareness that consumers spend most of their quality time with premium content on the open Internet versus the walled gardens. Advertisers are making better use of their first-party data and retail data as they explore contemporary cross-channel alternatives to cookies.\nAnd lastly, in advertising and marketing, like in many other sectors, there is a broad industry frenzy around AI and what it means for our industry. Taken together, I don't know that I've ever seen the industry in such a state of transition. In some corners of our industry, I also sense some [ pant ] and confusion about what to do next. But for us, this gives context to our recent outperformance as well as our conviction for why I'm so confident about the opportunity in front of us in 2024 and the years ahead.\nOne insight that reinforces the shift that is happening is founded where I'm spending my time. Over the last 6 months or so, I've been spending more and more of my time with CEOs, CMOs and heads of media companies, helping them make sense of the issues that I just outlined. And the bottom line across all of these discussions, there is consensus that the value is shifting to the open Internet.\nBut perhaps I should be more specific. It's shifting to the best of the open Internet, what we might call the premium Internet. It won't all happen overnight, but it is starting. In 2022, have marked the first year in a decade that the majority of digital ad spending took place outside of Meta and Google. With the proliferation of CTV and Retail Media, that trend accelerated last year, and I believe the trend will only continue moving forward.\nThe role of CTV and digital audio and all of this should not be understated. For many people, movie, TV and audio consumption is a very important part of their daily lives. It's premium quality content that captivate consumers who spend significant amounts of time engaging with it. No one watches Mandalorian or Curb Your Enthusiasm or March Madness casually. No one listens to their favorite podcast passively. I found in every aspect of my life, I can't talk to anyone about premium CTV content or the best of music without people sharing a passion for some form of those mediums. We are all highly invested in it.\nThat's very different than how consumers engage or talk about social media content, which is often short form UGC video, such as cat videos or 14-year-olds filming themselves falling off of bicycles. However, people spend much more time with premium content such as streaming TV and digital audio than they do with UGC. Our research shows consumers spend about 60% of their online time on the open Internet. The ad to content ratios are much better, and therefore, the experience is much better.\nBut walled gardens still command the bulk of digital advertising spend because those tech giants have made it super easy to reach consumers at map scale, and the performance results are equally simplified. Hey, look, your ads did great. We told you so, so it must be true. But that's changing. Advertisers now have scaled alternatives on the open Internet. One of the major innovations in Kokai is the sellers and publishers 500 plus. This is a curated marketplace that represents the best of the open Internet, the premium Internet, where consumers spend the majority of their time online.\nIts live sports events such as March Madness, where we saw a 200% increase in spend compared to a year ago. It's the latest movies in hot TV shows, it's music and podcasts on platforms like Spotify, its trusted journalism. Now our advertisers can access that premium marketplace at scale easily and with confidence. In doing so, they don't have to see control of their valuable first-party data, they get to measure effectively, and they can be sure that their ads are showing up against high quality content that's consistent with their brand. Advertisers now have a scaled way to control their own future.\nOf course, our ability to buy the best of the open Internet is based on close working relationships with the world's leading publishers. Across the board, publishers are working with us to make advertiser access to their inventory as attractive as possible, which means making it as transparent and objective as possible. You only have to look at the list of expanded partnerships that we've signed over the last few weeks. We are integrating directly with the Disney Real-time Ad Exchange, which includes Hulu and Disney+ via our Openpath technology. For the first time ever, NBCU will make the Olympics available programmatically to advertisers and is doing so with The Trade Desk.\nLG Electronics has adopted UID2 Visio and Cox Media Group are connecting with us via Openpath. TF1 and M6, 2 of the largest broadcasters in France, have integrated EUID as they make their content available programmatically. And just a week ago, Roku announced that it is expanding its demand strategy to include The Trade Desk or its premium content.\nJust to go one click deeper on Roku. I think it makes a ton of sense for Roku to embrace the open Internet with their premium content. Early on CTV inventory was scarce, it made sense for many of the premium CTV streamers to sell most of the inventory themselves. With the proliferation of CTV content over the last couple of years, those same companies now need to find ways to maximize advertiser demand and that means opening up to a broader range of demand sources such as The Trade Desk and embracing solutions such as UID2, which help advertisers find their target audience as accurately as possible. We are excited to be Roku's partner in this, and we believe this move is a win-win-win for Roku, for advertisers and for the trade desk.\nAs a reminder, last year on 66, we started shipping Kokai. This platform launch is different for us because 66 last year marked just the beginning, and we've been shipping new features ever since. We are quickly approaching some of the biggest UX and product rollouts of Kokai that nearly all of our customers will begin to use and see benefits from over the next few quarters, including a game-changing AI-fueled forecasting tool.\nAnother major innovation that we're bringing to market with Kokai is a completely new approach to audience-based buying. We're able to do this because of the broad availability of new identifiers such as UID2, along with easier on-ramps for first-party data. This means advertisers can now take what they know about their most loyal customers and by new customers who look just like the loyal ones and find them anywhere across the open Internet.\nAdvertisers no longer have to use content as a proxy for audience. instead of simply advertising against the NBA playoffs to reach pizza lovers, advertisers can find pizza lovers wherever they are across all digital channels. In Asia, Unilever and their agency, PHD, leverage our retail partnership in Kokai with Foodpanda to increase sales of their ignore food sauces. Unilever was able to onboard its own third-party data on our platform then do look-alike modeling for Foodpanda's retail conversion and loyalty data to target new customers more precisely on the open Internet. This new audience-based approach resulted in a 229% improvement in customers adding [ Knorr ] products to their shopping basket and an 81% improvement in customer conversion.\nJust like Unilever more and more advertisers are prioritizing at opportunities where they can be sure they are reaching their target audience. And increasingly, that means activating their first-party data effectively and leveraging ad impressions where UID2 is present. This is the new identity fabric of the Internet taking shape, and it's revaluing the Internet and the process. Recently, Target Australia and their agency OMD worked with us to upload their first-party customer data into our platform, then targeted new customers using UID2. Their conversion rate improved 66% versus using traditional identifiers, and their cost per action decreased 36%.\nAnd there are huge benefits to publishers who offer transparency and authenticated audience data to advertisers. Unwind Media is one of the world's leading gaming platforms. They recently reported that they saw a 47% improvement in the value of ad impressions when deterministic identifiers such as UID2 are present, and 107% improvement when users are authenticated with SSOs such as [ Open Costs ].\nLet me also spend a moment on AI, not because we're trying to get on the bandwagon. We've been deploying AI in our platform since we launched [indiscernible] in 2016. Given the frenzy around AI, I think it's important to talk about how it is actually helping advance the work of programmatic advertising. Too much discussion on AI today is about AI and the abstract instead of practical details about implementation. We are starting to get better at explaining how our AI investments will actually help people do their jobs better.\nTo that end, we've known since before our company existed, that the complexity of assessing millions of ad opportunities every second, along with hundreds of variables for each impression and be on the scope of any individual human. We have always thought about AI as a copilot for our hands-on keyboard traders. And with Kokai, we are bringing the power of AI to a broader range of key decision points than ever, whether it's in relevant scoring forecasting, budget optimization, frequency management or upgraded measurement.\nAI is also incorporated into a series of new indices that score relevance, which advertisers can use to better understand the relevance of different ad impressions in reaching their target audience. For example, U.S. Cellular worked with their agency, [ Harmelin Media ], to leverage our TV quality index to better reach new customers. Their conversion rates improved 71%. They reached 66% more households by optimizing frequency management and their cost per acquisition decreased 24%.\nI think it's important to understand how we're putting AI to work in Kokai because this kind of tech dislocation will bring new innovators. We see that now where major tech players are inviting scrutiny because they're behind the innovation curve on AI and more agile players, and I would include The Trade Desk in that bucket, are figuring out how to apply it, to help humans make better, more data-driven decisions. We are also developing AI branded with [ COA ] to make data-driven refinements on its own within the combined of human defined guard brands.\nLet me close by trying to bring all of this together and help you understand why I believe this positions The Trade Desk so well going forward. I can't explain that any better than [ Jamie Power ], the SVP of addressable sales at Disney, who spoke at our recent FORWARD '24 event in New York City. Disney is one of the pioneers of CTV technology, and Jamie talked about how UID2 is helping Disney offer advertiser match rates that are 3 to 4x higher than when UID2 is not present, and higher CPMs are clearly following higher match rates. That's a pretty astonishing statement about where the Internet is heading. Disney deals with an authenticated audience and they're leveraging UID2, so advertisers can find the right customers with much more precision in TV than ever before, against what many would consider some of the most premium content on the open Internet.\nWith the growing ubiquity of UID2, with new approaches to authentication with better deployment of first-party data with easier access to the premium Internet and with major advances in AI the ability for advertisers to reach the right audience at the right time and the right place and convert those customers has never been greater. And all of that's happening in our platform. And all of that happens with the advertiser in control of their data, understanding more precisely where their dollars are going, how they should optimize and how those ads are performing in service of their KPIs.\nNone of what I just ran through is really possible in a walled garden. I might not go as far as to say, we're seeing the early days of the fall of Rome, but the current macro and tech forces are creating an important moment of the reckoning for everyone in our industry, and advertisers are shifting more dollars to us as a result. Advertisers want a competitive market with price discovery because they want to own their own future.\nIt is easier than ever for advertisers to understand who is delivering value at all points of the digital advertising supply chain. And they will increasingly gravitate to those who are helping them make the most of every advertising dollar with transparency and objectivity. Of course, this is all made possible by our profitable business model which generates significant cash flow, which in turn allows us to invest in the major platform upgrades that characterize Kokai.\nSo while I believe 2024 will be remembered as a year of great tech-driven disruption in our industry, I also believe it is a year that The Trade Desk will continue to differentiate itself from its competitors and continue to outpace the market. As the industry races to $1 trillion TAM, we are incredibly well positioned to take more than our fair share.\nWith that, I will hand it over to Laura, who will take you through more of the financial details.\n\nLaura Schenkein\n\nExecutive Vice President of Financial Planning & Analysis\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. The Trade Desk delivered another strong quarter as revenue was $491 million, a 28% increase year-over-year. Our growth is further evidence of the durable value of The Trade Desk per our clients, and we continue to outperform the industry as a result.\nAll of our progress in areas such as CTV, Retail Media, Kokai and UID2 helped deliver another quarter of consistently strong growth in profitability to start 2024. In addition to strong top line performance, I'm proud of the $162 million of adjusted EBITDA we generated during the quarter. representing a margin of 33%. Our strong growth in Q1 was broad-based in terms of geography and channel geography.\nStrength in CTV continued as the channel led our growth from a scale channel perspective once again. We also continue to see strong momentum in Retail Media as we continue to win shopper marketing budgets and as more of our existing clients utilize third-party retail data for targeting and measurement.\nUID2 is being deployed by major advertisers and publishers at a larger scale than ever. And we continue to see the benefits from strengthening our relationships with major brands and their agencies.\nFrom a scale channel perspective in Q1, video, which includes CTV represented a mid-40% share of our business and continue to grow as a percent of our mix. Mobile represented a mid-30% share spend during the quarter. Display represented a low double-digit percent share of our business and audio represented around 5%.\nGeographically, North America represented about 88% of spend, and international represented about 12% of spend for the first quarter. We saw strong consistent year-over-year growth across all of our regions in Q1 with international growth outpacing North America for the fifth quarter in a row.\nWe continue to execute our growth playbook internationally, led by CTV and Retail Media. We remain optimistic that our business outside North America continues to be a strong contributor to our overall growth this year and for years to come.\nIn terms of verticals, every category greater than 1% of spend grew double digits in Q1. It's exciting to deliver such consistent growth across the business, and we're proud to see the value of the open Internet for premium Internet resonating with clients for many industries.\nTurning now to expenses. Q1 operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, were $352 million, up 20% year-over-year. We continue to make investments in our team and platform, particularly in areas like sales and marketing and platform operations as we position the organization for long-term growth. Income tax expense was $14 million in the first quarter, driven primarily by our profitability and nondeductible stock-based compensation.\nAdjusted net income for the quarter was $131 million or $0.26 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $185 million and free cash flow was $176 million in Q1. DSOs exiting Q1 were 86 days, down 2 days from a year ago. [indiscernible] were 70 days, down 2 days per meter ago.\nWe exited Q1 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.4 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet. Finally, in Q1, we repurchased 1.5 million shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $125 million. The company will continue to approach the repurchase program opportunistically depending on market conditions and capital priorities.\nNow turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We tend to see strong spend in our key areas such as CTV and Retail Media. We estimate Q2 revenue to be at least $575 million, which would represent growth of approximately 24% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $223 million in Q2.\nIn closing, we are encouraged about the momentum of our business. We're executing on large long-term growth drivers, including CTV, international expansion, Retail Media, our recent platform upgrade in Kokai, UID2 as well as the upcoming U.S. election cycle. We continue to generate strong free cash flow for our headcount efficiently and maintain a balance sheet that positions us to continue investing in achieving durable growth. We remain optimistic about the prospects for our business in the remainder of 2024 and beyond. That concludes our prepared remarks.\nAnd with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions."

Welcome to The Trade Desk Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Chris Toth. You may begin.\n\nChris Toth\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Hello, and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today are Founder and CEO, Jeff Green; and Chief Financial Officer, Laura Schenkein. A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section.\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind you that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. Actual results may vary significantly, and we expressly assume no obligations to update any of our forward-looking statements. Should any of our beliefs or assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings.\nIn addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provides a more meaningful representation of the company's operational performance. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\n\nJeffrey Terry Green\n\nFounder, President, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Trade Desk, Inc.\n\nHello, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Today, I'm really excited to discuss our strong finish to the year and Q4, reflect on the progress we made in 2023 and explain why I'm so confident about our growth prospects in 2024 and beyond. Total spend on our platform in 2023 was [ up ] almost $10 billion, a record for us. Revenue in the fourth quarter topped $600 million, the first time we have ever crossed that mark in a single quarter. This record spend helped drive revenue growth of 23% for the year, once again significantly outpacing the broader digital advertising market. And of course, we had solid growth in an uncertain market of 2022 when many of our competitors were exiting the year comparatively flat. In fact, in Q4 of 2022, we grew by 24% year-over-year. So 23% growth in 2023 on top of very strong growth in 2022 is once again leading the market.\nWe generated adjusted EBITDA of over $770 million in 2023. We also generated $543 million of free cash flow. This relentless focus on profitability and growth allows us to keep investing in innovation, ensuring we are always bringing the best possible value to our clients, whether it's our game-changing Kokai launch or new approaches to identity and authentication for the open Internet.\nWhile there is much to celebrate about 2023, I'm even more excited about 2024 and beyond, I've never felt more confident heading into a new year. I believe we are uniquely positioned to grow and gain market share not only in 2024 but well into the future, regardless of some of the pressures that our industry is facing, whether it's cookie deprecation, growing regulatory focus on walled gardens, or the rapidly changing TV landscape. These industry shifts represent tremendous growth opportunities for us.\nShifts in our nearly $1 trillion global advertising market are not dissimilar from shifts in all large markets, including the equities markets. When macro changes come to the equities markets caused by economic changes, Fed moves or governmental changes, these sorts of macro shifts force the smart money to rotate. Or said another way, macro changes almost always force a revaluing of the market. Every investment is scrutinized and adjusted. Similarly, the Internet is being revalued once again.\nWe've seen this many times before. During the pandemic, people streamed more. We got more inventory and the value of choice in CTV helped to create better performance so the value of CTV went up. Things shifted. We saw it again in 2021 when Apple made changes to limit relevant advertising in its operating system, which impacted their browser and their mobile environments. We simply adjusted and we bought 2 segments of the ecosystem with better price discovery and performance, which were still at times inside the Apple ecosystem but often were not.\nOften, people looking at our massive global industry continually overlook significantly different strengths, weaknesses and opportunities for different types of companies. Some wrongly think only big companies win and smaller companies like us don't. That paradigm is completely wrong. In general, the current shifts will help companies with authenticated users and traffic, which also sit next to large amount of advertiser demand. These macro changes hurt those, especially content owners and publishers who don't have authentication. So this year, CTV and audio have big opportunities ahead, and the rest has pockets of winners and losers but nearly everyone will be either better off or worse off. And I believe 2024 is a year of volatility for the global advertising market.\nAnd for those who are prepared, like the Trade Desk, it is an opportunity to win share. Our platform is set up to make the most of any signal that can help advertisers drive relevance and value. Our platform now sees about 15 million advertising impression opportunities per second. And we effectively stack ranked all of those impressions better than anyone else in the world based on probability of performance to any given advertiser, without the bias or conflict of interest that plagued most walled gardens. With UID2, Kokai and advances in AI in our platform, we now do this more effectively than ever before. And our work in areas such as CTV, retail data and identity are helping build a new identity and authentication fabric for the open Internet.\nSo regardless of how the environment evolves around us, we will always be able to help advertisers find the right impressions for them. A great example of this is the work that we're doing with HP. They initially started to think about new approaches to identity because of the imminent cookie deprecation in Chrome. But while the conversation started there, it quickly turned to how new identifiers such as UID2 could help manage campaigns across all channels, especially channels with high levels of user authentication. HP started using UID2 for CTV campaigns on Disney and Hulu, Disney being a notable and early adopter of UID2. HP started with their first-party data that consumers had consented to provide after making a purchase.\nThat data was then matched with UID2s on our platform. As a result, HP segmented its audience into specific groups, allowing better targeting and measurement of specific product campaigns with more accuracy. HP was then able to link ad exposure data from UID2 identifiers with the device registration data in its CDP to connect consumers with actual online conversions and sales. That measurement proved to be more effective than the multi-touch attribution model that HP had been using according to Caitlin Nardi, their head of programmatic for North America.\nThis is a great example of how we're improving advertising outcomes for a major global brand by integrating new approaches to identity, authenticated audiences in high-growth channels such as CTV and retail sales conversion data. It all started with a conversation about cookie deprecation, but the answer was something much more advanced, which speaks to the way that most major advertisers are innovating with us. And it's why we're embedding these innovations into Kokai. As I've said before, walled gardens are not an optimal competitive environment for the open Internet, and the open Internet will continue to challenge the walled gardens as the place where the very first advertising dollar is spent.\nBecause for the most part, premium content is outside of the walled gardens and all the questionable user-generated content is inside of the walled gardens, from cat videos to political rants to hate speech to cyberbullying, walled gardens simply use self-reported numbers in an increasingly opaque black box. Meanwhile, retail data and premium content are making the open Internet more compelling than ever. I predict this trend will accelerate during this year, which of course, is an election year.\nI think it's worth spending the bulk of my time unpacking the transitions we are seeing in the industry as it will highlight why we continue to outperform and why I'm so confident about our growth potential moving forward. To do that, I'd like to cover 3 main areas: first, how advertising channels such as CTV, retail media and even digital audio are helping replumb the Internet from an advertising perspective; second, what the future of relevance in advertising looks like as the identity landscape evolves; and third, why Kokai helps us advance our growth opportunity in the context of all of this.\nIn order to understand some of the more interesting drivers of our business, I think it's important to note the macro environment we're dealing with. For nearly all of 2023, there was uncertainty, particularly around economic growth rates and recessionary fears. In that environment, CMOs become much more reliant on their CFOs, and CFOs needed to make sure that every dollar spent was in service of growth, which means CMOs had to focus more than ever on where they could achieve efficacy and deliver strong and provable return on ad spend.\nThat pressure came in at the same time that many CTV content owners around the world were seeing how much more valuable ad viewing subscriptions were to them than the higher-priced ad-free subscribers. It is not a coincidence that our growth in 2023 was driven by ongoing strength in CTV and continued leadership through strong and expanding partnerships in retail and retail media. In each of these markets, advertisers can really put data to work and drive precision because they have a greater sense of confidence in who they are actually reaching.\nIn CTV and other emerging channels such as digital audio, there's a logged-in authenticated user base. In retail media, our platform works with actual authenticated sales data. CTV continues to be the fastest-growing channel at scale for The Trade Desk. There's a ton of speculation right now about the future of the TV industry, but every major TV trend is good for us. Linear is shrinking and users are streaming instead. We have built our business around streaming premium content. Subscriptions are moving to ad-funded models, and both consumers and content owners want that.\nAs the industry oscillates back and forth from fragmentation to consolidation, in all scenarios, we are partnering to provide demand from the biggest advertisers in the world. But 1 thing is clear through all of this: ad-supported streaming is going to be an essential strategy for any successful TV provider moving forward. Nearly every major streamer has stated that they make more money from their ad-supported tiers than from their subscription-only and was reported pretty extensively in recent weeks. With the price of subscription models continuing to rise, consumer fatigue is settling in. There's only so much disposable entertainment money to go around. According to The Wall Street Journal, 25% of U.S. streaming subscribers have canceled at least 3 subscriptions over the last 2 years, up from 15% for the prior 2-year period.\nIn fact, by hiking the cost of the no-ad subscription services, streamers are pushing viewers to the cheaper ad-supported options because they are more lucrative. There's only 1 way for the CTV ecosystem to mature. Content owners in CTV and audio get good at presenting 3 clear choices to consumers: pay for access to content by seeing a few relevant ads; or pay more money to avoid them; or some kind of hybrid of those 2. Consumers will have choice and CTV and audio will find their coveted incremental users. Some want to pay with time and some want to pay with money. There is enough pressure to fund the CTV content machines that all of them have to get focused on a light ad load with high CPMs to create the best experiences for their users.\nWhile there is more than enough pressure on TV content owners to expand relevant ad programs, there is probably even more pressure on big players of audio. 2024 will be a big year for audio, depending on the strategic choices that those players make. Just like CTV, digital audio benefits from a highly authenticated logged-in audience. Also like CTV, digital audio listeners are highly leaned in. Advertisers have a captive audience that are engaged with quality professional content. Whether it's a podcast or your favorite music, engagement is high. And we're spending more and more time with audio streaming leaders in part because I believe they are in the very early innings of seeing the value of data-driven advertising and about to set out on the journey that CTV companies began years ago.\nAnother area of strong growth for us in the fourth quarter was retail media. Again, a major reason for this is that advertisers got to work with their first-party data, in this case, real-world sales data. In the fourth quarter, we saw a major new shopper marketing budget shift to The Trade Desk as more advertisers started to move from a non-decision insertion order strategy, which has long been typical in the retail space to one that's highly decisioned and leveraging retail media.\nA great example of an advertiser leaning into retail media is Samsung in Canada. A large percentage of Samsung's device and appliance sales take place through carriers and retailers. In order to understand how advertising is influencing consumer purchases in those channels, they needed a way to unlock their first-party data and combine it with retail data. Working with their agency, Starcom, we helped Samsung develop what they call the Samsung sales measurement tool on our platform. When buyers make a purchase, they are prompted to open an account with Samsung and opt-in to marketing and engagement. With the right permission, Samsung can then look back through their marketing activations across masses of consumers and start to attribute campaign activities to different stages of the purchase funnel.\nThis helped Samsung be much more precise with their campaign activities looking forward. Working with us, they can attribute the effectiveness of marketing directly on sales 19x more effectively than they were previously. I spend time on these growth drivers not only to give you a sense of why I'm so confident in our prospects this year, but also to underscore how major advertisers are thinking about identity and authentication, which brings me to my second point or second topic, the evolving world of identity.\nI don't think it's an understatement to say that there's considerable thrash in the industry, driven by Google's recent decision to accelerate the deprecation of third-party cookies. It had previously been scheduled to begin deprecation at the end of March of this year but moved up to the beginning of the year in January. I just want to be clear on 1 point: for all of the industry debate that's been caused by these changes, The Trade Desk stands to benefit. As I said a few minutes ago, we see approximately 15 million ad impression opportunities every second on our platform. And the vast majority of the ad impressions that we value don't have anything to do with third-party cookies.\nWhen you consider the fastest-growing channels of digital advertising, such as CTV or digital audio, they've never relied on cookies. Retail data doesn't rely on cookies. What our clients care about is being able to reach their audiences with precision and relevance, and we help them do that using whatever signal is available to us. And increasingly, as I just discussed, the post-cookie world is one that will combine authentication, new approaches to identity, first-party data activation and advanced AI-driven relevance tools, all to create a new identity fabric for the Internet that is so much more effective than cookies ever were.\nThe Internet is being replumbed and our product offerings create the best outcome for all of the open Internet. The offerings of the walled gardens often are good for them and no one else. Let's also remember that we've seen this movie before. Today, cookies have already been deprecated for around 1/3 of all display impressions. Browsers such as Firefox and Safari made the transition several years ago. Neither of those shifts meaningfully affected our business. In fact, quite the opposite. We continue to innovate a full range of ways for our clients to understand the relevance value of every advertising impression and price them accordingly.\nIn fact, the value we add to advertisers and agencies has gone up with all these changes. Those shifts make it important to consider buying different impressions, and so we do. We're constantly objectively helping buyers to know where to find value and performance. As the relative value of ad shifts to somewhere else, we shift too. One example of this is the work we're doing with Unilever in Thailand. They were looking to raise awareness for their new detergent product, as well as test new identifiers that could advance addressability in a post-cookie environment. Using their own first-party data as a seed, they leveraged UID2 to target relevant audiences and measured against Unilever's traditional audience targeting methods.\nThe results showed a marked improvement over these traditional methods, which include cookies across key areas of measurements such as click-through rate, brand awareness and cost per completed view. Interestingly, this work relied on UID2s created from encrypted phone numbers, which is a big part of the identity fabric in Asia. This UID2 work with Unilever is now expanding into additional markets in Southeast Asia.\nI know you're going to ask me specifically about Privacy Sandbox because nearly everyone else does, so I'll touch on it here. I've written fairly extensively on it on our news platform, The Current, so you can see my thoughts there in more detail. But the CliffsNotes version is that I believe Google has missed an opportunity to build something better. Increased complexity with decreased functionality is hardly a compelling offering. To publishers, they are effectively saying, do more work and make less money. I believe Privacy Sandbox is an incredibly complex product, understood fully by very few people, which will likely degrade the Chrome user experience for publishers and brands but especially for users.\nUsers personalization will break more often. Users will begin to be required to log in seemingly everywhere. Browser-based publishers, including mobile, will likely have to do what so many e-commerce sites already do, ask for an e-mail address when you arrive. The consumers will get a weaker experience for a while and publishers will make less money until they change. However, this has less impact on advertisers, especially those with quality first-party data, and it is more likely to help The Trade Desk than it is to hurt us For many reasons, we will be better off, but a few of those to include: first, we're on the buy side. We also represent the majority of Fortune 500 brands. We also invested in UID2 many years ago. We invested in AI many years ago. And our business is increasingly built around CTV, audio and environments that are almost always authenticated.\nFewer cookies doesn't really matter a ton for us. It doesn't stop our work because we've been busy with other open Internet pioneers building something much better. Where there is real risk is on the publisher's side of the ad ecosystem, especially browser-based publishers. Others have reported that declines in publisher CPMs in Chrome where cookies have been deprecated are around 30%. That's potentially devastating for publishers, of course. Not so much for advertisers who continue to have millions of choices a second on where to spend their ad dollars. But this threat to publishers comes as there are daily reports of journalism outlets laying off major swaths of their newsrooms amid a really tight business climate.\nWhile there may be many reasons for the struggles that journalism outlets are having, one of the dirty secrets of the industry is that authentication rates there are surprisingly low. That means that they don't have any sense of who is visiting their destinations, and they've been reliant on cookies until now to create relevance for advertisers. Without either cookies or publisher authentication, advertisers won't value those ad impressions nearly as much. This is a wake-up call for publishers.\nAnd the math is obvious. $1 CPM turns into $0.70 with cookie deprecation. We are often seeing $1 CPM turn into $1.30 when UID2 is layered on it. So when publishers get to consider the contrast of $1.30 versus $0.70, the math is more obvious than ever. In some cases, they only recently started looking at the math when the dollar suddenly turned into $0.70. So 2024 has started off as a year of action for our industry. On the positive side, we're seeing more publishers lean into single sign-on authentication tools that they control. For example, we've seen a major uptick in publishers deploying OpenPath. These include Snopes, OK Magazine, Radar Online and many others. We expect many more to deploy this in the months ahead. OpenPath lets publishers authenticate their regular visitors so they can help advertisers score the relevance of their ad impressions.\nAll of this taken together brings me to my third point, our new Kokai platform. Much of what I've been talking about today is embedded into Kokai. In particular, Kokai represents a completely new way to understand and score the relevance of every ad impression across all channels. It allows advertisers to use an audience-first approach to their campaigns, targeting their audiences wherever they are on the open Internet. Our AI optimizations, which are now distributed across the platform, help optimize every element of the ad purchase process.\nKokai is now live, and similar to Next Wave and Solimar, it will scale over the next year. It's our largest platform overhaul in our company's history, and I could not be more proud of the incredible work of our product and engineering teams.\nIn Q4, me and our product team personally visited 4 continents and met with hundreds of clients in each location, Europe, North America with large showings in New York City and Chicago as well as in Asia and Australia. After spending half a day in each location with almost 1,000 clients in total, almost every single one of our clients believe that Kokai is a major upgrade to our platform and to the ecosystem. We have never launched a product with this much change, and we've never launched a product with this much confidence that what we have represents a major advance in advertiser performance and that it is going to be enthusiastically adopted.\nSo let me wrap up. I've covered a lot of ground but there's a lot going on in our industry. And I thought it was important to reiterate why I feel so confident about our position and our prospects. In closing, I'd like to just summarize a few key points. First, agencies and brands are becoming more deliberate with their campaign budgets. They are shifting ad dollars to where they can be more data-driven and precise in everything they do. And this is driving them to find JVPs with us at a record pace. Exiting last year, over 1/3 of our business fell under a JVP.\nSecond, we are reinforcing our position as the adtech AI leader. We've been embedding AI into our platform since 2016, so it's nothing new to us. But now it's being distributed across our platform so our clients can make even better choices among the 15 million ad impression opportunities a second and understand which of those ads are most relevant to their audience segments at any given time.\nThird, connected TV continues to be the fastest-growing channel of our business at scale and the key driver of overall omnichannel growth. And it's not just here in the U.S. We're seeing strong CTV growth across EMEA and Asia as more CTV inventory comes online. CTV companies are driving a ton of innovation in our industry, particularly around identity. And it's no coincidence that they have been among the earliest and most enthusiastic adopters of UID2.\nFourth, retail media has become one of the fastest-growing areas of our business, and we expect this to continue in 2024. Retail partnerships in retail media is revolutionizing the way many advertisers think about connecting advertising to actual consumer actions. And more and more of the world's leading retailers are now active on our platform.\nFifth, global expansion. We have made significant investments outside the U.S. over the last few years in CTV and in retail media but also in our overall go-to-market strategy. Our business outside the U.S. grew at a much faster pace than here in the U.S. last year. We believe we are in a position to accelerate our international growth in many of the markets we serve. Sixth, we've seen a rapid uptick in adoption of UID2 and EUID as a new identity currency for the open Internet from advertisers, publishers and everyone who serves them.\nBut perhaps even more encouraging, we're seeing significant performance improvements for advertisers who are using UID2, and this is accelerating adoption. Seventh, of course, 2024 stands to be a major year for political spending here in the United States. Since 2016, The Trade Desk has been a vital platform for leading political advertisers. This year, we expect to gain more share in this segment, and we believe that political spend will increase as the year progresses.\nThe Trade Desk is very well positioned as the advertising industry evolves. We've built our business model on the belief that objectivity and aligning our interest with buyers would matter more and more over time. Objectivity matters more now than it ever has before, and that trend will continue as walled gardens continue to grow their conflict of interest faster than ever. We are executing well, we are poised for growth. 2023 was an excellent year. We expect 2024 to be even stronger. Now I'm going to turn the call over to Laura to discuss our financials.\n\nLaura Schenkein\n\nExecutive Vice President of Financial Planning & Analysis\n\nThank you, Jeff. Before I go through the details of the quarter, I want to build on Jeff's sentiments regarding the strides we've made in 2023 and emphasize the consistency in our strong execution. Over the course of 2022 and 2023, The Trade Desk delivered revenue growth over 20% every quarter against what many would say were a challenging 2 years for the digital advertising industry. Whether it's our work in areas such as CTV, retail data or platform upgrade in Kokai, AI advances in our platform or helping build a new identity and authentication fabric for the open Internet, The Trade Desk remains resilient and we continue to execute efficiently.\nNow on to our results. We ended the year with a strong Q4 and our teams have carried the momentum into the start of the year. Q4 revenue was $606 million, a 23% increase year-over-year. Excluding political election spend, which was a mid-single-digit percent of revenue in Q4 2022, revenue grew 27% year-over-year. I am particularly proud of the $284 million of adjusted EBITDA we generated during the quarter, representing a margin of 47%, which helped drive full year adjusted EBITDA margin to about 40% and full year free cash flow of over $540 million.\nOur results in both Q4 and for the full year 2023 were another example of our ability to grow our top line and gain share while simultaneously investing in our business and platform to support future growth. For 2023, we ended the year with $9.6 billion in spend on our platform and about $1.9 billion in revenue, representing 23% revenue growth. As expected, our take rate in 2023 once again remained within a very consistent historical reach. We continue to execute on the model set out at the company's inception of keeping take rate consistent while substantially increasing the value that our platform provides.\nWe remain focused on our proven strategy of being the default DSP for the open Internet, only representing the buy side and avoiding conflicts too often prevalent in our industry as we continue our progression towards a totable addressable market that is on track to reach $1 trillion. The shift of advertising dollars from linear to connected television continue to be a core driver of our business. In Q4, CTV again represented our fastest growing channel at scale around the world with particularly strong growth internationally. We saw strong momentum in retail media as we won incremental shopper marketing budgets and more advertisers continue to utilize retail data in their campaigns.\nAnd we continue to see positive results from increased utilization of first-party data as the enhancements we've made throughout the year are helping deliver better outcomes for advertisers. From a scale channel perspective in Q4, video, which includes CTV, represented a mid-40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a high 30s percentage share of spend during the quarter. Display represented a low double-digit percent share of our business and audio represented around 5%.\nGeographically, North America represented about 88% of spend and international represented about 12% of spend for the fourth quarter. It's worth noting international growth again outpaced North America for the fourth quarter in a row. As I mentioned, CTV across international regions was particularly strong during the fourth quarter and throughout 2023.\nTurning now to expenses. Q4 operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, were $340 million, up 29% from a year ago. During the quarter, we continued to make investments in our team and platform, particularly in areas like sales and marketing and technology and development as we position the organization for long-term growth. Income tax expense was $63 million in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by our profitability and nondeductible stock-based compensation.\nAdjusted net income for the quarter was $207 million or $0.41 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $91 million and free cash flow was $64 million in Q4. DSOs exiting Q4 were 101 days, down 3 days from a year ago. DPOs were 83 days, also down 3 days from a year ago. We ended the year with a strong cash and liquidity position. Our balance sheet had about $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. We have no debt on the balance sheet.\nFinally, we repurchased $220 million of our Class A common stock via our share repurchase program during Q4. As you have seen in our press release, today, we announced a new authorization under our share repurchase program of up to $700 million, which includes $53 million remaining in the existing authorization. Given the strength of our balance sheet, coupled with the consistent cash flow generation of our business model, we plan to continue opportunistically repurchasing shares and offsetting dilution from employee stock issuances.\nNow turning to our outlook for the first quarter. We continue to see strong spend in our key areas such as CTV and retail media. We estimate Q1 revenue to be at least $478 million, which would represent growth of 25% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $130 million in Q1. In terms of our operating plan, we plan to continue to invest in our business and grow headcount efficiently. Similar to 2023, we expect to grow headcount at a rate slower than revenue growth. Considering our unique ability to generate both strong top line growth and profitability, we continue to manage the business with a balanced perspective that allows us to weight investment opportunities while retaining flexibility for margin improvement.\nIn closing, I'm very pleased with our performance in 2023 and are set up in 2024. We are executing to capture growth within key secular drivers like CTV and shopper marketing. We're amassing industry support and partnerships for UID2 and OpenPath. Our international business is poised to continue helping drive our growth. We continue to gain share within the political vertical heading into the U.S. presidential election cycle. We're adding more value for our customers with our biggest product release ever with Kokai, and we continue to innovate our platform. We enter 2024 in a strong position to grow and gain more share. We remain optimistic about the prospects for our business this year and in the years to come. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions."

We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provides a more meaningful representation of the company's operational performance. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\n\nJeffrey Terry Green\n\nFounder, President, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Trade Desk, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. As you've seen from our press release, we posted very strong growth in the third quarter. We reported revenue of $493 million, growing 25% compared with last year. Our third quarter again accelerated over the second quarter as we continued to significantly outperform the digital advertising industry. We're growing our revenues and maintaining profitability and a strong balance sheet and making large investments and, most importantly, we're gaining market share as we're outperforming our advertising peers, both big and small.\nFrom a global view, our industry is nearing the $1 trillion TAM we predicted when we launched as a public company 7 years ago. Inflation, a global pandemic, the streaming wars, and retail media have all accelerated the expansion of that global TAM, but it's especially accelerated the speed of the pace setter, the U.S. market. Magna Global estimates that the overall U.S. advertising industry is growing at 5% this year, and digital spend or the digital ad market pie is expected to grow by 10%. Clearly, we are significantly outperforming the rest of the advertising market. This builds on our market share gains from last year when we grew 20%-plus each quarter, and our competitors were posting negative to low single-digit growth.\nSo even with a bit more uncertainty than a usual Q4, we continue to gain significant share and we are set up exceptionally well for times of relative stability. As I often share with the teams at TTD, we got here by aligning our interest with agencies and brands, the buy side. We align our interests with them and then we obsessively innovate for them. We create more value than we extract, and we operate our business with a philosophy that is people-first. Our bias is to find win-win situations in all of our partnerships, and our strong alignment with our customers is the foundation of our success, and that foundation has created the opportunity for us to be a leader and innovator for the open Internet.\n2023 has already been the biggest year of innovation in the history of The Trade Desk, and I'd like to share 6 or 7 major categories of innovation and investment. The first innovation I want to highlight today is a relatively new format for partnership. Our unmatched growth rate is fueled by signing joint business plans with major brands and agencies. JVPs represent joint innovation partnerships with our clients. Agencies and brands work closely with us to pioneer new ways of thinking about data-driven advertising, and they are locking in that commitment as part of these JVPs. Our largest JVP signed this year represent future annual spend of over $1 billion per partnership. Yes, multiple partnerships have multiyear partnership agreements with omnichannel plans to spend $1 billion-plus in each of them.\nOur strong relationships and share gains, coupled with durable EBITDA and cash generation, means we can invest in innovation in service of our clients while also maintaining strong profitability. Our innovations in 2018 and '19 and 2020 helped us gain share during 2020 and 2021. And that's why I expect we will continue to gain share in Q4 of this year and 2024 and beyond. As a global company, in tough economic environments, we grab market share, and in vibrant economic environments, we aim to lead in absolute growth.\nThe second area of innovation I want to highlight is in AI. We've approached AI the same way we approached building the initial buying platform 14 years ago. While everyone else was on stage talking about building, we were back at the office actually building. AI has immense promise. It will change the world again. But not everyone talking about AI is delivering something real or impactful. We have been going through every part of our platform and making investments and/or plans to inject AI in the places where data sets are rich, big and high quality.\nLarge language models, the basis of ChatGPT, aren't the highest priority places for us to make investments in AI right now. Deep learning models pointed at bidding, pricing, value and ad relevance are perfect places for us to concentrate our investment in AI. All 4 categories have private betas and some of the best engineers on the world pointed at these opportunities. We've expanded Koa, our brand for AI products that we launched in 2018, and I believe this will unlock performance budgets on our platform in the years to come. We will begin to see the impact of these 2023 AI investments in 2024.\nWhen I first mentioned the massive wave of opportunity in 2019 and 2020, one of the major factors in the size of that wave was the rapidly emerging world of CTV. As we all know, the pandemic accelerated the shift to CTV from a viewer perspective. And now we're at a point where more viewers are watching streaming services than traditional linear television. The global changes of 2020 and 2021 ushered in a period of innovation in CTV. As an industry and as a company, we crammed more advances into 2 years than might otherwise have been played out over a much longer period of time.\nWhere once the industry was taking a wait-and-see approach to the emergence of streaming, suddenly everyone was innovating fast. Fortunately, we had a history of innovating ahead. With that same foresight, I believe the walled garden strategy will not work for most companies, if any, at end state. Competition, innovation and the benefits of globally integrated markets outweigh the benefits of Draconian walled gardens. The surest way to prove the value of the open Internet is to continue to innovate in the third and fourth and fifth innovations that I want to talk about today: CTV, identity, and retail media.\nOur innovations in CTV have fueled our outsized growth and made us a better partner for all of the content companies. The last few years, consumers and media companies have been in the new golden age of TV. Content companies have been competing for streaming subscriber growth, which seemingly has provided the scoreboard determining winners and losers in the new digital era. That competition to win subscribers has ratcheted up content costs. Higher content costs mean raising prices or finding some way to raise revenue per user if media companies were going to continue to feed their content engines with a similar rate as before.\nEvery premium video content company from Disney to Paramount to NBCU and Sky to Netflix have changed pricing and embraced advertising. Not all of them have yet embraced or centered around programmatic advertising, but we predict they will. In order to get incremental subscribers, they can't simply keep raising prices. Some consumers would rather spend a few extra minutes, considering ads they watch that pay more for subscriptions. High-priced subscriptions alone will not provide the incremental subscribers media companies need to continue growing.\nAs recently reported by Hollywood and I quote, \"Executives at every major streaming giant with both an ad-supported and an ad-free tier, including Disney, Netflix, Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery and NBCU say that the total revenue per user is higher on the ad-supported plan than it is on the ad-free plan. Not only do media companies generate more revenue per user within an ad-supported option but the potential for growth is much greater. Ultimately, there's a limit to how much viewers will spend on subscriptions.\nEconomic pressures on the consumer right now are increasing the appeal of a free or low-cost option that is supported by ads. However, this model is only sustainable if the ad load is significantly lower than traditional linear television. And the only way we get there is if the ads are relevant to the viewer so that the advertisers are willing to pay more for each of them. It's why we work closely with the world's largest streaming services to fully realize the value of that exchange. This includes freeing up competitive biddable inventory, advancing new approaches to identity, unleashing the power of first- and third-party data and, of course, the technology infrastructure to transact and measure.\nIn CTV, we have innovated by constructing a more efficient supply chain by creating a new product, OpenPath. It celebrated its first birthday this year and has already become a gold standard of transparency and auction integrity. We've also advanced TV measurement with the launch of TV QI, the TV Quality Index, to showcase the value of premium TV content over UGC platforms like YouTube that advertise on more questionable content for brands. We believe the ads we show in CTV in 2023 are more relevant in CTV than they've ever been before in TV or premium video.\nAs the value of these innovations has proven out in the CTV advertising market day after day, we continue to see more premium inventory flow into our platform. Disney, for example, just opened Disney+ inventory for us across Europe. More and more live sports inventory, perhaps the crown jewel for most streaming providers, is opening up for programmatic buying on our platform, with billions of avails every single week. For the first few weeks of the football season, for example, we are averaging more than 300 advertisers activating on the NBC Sunday Night Football live stream.\nA great example of an advertiser pioneering new approaches to TV advertising with a focus on live sports is Old Navy. They have been a long-time participant in the upfront process. With their agency, PhD, Old Navy wanted to embrace CTV as more of their target audience has shifted to streaming. At first, they moved part of their spend from insertion order to programmatic guaranteed and consolidated spend on our platform. In doing so, they were able to mitigate audience overlap across TV providers and hold each provider more accountable for performance.\nBut as Old Navy quickly found out, programmatic guaranteed has limitations. Programmatic guaranteed, or PG, does not allow Old Navy to get the full value of programmatic such as frequency management, audience targeting and the ability to layer on their first-party data. So they took the next step in the form of decision biddable buying within the private marketplace and focused on live sports inventory. CTV live sports advertising was appealing because it offered an opportunity to expose their brand against very high premium content that might be more restrictive and expensive in a traditional linear environment.\nThey were able to use Koa, The Trade Desk's AI, to optimize pacing and frequency management across the highest-performing inventory. As a result, they saw a 70% reduction in the cost to reach each unique household versus their programmatic guaranteed performance. And we're just scratching the surface. As recently reported in the current, NBCUniversal has teamed up with the Walmart DSP, which partners with The Trade Desk so brands can now deliver targeted ads on Peacock live sports inventory using Walmart shopper data. Brands can then measure and provide attribution on the results of those ads in terms of impact and in-store and online sales. So now, North America, which includes brands such as Dannon, Silk and Activa, reported a 30-plus percent increase in new-to-brand buyers from their CTV campaign earlier this year.\nThe next phase of innovation in CTV is the development of a forward market product on our platform. We are investing significant resources to build this product, which is akin to a futures market but for premium CTV inventory. Here, we bring the best of the traditional upfront guarantee and combine it with the power of data-driven decisioning or programmatic advertising. Advertisers commit to certain levels of spend on specific audiences in a decision programmatic forward market. We are already active in live beta with a number of CTV providers and advertisers and expect the testing to steadily increase throughout 2024. We're excited to provide more details on our forward market innovations at our Forward '24 event in the first half of next year.\nThe advances in CTV in 2023 for The Trade Desk have been accelerated by the fourth category of innovation I want to discuss today, identity. With Google's latest disclosure that they plan to deprecate cookies in 2024, the industry has been more focused than ever on coalescing around a better alternative. Nearly all of the major streaming companies in the U.S. have embraced UID2. They understand that if advertisers only advertise on users likely to be interested in their products, then advertisers will pay meaningfully more for those impressions. With UID2, content owners don't have to share data. Instead, advertisers can use their own data, and to do so, they're willing to pay more.\nOne leading streaming platform recently implemented UID2 and the results have been remarkable. Their average daily revenue from The Trade Desk has increased 150%. Their average daily revenue when those impressions are open and biddable, has increased 222% and all because they are able to offer advertisers a much clearer sense of relevance and addressability. Again, because of rising cost of content and less appetite from consumers to pay for more subscriptions, every global content company in the world is now rolling out a programmatic advertising strategy and plan. As a result, more and more publishers and advertisers are now deploying UID2.\nOver the last couple of years, a who's who of major publishers, advertisers and data partners have announced their commitment to UID2, and now we're seeing the positive impact of adoption on our platform. Luxury Escapes is a high-end travel agency with more than 7 million customers worldwide. They activated their first-party data on our platform and then used UID2 to help find potential new customers who shared characteristics with the most loyal customers they already had. In this way, their first-party data acted as a seed to grow their potential customer base.\nAnd the results were very impressive. In the U.S. alone, their conversion rate with UID2 was more than 400% higher than with cookies. Their return on ad spend was 900% higher and their cost per acquisition was 83% lower. For the first time ever, in 2024, we expect the majority of CTV and premium video impressions to be bought on our platform using either EUID or UID2.\nThe fifth innovation I wanted to highlight today is the rapid innovating we're doing in retail media and retail data partnerships. The fusion of retail and programmatic advertising has accelerated in the wake of the pandemic. Our partnerships with Walmart, Target, Albertsons, Instacart and many, many more have fueled the expansions of our TAM in the United States. Schwartz and Ocado have been notable catalysts in the EU. Incidentally, the EU programmatic advertising ecosystem is showing signs of improvement, in part brought on by the appeal of retail partnership.\nAnd lastly, Big Basket and Tokopedia are examples of growing synergies between programmatic advertising and retail media in some of the largest APAC markets. Just as stay-at-home directives encouraged many of us to shift our viewing habits to binge streaming, they also forced many of us to shift our shopping habits to e-commerce. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, e-commerce sales boomed 43% in 2020 alone, and it has continued to grow every year since. As a result, advertising on e-commerce destinations has become more attractive and the value of data collected about purchase behaviors has become much more valuable.\nAll major retailers are working on activating that data for advertisers, so brands can understand how their advertising dollars impact actual sales, whether online or in-store and most of them are partnering with us. The significance of this shift should not go unstated. All advertisers are focused at their core on driving sales growth. But until very recently, especially in the consumer space, advertisers have been missing the link between their advertising dollars and the real-world sales growth. Instead, they have had to use proxy metrics to showcase the ROI of their campaigns. How many click-throughs did their ads strive for example.\nBut now we can measure with much more precision whether the ad dollars actually led to a consumer purchase. We can attribute value to all parts of the funnel, not just the last touch. We can understand the relevance of every ad impression more clearly, and we can better prioritize the right channel at the right time for the right audience.\nThe open Internet is proving to be increasingly preferred by big brands as retail media makes the efficacy of the open Internet continue to improve and scale. Rossmann, a major European drugstore chain, came to us when they wanted to drive first sales for their organic food brand. They knew that if consumers tried their product, there's a 95% chance of them becoming repeat customers. The challenge was getting them to make that first purchase. Working with us, they were able to deploy their first-party data and then find where their target audience groups might be across the open Internet.\nWith data-driven precision, they were able to determine that 99% of their ad spend was hitting their specific target audience. And more major retail organizations continue to partner with us as the most effective way to enable advertisers to benefit from their data. Just last month, Instacart, one of the world's largest retail technology companies representing more than 1,400 retail labels, announced that it will make its retail media data available to advertisers on The Trade Desk.\nAt the same time, we continue to innovate in the retail space. As a part of Kokai, we have launched the Retail Sales Index, which allows advertisers to understand the performance of the retail campaigns across the open Internet. It radically simplifies the measurement and attribution process in a rapidly evolving market, and we are just scratching the surface. As one of the few independent players at scale in our industry, we are in the pole position to continue partnering with leading retailers, standardize their data on our platform and drive value for our clients.\nLet me conclude by making a few comments about the current environment and then connect the dots of innovation and our optimism for the future. We represent the vast majority of the Ad Age top 200 advertisers, the largest advertisers in the world. Starting in the second week of October, we have seen some transitory cautiousness across some of those advertisers. These include, for example, industries that have been impacted by recent strikes such as the U.S. auto industry. Through the first week of November, we have seen spend stabilize, and we are optimistic for the remainder of the year and for 2024.\nBoth CTV and retail media continued to drive our business and we continue to win share. In terms of innovation, I am so excited to showcase the strength of this company over the next few years as we've innovated and built more this year than in any year in our history, while at the same time, preserving and leaving room to expand our operating leverage. The many innovations I've discussed today are embedded in our newest version of the platform, Kokai. We've been launching Kokai innovations throughout the year, but many of the biggest innovations, including our new UX, are in alphas or private betas today and will roll out to all of our customers in the first half of next year.\nAs we exit 2023 and look forward to 2024, I want to highlight several specific areas that make me extremely positive about our future prospects. So let me sum up. First, agencies and brands are more deliberate with advertising budgets. They are shifting ad budgets to where they can be more flexible, agile and data-driven in everything they do, especially in times of uncertainty, and this is driving them to sign JVPs with us at a record pace.\nSecond is the innovation coming from AI and the many, many opportunities we have ahead of us to find places to inject AI into what may be the most rich and underappreciated data asset on the Internet, which we have here at The Trade Desk. Third, Connected TV continues to be the fastest-growing channel of our business and a key driver of overall omnichannel growth, and it's not just here in the U.S. CTV continues to grow rapidly, both in EMEA and across Asia. The industry is evolving fast as providers shift inventory into biddable marketplaces to maximize ad revenue and as advertisers look to bring more precision and addressability to their TV campaigns.\nFourth, retail media has become one of the fastest-growing areas of our business and we expect this to continue in 2024. Retail media is revolutionizing the way many advertisers in the CPG space think about measurement and attribution, and our innovation is at the center of this. Fifth, global expansion. We have made significant investments outside the U.S. over the last several years in our go-to-market strategy in CTV and in retail media. We believe we are in a position to continue to accelerate our international growth in many of the markets we serve.\nSixth is the rapid adoption of UID2 and EUID as the currency for relevant ads and personalized content that has been adopted by the infrastructure of the Internet and nearly all of the biggest content companies in the world. Seventh is the upcoming U.S. political election. Since 2016, The Trade Desk has been a vital platform for leading political advertisers. In 2024, we expect to gain more share in this segment, and we believe that spend will increase as the year progresses. And finally, we continue to be one of the few high-growth technology companies that consistently generate strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow that has steadily increased over the years. As a result, we have been able to invest in innovation and generate strong profitability.\nI believe The Trade Desk has been successful because we have always focused on delivering premium value to advertisers and agencies. Everything we do, including our latest Kokai innovations, are pointed at helping brands and advertisers get the maximum being for every advertising dollar. I could not be more confident or excited about how we are positioned for 2024 and beyond because of the many growth drivers that we've discussed today. We will continue to innovate to lead the market, and I'm confident that the world's leading advertisers will continue to default to our platform as they seek to drive their own business growth via advertising. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Laura, who will give you more color on the quarter.\n\nLaura Schenkein\n\nExecutive Vice President of Financial Planning & Analysis\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good afternoon. As you have seen in our Q3 results, we have continued to execute extremely well. During the quarter, we continued to grab share and outpace our peers. We delivered accelerating year-over-year revenue growth, managed our expenses efficiently and delivered strong adjusted EBITDA and cash flow. Our results are a reflection of the premium advertisers are placing on precision, agility and transparency as they continue to shift away from linear media and walled gardens.\nRevenue in Q3 was $493 million, representing growth of 25% year-over-year, an acceleration from the prior quarter. Excluding U.S. political election spend, which represented a low single-digit percent of spend in Q3 2022, our revenue growth rate in Q3 of this year was about 27% on a year-over-year basis. We continue to win spend as marketers increasingly focus their investment on platforms that deliver value, particularly in premium video like CTV. This is a dynamic we've seen many times over the years. When the macro environment presents challenges, brands shift to platforms and channels that offer flexibility and measurable results.\nDuring the third quarter, CTV led our growth from a scaled channel perspective once again. We saw strong momentum in retail media as we won incremental shopper marketing budgets and brought the Retail Sales Index to market. International spend growth accelerated off a strong Q2 with notably strong performance in CTV. With the strong top line performance in Q3, we generated approximately $200 million in adjusted EBITDA or about 40% of revenue. This led to free cash flow of $184 million in Q3, marking over $600 million of free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis. I'm proud of our ability to generate strong profitability while continuing to invest in our business as that will help fund our future growth.\nBecause of our fortunate position within an incredibly large addressable market, one of our greatest responsibilities is ensuring that we are growing sustainably while also generating sufficient profitability and cash flow. Our team has done a remarkable job achieving this as we balance short-term opportunities with our long-term financial vision.\nFrom a scale channel perspective, CTV, by a wide margin, led our growth again during the quarter. In Q3, video, which includes CTV, represented a mid-40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a mid-30s percentage share of spend during the quarter. Display continued to represent a low double-digit percent share of our business, and audio represented around 5%.\nGeographically, North America represents about 87% of our business in Q3, and international represented about 13%. We are very pleased that international growth slightly outpaced North America for the third quarter in a row. CTV across EMEA and North Asia was very strong during the quarter, growing over 100% year-over-year in each region. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, we continued to see strong performance in food and drink, travel and automotive. Health and fitness and business were below the average.\nTurning now to expenses. Excluding stock-based compensation, operating expenses in Q3 were $316 million, up 29% year-over-year. During the third quarter, we continued to invest in our team, our platform and our infrastructure to support sustained growth. Income tax expense was $18 million for the third quarter, driven primarily by our pretax profitability and nondeductible stock-based compensation.\nAdjusted net income was $167 million or $0.33 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $192 million for Q3 and free cash flow was $184 million. DSOs exiting the quarter were 91 days, down about 1 day from a year ago. DPOs were 75 days, up about 1 day from a year ago. In Q3, via our share repurchase program, we repurchased and retired 1.2 million shares for an aggregate repurchase amount of $90 million. We exited the third quarter with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.5 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet.\nTurning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. First, we continue to see strong spend in our key areas such as CTV and retail media. That said, we have seen more macroeconomic uncertainty at the start of Q4. We estimate Q4 revenue to be at least $580 million, which would represent growth of 18% on a year-over-year basis. Excluding U.S. political election spend, which represented a mid-single-digit percent of spend in Q4 2022, our estimated revenue growth rate in Q4 of this year would be about 22% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $270 million in Q4.\nIn closing, we are extremely pleased with our strong performance in the third quarter and we are cautiously optimistic for Q4. We continue to demonstrate our ability to drive momentum across our company priorities, achieve profitable growth and drive significant share gains. Regardless of what the macro brings, we believe we have never been in a better position than we are in today. With large growth drivers, including the ongoing secular shift to CTV, upgrading measurement with retail data, our biggest product release ever with Kokai, growth in international markets, an identity framework that has never been stronger, the U.S. presidential election cycle, amongst others, we remain optimistic for the remainder of Q4 and into 2024. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions."

Welcome to The Trade Desk Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call.\n[Operator Instructions]\nPlease note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Chris Toth. Please proceed.\n\nChris Toth\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Hello, and good afternoon to everyone.\nWelcome to The Trade Desk Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today are Founder and CEO, Jeff Green; and Chief Financial Officer, Laura Schenkein.\nA copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements, which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties.\nThese forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. Actual results may vary significantly, and we expressly assume no obligations to update any of our forward-looking statements. Should any of our beliefs or assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements.\nI encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provide a more meaningful representation of the company's operational performance.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\n\nJeffrey Terry Green\n\nFounder, President, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Trade Desk, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today.\nAs you've seen from our press release, we posted very strong growth in the second quarter. We reported revenue of $464 million growing 23% compared with last year. This also represents an acceleration in our growth rate compared with the first quarter. And just like the last few quarters, we continue to significantly outperform the digital advertising industry. What's particularly notable about our performance is that most advertisers are still dealing with some degree of uncertainty in their business.\nEven though certain macro indicators are improving, there's still a sense from many advertisers that we are in an unpredictable environment. For them, it's hard to dismiss what we've been through over the last 2 to 3 years with the global pandemic, ramp inflation, supply chain crises and banking system uncertainty, and of course, global rebalancing.\nNone of these market dynamics have been very predictable the last few years. And this year, like the last few, has similarly had lots of never-before macro events. So while many indicators and advertiser sentiments are improving, there's also a sense that it's more difficult than ever to predict what's coming next.\nBut in this environment, marketers have learned that data-driven precision can bring a sense of certainty and reliability to their advertising efforts. Because of the innovations we brought to market in areas such as retail media, CTV, identity and data, advertisers have a clearer sense than ever of the performance and impact of their ad campaigns. And with Kokai, we are delivering even more innovation, all in service of helping advertisers drive precision, relevance and certainty in everything they do.\nAs a result, we are winning more business with both new and existing customers. We are signing more multiyear joint business plans, or JBPs, with leading agencies and brands representing spend projections in future years well into the billions of dollars. Our relative outperformance over the last few quarters means we have gained more market share than in any other period in our company's history. Advertisers have become more deliberate with their spend and have increasingly gravitated to our platform and as they understand more about the power of programmatic, they are choosing the objectivity and performance of our platform over the murkiness of Walled Gardens more than ever before.\nEven as we continue to grow and scale around the world, we see no deviation from our 95%-plus retention rate. Our clients rely on us more and more. I was at the Cann Advertising Festival a few weeks ago, and I could have filled my calendar several times over with brand CMOs, agency leaders and CEOs of our key partners, all of whom want to understand how we can work more closely together every year, demand for the value that we deliver continues to grow. Perhaps what's most interesting right now is how marketers are seeking a sense of certainty in an uncertain environment.\nMuch of the product rollouts and partnership growth we've seen this year is because we're giving our clients certainty and reliability that they can't get elsewhere. This shows up all over our client base and all over our platform, but I'd like to talk today about a few places where the certainty and reliability is really driving our relative outperformance particularly in retail media, CTV and identity.\nBy discussing these 3, I believe it will provide some insight as to why we continue to outperform the market, why I believe we'll continue to outperform the market and why we continue to invest in our platform with all the innovations coming from Tokai.\nSo first, let me talk about retail media, which has become one of the fastest-growing areas of our business. Much like CTV, our rapid growth in retail media starts with our focus on objectivity. Retailers know we're only here to serve advertisers and to drive more precision and efficacy in ad campaigns. We don't compete with them. And like all of our partners, retailers know, we are careful and objective stewards of their data. As you know, Walmart was one of the first early major retailers to understand the power of their data and to help advertisers understand and measure the connection between campaign spend and actual consumer purchases.\nFor many advertisers, there's no clear measurement of performance than that. You can look at all kinds of traditional marketing KPIs, but there's nothing more powerful than knowing that a consumer bought your product because of the ad you serve and then using that data to improve marketing spend in the future. One of the great recent examples of this is Fruit of the Loom, working with our agency, GSD&M, Fruit of the Loom wanted to reach new and existing customers to increase sales with a back-to-school promotion.\nThey were targeting a 200% return on ad spend, or ROAS, Working with the Walmart DSP and The Trade Desk, they were able to predict audiences with much more precision and were able to understand in real time, how ads in different channels were performing.\nThey could then shift campaign dollars to those channels that were actually driving consumer purchases. This clear line of sight helps Fruit of the Loom vastly exceed their campaign goals, delivering a 1,200% return on ad spend among existing customers and more than 1,000% rollouts with new customers. Eric Mahoney is Fruit of the Loom's Digital Marketing Manager. He said, and I quote, \"historically, we've done a really good job of reaching our brand purchasers. But working with the Walmart DSP allowed us to reach that new consumer through predictive audience segments. We could not have achieved these results without Walmart DSP and The Trade Desk.\" He also said that working with The Trade Desk is like putting on a fresh pair of underwear. Of all the accolades we've received over the years that is definitely one of my favorites ever.\nThe gravitational pull of retail media is not limited to the U.S. retailers around the world are working with The Trade Desk in different ways to unleash the power of their data to help advertisers bring more value to their campaigns. In Singapore, we partnered with [indiscernible], the largest grocery chain there with 570 stores serving 90% of the country's population.\nOne of the first brands to leverage fair price shopper data on our platform was Coca-Cola, who wanted to reach customers during the festive Lunar New Year season. They also wanted to be able to measure the performance of low-funnel marketing outreach across multiple channels, including OTT, audio, digital out-of-home and of course, open Internet display.\nThe campaigns have into [indiscernible] audience segments via our platform, targeting [indiscernible] customers who have purchased Coke or other Coke products over the past 1 to 3 months. They were able to target seasonal shoppers who purchased bested products and optimize in real time to the news and lifestyle channels that delivered the best results. With their agency, Essence Mediacom, Coke was able to drive 189% uplift in sales during the campaign. They were also able to measure consumer reaction in a range of new ways, including the time it takes for a consumer to buy a product following different kinds of ad exposures, audience engagement from different channels and heart values of first time and repeat buyers.\nThe retail media opportunity is also growing exponentially for us in Europe. In recent quarters, we've talked about our partnerships with leading retailers such as Ocado and TESSCO. And just a few weeks ago, we announced a partnership with Europe's largest retail group, Schwartz, which includes major brands such as Kaufman and Little.\nFrom an advertising perspective, retail media is something that's really taken off over the last 2 years. It's no coincidence that the growing interest in retail media coincides with growing advertiser focus on authenticated ad environments. With retail media, advertisers can start with precise authenticated data whether that data is based on purchase history or loyalty data. From there, the advertiser can target based on what they know and then do more accurate data-driven modeling to expand targeting segments with greater precision. Some of the same dynamics are behind the rapid growth of CTV advertising.\nAs we have all seen in recent weeks, there is a ton of focus right now on the business model of TV. What is the future of the linear TV model? And how does the TV industry create sustainable, profitable business models for streaming TV as viewers shift there in mass. I believe the answer will come in fully exploring the authenticated viewer data that sits at the core of the CTV ecosystem, which is something that today's leading media companies are exploring.\nFor the past couple of years, CTV has been one of our fastest-growing channels at scale. There are a range of reasons for that. Fundamentally, video remains the most effective way for brands to influence the hearts and minds of consumers. And with CTV, brands can apply data to their TV campaigns and measure with much more precision, the effectiveness of every odd dollar.\nAnd much like retail, advertisers value the authenticated audiences that come with CTV, pretty much every streaming TV viewer is logged in with an e-mail address. For advertisers, this means more certainty. It also creates a new starting point centered on data. These dual forces of retail and CTV are truly bringing the power of data-driven decisioning home for advertisers, and it is accelerating their shift to programmatic on our platform.\nWhereas in the early years of programmatic, we were looking to find ways to fix data to campaigns. Today, we use data as a starting point for campaigns. Instead of hunting for ad opportunities with data, The Trade Desk at marketers are starting with data to know which media opportunities we should hunt for. It's a different dynamic and it's one that's become more prominent as advertisers seek more certainty in an uncertain and unpredictable environment.\nAs I said, media companies generally understand the value of authenticated user data. And this is a major reason why the top streaming companies in the U.S. have pretty much all integrated with UID2 or are planning to. The latest was Warner Bros' Discovery, who announced at [ Cann ] that they will integrate UID2 across all of their streaming properties, including MAX and Discovery Plus. The broad embrace of UID2 across the CTV ecosystem has been driven in part by a key economic factor. Streaming leaders need to unleash the value of their authenticated data for advertisers in order to create as much precision and relevant as possible, thereby maximizing their CPMs.\nIn order for the streaming business model to thrive and for media companies to keep pace in the content arms race, they need to maximize advertising revenue. As we have seen with every streaming platform launching an ad-supported service, a subscription-based approach is not enough. And the only way to maximize advertising revenue is to increase precision and relevance.\nWith UID2, the advertiser can start with authenticated data, enrich that with our own and third-party data and then where they can find the right relevant audience, they will pay a meaningfully higher price.\nAs Tim Sims outlined during our Investor Day, where advertisers are able to bid with certainty based on relevance and precision, the value of each impression increases significantly, generally, exponentially. Ultimately, this is how we will answer some of the vexing questions that have been swirling around the TV industry recently. And while we are still in the early days of the CTV advertising revolution, I'm confident that emerging innovations on our platform, such as a forward market for CTV advertising will only accelerate advertisers' ability and appetite to fund this amazing new golden age of TV.\nIt's also worth pointing out that this is an increasingly global trend. At Cann this year, for example, we announced a new partnership with RTL, one of the largest pan-European media companies. Through this partnership, our international advertisers will have exclusive programmatic access to RTL's addressable linear and Connected TV inventory. We are starting with inventory across Germany, Spain, France and Austria with more European markets to Polycom.\nThis represents our most significant step yet into the European CTV market. It's also indicative of how the major European media companies are keeping pace with changing viewer preferences and advertiser demand to meet viewers where they are and where they are most leaned in.\nAs many of you have seen, we had a lot to say about retail and CTV during our recent Kokai launch. And I'd just like to take a moment to put that in perspective. Because as advertisers increasingly prioritize CTV and retail, it's critical that we continue to innovate in our platform so that we surface value for our users as intuitively as possible. One way Kokai accomplishes this is with a series of new indexes or benchmarks that help advertisers understand and measure performance. In the retail arena, we launched the retail sales index. The RSI helps advertisers understand the impact of their retail media spend across multiple retailers at once.\nIn this way, we are massively reducing the complexity of measuring ad campaigns that run across multiple retail data sets. Now advertisers can understand which retail environments perform better at different times in which channels or which kinds of creatives, all in 1 place. And in doing so, we are providing a level of objectivity and measurement from the bottom of the funnel all the way to the top, that is simply not possible within a walled garden. In addition to that, we also announced a few pioneering retailers who are making retail measurement available for free in our platform if the advertiser has activated their retail data for targeting. These retailers include Walgreens, Dollar General and Albertsons.\nThis is a major step forward in bringing the full value of retail media to bear in service of greater precision and certainty. In the CTV space, we launched the TV Quality Index, or TVQI. As the CTV advertising market has multiplied in terms of inventory, there are some who would have you believe that a piece of user-generated content has the same quality in the eyes of the viewer as professionally produced content or live sports.\nYes, I know there are some UGC influencers who have millions of followers that some brands may target from time to time. But that's a very small slice of UGC. The vast bulk of it is very unattractive, and sometimes even unsafe, programmed advertisers. The TVQI helps advertisers understand the value of the impressions they are buying in the context of the quality of the content those impressions are served against.\nThe index shows that for every 10-point improvement in quality there is a 15-point improvement in conversion rates. Sometimes it's even higher than that. And for our own campaigns for The Trade Desk, in the second quarter of this year, as we were beta testing TVQI, we found that a 19-point increase in the index score resulted in a 50-point improvement in our conversion rate.\nIf you're a marketing leader, these are substantial performance improvements. I mentioned those 2 elements of Kokai because they're important to understand in the context of CPD and retailer as more advertisers gravitate to CTV and retail because they offer more certainty in starting advertising campaigns based on authenticated audience data, these Kokai innovations provide more certainty through the course of the campaign in terms of measurement and performance optimization.\nOf course, there are many other aspects of Kokai that we unveiled on [ 06/06 ], some of which are live and many of which we will be launching in the next few months. These indexes and other innovations, especially around the application of AI across our platform [ are helping us ] surface value more intuitively to advertisers.\nWe are revamping our U.S. so that the campaign setup and optimization experience is even more intuitive with data next to decisions at every step. And we're making it easier than ever for thousands of data, inventory, measurement and media partners to integrate with us.\nIn doing so, I believe that The Trade Desk will become an essential innovation hub of the open Internet. I'd like to end on this point because I think it's important to reiterate that there are many things we do at The Trade Desk that are not in our immediate business interest. UID2, for example, is an innovation we devised about 3 years ago and promptly gave it away to the industry.\nWe're seeing broad adoption across the data and inventory ecosystems of the open internet and accelerating use by advertisers. In many ways, the industry is looking at innovations like UID2 as a core element of the flight to certainty that is driving a lot of advertiser action today. If an advertiser has certainty that they are reaching the right person across all channels, they will prioritize that ad buy. CTV and retail are major advancements in this regard, but UID2 is a major building block of this new cross-channel identity fabric too.\nThis is particularly important as there has recently been a lot of speculation regarding the potential demise of third-party cookies in Chrome in early 2024. A lot of the speculation reminds me of the frenzy in 2017 when Safari deprecated cookies or more recently in 2021 when Apple made its IDFA changes. Each time I have stated that none of this will have a significant material effect on our business, and that was true. I've said many times that I'm not sure that it's in Google's best interest to get rid of third-party cookies because of the harmful impact it will likely have on publishers that have not implemented a strong identity strategy.\nBut while it matters a lot to many browser-based publishers, in the long run, it really doesn't matter that much to us. Advertisers will increasingly select at opportunities where they can act with certainty and leverage their own data. That's why I've spent so much time today talking about CTV, retail and UID2 as they have become essential building blocks of the open Internet.\nOn the supply side, we developed OpenPath, to provide our clients with a direct transparent path to inventory. This is just the latest effort by the Trade Desk to improve supply-side transparency and objectivity and we now have thousands of destinations across the open Internet, integrating with OpenPath. And when advertisers see an OpenPath channel to inventory, they are more likely to select it versus the 8 to 10 alternative paths to that same impression because there's more certainty. And now integrating with UID2, OpenPath, where any number of other innovations or offerings on our platform is easier than ever with Kokai.\nWe believe that to truly optimize the value of the open Internet, there are many ways in which the industry needs to innovate together. So we can provide advertisers as an ecosystem with more certainty, transparency and objectivity. In recent weeks, we've heard even more about the alleged dubious behavior of Walled Gardens, whether it's from the European Commission or independent research reports. Advertisers and media companies are increasingly aware that they need to work with technology partners who represent their interest, not conflicts of interest.\nAs a result, advertising dollars are shifting to our platform. and we will continue to invest in our platform and push the industry to create even more value for advertisers on the open internet. Our recent outperformance is not a temporary blip I believe it is the start of a reassessment of the value of the Internet, particularly from an advertiser's perspective, and they could not be more excited about the growth opportunity that is in front of us in the years ahead as a result.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it over to Laura to cover our financials.\n\nLaura Schenkein\n\nExecutive Vice President of Financial Planning & Analysis\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone.\nFor nearly the past 10 years, I've experienced firsthand all of the incredible work from The Trade Desk teams around the world that produce our outstanding performance that have enabled us to manage the right balance between strong growth and significant profitability. I'm proud to present our results today and going forward.\nWith that, on to the numbers. As you've seen in our results, Q2 was a strong quarter. Revenue was $464 million, representing growth of 23% year-over-year, accelerating from the prior quarter. Excluding U.S. political election spend, which represented a low single-digit percent of spend in Q2 2022, our revenue growth rate in Q2 of this year was about 24.5% on a year-over-year basis. Visibility and advertiser sentiment continued to improve throughout the quarter, and we continue to gain share as marketers increasingly focus their investments on areas where data is deployed effectively where AI and decisioning produce high ROI and where results are measurable and transparent.\nOur growth continued to be driven by the shift of budgets to Connected TV and increasing use of retail data. Because of our objectivity and our connectivity to nearly every major CTV content provider, our platform is the most eligible for the tidal wave of demand as it shifts away from linear and Walled Gardens.\nIn retail media, many of the largest retailers around the world are now our partners and more and more brands and agencies are taking advantage of this powerful data in their campaigns. We also continue to benefit from the trust we've built with our clients, launching innovative products in the interest of the demand side, paving cleaner path to supply and cultivating industry-wide support for improved identity solutions like UID2 and EUID.\nDuring the second quarter, Growth was broad-based across channels, verticals and regions. CTV led our growth from a scale channel perspective once again. We saw strong momentum again in Retail Media as we launched integrations with more retailers and on incremental shopper marketing budgets. International spend growth accelerated off a strong Q1 with notably strong performance in CTV. And with the launch of Kokai in early June, we are well positioned for the second half of the year and 2024 as visibility and advertiser sentiment improve.\nWith the strong top line performance in Q2, we generated approximately $180 million in adjusted EBITDA or about 39% of revenue. When we outperform on the top line, we often see that outperformance throughout all our financial statements as was the case again in Q2. This outperformance led to free cash flow of $119 million in Q2. Our unique ability to generate meaningfully positive EBITDA and cash flow continues to put us in a strong position as we look ahead and invest in the critical areas of the business that will drive our growth in the years to come. This is an area I'm intently focused on, making certain that our productivity and efficiency remains best-in-class as we scale as we manage both industry-leading growth and significant profitability.\nI believe this is a critical factor to our success in the next phase of growth. From a scale channel perspective, CTV, by a wide margin, led our growth again during the quarter. In Q2, video, which includes CTV represented a mid-40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow as a percentage of our mix.\nMobile represented a mid-30 percentage share of spend during the quarter. Display continued to represent a low double-digit percent share of our business and audio represented around 5%. Geographically, North America represented about 88% of our business in Q2 and international represented about 12%. We are pleased that international growth slightly outpaced North America for the second quarter in a row. Looking ahead, we see significant opportunities to capture share in international markets as operating conditions continue to improve. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, travel more than doubled compared with a year ago as the sector continues to recover.\nAutomotive was strong once again with growth accelerating each month during the quarter due to share gains and recovery. We also saw strong performance in Home and Garden and Food and Beverage, while shopping in business were below the average. We continue to believe there is still opportunity for us to gain share in most of our verticals.\nTurning now to expenses. Excluding stock-based compensation, operating expenses in Q2 were $305 million, up 22% year-over-year. There are ample opportunities to achieve significantly more leverage within our operating expenses. However, our primary objective remains on growing spend on our platform and grabbing land.\nDuring the second quarter, we continued to invest in our team, our platform and our infrastructure to support sustained growth. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, included realized costs from our 2022 hiring ramp, infrastructure investments and return to office expenses.\nBecause we have responsibly managed headcount and operating expenses over the last few years, we're in a strong position to continue innovating for clients, growing our teams and widening the distance between us and our competitors.\nIncome tax expense was $27 million for the second quarter, driven primarily by our pretax profitability and nondeductible stock-based compensation. Adjusted net income was $139 million or $0.28 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $128 million for Q2 and free cash flow was $119 million.\nDSOs exiting the quarter were 92 days, up about 1 day from a year ago. DPOs were 76 days, up about 3 days from a year ago. In Q2 via our share repurchase program, we repurchased and retired 595,000 shares for an aggregate repurchase amount of $44 million. We exited the quarter with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.4 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet.\nTurning to our outlook for the third quarter. While macro conditions remain uncertain, visibility has improved slightly since the beginning of the year. We estimate Q3 revenue to be at least $485 million, which would represent growth of 23% on a year-over-year basis. Excluding U.S. political election spend, which represented a low single-digit percent of spend in Q3 2022, our estimated revenue growth rate in Q3 of this year would be about 25% on a year-over-year basis.\nWe estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $185 million in Q3. In closing, we're extremely pleased with our strong performance in the first half of the year. I've always seen the immense opportunity this company has. And frankly, that opportunity has never been clearer than it is today. We have a large and growing addressable market in front of us. We have a business model that's proven to generate strong top line growth in addition to significant profitability and cash flow. With growth drivers including CTV, Retail Media or international business, a strong identity strategy, a 2024 U.S. election year cycle, and a significant product upgrade with Kokai, among others, we remain highly optimistic about our future as we move through the second half of 2023 and into 2024. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions."

Welcome to The Trade Desk First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn the conference over to your host, Chris Toth. You may begin.\n\nChris Toth\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Hello, and good day to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today are Founder and CEO, Jeff Green; Chief Financial Officer, Blake Grayson; and Executive Vice President of Finance, Laura Schenkein. A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section.\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind you that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements, which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. Actual results may vary significantly, and we expressly assume no obligations to update any of our forward-looking statements. Should any of our beliefs or assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings.\nIn addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provides a more meaningful representation of the company's operational performance.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\n\nJeffrey Terry Green\n\nFounder, President, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Trade Desk, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. As you've seen from our press release, we are off to a very strong start in 2023. We reported first quarter revenue of $383 million, representing growth of 21% compared with last year, again exceeding our own expectations. And has been in the case in the last few quarters, we continue to significantly outperform the digital advertising industry. We are gaining market share as advertisers embrace the precision and relevance of data-driven advertising on the open Internet via our platform.\nEven as most brands and advertisers continue to deal with some level of uncertainty, they are increasingly shifting more of their campaign dollars to decision, data-driven opportunities, where they can have more confidence that those dollars are working as hard as possible. As a result, we are signing multiyear joint business plans, JBPs, with the leading agencies and brands, some of which represent spend projections that exceed $1 billion.\nFrom the beginning, our goal has been to align our incentives with the buy side. This continues today. Because we do not own any media and because of our unwavering commitment to the demand side, our clients trust that we represent their interest alone, and we continue to innovate our platform to bring maximum value and ROI for their brand and agency campaigns. With that in mind, I'd like to focus my comments today on a few key areas. First, CTV; second, AI, including generative AI; third, agility; and fourth, the combination of OpenPath and identity.\nSo first, the transformational impact of CTV. In the first quarter, video, which includes CTV, was the fastest-growing channel of our business. And our CTV growth is not just here in the United States. CTV continues to grow rapidly, both in EMEA and across Asia. As I've said before, the shift to CTV is driving significant change, not only in TV advertising, but also in omnichannel advertising. In other words, our whole business. Many campaigns are now starting with high-value CTV impressions with carefully monitored reach and frequency. As part of an omnichannel campaign, these impressions are then followed up with less expensive display, audio, mobile and native ads to move the user down the funnel.\nThe focus on the transformational nature of CTV is never more apparent than at this time of year as major networks work to sell as much of their inventory as possible in advance through the annual spring upfront process. As the upfronts kick into gear, the role of programmatic CTV advertising is increasingly top of mind for our agency and brand clients. In recent years, upfronts have been charging higher CPMs for less reach in broadcast TV, which only serves to assign more clarity on the value of digital and CTV. Add to that, the current writers strike undoubtedly time deliberately, and we expect more dollars to flow into the spot market, programmatic and decision TV. As a result, I expect CTV to play a more central role than ever in this year's upfront.\n[ Rave ] summarized recent trends in an article a couple of weeks ago that I quote, \"Advertisers are requesting new deal terms with the major streaming TV companies ahead of this year's spring ad haggle, including how brands spend through programmatic platforms.\" In some cases, brands and agencies are asking streaming publishers to let The Trade Desk be a part of the deals.\nThe shift to decision CTV was reinforced at our recent Forward '23 CTV event in New York City, where most of the major streaming media companies joined us on stage to talk about how they are innovating in CTV to bring value to the world's top advertisers. Paramount talked about how advertisers are incorporating data, identity and optimization into the upfronts. Disney spoke about the multiyear transition taking place in CTV, much of it hinging on advances in addressability made possible by CTV. Also at Forward '23, NBCU made the big announcement that they have adopted UID2. They are integrating UID2 in order to ensure a premium CTV experience with low ad loads and frequency controls for advertisers. Across the board, UID2 is accelerating as the primary currency or CTV decisioning.\nAs we've discussed previously, biddable marketplaces are inevitable for media companies to maximize demand and compete in the CTV content arms race. This only becomes more true as the streaming wars intensify each year. By the way, this also makes integration with The Trade Desk somewhat inevitable for all major streaming platforms as they scale because they need as much demand as possible to their platforms.\nEven Netflix, a company who just launched their advertising business model at the end of last year, highlighted on their earnings call a few weeks ago that the ad-funded subscriber is more valuable to them than the ad-free subscriber. Hulu has said the same thing for years. Even in the early days of the market, ad-supported streaming is proving to be the most effective engine for growth and value, and that is even before Netflix brings the power of identity and biddable marketplaces to the table.\nWith a critical mass of premium CTV inventory available across a wide range of platforms, our advertising clients are eager to embrace the power of decisioning in their TV campaigns, and many of them are working with us to drive new innovations in CTV to get the maximum value from their investments.\nRecently, we launched a new product, The TV Quality Index, or TVQI for short. It helps advertisers understand the quality of the ad experience that the consumer is having. The index analyzes consumer perceptions of different streaming platforms, ad relevance and publisher signals to ensure that each campaign targets the most relevant inventory to any specific audience group. It also helps advertisers compare the impact of premium video against the C of UGC skippable ads.\nOne of our large independent agency clients, Tombras recently ran a campaign for one of their large global banking customers. Tombras wanted to understand how CTV could help increase brand awareness and favorability. With TV QI, Tombras was able to see where increases in the index score drove meaningfully higher brand lift. In this particular campaign, Tombras was able to drive a 22.5% lift in awareness and a 17% improvement in favorability by focusing on high scoring inventory from HBO Max and Discovery Plus based on TVQI.\nThe TV inventory quality is particularly important to advertisers when thinking about premium CTV content compared to the user-generated video content that often characterizes walled gardens. This was a priority for Sinyi Realty, one of the top real estate companies in Taiwan for an omnichannel campaign that they recently ran on the trade desk. Sinyi wanted to boost its business by reaching more sellers, and they had previously relied on social media marketing against UGC. With The Trade Desk, however, Sinyi was able to significantly expand targeted reach and improve performance with an omnichannel campaign that embrace CTV, online video and display advertising, allowing them to maximize precision and optimize frequency across all those channels at once. Sinyi onboarded their valuable first-party data, leverage UID2 to find new target audiences and use third-party behavioral data to find people interested in real estate and related topics, including consumers who had recently purchased home decoration products. With this approach, Sinyi was able to significantly expand their target audience, outperforming every one of their key KPIs. Indeed, Sinyi's video advertising assets performed twice as well as their previous GC campaigns.\nI think it's also worth noting that while we spend a lot of time talking about the transformational nature of CTV, Sinyi's experience is a typical one of many of our clients. As I mentioned before, CTV is often just a starting point. Very few advertisers execute in CTV alone. Almost all of them want to bring decisioning to their TV spend so that they can be more data-driven across all advertising channels, and the emergence of premium CTV inventory at scale now enables that omnichannel optimization.\nNext, I'd like to talk about artificial intelligence and our focus on innovation. AI has always been a very strategic focus of The Trade Desk, and we're confident that once again, we're in a leading position. In our original business plan, we said that our technology had to be a fusion of human and machine. Our initial products reflected that paradigm. Humans are often best at creating hypotheses, especially about how to emotionally connect with other people, something that is key to the success of any advertising campaign. At the same time, machines can often test those hypotheses and constantly learn from new data.\nIn 2018, AI was deployed throughout The Trade Desk product in enough places that we launched a brand that year, Koa. To our users, Koa denotes the presence of TTD's proprietary AI learning technology that generates recommendations and optimizations. When we launched Koa in 2018, we used the analogy of the copilot, where our thousands of daily users are the pilots and our generative AI recommendation serve as their copilot. More and more of our users have these features turned on as a default because they know that they're getting AI-driven insights and optimizations constantly applied to their campaigns.\nI love what the CEO of Coca-Cola said publicly after their earnings a few weeks ago. And I quote, \"Much has been said about AI, and it's certainly going to abate the maxim. Profound transformative technology is often overestimated in its impact in the short term and underestimated in the long term. This is going to have a profound impact, profound internally for the way our business operates, but also how we engage with consumers.\" He then added, \"I think AI is going to make a huge impact in marketing.\"\nWith that in mind, not enough has been said about what it takes to make great AI. ChatGPT is an amazing technology, but its usefulness is conditioned on the quality of the dataset it is pointed at. Regurgitating bad data, bad opinions or fake news, where AI generated deep bases, for example, will be a problem that all generative AI will likely be dealing with for decades to come. We believe many of the novel AI use cases in market today will face challenges with monetization and copyright and data integrity or truth and scale.\nBy contrast, we are so excited about our position in the advertising ecosystem when it comes to AI. We look at over 10 million ad requests every second. Those requests, in sum, represent a very robust and very unique dataset with incredible integrity. We can point generative AI at that dataset with confidence for years to come. We know that our size, our dataset size and integrity, our profitability and our team will make Koa and generative AI a promising part of our future.\nIn the future, you'll also hear us talk about other applications of AI in our business. These include generating code faster; changing the way customers understand and interact with their own data; generating new and more targeted creatives, especially for video and CTV; and using virtual assistance to shorten the learning curve that comes with the complicated world of programmatic advertising by optimizing the documentation process and making it more engaging.\nWe'll have a lot more to say about the role of AI, particularly how it is getting more distributed within our system as well as many other game-changing innovations at our Net Platform Launch event on 66 in New York. It will be the largest platform launch in our history, and I even hesitate to call it an upgrade because it is so much more than that. It will encompass a new approach to collaborative innovation, breakthroughs in how we service value for advertisers and expanding accessibility as marketers of all types embrace the power of programmatic. The new release is called Koki, and we look forward to sharing new product announcements new ways for partners and clients to adopt and integrate with The Trade Desk and even deeper relationships as a result.\nFor the third topic today, I'd like to talk briefly about agility. In our work with the thousands of agencies and brands that utilize our platform, there has been a shift in the discussions we're having over the last 12 months or so. All of our clients are cognizant of the macro market environment, whether it's high interest rates or fears of recession, the stability of the banking system or ongoing supply chain issues. They are also, though, keenly aware of the role that advertising continues to play in helping them drive growth and differentiate their businesses even in times of uncertainty.\nBecause of this, marketing leaders need to be deliberate with advertising budgets. More and more, they are looking to understand where they can shift investments and where they can be more flexible, agile and data-driven to find those important opportunities to differentiate and drive growth to their business. And in that environment, the value of The Trade Desk becomes even more apparent. With us, agencies and brands can plan and optimize in real time. They can work in month-to-month increments versus a year long or a 6-month plan.\nA great example of this is FairPrice in Singapore. You may remember that FairPrice is one of our retail media partners. They are the largest grocery chain in Singapore. They are also an advertiser on our platform. Their goal was quite simple. In an increasingly competitive market, FairPrice wanted to reach new customers with a lower acquisition cost. Working with The Trade Desk, they were able to import their valuable first-party data from their loyalty program, which comprises more than 2 million customers. Using UID2, they were able to do look-alike modeling to understand where additional potential customers might be targeted, potential customers who share some characteristics of their most loyal customers. And the results were very impressive. When using UID2 to execute that modeling, FairPrice's acquisition cost per customer was 1/3 lower than with traditional identifiers, but also with twice the scale.\nThe same trend is happening around the world. One of the world's largest CPG companies, also one of our largest clients, recently highlighted this on their earnings call. They talked about how programmatic was helping them drive significant campaign and media efficiencies, maximizing the ROI of every campaign dollar. This efficiency helped them reinvest in more media and innovation, driving competitive differentiation.\nThe trend towards agility and flexibility plays into the strengths of The Trade Desk. In fact, I would argue that at a time when it can be harder than ever to predict macro market trends, the ability to drive a growth and competitive differentiation agenda using our platform becomes more compelling than ever, and we expect this trend to continue regardless of the macro environment. More and more marketing leaders from CMOs to agency leaders, to media planners understand the power of programmatic to thoughtfully drive value. And they are leaning in, whether it's in CTV, retail media, UID2 or any number of other key programmatic innovations.\nFinally, I'd like to discuss UID2 in the OpenPath. I've mentioned UID a few times on this call already, but I'd like to touch on the progress we've made there and with OpenPath in the last few months as well. Much has been written about these innovations in recent weeks, especially about what they might mean for the evolving role of demand-side platforms and supply-side platforms.\nAs I hope you picked up in the client stories I've shared today, UID2 is much more than a new identity alternative to cookies. It's really about helping our clients drive advertising precision in a privacy-safe way across all advertising channels. As the open Internet continues to grow and evolve, it's essential that we develop new identity currencies that help us preserve the vital value exchange of relevant advertising or free content.\nLast quarter, I said we expect 75% of the third-party data ecosystem to be activating on UID2 by the middle of the year. I'm proud to report today that we are now right at that level. with most major third-party data providers leveraging UID2s on our platform. A growing number of publishers are also sending UID2, providing advertisers with greater insight into audience engagement and campaign performance. And as a result, ad spend is increasingly gravitating towards ad impressions that include UID2. It's worth noting that, in some cases, we may see the same ad impression from up to 8 or 9 SSP supply paths on our platform. When this occurs, our clients are more likely to transact on impressions that incorporate UID2 because they have a clearer sense of exactly which audience they are reaching and how those ads are performing.\nA few weeks ago, for example, Unilever announced that ad impressions, including UID2, on Disney were 12x more effective in reaching their target audience than those with traditional identifiers. This is not atypical, and our advertisers are willing to pay for the value of that precision. Indeed, CPMs on ad impressions containing UID2 are meaningfully higher than those without in most channels. In this way, UID2 simply helps advertisers drive as much value as possible from every advertising dollar.\nThe same can be said of OpenPath. To begin the discussion on OpenPath, let me first remind you of what it is. OpenPath is a direct integration from our platform into publisher inventory. It provides our clients with a direct line of sight into premium inventory across channels, and it provides publishers with a direct view of what advertisers are willing to pay for their impressions. In no way, shape or form is OpenPath an effort by the Trade Desk to enter the supply side of digital advertising. That is not in our interest.\nTo explain that a bit more clearly, it's worth spending a moment on some of the industry dynamics that make OpenPath compelling for our clients. OpenPath was born of an advertiser interest in having a more clear and transparent path to publisher inventory, where every participant in the supply path is contributing more value than they are extracting in fees. Advertisers have long been aware that there are quite a few hops in the advertising supply chain, and neither the price nor the value of each hop has ever been completely clear.\nWe share this concern. And in this way, OpenPath, is very consistent with our long-term commitment to make supply chain optimization and efficiency a reality. Advertisers' eagerness for more transparency came at a time when publishers were becoming increasingly frustrated in their ability to manage yield in the complex world of programmatic. Indeed, many of them were starting to do it themselves, with some even launching their own ad servers. And why were they frustrated? It really has a lot to do with Google's dominance of the supply side and the draconian measures they've taken that hurt publisher revenues. The recent Department of Justice lawsuit against Google does a remarkably thorough job of outlining these dynamics.\nWe have long asked the supply side to do a better job of yield management. It's not something we will ever do. We see the impact that Google is having, and we believe DoubleClick for Publishers or DFP should have more and better competition from SSPs just as we try to provide on the demand side. But given the state of the supply chain in programmatic, which is one where either companies have the power to create change and don't want to or they are too small to have the power to create the change, advertisers want direct integrations, and publishers are welcoming them. Many publishers representing thousands of media properties across CTV, mobile and display have already integrated with OpenPath. And our advertisers are increasingly prioritizing direct channels, where they have a clear view of value. For all of the publishers that have integrated, we have a multiple of that number going through the process of getting on board right now.\nSo let me bring this all to a close by highlighting that our work in these areas is made possible by our focus on profitability. In the first quarter, once again, The Trade Desk generated strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. We remain one of the very few high-growth technology companies to consistently do so year after year. Our strong profitability allows us to invest in emerging technologies such as OpenPath and UID2 and deliver them to market, even if development resources are in short supply across our clients and partners. It means we can continue to invest in innovations such as our retail media marketplace, enabling our clients to more effectively measure how specific campaigns drive in-store or online purchases.\nJust a couple of days ago, we announced a new retail partnership with Macy's here in the United States. In Europe, we recently announced a new partnership with Ocado, a joint venture involving Marks & Spencer and one of U.K.'s fastest-growing grocery groups. We now work with many of the world's leading retailers to activate their data for our advertisers, and our clients are embracing the opportunity to apply more performance and measurement precision to their retail campaigns. In many cases, this is incremental market opportunity for us. It also means we continue to advance our industry leadership in AI, which I mentioned earlier, and which we will talk about more on June 6 with the launch of Kokai.\nOur commitment to industry-leading innovation underpins everything we do. In the first quarter, we once again outperformed the market with 21% revenue growth, meaning we continue to gain market share at an impressive pace because we consistently bring innovation value to our clients every single day. The innovation acceleration in programmatic will only continue in 2023 and as more advertisers embrace breakthroughs in CTV, retail, identity and so many other areas. The Trade Desk will stay at the believing edge of this innovation curve. And in doing so, I'm optimistic that we will continue to outperform the market, deliver more value to our clients than we extract and gain share.\nAs I hand over the microphone to Blake Grayson, I'd like to underscore an announcement that we made in our press release. I'm so thrilled to announce the promotion of Laura Schenkein to become our new Chief Financial Officer succeeding Blake, who will be leaving the company for a senior finance role outside of the ad tech industry.\nFirst, I'd like to thank Blake for the amazing contribution that he's made to this company during his time here in the last few years. I can't imagine having been through this with anyone else, never expected to experience the effects of the pandemic, some very difficult decisions in the middle of 2020 around resource allocation as we were looking into uncharted territories and lots of uncertainty.\nBut I am extremely excited to announce Laura as our new CFO. Laura and I have worked together for about the last 10 years. I've seen Laura grow as a leader. I think it's fair to say that one of the most significant achievements of Blake during his time here is how much he has mentored and helped Laura to grow. Laura understands our business and on a personal note because I worked with Laura for a decade. I've come to trust for strategic counsel and her recommendations. I'm very proud to call her my partner and our new CFO.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it over to Blake to say a few words and cover our financials.\n\nBlake Jeffrey Grayson\n\nCFO, The Trade Desk, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff, for the kind words. And good afternoon, everyone. I am immensely proud of our achievements as a company, and it has been an honor to work with Jeff and the leadership team as well as so many talented individuals at The Trade Desk. I'm leaving for a new challenge knowing the company is well positioned for the future. Laura is an extremely well-respected and accomplished colleague and has my full confidence as she assumes her new role.\nNow on to our results. Q1 was an exceptional quarter of financial performance and execution for The Trade Desk. Q1 revenue was $383 million, a 21% increase year-over-year. Our Q1 performance was bolstered by the growing trend toward unbiased, data-driven advertising on the open Internet. This shift has played to the strength of our platform as marketers become more agile and deliberate with their digital advertising. While some macro uncertainty in the market has led to relatively uneven ad budgets, we are seeing increasing numbers of marketers embrace our platform to take advantage of our flexible and data-driven approach.\nOur success in Q1 was demonstrated by several key achievements. Our performance in the CTV space remain robust, and we continue to achieve strong momentum in retail media, further solidifying our position as a leading player in the industry. Strong growth returned to many of our key international offices. The growing adoption of UID2 by major advertisers and publishers speaks to the value that is placed on identity in the open Internet ecosystem. In addition, we deepened our partnerships with clients by expanding our joint business plans on a global level, a testament to our unwavering commitment to providing outstanding value and results for our customers.\nIn addition to strong top line performance, in Q1, we generated $109 million in adjusted EBITDA or 28% of revenue, exceeding our own expectations. As it typically occurs, when we outperform on the top line, it generally flows through to our bottom line results as it did in this quarter. This outperformance led to record free cash flow of $177 million in Q1, marking nearly $500 million in free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis, which is nearly 10x the free cash flow we generated just 3 years ago. In the current environment, our consistent ability to grow our top line revenue while generating meaningfully positive adjusted EBITDA and cash flow puts us in a strong position to continue investing for growth and grabbing land while others are forced to pull back. Additionally, I am proud that our robust cash generation allowed us to return excess capital to shareholders for the first time via our share repurchase program.\nIn Q1, growth was broad-based across channels. The shift of advertising dollars from linear to connected TV continued to be a core driver of our business. From a scaled channel perspective, video, which includes CTV represented a mid-40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow rapidly as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a mid-30s percentage share of spend as growth was again solid across in-app and mobile video. Display represented a low double-digit percent share of our business, and audio represented around 5%.\nGeographically, North America accounted for 88% of our Q1 spend, with international representing the remaining 12%. We're pleased to report that international growth slightly outpaced North America during this period, with particularly strong performance in EMEA. Our CTV business in Europe grew well into the triple digits year-over-year in Q1. While CTV growth in North Asia also showed encouraging momentum, with year-over-year CTV spend growth in both regions improving each month. Looking ahead, we see significant opportunities to capture share in international markets as operating conditions continue to improve. As customers seek to optimize their ad spend, The Trade Desk is well positioned to deliver value and drive ROI as we demonstrated in late 2020.\nIn terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, travel nearly tripled in spend in Q1 compared with a year ago as the sector continues to recover from the pandemic. Food and drink, automotive, and home and garden were also among our strongest performing verticals, while shopping in business were below the average. We continue to believe there is still potential for us to gain share within most of our verticals.\nTurning now to expenses. Excluding stock-based compensation, operating expenses in Q1 were $293 million, up 41% year-over-year. We continue to invest prudently in our team during the quarter to support our long-term growth objectives. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, was partly due to in-person events and travel that did not take place in Q1 of the prior year as we had not yet fully resumed back to office work or in-person events. Unlike many ad-funded and technology peers, we have responsibly managed headcount and operating expenses over the past few years, maintaining a focus on profitable growth. As a result, we are well positioned to capture market share and increase spend while generating significant adjusted EBITDA.\nOur income tax benefit was $19 million in the quarter, mainly due to the tax benefits associated with employee stock-based awards, the timing of which can be variable. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $114 million or $0.23 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was a record $188 million, and free cash flow was a record $177 million in Q1. DSOs exited in the quarter were 88 days, and DPOs were 72 days.\nWe exited Q1 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.3 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet. In February, upon review of our capital allocation strategy, we announced a $700 million share repurchase program. In Q1, we repurchased 5.1 million shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $293 million. The company will continue to approach the repurchase program opportunistically depending on market conditions and capital priorities.\nBefore I pass the microphone to Laura to cover the outlook for Q2, I'll summarize by saying The Trade Desk is off to a fantastic start in 2023 with strong momentum across the business. Our robust business model and solid balance sheet have positioned us well to succeed in the current environment with powerful secular trends such as the shift from linear to CTV the growing use of data and marketing campaigns and significant long-term growth drivers such as CTV, retail media, joint business plans and gaining share in international markets, we are highly optimistic about the potential to continue growing and capturing market share in the years ahead.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it over to Laura.\n\nLaura Schenkein\n\nExecutive Vice President of Financial Planning & Analysis\n\nThank you, Blake. And thank you, Jeff, for the kind words. I'm incredibly excited to be taking on the CFO role starting next month. I feel fortunate to have worked with Blake these last 3.5 years. It's because of his and Jeff's mentorship that I feel well prepared to take the baton and build upon the strong foundation they've set for CTV's future.\nTurning now to our outlook for the second quarter. While macro conditions remain uncertain, visibility has improved slightly since the beginning of the year. We are cautiously optimistic and estimate Q2 revenue to be at least $452 million, which would represent growth of 20% on a year-over-year basis.\nExcluding U.S. political election spend, which represented a low single-digit percent of spend in Q2 2022, our estimated revenue growth rate in Q2 of this year would be about 21% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $160 million in Q2.\nAs Jeff has outlined, with the large addressable market in front of us, we see significant growth opportunities and continue to invest thoughtfully in the business. We continue to be one of the few technology companies capable of consistently generating high top line growth, significant adjusted EBITDA margins and free cash flow. This enables us to continue distancing ourselves from the competition in areas such as platform renovation, customer service identity and supply chain optimization.\nIn addition, this year, we remain focused on hiring to support future growth, although at about half the rate of 2022 as we expect our year-over-year headcount growth to continue to decelerate as we progress throughout the year.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions."

Welcome to The Trade Desk Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please note, this conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn the conference over to your host, Chris Toth. You may begin.\n\nChris Toth\n\nVP of IR, The Trade Desk, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. Hello, and good day to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today are both Founder and CEO, Jeff Green; and Chief Financial Officer, Blake Grayson.\nA copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section.\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind you that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements, which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. Actual results could vary significantly, and we expressly assume no obligations to update any of our forward-looking statements.\nShould any of our beliefs or assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings.\nIn addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provides a more meaningful representation of the company's operational performance.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\n\nJeffrey Terry Green\n\nCo-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO, The Trade Desk, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Let me start by highlighting the numbers. A spend on our platform in 2022 was nearly $7.8 billion, a record for us. Fourth quarter revenue alone was $491 million, also a record.\nCTV continued to be our strongest growth driver as more content owners from around the world are moving beyond ad-free subscription models and offering ad-supported options for viewers. And once again, despite all the uncertainty of the year, we delivered strong profitability, highlighting the operating leverage we have in our business.\nOur results are often benchmarked against the rule of 40 and compared to other high-growth companies. In that benchmark, the health of a technology company is expressed as the sum of a company's growth rate and EBITDA margin. In 2022, we finished well over that benchmark again. For the sixth year in a row, we were over 50%, all while we continue to invest to drive future value and growth.\nIn times of market uncertainty, perhaps its most useful to look at how we are performing compared to the broader industry. According to estimates by (inaudible) total global ad spend increased 8% last year. Spend on our platform grew more than 3x of that. With uncertain macro conditions, where most marketers are under pressure to do more with less, we continue to outperform and gain share. I'd like to focus on why we're winning market share during this time of uncertainty, as I think it gives us a sense of the dynamics in our industry right now, which I expect to be in place for the foreseeable future.\nSpecifically in the last 6 months of 2022, The Trade Desk started to separate from much of the digital advertising market in terms of relative outperformance. In the third quarter, we reported 31% growth while our competitors were either in retreat or posting single-digit growth. That same trend continued into the fourth quarter as we grew 24% and most of our large competitors were posting between negative 9% and negative 2% growth.\nI don't think we've ever had the level of industry outperformance in our 6 years or so as a public company as we did in 2022. And it means that we can be very confident that we're gaining share and that our platform continues to gain traction with advertisers. I remain convinced that in times of uncertainty, as marketers look to do more with less, they are continuing to prioritize decision media on the open Internet. With The Trade Desk and the Open Internet, marketers can measure ROI and value with more objectivity. And that means they'll prioritize us over the limitations of walled gardens.\nWith that in mind, Insider Intelligence reported a couple of weeks ago that 2022 represented the first year in a decade that Meta and Google did not account for more than half of the digital advertising market between them. That shift comes as the digital advertising market continues to expand. Before the pandemic, digital advertising accounted for around half of total market spend, last year it represented more than 2/3 of the market according to [Group M].\nWhat's driving these 2 trends? Well, as I've said many times before, CTV is changing everything in advertising. Not only is the shift from linear to CTV driving significant growth in digital spend as advertisers shift dollars from linear TV to connected TV, but more spend is happening outside the walled gardens as advertisers shift spend from user-generated content to premium streaming content.\nI'd like to expand on this in a couple of dimensions because I think it will give you a sense of why I'm so optimistic about our potential to grow this year and beyond. First, I'd like to touch on UID2 because so much has happened around identity in recent months, that points to how the industry is evolving. Second, I believe we are starting to see advertisers challenge the walled garden business model more systematically than ever, and it's because they have premium alternatives at scale in fast-growing markets such as CTV and retail media. And last, I'd like to touch on what all of this means for us in 2023.\nSo let's start with UID2. First, as a reminder of what UID2 is. A few years ago, we created in collaboration with other open Internet companies an identity currency for the open Internet based on either an e-mail address or a phone number. UID2 is anchored on those 2 consumer data points so that consumers can own and manage their identity around the Internet rather than managing privacy settings for each device or ecosystem like Apple or Google.\nOur goal was to create a personalization technology that was more privacy safe than cookies and better at empowering consumers than any alternative in the market. Once UID2 was built, the technology was open sourced, and we welcome the partnership of Internet governing bodies as well as the broader digital advertising ecosystem, including agencies, brands, content providers, ad tech companies and data partners. We have always believed a critical mass of adoption would lay the foundation of a massively upgraded Internet, one that incense more competition and improves privacy standards and that's exactly what we are starting to see.\nIf you had told me at this time last year, how much progress the industry would have made on UID2 in 2022, I don't think I would have believed you. At the beginning of our fourth quarter last year, around 15% of the third-party data ecosystem was estimating on UID2. This is essentially a very large sample of the entire data ecosystem of the entire Internet. By the first half of this year, we expect we will be in the 75% range. Levels of activation that high mean we will have effectively solved the identity matching challenge of the entire open Internet on a scale well beyond anything cookies have ever accomplished and all while providing consumers with much greater control over their privacy.\nTo be clear, I'm talking about companies adopting UID2 such as AWS, Snowflake, Salesforce and Adobe. We always said this change to the Internet required adoption of the infrastructure players of the Internet, not knocking on 2 million publisher or content owners doors. By upgrading the data infrastructure of the Internet, there is now a significant mathematical incentive for every reputable player involved in digital advertising to lean in to UID2.\nThis is already happening with thousands of publishers in all channels of the open Internet. UID2 adoption by publishers is creating the richest, most privacy-centric identity environment we've ever seen for advertisers. And it also means an advertiser's first-party data becomes exponentially more valuable. In fact, I would say again that it becomes about 10x more valuable than with cookies. Simply because UID2 solves the needle in the haystack problem that came with cookies, because advertisers can now match their customer data with accuracy across the open Internet more effectively than ever before.\nThey can make much better decisions in every aspect of campaign optimization, including attribution and measurement. And they can do so without ever compromising the consumer trust they have spent years, sometimes decades establishing. Self advertisers take advantage of this new value, at CES, we announced Galileo, a new service that helps advertisers easily onboard and activate their first-party data. Galileo is only possible because of all those integrations we worked on last year across the data ecosystem. Galileo starts with advertisers activating their first-party data. UID2 can then be applied to ensure that data can be used in a privacy safe way.\nOf course, it's not just on the data side that we're seeing critical mass of UID2 adoption. UID2 is starting to change the value of the inventory on the Internet because CTV is almost 100% authenticated, CTV is being upgraded while non-personalized ads on the web, mobile and UGC sites are being downgraded. As a result, increasingly, the world's leading publishers are embracing UID2. With CTV, we talked previously about how Disney is applying new UID2 across its media portfolio.\nJust a few weeks ago, Paramount announced their integration with UID2 across their IQ inventory, which includes Paramount Plus, Pluto TV, BET, CBS News, CBS Sports Network, Comedy Central, MTV, Paramount Network, VH1 and many others. I shared the stage at CES with Paramount Advertising President, John Haley. He talked about the importance of unified identity in helping agencies and brands tie together campaigns in a fragmented omnichannel environment. And I couldn't agree more with his sentiment. UID2 will continue to grow as cookies become less important, and CTV will continue to lead the charge here because right now, there is economic pressure on everyone in the advertising ecosystem.\nThere is pressure on consumers who increasingly want ad support at lower cost options because of the strain on their wallets. There is pressure on content providers who need high CPMs to fund their premium content in the arms race for new subscribers. And there's pressure on advertisers, many of whom need to do more with less. All of that creates opportunity for CTV. At a moment when advertisers need to prove value and ROI, there is more opportunity than ever to advertise via CTV in a more data-driven way.\nPioneer advertisers are already taking action. For example, leading advertisers running campaigns on Disney, leveraging UID2 have been 12x more effective in reaching their target audience than without UID2. That's astonishing progress, and it's just the beginning. Much more will be said this year about the impact UID2 is having on the biggest brands and media companies in the world.\nThe CTV is the king pin for the open Internet. And I believe its size, its efficacy and its value will be transformational in showcasing the power of the open internet to advertisers. Eventually, it will force many walled gardens to lower their barriers. This will happen in part because CTV is perfectly fragmented, but collectively huge. It's not so fragmented that you need millions of parties to coordinate, but it's fragmented enough that no one has enough power to be draconian and go it alone. As a result, everyone is rational enough to make the right decisions for the ecosystem that optimize the experience for viewers, advertisers and of course, media companies.\nBecause of these dynamics, I also believe that 2023 will be the year that everything in TV changes. We now have premium CTV inventory at scale, almost all of which is authenticated and we'll see more of a premium attached to inventory that incorporates new identifiers such as UID2. But in order to get the best out of data-driven TV advertising, you cannot use a forward market that was invented in 1962. By the way, that's the same year the cassette tape was introduced. The cassette tape has evolved. In fact, the way we consume music has evolved many, many times over the last 60 years. But the upfronts have not. The market needs an upfront that is always on, but also leverages data so that content owners sell fewer, more relevant ads at higher CPMs and advertisers get more efficacy.\nTo adjust for high CPMs in CTV today, advertisers are asking us for a new forward market where they can leverage data on an everyday always-on basis. Advertisers have to make their ads more effective to justify higher ad prices. It takes a long time to unwind the culture of multibillion-dollar commitment signed during a few days each spring and bring the process into today's digital environment. But this is already starting to happen as media companies can no longer adjust the CPMs required to power today's content arms race without a contemporary forward market where advertisers leverage data.\nWe will talk more about our CTV forward market strategy at an event that we will host in early March in advance of the upfront season. This is the first time we're hosting this kind of event where our streaming inventory partners will be able to showcase their value and innovation to our top clients. And what's interesting about this event is that I don't think there's any company in the industry that can convene this level of media and advertising leadership to have this discussion. I believe this event marks an inflection point for The Trade Desk, but I think it will also underscore the pivotal role that CTV is playing in the broad transformation of digital advertising.\nIt will showcase the emergence of premium CTV inventory at enough scale to provide a compelling alternative to the limitations of walled gardens and user-generated content. And it's not just here in the United States, CTV and premium video is the fastest-growing digital advertising channel worldwide. In Indonesia, we recently ran a premium video campaign for Mondelez, the global food giant. Using our platform, Mondelez was able to target specific audiences on premium video content from media companies such as video, VTV and iflix.\nFor this campaign, Mondelez shifted spend from popular user-generated content platforms, and the results were very positive. Ad completion rates were 8x higher than what they've been achieving against user-generated content, and the click-through rate was 15x higher.\nIn addition to CTV, one of the rapidly emerging areas of digital advertising is shopper marketing. Shopper marketing, of course, has several components to it. Probably, the most interesting part is the retail media segment. Interestingly, the dynamics of the market are not dissimilar to CTV. Retailers realize that they cannot maximize the value of their shopper data by building walls around it. They stand to drive much greater growth by opening their data up to advertisers in a privacy safe way. Advertisers can then understand much more clearly how their campaigns are driving actual online and in-store sales, meaning that they can optimize and measure in ways that simply weren't possible a few years ago.\nThe current recently published a story about how Coca-Cola, one of the world's largest advertisers, is thinking about shopper marketing. They are activating campaigns across more than 25 retail media networks, including Kroger, Target, Walmart, Amazon, DoorDash and Instacart. Since Coke started building out its retail media strategy a few years ago, it has seen a major uptick in return on ad spend and incremental reach as well as its ability to determine overlapping audiences across more than 130 million households in the United States. This approach has helped the company better pinpoint audiences in targeted channels like programmatic display, connected TV and social media.\nI'd like to quote Katie Neil, the Connected Commerce lead for Coke in North America. Retail Media Networks know so intimately the behaviors of these consumers that their predictive models, their data really help us identify what are those right touch points when we are able to say this is a great time to remind you that there's a Coca-Cola product for you. Retail Media Networks are another proof point that advertisers win when they can apply data to their campaigns. And because of this, like CTV, retail will also prove to everyone in the advertising ecosystem that building walls around data and inventory is ultimately a flawed strategy.\nAs I said last quarter, we now provide access on our platform to about 80% of the leading retailers in the United States, and we're growing our international footprint every month. For example, we recently announced partnerships with Tesco, one of the largest grocery groups in Europe; and FairPrice, the largest grocery chain in Singapore. As a result of these integrations, measurement from impressions all the way to the point of sale can be connected to drive better reporting analytics and attribution across the open Internet. This provides our advertising clients with new measurement capabilities that don't exist pretty much anywhere else on the digital ad landscape, including inside of walled gardens.\nOnce again, we are pioneering better data-driven strategies. Now the tens of thousands of brands that sell in retail environments have better, more objective, data-driven alternatives to walled gardens and unfair opaque marketplaces. So what does all this mean for us in 2023?\nFrom an industry perspective, we have a lot of tailwinds. The shift from linear TV to CTV continues to accelerate, and I predict that at some point in the near future, we will reach a precipitous tipping point. It won't be a long gradual shift to CTV. It will be an acceleration and then a full long shift. One of the things I am preparing for as a CEO is making sure that we have the resources and scale in place to help our clients through that shift.\nRetail Media Networks will continue to grow and influence in part because they offer something revolutionary in terms of measurement that advertisers have been craving for years, that direct relationship between spend and action. But partly as a result of those trends, I also believe we will see a couple of additional important shifts in our industry in 2023, particularly when it comes to how marketers think about programmatic.\nFirst, as advertisers have more opportunity to deploy data more fully in their omnichannel campaigns, their focus will continue to shift from price to value. They will always want to make sure that they are buying impressions at the right price, but that won't be the leading indicator anymore. It never should have been. They will continue to put much more priority on whether those ad impressions delivered the right outcome for that price, in other words, value.\nSecond, in the pursuit of value, advertisers decisioning will shift from inventory to audience. Instead of focusing on buying a certain show or a certain piece of inventory, advertisers will put much more priority on audience precision regardless of channel because data enables them to do that. This is especially important as the industry moves from a once-a-year upfront to an always-on forward market.\nAs we make progress on these initiatives and as advertisers embrace the value of the open Internet, I also predict that more walled gardens will begin to take down some of their barriers. They will see that incremental demand and higher CPMs that companies like The Trade Desk can generate with a focus on advertiser goals, data and the open Internet.\nI'll close by highlighting that while we have those industry tailwinds, we are not immune to the general economic headwinds. I've met with dozens of CMOs through the first few weeks of 2023, and there is some level of uncertainty. They all are under pressure to do more with less. And precisely because of those pressures, CMOs are gravitating to places where they can be more deliberate and where they can apply data and decisioning. And in fast-growing channels like CTV, they're finding data-driven advertising opportunities at massive scale.\nCMOs also understand that while the current macro environment may be uncertain, we will emerge from it and they are all preparing to be in a position of strength as that happens. Most of them are getting ready. Some are grabbing land now, but nearly all of them are getting a better grasp on their first-party data. They are working with new identity solutions. They are leveraging more direct paths to premium inventory, such as OpenPath.\nAnd the world's leading media companies are integrating with us, so they are best positioned to access demand from advertisers. They are integrating UID2 as well as new innovations such as OpenPath, which creates simple authentication for their consumers as the Internet shifts away from cookies to a more logged-in consent-based model.\nEveryone is taking this moment to prepare for a more data-driven decision advertising environment. This also means that the walled garden strategy is breaking down. Everyone needs more demand. Advertisers want more objectivity and value is becoming increasingly difficult or other players to be draconian, especially now that advertisers have premium options at scale on the open Internet.\nRight now, the biggest threat to the walled gardens is an open Internet centered around CTV and retail media. The disparity in what advertisers get from the open Internet in terms of measurement and performance compared to walled gardens is growing every day. You see it especially in TV and increasingly, you see it in retail.\nOf course, I would be remiss to not mention the recent Department of Justice lawsuit against Google. It's a comprehensive look at how Google operates, including many of the draconian measures they have implemented to tilt the market in their favor. The Trade Desk has not been as impacted as much as others in the ecosystem, and I believe that's because our mission has always been to provide an open, objective and transparent alternative to the walled gardens.\nWe focus on objectively serving the buy side. And with that objectivity, we will win no matter what. To be clear, this is not us versus Google. It's the value and opportunity of the open Internet versus the limitations of walled gardens. We have been winning for years in an unfair market with some systemic obstructions working against us. Imagine what we can do as the market becomes more fair which we predict it will one way or another.\nI could not be more excited about the direction we are heading in and the value that our advertising clients are realizing on the open Internet because of all the progress we've talked about today. Our focus on profitability ensures that we will remain at the cutting edge of our industry. Compared to many others in our industry over the last 3 years, we did not overextend ourselves in terms of hiring. We have been deliberate and prudent keeping a laser focus on the long-term opportunities in front of us. As a result, we are one of a few high-growth technology companies that consistently generates strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow.\nAs you may have seen in our press release, our strong profitability and cash flow enables us to return capital to shareholders with a $700 million share repurchase program. While I generally don't like to comment on competitors' performance, it is worth noting again that in an environment where many of our competitors contracted, our revenue grew 24% in the fourth quarter. I believe that level of relative outperformance, which was evident throughout 2022, is indicative of the value we are delivering to our clients, even in a challenging environment we continue to sign JBPs with brands and their agencies at a very strong pace, with billions of dollars transacted through these agreements last year. I believe 2023 will be a tipping point year in many ways.\nAnd I expect that advertisers will emerge more empowered than ever to drive data-driven precision. As a result, we will continue to gain share. Let me wrap this up by borrowing a phrase from one of our closest and large agency partners. I have a strong sense of hesitant optimism about what 2023 holds for our industry. And with that, I'll hand it over to Blake to cover the financials.\n\nBlake Jeffrey Grayson\n\nCFO, The Trade Desk, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As you already heard from Jeff, we had a strong 2022, demonstrating another year of continued execution and growth for The Trade Desk despite economic headwinds around the world.\nQ4 revenue was $491 million, a 24% increase year-over-year. Once again, in Q4, we continue to (inaudible) share and significantly outpace (inaudible) on the top line, delivering growth well into the double digits. I am also particularly proud of the $245 million of adjusted EBITDA we generated during the quarter, representing a margin of 50% that helped drive trailing 12-month free cash flow of over $450 million.\nOur results in both Q4 and for the full year 2022 were testament to our ability to grow our top line efficiently, while generating substantial adjusted EBITDA and cash flow. For 2022, we ended the year with nearly $7.8 billion in spend on our platform and about $1.6 billion in revenue, representing 32% revenue growth. During the year, we produced adjusted EBITDA of $668 million or 42% of revenue as we continue to generate very strong profitability rates despite macro challenges.\nOur results reflect the ongoing strength of programmatic advertising and the increasing value that the Trade Desk provides thousands of agencies and brands as they connect with their customers across our platform every day. As expected, for the ninth year in a row, our take rate remains within a very consistent historical range, while over the same time frame, the value that our platform provides for our customers had increased dramatically. More than ever, advertisers are embracing the use of data and value-added services to increase their advertising efficacy.\nDeliberately choosing to leverage more data and value-added services is a win-win for advertisers in terms of higher ROIs, content partners in terms of higher CPMs and the Trade Desk in terms of our business model. We remain focused on our proven strategy of being the default DSP for the open Internet, only representing the buy side and avoiding conflicts too often prevalent in our industry as we continue our progression towards a total addressable market that is on track to reach $1 trillion.\nThe shift of advertising dollars from linear to connected television continues to be a core driver of our business. In Q4, CTV again represented our fastest growing channel at scale around the world, and year-over-year growth for CTV stayed consistent versus Q3 despite the level of uncertainty in the global economy.\nOur shopper marketing also continues to progress nicely as more and more advertisers deploy retail data in their campaigns. And we continue to see positive results in utilization in our data marketplace as the enhancements that we made throughout the year are helping deliver better outcomes for advertisers.\nFrom a scale channel perspective in Q4, video, which includes CTV, represented a mid-40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow rapidly as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a high 30s percentage share of spend as growth was again solid across in-app and mobile video. Display represented a low double-digit percent share of our business and audio represented around 5%.\nGeographically, North America represented about 90% of spend, and international represented about 10% of spend for the fourth quarter. Growth in North America was resilient with our New York office leading the way in Q4. It's worth noting, CTV growth in EMEA and South Asia were very strong once again this quarter. We are encouraged to see our teams in these regions executing on this key growth driver.\nIn terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, travel nearly tripled in spend in Q4 compared with a year ago, as the sector continues to recover from the impacts related to the pandemic. Automotive was also among our strongest verticals, accelerated to its highest year-over-year quarterly growth rate in 2022 as a result of winning new business and the easing of supply chain challenges across the industry. Additionally, as expected, political election spend about doubled quarter-over-quarter, representing a low single-digit percent of spend in Q3. We continue to believe there is still potential for us to gain share within most of our verticals.\nTurning now to expenses. Q4 operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation were $263 million, up 22% from a year ago. During the quarter, we continued to prudently make investments in our team, particularly in areas of technology and development as we scale and position the organization for long-term growth. Excluding stock-based compensation, the year-over-year growth in Q4 operating expenses was lower than our year-over-year headcount growth, primarily due to lower costs such as variable compensation, the timing of fixed marketing investments and employer taxes.\nUnlike some ad funded peers and many technology companies, however, we have responsibly managed our headcount operating expenses over the past few years as our demonstrated revenue growth since 2019 is higher than both headcount and operating expense growth, excluding stock-based compensation over the same period. Because of that continued focus on generating profitable growth, we enter 2023 in a very strong position to take share and win spend, while still generating meaningful adjusted EBITDA.\nIncome tax was $41 million in the quarter, mainly due to lower tax benefits associated with employee stock-based awards when compared to the prior year, the timing of which can be variable. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $190 million or $0.38 per fully diluted share.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $173 million and free cash flow was $123 million in Q4. CapEx during the quarter was driven primarily by data center and infrastructure investments that were higher than the previous year due to timing was in line with our expectations for the full year. I would like to remind you that the timing of cash collections and payments can significantly impact cash from operating activities and free cash flow results on a quarterly basis.\nDSOs exiting Q4 were 104 days, down 3 days from a year ago. DPOs were 86 days, down 5 days from a year ago. We ended the year with a strong cash and liquidity position. Our balance sheet had $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. We have no debt on the balance sheet.\nAnd finally, as you have seen in our press release, we announced a $700 million share repurchase program this morning. Our strong balance sheet, coupled with the strength of our business model that produces significant cash flow, led to a review of our capital allocation strategy. Our review adjusted investments in our business, including managing our working capital, the potential for acquisitions and options for returning excess capital to our shareholders. Starting in the first quarter of this year, we plan to opportunistically repurchase shares, including helping to offset dilution from employee stock issuances.\nTurning now to our outlook. We have started the year with good momentum. For the first 6 weeks of the quarter, spend growth has increased on a year-over-year basis each week, demonstrating consistent acceleration of a bit slower-than-normal month of December. While macro conditions continue to remain uncertain, we are cautiously optimistic and estimate Q1 revenue to be at least $363 million, which will represent growth of 15% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $78 million in Q1.\nTurning to our operating expenses. In 2023, excluding stock-based compensation, we expect our operating expenses to increase on a year-over-year basis. We plan to continue to invest in our business and grow headcount. However, our current operating plans to grow our team at around half the rate we did in 2022. Considering our unique ability to generate both strong top line growth and profitability, we continue to manage with a balanced perspective that allows us to prudently invest in our business to capture the immense opportunity in areas such as CTV or shopper marketing, while retaining flexibility in light of the macro environment.\nWe're also happy to say that most of our teams around the world are now back to working in-person in our hybrid operating model, and we have resumed live team events, travel and other related activities. With that in mind, our operating expense structure of the company is significantly better than it was prior to the pandemic.\nWe are proud that the Trade Desk is one of the few high-growth technology companies consistently able to generate growth, profits and cash. We expect 2023 capital expenditures and capitalized software investments to be around $80 million. We expect data center and infrastructure costs have the majority of our CapEx investment in 2023 as it did in 2022.\nIn closing, I am very pleased with our performance in 2022 and our setup into 2023. We're executing to capture key secular growth drivers like CTV and shopper marketing, we're amassing industry support and partnerships for UID2 and OpenPath, and we're adding more value for our customers with continuous innovation of our platform. We enter 2023 in a strong position to grow and gain more share, continue to focus on both growth and profitability and remain highly optimistic about the prospects for our business this year and in the years to come.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions."

(Operator Instructions)\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Chris Toth, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.\n\nChris Toth\n\nVP of IR, The Trade Desk, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. Hello, and good day to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today, from our Singapore office are Founder and CEO, Jeff Green; Chief Financial Officer, Blake Grayson; and our Chief Revenue Officer, Tim Sims.\nA copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements, which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties.\nThese forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. Actual results may vary significantly, and we expressly assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Should any of our beliefs or assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements.\nI encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provides a more meaningful representation of the company's operational performance.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\n\nJeffrey Terry Green\n\nCo-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO, The Trade Desk, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us. As Chris mentioned, I'm thrilled to be speaking with you today from our Singapore office, our South Asia headquarters. This is the first time that I have been in Asia since January of 2020 due to the global pandemic. And it's been great to reconnect with our team, our clients and our partners here in-person this week. Asia as a whole is crucial to our long-term growth, and it's always inspiring to spend time here. More on that later, but first, on to our results.\nAs you've seen in the release, The Trade Desk posted another very strong quarter with revenue growth up 31% year-over-year. We continue to gain share as advertisers embrace the precision and relevance of data-driven advertising on the open Internet via our platform. Throughout 2022 and in particular, in Q3, The Trade Desk has significantly outperformed seemingly all other forms of digital with a significant contrast to walled garden in our ability to win advertising budgets. It is very clear that under the current operating conditions, we are significantly outpacing the market regardless of the macro environment.\nOur vision and business strategy continues to be validated by our advertising clients. Nearly every single major advertiser wants a world where the open Internet thrives, where competition and price discovery thrive. They want great measurement that works across the web so that they can compare the performance of each site, app or destination to all the others. They want an Internet where relative value can be found. As we've predicted, CTV is a catalyst for massive change on the Internet. When possible, the power balance is shifting to the open Internet away from opaque walled gardens and systems that aren't comparable to others.\nIn short, more and more, our clients embrace the value of the open Internet compared to the limitations of walled gardens, and they are embracing The Trade Desk as the default platform to execute on the open Internet. This is resulting in closer relationships with the largest brands and agencies in the world. Our client relationships are stronger than ever because they are based on shared values and goals, a strong buy-side road map, and Internet where relative value and objective measurement can thrive with data-driven empowerment for brands and advertisers, rather than a tech company who is just asking the brand or agency to outsource media buying to them and send their first-party data down a one-way street.\nBecause of this contrast, we are signing joint business plans with brands at a record pace. Some of the largest JVPs signed this year represent spend of over $1 billion in the future. In this way, not only do these JVPs position The Trade Desk for future growth, but they also create an environment for joint programmatic innovation. JVPs represent strong alignment with brands that only come as a result of not owning media. Whether it's decision CTV, new approaches to identity, unleashing first-party data, advanced data and retail marketplaces, our clients are working with us to pioneer the future of digital advertising.\nWith this context, hopefully, you can see why we continue to outperform the industry and gain share, and why we are confident that our future growth outpaces the projections of almost everyone else in our industry. Just one more data point on the market overall and how we are performing, WPP's GroupM predicted worldwide advertising will increase 8.4% in 2022, and we are growing at more than 3x that rate.\nCTV continues to be a key growth driver, and our shopper marketing initiatives are yielding very encouraging results. While still early, it's only our third full quarter, total shopper marketing spend increased nearly 3x from Q2 to Q3.\nAs we said at Investor Day, we believe that more than 80% of the largest retailers in the United States partner with The Trade Desk, and more of the world's leading retailers are also now following suit. The cores of retailers making retail measurement available is furthering the power and benefits of an open competitive Internet. While CTV may be the biggest force of change for the open Internet, perhaps retail media and its accompanying data is a close second.\nPolitical also continues to perform well. Midterm election -- over midterm election, we have exponentially grown our business. We're proud of the work we do in political advertising, particularly our focus on helping provide a better advertising process for all political candidates. We are an objective and independent platform open to registered candidates on both sides.\nWith all of this in mind, I believe that through the first 9 months of the year, we have gained more market share, grabbed more land than at any point in our history. To provide more color on why, I'd like to touch on 3 areas. First, is the growing importance of programmatic on the open Internet, even in a volatile macro environment. Second is the transformational role of CTV and showcasing that value and last is the critical mass of support that is growing Unified ID 2, and why this is so important in building the new identity fabric of the Internet.\nSo first, in terms of the macro environment, increasingly, advertisers view programmatic as one of the most effective ways to drive relevance and differentiation, especially in times of market volatility. And perhaps even more importantly, they believe that the open Internet is the best place to create that value compared to the limitations of the walled gardens.\nYou only have to look at a couple of comments made by the CFO of P&G during the most recent earnings call a couple of weeks ago. As you may know, Procter & Gamble is one of the world's largest and most progressive advertisers. He said, and I quote, \"It is difficult to describe media sufficiency in dollars, especially when we are actively shifting our spending from linear nontargeted TV into programmatic and into digital spend.\" That is a lot more targeted and a lot more precise in terms of delivering reach and quality of reach where we need it.\nWe now have more than 50% of our media spend in digital. We are increasing our first-party data and our digital capabilities to increase precision of reach, not only in the U.S. or in Europe, but around the world, and that is allowing us to drive significant productivity, while increasing reach, while increasing quality of reach and while more precisely targeting our consumers.\nBack in early 2020, as we entered that short-lived COVID dip, I talked about how easy it was for large brands to turn off programmatic with the first hand of uncertainty. But what you're hearing from P&G there and what I hear from major brands around the world every day now is that programmatic is a central and critical component of any campaign. The world's most sophisticated advertisers understand that as they get more pressure from their CFOs to demonstrate the value and return of every advertising dollar, one of the best places to do that is on our platform.\nWe provide objective, transparent measurement. We provide precision and relevance. We allow advertisers to optimize based on real-time performance, and we provide access to the world's most advanced data marketplace, including many of the world's biggest retailers. CMOs and CFOs are carefully watching costs and spend at this moment. It is why we are particularly excited by the growth on our platform this quarter. This moment is also a time when advertisers have clear goals, and our objective partnership is really important to them achieving those goals.\nWe recently ran a campaign for Clarins, one of the world's largest multinational cosmetic companies. They wanted to reach career women with a specific new product in the U.K. They wanted to do it cost effectively with minimal waste with optimal precision. Using our platform, they were able to launch a multichannel campaign, including mobile, CTV, digital out-of-home and audio. They were able to pivot based on channel performance and retarget based on engagement.\nAs a result, they were able to drive significant new traffic to their website, 8% of whom purchased the product, driving an exponential sales increase, all as part of a highly-decisioned campaign that was automatically optimized on the fly to maximize performance and minimize waste. In an environment with ROI scrutiny of every advertising dollar, this is exactly the kind of campaign optimization that CMOs are looking for. And as a result, they are increasingly gravitating to our platform. Nowhere is this more apparent than CTV, the second area I want to cover. Once again, CTV was our fastest-growing channel and it has rapidly become our largest.\nFor years now, we've been talking about how the English-speaking markets have been leading the adoption of CTV advertising. The U.S. and Australia have been great leaders and case studies for the world, both benefiting from the fragmented and competitive nature of content in their markets, but now CTV adoption is going global. Perhaps the most bullish statement I'll make this year is that our CTV spend grew in the majority of our international markets faster than it did in the United States. I've said previously that the U.S. and Australia are leading the way on CTV and that markets, like the U.K. and France, are following fast, but that pace is picking up in all corners of the world, especially as advertisers look for more relevance and precision in their biggest campaign category.\nLet me give you a couple of quick examples. When Mercedes launched a new C Class model in Australia this year, they wanted to lift brand awareness among the key demographics. Working with us, they were able to deploy a CTV strategy that reached 1.5 million households with precision and which ultimately increased brand awareness 11% among their key targets.\nViewSonic is a multinational electronics company, headquartered in Taiwan. They wanted to launch a new monitor aimed at gamers in key markets, such as India, the Philippines, Germany and U.K. Working with us, they launched a CTV campaign, which was constantly optimized via Koa on our platform letting them iterate based on campaign performance and engagement. They saw significant improvements in all aspects of the campaign performance, from reach to cost effectiveness compared to industry benchmarks. They were also able to link thousands of new engagements on their product website directly to the campaign.\nBack in the U.S., Lexus wanted to reach a new generation of millennial buyers for their luxury cars, most of whom have abandoned linear TV and moved in mass to streaming platforms. They were able to target key audiences with little to no waste and effective frequency management. They were able to reach 15 million potential new customers driving 5x more website traffic than the previous year with an astonishing 67% improvement in purchase intent among key targets.\nOur success in CTV is multifaceted. On our platform, we have built the optimization tools that enable advertisers to drive these kind of results with precision as part of an omnichannel strategy. But on the inventory side, we have developed very close working partnerships with pretty much every premium CTV provider worldwide. While much has been said about Netflix moving to advertising, and we are excited about what that opportunity means for our industry and our business, there are many leading content providers that are driving innovation in CTV.\nNot enough has been said in recent months about what is happening from the content creators, who have long histories in advertising and what they're doing to continue to innovate. Disney will launch advertising on the Disney+ platform in December, and they are incredibly progressive in how they are enabling advertisers to leverage their own first-party data via UID2. We are very proud to be their partner. Transaction volume will grow over time and their standards on ad load and the use of UID2 will put pressure on the rest of the industry to think about CTV in a way that maximizes advertiser value and optimizes the consumers' experience.\nPeacock is one of our longest-standing CTV partners. As with many broadcasters who begin the CTV journey, much of our work with them was initially in a fixed price context, testing the market. But I'm thrilled to report today the vast majority of Peacock inventory that flows through our system is fully decisioned and biddable. And as a result, CPMs have increased significantly, while advertisers are spending more and of course, seeing more value. CTV providers that understand the benefits and gains of fully biddable and decisioned inventory will win over time. They will maximize revenue by helping advertisers drive precision and relevance.\nUID2 is rapidly emerging as a key new CTV identity currency as I predicted it would. Let's remember that cookies are not present in CTV. There's nothing about the role of UID2 in CTV that is a response to the deprecation of cookies. Rather, it is recognition among CTV leaders that they need a way to provide advertisers with relevance in a way that protects consumer privacy as part of omnichannel campaigns.\nOne of the first CTV platforms to embrace UID2 was Fubo, and the results they've seen have been incredibly impressive. Fubo itself has seen ad revenues on our platform increase 113% faster than impression growth. Advertising spend on Fubo on our platform has increased more than 60% and CPMs are up significantly. And with UID2, they are also able to deliver more value to advertisers. One e-commerce retailer saw a 25% improvement in conversion rate and a 14% improvement in return on ad spend. There is a tremendous amount of transformation happening in our industry and on our platform.\nThe adoption of UID2 by the infrastructure of the Internet is transforming the open Internet, and where marketers put their very first dollar. In the coming quarters, we will talk more about all the amazing changes happening in identity, often driven by CTV. 2023 will likely have more market changes that create secular shifts in our direction with more data, more decisioning, better results and the best CTV experience consumers could ever have.\nOne of the key factors in our progress with UID2 has been our success with the world's leading data aggregators, such as AWS, Snowflake, Salesforce, Adobe and many, many others. Put simply, these companies house the first-party data of the world's leading advertisers. With UID2, advertisers can transact on that data without ever leaving home. Because of this progress, I predict that more than half of the data inventory flowing through our platform by early next year will be UID2 tagged. With more and more of our publishers' inventory also UID tagged, that means the value of advertiser first-party data increases exponentially on our platform, more than 10x next year compared to this year.\nWith this progress, the strategic value of UID2 in helping advertisers drive relevance in a privacy-centric manner becomes undeniable. While most of our advertisers are already transacting on UID2 on our platform in some way, I expect they will fully embrace it next year because we've done the hard work on the data and the inventory side, advertisers now have every incentive to fully unleash the first-party data in a way that will supercharge their campaigns. They will finally be able to realize the value of their first-party data to model and understand where their next-generation and most loyal customers are and reach those customers with precision and of course, do that more effectively than ever. This gives me tremendous confidence for 2023 and beyond.\nI'd like to close by just touching on our business here in Asia, as I've spent time with our teams here over the last few days. We are seeing great momentum across the region. We have recently posted some of the biggest months ever in offices, such as Melbourne and New Delhi, as we have benefited from new JVPs and MSAs across the region. We have built strategic partnerships with major inventory players in all of our key markets here.\nAs I said during Investor Day, most publishers I speak with complain that they do not believe that they are getting their fair share of spend today relative to the walled gardens. That's true here in Asia, too. I met with one of the largest publishers here, and they understand they need to maximize revenue on their digital content, but they need greater access to global advertiser demand.\nMany inventory partners in Asia are facing the same problem. As a result, they are looking to partner with The Trade Desk, a partner they can trust to be objective and transparent in delivering maximum advertiser value. On the demand side, Asia is witnessing the emergence of the largest middle class population in history. It is essential for brands to reach these consumers through the channels they use most. And in Asia, that means CTV or OTT or mobile and, of course, premium video on mobile. Because we made investments early across the Asia Pacific region and in many key channels such as mobile, OTT and digital out-of-home, we are in a great position to build on those investments in the years ahead.\nTo come back to where I started, in Asia and around the world, the biggest brands in the world increasingly appreciate the value of data-driven advertising on our platform. We have established trust with advertisers and their agencies that we can deliver growth for their business in any macroeconomic environment. Many of them are now trusting us with significant multiyear partnerships. This means we have very high client retention rates. It means we can innovate with our clients to deliver premium value. Our focus on profitability funds that innovation and ensures that we will remain at the bleeding edge of our industry and that we never have to compromise our beliefs.\nAs a result, we are one of the few high-growth technology companies that consistently generate strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. While I don't often comment on competitors' performance, I do think it's worth noting again that in an environment where many of our competitors have contracted or grew in the single-digit range, we grew 31%. That shows that we are outperforming the market and that we're gaining share, even in what many are calling a challenging macro environment. While we will never be immune from those macro challenges, we are confident that we will continue to outperform.\nI could not be more confident and excited about how we are positioned for 2023 and beyond. Our business has many growth drivers, as we've discussed today, and we will continue to innovate to lead the market, and I'm confident that the world's leading advertisers will continue to default to our platform as they seek to drive their own business growth via advertising.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Blake, who will give you more color on the quarter.\n\nBlake Jeffrey Grayson\n\nCFO, The Trade Desk, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. First, it was great to see so many of you at our Investor Day last month in New York City. We always appreciate the opportunity to dive deeper into the drivers of our business and discuss our strategy in more detail.\nAs our performance in Q3 shows we continue to execute extremely well in the current environment. We continue to grab share and significantly outpace our peers. We again delivered year-over-year revenue growth well into the double digits, while many companies in the ad-funded space have seen low single-digit or even negative year-over-year revenue growth. We've also managed our expenses efficiently, delivering strong adjusted EBITDA and cash flow. Once again, our results reflect the continued shift from advertisers toward data-driven advertising and the open Internet as they continue to shift away from linear channels and walled gardens.\nRevenue in Q3 was $395 million, representing an increase of 31% year-over-year. While the macro environment has created some uncertainty, which we are not immune to, our platform continues to deliver value for advertisers, and we are building trust with our clients for the long term. During the quarter, growth was broad-based across channels and verticals. We saw continued strength from CTV, which again led our growth from a scale channel perspective. We're seeing progress in our shopper marketing business as our customers deploy retail data in more and more of their campaigns. And we continue to see positive results as advertisers utilize Solimar to sharpen campaign goals and activate our industry-leading AI.\nQ3 was another example of our ability to grow top line, while scaling our cost structure efficiently, helping to drive meaningfully positive EBITDA and cash flow. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $163 million, representing a margin of 41%. I'm proud of our sustained efforts to consistently generate strong EBITDA, while continuing to invest in the critical areas of our business that will prepare us for the tighter wave of opportunity ahead, while still producing cash flow that helps fund our future growth.\nOur trailing 12-month free cash flow of nearly $500 million is up 53% from a year ago. While there will always be periods where we may lean into investment due to the opportunity, over the long term, the best business models in the world generate long-term growth, profits and cash. I'm fortunate to be part of a team that considers all of these in our investment decisions.\nFrom a channel perspective, CTV by a wide margin led our growth again during the quarter. Exiting Q3, video, which includes CTV, represented a low 40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow rapidly as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a high 30s percentage share of spend during the quarter as growth was again solid across both in app and mobile video. Display represented a low teens percent of our business and audio represented around 5%.\nGeographically, North America represented about 90% of spend, and international represented about 10% of spend in Q3. Spend growth in North America was resilient as we continue to win new business and gain share. CTV across Southeast Asia and Europe was very strong during the quarter, growing faster than in any other region. While still small compared to CTV spend in North America, we're encouraged to see CTV in both Europe and Southeast Asia rapidly increase year-over-year relative to their overall spend.\nDespite an uncertain macro environment, particularly in Europe, we remain focused on the long-term investments that will position us for strength when conditions improve. In an uncertain environment, like today, advertisers become more deliberate with their ad spend, scrutinizing the effectiveness of their ad budgets much more carefully than they have done previously. As we have shown during similar environments in the past, as advertisers become more deliberate and data-driven with their ad spend, The Trade Desk wins more budget.\nEvery ad run on our platform is measurable, and we are focused on driving the highest returns for every campaign as our clients are. As we're starting to hear more publicly from the largest and most sophisticated advertisers in the world, they are beginning to prioritize programmatic decision advertising investments first because it delivers higher returns than they have seen in other channels. And on top of that, our company's unbiased partnership with them and that we don't own inventory, we don't compete with our customers, and we offer an unrivaled data marketplace where they can inspect, measure and enhance campaigns in ways that walled gardens either refuse to offer or merely cannot match, creates a durable advantage that we believe makes the future very bright for us and for our customers.\nIn terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, travel more than doubled compared with a year ago. Food & Drink, automotive and technology were also very strong. Our automotive vertical is seeing a bit of a resurgence as a result of winning new business with large automotive manufacturers and the easing of supply chain issues the industry has seen over the better part of the last 2.5 years. Hobbies and interest in education were both below the average. Additionally, as expected, political was strong and represented a low single-digit percent of spend in Q3. We continue to believe there is still potential for share gain and improvement in most of our verticals.\nTurning now to expenses. Q3 operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, were $245 million, up 32% year-over-year. Operating expenses during the quarter were primarily driven by investments in our team, particularly in areas like sales and marketing, as we scale prudently to support long-term growth as well as return to office expenses. Income tax was $15 million for the quarter. Adjusted net income was $129 million or $0.26 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $137 million for Q3 and free cash flow was $112 million. DSOs exit in the quarter were 92 days, up 5 days from a year ago. DPOs were 74 days, up 1 day from a year ago. We exited Q3 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.3 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet.\nTurning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We estimate Q4 revenue to be at least $490 million, which would represent growth of 24% on a year-over-year basis. In Q4, we anticipate U.S. political midterm election spend to about double compared with the prior quarter. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $229 million in Q4. From a stock-based compensation perspective, we expect absolute stock-based compensation expense to decline year-over-year in Q4 due to the timing of the CEO performance award granted in Q4 of 2021.\nWhile uncertainty about the macro environment remains, we continue to feel confident in our ability to execute and gain share in the quarters and years ahead. Given the large and growing addressable market in front of us, we see significant opportunities to prudently invest in our business to innovate and to widen the distance between ourselves and our competition.\nIn closing, we are extremely pleased with our strong performance in the third quarter. We continue to demonstrate our ability to drive both profitable growth and achieve significant share gains with large growth drivers, including the secular shift to CTV, attracting more shopper marketing budgets, scaling our international operations to be ready when the macro environment improves, innovating the data marketplace, the U.S. midterm election cycle as well as elevated pressure on walled gardens, we remain optimistic for the remainder of Q4 and into 2023.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions."

(Operator Instructions)\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Chris Toth. Sir, the floor is yours.\n\nChris Toth\n\nVP of IR, The Trade Desk, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. Hello, and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today are Founder and CEO, Jeff Green; and Chief Finance Officer, Blake Grayson. A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section.\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind you that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements, which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. In particular, our expectations around any macroeconomic deceleration, potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in various regions where we operate, in addition to potential supply chain disruptions that could disrupt advertising spend on our platform are all subject to change. Should any of these risks materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections for those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings.\nIn addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provides a more meaningful representation of the company's operational performance.\nLastly, I would like to highlight that we are planning to hold an Analyst Day on Tuesday, October 4, 2022, in New York City. This event will be webcast and available on our Investor Relations website.\nI will now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\n\nJeffrey Terry Green\n\nCo-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO, The Trade Desk, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. As you've seen from the press release, we had a very strong performance in the second quarter. We grew revenue 35% compared with last year, and we outpaced our competitors and continued to gain market share despite some macroeconomic uncertainty.\nIn the first half of the year, marketers shifted to decision data-driven advertising on the open Internet more rapidly than ever. And as a result, The Trade Desk has become increasingly indispensable as the default DSP for the open Internet and connected TV. Perhaps the most encouraging aspect of our business through the first half of this year has been the rate at which we signed new and expanded joint business plans or JBPs with our clients. I haven't spent a lot of time on this dynamic in the past, but I'd like to today because I think this trend says a lot about how we are winning in the market and why that gives us optimism for the future and confidence that we can execute in any market environment.\nJoint business plans, or JBPs, are long-term deals that we sign with leading brands who aim to increase spend on our platform often over a multiyear period. In many cases, these agreements are signed with the partnership and cooperation of the agencies that represent the brands. So as we continue to move upstream and get more direct commitments from CMOs and brand marketers, it is not at the expense of our valuable agency relationships. In the second quarter, we signed new and expanded JBPs at a record rate, covering many verticals. For example, there were new agreements with some of the world's largest automakers and technology companies, along with significantly expanded deals with large global CPGs.\nMany people looking at our results, including those in the advertising industry, are asking how we are winning and growing at this pace in the current environment. There are a few vectors and macro factors that are creating an amazing opportunity for us to grow into a much bigger company and win share regardless of the economic environment. I'd like to take a minute to identify those macro factors that are providing wind at our back.\nFirst, there is a secular tailwind that continues to propel us forward, and that's the worldwide shift to advertising-fueled connected television. I don't know that we've ever experienced a secular tailwind like this before. CTV is evolving faster than anyone predicted. And if we continue to execute, I believe we will benefit as much as any company in the world from this tailwind, just like we did in Q2 and through most of the pandemic.\nThe second macro factor that is helping us grab share is that walled gardens like Google's ad network are being downgraded in priority. For most of the last 2 decades, when dollars moved over from off-line spending to online spending, they have gone first to Google and other walled gardens. One way to define a walled garden is to think about an Internet publisher or a content destination that is so large and dominant in their content segment that they can be draconian to advertisers and still win business. Google's advertising products are a textbook example. Many have pointed out that Google does its own performance measurement. They have run marketplaces with questionable integrity and fairness, but they win advertising budgets because of their dominant position and their size and footprint around the world.\nCTV has started to change this dynamic in our industry though because no one in CTV is big enough to be as dominant in TV as Google has been with search or with Chrome or DoubleClick, their ad server that is almost irreversibly integrated into the Google ad network machine. As a result, the marketplace for premium CTV is fair, especially in relative terms and extremely competitive. Because of the efficacy of moving picture and sound, coupled with these competitive market dynamics, for the first time ever, some of the biggest brands in the world have a new place to spend their first dollar on the Internet, which is premium CTV.\nCTV is fast becoming a must buy, and in some cases, is the highest staff ranked part of the digital media plan for many brands. This trend is changing the makeup of the whole Internet, and it is likely to change the role of walled gardens in our industry, especially the smaller walled gardens. So the bottom line on this second major macro trend, the draconian tactics of walled gardens are now being challenged because of the competitive nature of CTV as advertisers increasingly prioritize premium CTV content.\nAnd lastly, I'd like to talk briefly about the third macro force that is changing the landscape before I come back to us, The Trade Desk and what we're doing and how we're taking advantage of these trends. The third macro trend that is creating market opportunity for us is the worldwide pressure on Google. There has been a great deal of regulatory scrutiny of Google over the past couple of years. We've seen the reports of investigations and complaints from the Department of Justice, the States Attorneys General concerning various forms of alleged antitrust violations in Google's ads business.\nBut it's not just here in the United States. It's also in various other countries around the world. Recently, the U.K.'s Competitive Market Authority or the CMA announced it is investigating whether Google has broken the law by restricting competition in digital advertising in the U.K. As the CMA Chief Executive, Andrea Coscelli said, and I quote, \"We're worried that Google may be using its position in ad tech to favor its own services to the detriment of its rivals, of its customers and ultimately of consumers. Weakening competition in this area could reduce the ad revenues of publishers who may be forced to compromise the quality of their content to cut costs. It may also be raising cost for advertisers, which are passed on through higher prices for advertised goods and services\". So let me be very clear about this point. The Trade Desk stands to gain share no matter the outcome of these investigations or lawsuits. I believe Google's biggest obstacle to compete in programmatic and in CTV is their lack of objectivity.\nBy contrast, we don't own any inventory, and we can partner with everyone in CTV. That gives us a level of objectivity that Google can't overcome as long as it owns YouTube and its search engine, its core assets, and continues to operate on both the buy side and the sell side. Advertisers are increasingly aware of the very concerns that the CMA is raising, especially the large-brand advertisers and their agencies that today constitute the majority of spend on our platform. As a result, I'm confident we will do well regardless of Google's moves in programmatic and with DV360, their demand-side platform or DSP.\nIn addition to thinking about The Trade Desk and how we gain share, I'm often asked to speak about the open Internet more broadly. When I put that hat on and speak on behalf of the open Internet, I do get concerned about what Google has done to make it much harder for companies smaller than The Trade Desk to compete in the open Internet. I'm concerned that the press and regulators are too focused on what assets Google owns or should own and instead should apply more scrutiny to Google's behaviors, their incentives, their structure and their tactics. But that's for another day. I believe so long as we execute, The Trade Desk is going to do well regardless of what tactics Google deploys. Even when Google plays unfairly as some regulators have alleged, it tends to move advertisers and agencies to us. This is one of the reasons we are reporting such a good quarter today and why we're so optimistic about our future.\nSo with that, let's shift gears to discuss our strategy, our tactics and how we're executing. So let's discuss what's happening inside The Trade Desk. Across the company, we're very clear on our mission, and we're extremely focused on helping agencies and advertisers as we always have been. We are focused on the buy side, and our goals are clear, to be the objective open Internet alternative to walled gardens, to pioneer a new approach to decision TV ad buying, to help build the new identity fabric of the Internet and to create a better open Internet for everyone, including us, to enable brands to safely and easily deploy their first-party data and to add more value by creating a more efficient supply chain.\nIt's because of these factors that more and more of the world's leading advertisers are embracing our platform compared to our competitors. It's also why you saw a string of key partnership announcements forged in the second quarter, whether it's Disney partnering with us as they race to ensure that the majority of their ad impressions are automated, or Amazon's AWS, ensuring that the many brands who use their marketing data services can now transact on UID2, the same with Experian who's using UID2 as a common currency or Albertsons becoming the latest retail media partner on our platform to improve measurement and insight for brand selling products at Albertsons. And of course, Albertsons has committed to using UID2 to do this.\nI also want to talk about Netflix' recent moves. I believe they are in a very strong position to be a leader in AVOD and hybrid pricing models similar to how they've led the way for more than a decade in SVOD. We have a great relationship with Netflix. We also have a great relationship with Microsoft. We've had many constructive conversations with Netflix over the last few months. I personally am very impressed with how quickly they are diving into advertising.\nThe Netflix partnership with Microsoft is very positive news for the open Internet. The fact that Netflix didn't choose Google is very telling. We believe it's another strong indication that more industry leaders recognize the opportunity of the open Internet compared to the dangers and limitations of walled gardens. By partnering with Microsoft on the supply side of the digital advertising equation, Netflix controls its own destiny. They chose a partner that can represent their interests, not one with a conflict of interest.\nXandr is a strong sell-side partner and has been a great partner of ours for years. In fact, almost 12 years ago, I initiated the partnership between Microsoft and AppNexus, the company they now own that has been renamed Xandr. Netflix and Xandr have a lot of ground to cover. Once they've done the work on the supply side, driving as much demand as possible toward those ad impressions will come next. Over time, Netflix is very well positioned to open their ad inventory on the demand side to the open Internet. That would enable the demand-side players to compete in an open, objective and decision market, driving high CPMs and maximizing the value for both the advertiser and the publisher, in this case, Netflix. They will need to figure out how to do what Disney and their properties like Hulu are doing so well right now, which is creating a personalized TV and ad experience that respects consumer privacy.\nDisney is setting the pace on this today, which sets a model for what technologically savvy media companies like Netflix and NBCU and Paramount and so many others are likely to pursue very quickly as well. As you know, I predicted publicly and repeatedly many years ago that Netflix and other subscription CTV leaders would eventually offer some kind of ad-supported option. The economics of the market demand it. And so many streaming providers have proved how attractive CTV is to advertisers. We work with almost all of them.\nFor example, one of our early CTV partners, NBC, continues to go from strength to strength on our platform with fully biddable inventory now available across its entire portfolio, including Peacock, which is driving significant interest and growth from our advertisers. The same is true of other premium CTV pioneers, including Discovery Plus and HBO Max, which went live recently as well. As a result of our work with the world's leading CTV pioneers, The Trade Desk is now the largest demand source for decision premium CTV advertising.\nAnd CTV is now reaching the kind of scale where it is forcing change across the advertising ecosystem. CTV leaders will help forge the future of identity. It's where we will dislodge the bricks of the walled gardens most rapidly. It's where advertisers now have globally scaled premium content alternatives to user-generated content. And because CTV has a massive authenticated logged-in user base, it's where advertisers and publishers will innovate new ways to create personalized experiences while also improving consumer privacy and better explaining the quid pro quo of the Internet.\nThere is arguably no company on the planet that cares more about consumer privacy than Disney. They've spent decades building a brand based on intentional, personalized experience across all of their channels. But as they do that, they also want to ensure that their consumers' privacy is highly protected. As you've seen, Disney recently announced an expanded global partnership with The Trade Desk. And as a key part of that partnership, Disney will become interoperable with UID2 across all channels. As you know, Disney engages consumers in many different ways, all of which are incorporated into their Audience Graph, which is now interoperable with UID2.\nAaron LaBerge, the President and CTO of Disney Media & Entertainment Distribution, perhaps said it best, and I quote, \"The growth of our relationship with The Trade Desk is a milestone in addressability and automated buying at scale and the latest step as we use technology to enable advertisers to buy once to deliver everywhere across Disney\".\nI want to spend a moment on why UID2 is so important. A couple of weeks ago, Google announced that they are delaying the demise of third-party cookies in Chrome until at least the second half of 2024. If you've been paying attention to anything we've said over the last couple of years at The Trade Desk, you'll understand how completely predictable this announcement was. I've said I'm not sure it is ever in Google's best interest to get rid of third-party cookies, but it ultimately doesn't really matter that much. The uncertainty around Google's decision-making is only hardening the resolve of the rest of the industry to develop new approaches to identity. It is shortsighted to think about this work as simply a replacement for cookies. That doesn't really capture the scope of what's going on, and Disney is a great example of this.\nDisney wants to pioneer new ways to create highly personal experiences that protect consumer privacy across all channels. In most of those channels, cookies are not even present. It's much bigger than cookies. CTV does not rely on cookies. Successful consumer-oriented companies are taking a holistic approach to the consumer across all experiences and designing something new. Marketers understand that key marketing objectives such as reach, frequency and data usage and privacy can be managed in a much more deliberate and decisioned and holistic manner.\nPart of the reason that Disney can act with confidence here is because we've already done the hard work of activating UID2 across the data infrastructure that's something at the central nervous system of digital advertising. AWS is a great illustration of this. AWS recently announced that they will enable their customers to deploy UID2 to help liberate the customer data stored on their platform, and AWS is one of the largest aggregators of marketing data in the world. If an advertiser uses AWS already, they can use UID2 to create an identifier that helps put that data to work without any of the data ever leaving AWS. AWS is just the latest infrastructure leader to deploy UID2. They are joining other leaders that include Oracle, Adobe, Salesforce and Snowflake to help build the new identity fabric of the Internet. The latest major data player to join this movement is Experian. Experian Marketing Services is one of the leading suppliers of marketing data and insights to advertisers, and they are now using UID2 for their third-party data sets.\nAs we've said all along, the success of UID2 will never hinge on ringing 10,000 door bells. First and foremost, it's about gaining traction with the infrastructure of the ad tech industry, and with that infrastructure in place, it is much easier for advertisers and publishers to activate because UID2 is already embedded in the tools they rely on. In a world with better identity solutions like UID2 instead of cookies, publishers will make more money per ad. Advertisers will need fewer, more relevant ads to make an impact and sell product. Consumers will have more privacy and more control over their privacy. And that's why I'm confident that almost all of our customers will be transacting on UID2 by the end of this year. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, we are highly encouraged by our performance and optimistic about our ability to outpace the market moving forward. The combination of macro trends and our own innovation enables us to deliver differentiated value to our clients.\nOf course, we understand many of our customers are dealing with uncertainty. But even with that uncertainty, we remain focused and confident. Programmatic advertising first came of age during the global financial crisis between 2007 and early 2009. We launched The Trade Desk right in the heart of the uncertainty in 2009. And while we are not immune to macroeconomic weakness, we gained share coming out of the uncertainty during the early months of the COVID pandemic. And it's because in times of uncertainty and volatility, when marketers have to make the most of every advertising dollar that we have an opportunity to demonstrate our value. Our customers recognize that efficient and decisioned advertising can play a critical role in differentiating their brands to specific audiences and specific times. And there's no better platform on which to do that than The Trade Desk.\nThroughout the first half of 2022 and particularly in the second quarter, I believe we have gained more market share or grabbed more land than at any period in our history. And in large part, that's because as marketers become more deliberate with their budgets, they are prioritizing advertising that delivers the highest return. And CTV has moved up the priority list. So while we can't control the macroeconomic environment, the pace at which we are signing new and expanded customer agreements indicates that we are becoming an indispensable partner in their business growth, and we anticipate grabbing land regardless of the macroeconomic environment.\nWe will never rest on our laurels. As one of the few high-growth tech companies that consistently generates strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow, we have the financial flexibility to invest so that we can innovate for our customers. Last year, on 7/7, we launched our biggest platform upgrade in our company's history. A year later, 100% of our customers are now using our Solimar platform, with all the data, the measurement and decisioning benefits that Solimar brings them. This is perhaps our greatest engineering achievement yet.\nWithin Solimar, our data marketplace continues to expand rapidly. Many leading retailers are now integrated with our platform, including Walgreens, Albertsons and Target. And we continue to see utilization growth from both endemic and non-endemic advertisers. We continue to innovate to help build the new identity fabric of the Internet, whether it's the data infrastructure work that's already proving so successful in North America or the early work around EU ID in Europe, which is already gaining very encouraging traction.\nWe continue to see success from brands working with the Walmart DSP with significant quarter-over-quarter growth and the strongest quarter yet. And in CTV, we are already beta testing our forward market product. We're working with select streaming platforms and advertisers to bring this new approach to CTV decisioning in advance of next year's upfronts.\nAnd early results are very positive. A strong forward market should replace the upfront market and provide a better TV experience for the whole ecosystem. Our early adopter advertisers are seeing excellent win rates, and they want to commit larger budgets to it. And publishers are gaining confidence that this should become an essential component of monetizing their inventory.\nAs I said at the outset, the transformational impact of CTV, the revolutionary approaches to identity and growing instability in some of our walled garden competition will only accelerate our ability to deliver value and to continue to gain share. I could not be more excited about the work ahead of us in the second half of this year and in the years ahead.\nAnd with that, I'll pass the baton to Blake, who will give you more color on the quarter.\n\nBlake Jeffrey Grayson\n\nCFO, The Trade Desk, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. As you have seen in our results, Q2 was a very strong quarter. Revenue was $377 million, representing an increase of 35% year-over-year. Our top line growth of 35% is especially impressive given we are comparing against a prior year growth rate of over 100% in Q2 of 2021.\nWhile the macro environment has created some uncertainty, and we are not immune to it, we continue to gain share as more and more advertisers seek efficiency and measurable results in their ad spend, particularly in CTV. We also benefit from the diversity of our business model, including not only the breadth of advertisers and verticals we represent, but also the range of inventory we have access to across the open Internet, which provides a long-term durability we are proud of.\nDuring the quarter, we benefited from a digital advertising environment that is shifting increasingly towards data-driven buying and measurable results. Growth was broad-based across channels and verticals this quarter. We saw continued strength from CTV, which again led our growth from a scale channel perspective. We successfully completed a full transition to Solimar, and our customers continue to see positive results as they utilize our platform to sharpen campaign goals, activate our industry-leading AI and leverage more data elements per impression.\nWe are also seeing progress in our shopper marketing business. We have brought new partners into the platform over the past few months, and we are pleased to see increasing interest and adoption from advertisers utilizing shopper data in their campaigns. Although it is still very early days for us, spend that utilizes our expanding shopper data lineup continues to ramp very well.\nWith the continued strong top line performance in Q2, and we've generated $139 million in adjusted EBITDA or about 37% of revenue. When we outperform on the top line, we often see that outperformance drop down to EBITDA, as it did again in Q2. I'm proud of our sustained efforts to consistently generate meaningfully positive EBITDA while continuing to invest in the critical areas of our business that can drive our future growth. This was particularly true in Q2 as items such as our first live company-wide event in over 3 years resumed and travel also continued to ramp up.\nFrom a channel perspective, CTV by a wide margin led our growth again during the quarter. Exiting Q2 video, which includes CTV, represented a low 40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow rapidly as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a high 30s percentage share of spend during the quarter. And display and audio continued to represent about 15% and 5% of our business, respectively.\nGeographically, North America represented about 90% of spend, and international represented about 10% of spend. Spend in North America maintained its resiliency as we continue to win new business and gain share. In particular, our Chicago office, which is our second largest office behind New York, grew spend faster on a year-over-year basis than any other office in the world that represent at least 1% of our spend. Fantastic results by that team as we continue to expand our reach. Our international spend grew both sequentially and year-over-year but dropped slightly as a percent of overall mix.\nHistorically, our growth has been driven by the strong position we have in CTV, particularly in North America, as was the case again in Q2. However, our CTV business internationally continues to grab share. CTV spend in Europe, again, more than doubled year-over-year. Despite a challenging macro environment, particularly in Europe, we are focused on making the long-term investments that will position us to be stronger when conditions improve. As we have proven in the past, as our customers become more deliberate and data-driven with their ad spend, much like they did in late 2020, The Trade Desk is in a great position to help customers achieve better ROI and win more of their budget.\nIn terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, nearly all of them grew in the double digits during the quarter. Both travel and pets more than doubled compared with a year ago. Food and drink and technology were also very strong with food and drink accelerating on a year-over-year basis every month during the quarter. Home and garden and automotive grew slower than the average. However, both verticals grew faster than the average in July. Additionally, automotive still grew in the double digits in Q2 and accelerated in growth from Q1. We continue to believe that there is the potential for share gain and improvement in most of our verticals.\nTurning now to expenses. Q2 operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, were $250 million, up 45% year-over-year. Growth in operating expenses is influenced by investments in our team, particularly in areas like sales and marketing and technology and development as we continue to build a platform for long-term growth as well as the return of in-person events. Income tax was $21 million for the second quarter. The higher amount of tax relative to prior quarters was driven primarily by lower benefits from stock-based awards, the timing of which are variable.\nAdjusted net income was $99 million or $0.20 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $92 million for Q2, and free cash flow was $86 million. DSOs exited in the quarter were 91 days, up 9 days from a year ago. DPOs were 73 days, up 6 days from a year ago. We exited Q2 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.2 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet.\nTurning to our outlook for the second quarter. We estimate Q3 revenue to be at least $385 million, which would represent growth of 28% on a year-over-year basis. In Q3, we anticipate U.S. political midterm election spend to represent a low single-digit share as a percent of our business. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $140 million in Q3.\nWhile there is continued uncertainty about the macroeconomic environment, we continue to feel confident in our ability to execute and take share. Given the large available market in front of us, we see significant opportunities to invest in our business. In more uncertain times, this enables us to widen the distance between ourselves and our competition in areas such as technology, identity, supply chain optimization and customer service.\nIn closing, we are extremely pleased with our strong performance in the quarter with significant growth drivers, including CTV, retail media, our international business, Solimar as well as the U.S. midterm election cycle, we remain highly optimistic about our future prospects. We continue to generate strong annual free cash flow and the strength of our business model and balance sheet have positioned us well as we enter the second half of the year.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions."

(Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Chris Toth, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.\n\nChris Toth\n\nVP of IR, The Trade Desk, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. Hello, and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today are Founder and CEO, Jeff Green; and Chief Financial Officer, Blake Grayson. A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section.\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind you, that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. In particular, our expectations around the impact of the recent pandemic on our business and results of operations, in addition to potential supply chain disruptions or other macro events that could disrupt advertising spend, are all subject to change. Should any of these risks materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to our risk factors referenced in our press release and in our most recent SEC filings.\nIn addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provides a more meaningful representation of the company's operational performance.\nI will now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\n\nJeffrey Terry Green\n\nCo-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO, The Trade Desk, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As you've seen from the press release, we are off to a great start once again this year. For the first quarter, revenue grew 43% compared with last year, our fastest first quarter growth rate in the last 4 years. Our strong growth is a testament to a variety of factors that I want to touch on today and which give us significant optimism for the future.\nOur performance is especially encouraging because annual advertising budgets are often being reset and reconsidered in Q1, making them historically harder to predict. And this year, the macro environment was challenging with the ongoing global pandemic, war in the Ukraine and the higher rates of inflation around the world. Despite those challenges, we again exceeded our own expectations. I believe we are now firmly established as the default DSP for the open Internet and that we are very well-positioned to grow and grab share regardless of the macro environment.\nWe now have over 1,000 customers, representing tens of thousands of advertisers spending on our platform across the open Internet. We continue to see a steady stream of new agencies and brands starting to work with us for the first time as well as existing customers increasing their spend with us. We are seeing strong momentum around key initiatives, such as connected TV, shopper data, UID2, OpenPath and our game-changing new data marketplace. In each case, we are working with our advertising clients to drive maximum value from their campaign dollars. And this, in turn, helps us grow our trusted relationships with the world's leading brands and agencies, many of whom are signing long-term strategic partnerships with us.\nAs a CEO, it's always important for me to look at how we are performing relative to the industry. For example, the IAB and PwC predict digital advertising will increase approximately 8% in 2022. Publicis Groupe's Zenith estimates the increase at about 14%. But either way, we continue to grow at a pace well ahead of industry estimates, which means we are gaining share and adding significant value. I continue to be extremely optimistic, in part, because of the combination of our exceptional 95%-plus retention rate and our significant growth rate.\nThere are macroeconomic forces which have changed the media and technology landscape dramatically in the last few months, especially in CTV, which also give me optimism. As many of you know, I have spent many of the last 10 years publicly predicting that Netflix and nearly everyone else would eventually show ads. Netflix recently announced that they are likely to make ads a part of their future. This and so many other great things are happening in CTV.\nIn fact, I can't think of a time that the TV landscape has had more positive changes in a short period of time than what has happened in Q1 of this year. I want to spend the biggest lock of time on that. But in order to discuss the significance of what's happening in CTV, we first need to discuss what's happening with 2 foundational initiatives: first, our work on a new identity framework for the Internet; and second, our work to make the supply chain more efficient.\nSo first, identity. The Internet has been operating on a quid pro quo since it became commercial, but the Internet has been a suboptimal Internet. And by that, I mean, we've used cookies as a makeshift technology to enable relevant advertising. But due to a series of events and choices, cookies are going away. Currently, Google has the majority of the browser market share around the entire Internet, outside of China. So they decided when this transition is going to take place, and they have currently targeted the end of Q1 2023. This has created a very unique opportunity to upgrade the Internet. Indeed, without those many circumstances, this opportunity wouldn't exist. We are upgrading from an opt-out Internet, to an opt-in Internet.\nThe open Internet is scrambling to coordinate and collectively upgrade. Many different opt-in IDs are being created. Some of them will scale and survive, some won't. However, those that scale will be distributed, encrypted and interoperable. We don't believe IDs can or will scale if they don't upgrade the experience for consumers.\nWith this in mind, we developed and launched UID2. This is the second version of UID, version 2 being e-mail and phone number-based instead of cookie-based. This allows consumers to take their privacy settings and controls with them all over the Internet without loss of control or a false sense of security. Some of the privacy protection that has been promised to consumers by large technology companies with billions of log-ins have misled some consumers to believe that they control privacy, opt-in and the quid pro quo of the Internet across CTVs, mobile environments and computer browsers.\nUID actually does enable consumers to set preferences and restrictions for each web publisher, mobile app and CTV app. They choose who they trust and can change their mind. Their preferences are tied to an encrypted, hashed, salted ID based on e-mail address or phone number that a consumer can take with them. Because this move to an upgraded opt-in Internet is scheduled to happen in about 10 months based on the date Google deprecates third-party cookies in Chrome, the entire open Internet ecosystem is thinking about identity, and we continue to make significant progress with UID2. And I would like to spend a few minutes talking about this progress and the various innovations that are driving that progress.\nIn terms of the number of unique IDs, we are now measuring UIDs on billions of devices. With every passing month, we are posting new all-time highs. That comes as more advertisers activate on UID2 and as more publishers adopt it.\nLet me give you one quick example which is particularly illustrative of the business value of UID2. MediaVine is a company that manages advertising for more than 8,500 independent publishers. Those include some large publishers like The Hollywood Gossip and some very niche publishers like Steamy Kitchen. They're big. They are a Comscore top 5 lifestyle media platform, with more than 130 million monthly viewers and 17 billion monthly ad impressions.\nMediaVine has now adopted and deployed UID2. Their publishers have seen CPMs increase more than 100%. With UID2, they can create privacy-safe identifiers for their readers, pass those on safely to advertisers, who can then serve relevant advertising without ever knowing anything directly identifiable about the reader. Better opt-ins and more sign-ins, including new lightweight SSOs, is what a post-cookie Internet is going to look like. And pioneering advertisers, publishers and CTV providers are building that Internet now.\nMomentum is amazing, but we're still in the early stages simply because the Internet is so big. This work is both inevitable and essential. Without relevant advertising, CPMs will crater. That's the fundamental value exchange of the Internet, relevant advertising in exchange for free content. That's why so many publishers are implementing UID2, with many already reporting strong CPM growth.\nThe ecosystem of UID partners also continues to expand. InfoSum, a leading data collaboration platform, recently signed up as another closed operator of UID2. Many leading advertisers and their agencies, including Omnicom, already use InfoSum to activate their first-party data and are excited about this partnership as they look to unlock the value of that data while maintaining control over it using UID2.\nAppLovin also recently joined the UID ecosystem. AppLovin is one of the world's leading mobile in-app ad exchanges, and our advertisers now have access to ad opportunities across more than 140,000 apps and 1.8 billion devices, with the precision and relevance that UID2 creates. The solutions such as UID2 allow us to manage that value exchange in a way that improves the experience for all parties. I believe this new approach will ultimately result in an upgrade to the Internet.\nWe also recently announced that we are launching a version of UID2 that will be tailored for the European market called EUID. To understand the connection between UID2 and EUID, consider an analogy to Chrome and Chromium. Chromium is a free open-source development platform for web browsers. Many browsers use core elements of Chromium, including Google Chrome, which uses Chromium as a foundation, but which is enhanced and adapted by Google. Essentially, Chrome is one iteration built on top of Chromium.\nIn the same way, UID2 is an open-source project and EUID is a version of it, developed for Europe, that meets the specific needs of that market, especially the legislative requirements. Building this specific version also allows us to build in the features that give our partners reassurance that data will not leave Europe, even for international companies that do business and have data in Europe. With this approach, we believe that EUID is the most GDPR-compliant identity solution in the market today.\nIn order for the open Internet to thrive, it will require more authentication or logging in. High CPMs and relevance will gravitate to publishers and content owners who have logged-in users. CTV and new sites and apps especially have a unique opportunity at this moment as the identity foundation of the Internet being rebuilt.\nThe CTV leaders understand this. Nearly every CTV ad is shown on the authenticated side of a log-in, almost always via an e-mail or phone number, which means CTV already operates in an opt-in environment, unlike much of the rest of the Internet, which is still in opt-out, although it's transitioning. Within that environment, broadcasters can work with advertisers to build the new identity fabric of the Internet that provides addressability, while significantly upgrading consumer privacy.\nAnd new identity solutions, including UID2, are key here. With UID2, advertisers can safely onboard first-party data. And then with interoperability with CTV apps, they can find valuable audiences, both current and prospects, exactly when they are viewing their favorite premium content. Ultimately, this is a much better advertising experience than one based on cookies. Cookies were never really intended to do this work. They were just co-opted. But in new technology environments, like CTV, we can build a new identity framework that allows advertisers to create relevance, enables publishers to maximize yield and hand consumers much more control over their privacy.\nSo in many ways, the CTV ecosystem will pioneer the future of identity. To be clear, it's not about any one identity solution. It's about interoperability. This new fabric will include new currencies, such as UID2, but also other identifiers, whether it's those developed by CTV providers themselves, measurement partners like Nielsen or by companies such as LiveRamp. And we are working with all of them to ensure this new fabric pays off those promises I just outlined for all participants.\nThere is so much to discuss today that I'm going to bookmark a related issue that I would like to discuss in a future call, our data marketplace. The data marketplace is as healthy as ever, largely because UID2 and a better opt-in environment creates a better foundation for our data marketplace, which has the potential to become the largest in the world. I don't think any walled garden can ever create a data marketplace to rival it.\nAlready, we have enacted massive marketplace design upgrades. As a result, we're already seeing higher data usage, better CPAs and ROI for advertisers, better margins and a faster-spinning flywheel for us. We have once again stair step-increased the consumer surplus of our offering to our clients. There is so much more to report on this and more change and benefit to come, so I'm excited to talk about that in the future.\nRelated to all the progress we're making with UID is the recent launch of OpenPath. We announced it in our last earnings report, and I would like to give an update today. First, a reminder of what it is. OpenPath is a way for our advertisers to plug directly into publisher inventory via our platform. By plugging in directly, publishers have the opportunity to capture the value of an opt-in Internet and implement changes that benefit all participants, including advertisers and agencies.\nI do want to reiterate that this does not mean that The Trade Desk is getting into the SSB or supply side business. OpenPath is simply a direct path to inventory with publishers that already have their own yield management solutions. OpenPath helps eliminate steps in the process where there may be fees or charges with no value in return.\nFor example, since we announced OpenPath, we have shut down Google's open bidding on our platform. When we announced OpenPath a few months ago, we also had commitments from news organizations that represent a majority of news consumers in the United States, organizations such as Reuters; The Washington Post; Gannett; Condé Nast, which owns Vanity Fair, Vogue, The New Yorker and many others; McClatchy, which owns more than 30 leading daily newspapers, including The Kansas City Star and the Fort Worth Star-Telegram; Hearst magazines and newspapers, which operate major titles such as the Cosmopolitan and the San Francisco Chronicle; the Tribune Group and several others.\nIn the days following the announcement, we had more than 100 inbound inquiries from major publishers looking to join the initiative. We're prioritizing journalism as we launch OpenPath because nowhere is the danger of the absence of identity more apparent. Recently, we announced more journalistic publishers committing to OpenPath, including The L.A. Times, BuzzFeed, Forbes, MediaVine and Red Ventures, which includes publications such as CNET and Lonely Planet.\nAs more publishers adopt OpenPath, they will make UID2 deployment or interoperability a key element of their plan. In doing so, they can activate their own first-party subscriber data in a way that protects that data, but also provides enough relevance to advertisers that we can enhance the value of those ad impressions and yield for publishers.\nFor those that don't show most of their ads after a user has logged in, OpenPath will include a simple UID2-based SSO that will help them make this essential transition to a post-cookie environment.\nLet me bring this back to CTV because CTV is really the epicenter of open Internet identity. We've seen massive moves in the CTV landscape recently. In 2021, we added exponentially more inventory, thanks to new partnerships with a wide range of partners, including Peacock, Paramount+, discovery+ and Sky. Early this year, we entered a scaled relationship with HBO Max, one of the most recent and fastest-growing content companies to aggressively adopt ad-funded subscriptions for consumers.\nOn a more macro level, Amazon bought MGM and streams ads through IMDb TV. Just this year so far, Disney+ announced that ads would be added as a choice to their app. Microsoft acquired Xandr. Time Warner left the AT&T family and is now owned by Discovery and is mostly led by discovery+ leadership, which is one of the most savvy programmatic teams in TV. And of course, Netflix recently announced that it will likely make ads available on their platform. These major changes in the landscape have huge implications for the future of CTV and programmatic.\nA tailored TV ad is probably the most effective scaled advertising available today on or off-line. As a result, for most of our clients, TV is the largest segment of their campaign spend. That unique combination of video and audio delivered at a time when the audience is leaned in, remains the most effective way to touch the hearts and minds of consumers. As those consumers have shifted en masse to streaming platforms, advertisers are following them.\nFor consumers, on-demand content is just better. As content owners and the streaming apps are competing for more subscribers, it has become very clear, providing consumers with choice is the only way to win. This is a great setup for Netflix. By not having ads to date, Netflix has protected an amazing user experience, but it required Netflix to keep raising prices so that they could keep making and buying content. At some point, price becomes an issue for nearly all consumers. Consider what we can learn from TV of the past. Even in the days of cable bundles, very few consumers pay for every premium channel, SHOWTIME, HBO, Cinemax, NBA League Pass, et cetera. In the past, nearly all channels have had ads.\nNow once again, consumers will have something better, choice. Netflix will very likely setup a clean option for consumers, see ads and pay meaningfully less or pay slightly more and avoid ads altogether. Consumers will continue to be given more choices. I predict that with this move, Netflix will continue to be something of a pace car in TV innovation. They were the first ones to really nail the subscription model for CTV. They were the first to 100 million global subscribers, the first to 200 million, and they continue to lead that race today. And now, they are embracing consumer choice as a way to expand their market share even further.\nIt's important to note that at least half of Netflix subscribers are outside the United States. So the implications to this move has global ramifications to the world of CTV. But there will even be more to this part of the story. As Netflix explores advertising options, they will be unburdened by legacy processes that some of their competitors are working through. For example, they will be able to structure their advertising operations so they don't have sales channel conflict. They can be data-driven from the start in everything that they do, using data to ensure that they maximize yield on every ad impression.\nIn all of these dimensions, and likely many others, I believe Netflix will continue to innovate and set the pace. And as with any market, others will have to adapt accordingly. Many of them already are. We are working on these opportunities with leading CTV providers every single day.\nHBO Max, Disney+ and Netflix are all public about their intentions to implement ad experiences. This adds pressure to all content owners to accelerate the move to data-driven buying and selling and finding ways to make the most competitive consumer experience, which means limited relevant ads with high CPMs.\nFor CTV to continue to produce the amazing and expensive content that is driving this new golden age of television, relevant ads are the only way to fund and preserve it. This requires CTV to participate in the open Internet because in walled gardens, one cannot control universal reach and frequency. Additionally, I believe this means every CTV company around the world is racing to create this optimal viewing experience.\nTV has historically competed regionally due to the licensing and broadcast regulations. Netflix and YouTube have made this a global race. We're seeing content owners all over the world quickly adapting to these recent moves. Recently, I've personally spoken about this directly with some of our content partners in the United States and in Europe. They are already feeling the pressure to move fast and to improve their ad experiences. This messaging from Netflix, Disney+ and HBO Max is requiring everyone to embrace biddable environments and move away from legacy models, like upfronts and even programmatic-guaranteed, where advertiser choice is limited. These changes in the TV landscape also have adjusted marketers' mindsets.\nAs advertisers are seeing reach and impact erode from traditional cable television, they are focused on moving to premium streaming content. Increasingly, this is the most important buy on the media plan. Marketers want to advertise against premium content as much as possible. It's content they can trust. It's content that reflects their own brand. It's content they can activate on and measure against with precision. As advertisers prioritize ads on premium content on our platform, they are beginning to start their campaign planning there, too. As a result, user-generated content is increasingly getting the leftovers.\nWith the explosive growth of premium CTV over the last few years, especially the last year, the trend is clear. We see it clearly reflected in some of the UGC data that's been reported out in the last few weeks, and it's also why CTV remains by far our fastest-growing channel and why premium video, in all of its forms, has become the largest segment of our business. This trend will be equally apparent internationally where there is also a flight to premium content.\nWe work with many of the Fortune 500 companies, almost all of whom direct their advertising campaigns at multiple international markets. As more premium supply comes online, particularly premium video, we have more than enough demand to satisfy it.\nAnd we could not be more excited about what this shift from Netflix, Disney+ and HBO Max means in terms of opening the door of AVOD supply, not only in major markets that have already embraced CTV advertising, such as Western Europe and Australia, but also in many other markets where AVOD will be a vital driver of subscription growth because of tighter economic pressure on consumer wallets.\nPremium video, where everything is authenticated, is one of those key areas where the future of Internet identity is being forged, not just for CTV, but across the open Internet, including inside the browser. That may not seem obvious as cookies are not present in CTV, and so you would think they would be less affected by the potential phaseout of cookies next year. But CTV needs persistent identity to have effective and high CPM ads, and they need high CPM ads to fund that content.\nIt's economics that's driving that process. As more CTV leaders embrace advertising, they want to ensure that they create as much addressability as possible because that's the only way that they can maintain high CPMs. And an advertiser will pay, say, a $12 CPM if they know the viewers are watching the latest hot reality show, but they will pay 3x that if there's a reasonable chance those viewers are interested in their product. And that's why they will be among the pioneers of the new identity framework or the open Internet.\nI would like to wrap this up by bringing us back to the market opportunity in front of us. The global advertising industry is moving rapidly towards a $1 trillion TAM. As the market grows, the majority of that spend will be digital, and all of it will ultimately be traded programmatically. At the same time, the industry is making important progress in several dimensions in building the Internet advertising ecosystem of the future, one that no longer relies on cookies.\nThe Internet is getting an upgrade. We're moving from an opt-out Internet to an opt-in Internet. Everything is founded on a better identity framework. On that foundation comes better controls for consumers, more choices for consumers on how to pay for CTV subscriptions, whether that's with money or with ad time, and better measurement and data.\nAs the ecosystem continues to evolve and move away from walled gardens, led by CTV, we will unleash the power of programmatic for our advertisers and for our publisher partners. It will be an improved experience for everyone, consumers included. The innovations we are driving to help accomplish this are already delivering performance improvements for us today. They are a key factor in why we are off to such a positive start in 2022 and why we are so optimistic about our growth opportunities looking forward.\nAs I said earlier, advertisers are increasingly gravitating to our platform as the de facto DSP of the open Internet, led by CTV. And we will continue to innovate to reinforce that leadership position and deliver more value to our advertisers.\nOur profitable business model allows us complete flexibility to make these investments and continue to drive growth. In doing so, we will help build a better Internet for all stakeholders, and all of that is what makes me so excited about our growth prospects.\nWith that, I will hand the call over to Blake, who will take you through more of the financial details.\n\nBlake Jeffrey Grayson\n\nCFO, The Trade Desk, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. As you have seen in our results, 2022 has started out strong, with solid Q1 financial performance and execution despite the current macro environment. Q1 revenue was $315 million, a 43% increase and an acceleration in growth from a year ago. In Q1, we benefited from a digital advertising environment that is leaning increasingly towards data-driven advertising and measurable results. This was evidenced by the continued strength in CTV, which again led our growth from a scaled channel perspective.\nSolimar adoption is over 80%, and we continue to see promising results as customers are utilizing Solimar to leverage more data elements than they did previously. More data-driven precision improves ROI for customers, and we believe this helps spin the flywheel of our business faster.\nWe are also starting to see green shoots in our retail media business, with Q1 representing our first full quarter of operations in this space. We have brought on additional retail media partners into the platform and are cautiously optimistic as spend continues to ramp up.\nWith the durable top line performance in Q1, we generated $121 million in adjusted EBITDA or about 38% of revenue. The $121 million in adjusted EBITDA represents a 72% increase from a year ago. In Q1, we continued to benefit from temporarily lower-than-expected operating expenses, partly driven by the virtual environment. Even recognizing that, I'm proud of our continued ability to consistently grow our top line revenue while generating meaningfully positive adjusted EBITDA and cash flow that has enabled our cash and short-term investments balance to end the quarter over the $1 billion mark for the first time.\nIn the current environment, our demonstrated ability to invest for growth and self-fund our high-growth rates through profitable long-term cash flow generation sets us up well for the future.\nFrom a scaled channel perspective, CTV, by a wide margin, led our growth again during the quarter. For Q1, video, including CTV, represented our largest percent of share on the platform, followed by mobile. Video and mobile each represented about 40% of spend. Display continued to grow well in Q1 and represented about 15% of spend. And audio represented about 5% of spend.\nGeographically, North America represented 88% of spend, and international represented 12% of spend. International's overall share, while relatively small for our overall business, dropped slightly from Q4 and the prior year. Historically, our growth has been driven by the strong position we have in CTV, particularly in North America. That said, our CTV business internationally continues to grab share, with European CTV spend more than doubling over the prior year in Q1.\nWe did see a larger gap between our North American growth rate and international growth rate, particularly in the second half of Q1, mainly due to spend in Europe. However, through April, Europe has recovered to levels we saw early in Q1, although there is still some room to improve. I'm excited about our opportunities to grab share as we have proven that as our customers become more deliberate and data-driven with their ad spend, much like they did in late 2020, The Trade Desk is in a great position to help those customers and also spin our flywheel. It is still early days for us internationally, but we are optimistic about our market position and the long-term growth opportunity that we have.\nIn terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, nearly all of them grew in the double digits during the quarter. Both travel and pets more than doubled compared with a year ago. Shopping and Food & Drink were also very strong. We believe there is still the potential for share gain and improvement in most of our verticals.\nTurning now to expenses. Excluding stock-based compensation, operating expenses were $207 million in Q1, up 30% year-over-year. We continued to see significant operating leverage as we scale the business and improve our efficiency. Our income tax benefit of $2.7 million in the quarter was mainly due to the tax benefits associated with employee stock-based awards, the timing of which can be variable. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $105 million or $0.21 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $146 million for Q1. And free cash flow was $136 million.\nDSOs exiting the quarter were 88 days, down 5 days from a year ago. DPOs were 72 days, down 3 days from a year ago.\nWe exited Q1 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.1 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet.\nTurning to our outlook for the second quarter. We estimate Q2 revenue to be at least $364 million, which would represent growth of 30% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $121 million in Q2. With a large available market in front of us, we see significant opportunities ahead and continue to be motivated to invest thoughtfully in the business, placing a high importance on hiring to support future growth. This enables us to continue distancing ourselves from the competition, in areas such as technology, identity, supply chain optimization and customer service.\nI am pleased that over the past couple of years, the operating expense structure of the company has improved and is significantly better than it was prior to the pandemic. Doing so allows us to invest meaningfully in opportunities for growth while still generating strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow.\nIn closing, we are excited about the momentum of our business. With significant long-term growth drivers, including CTV, our international business, our retail media opportunity, which is only just beginning, our recent platform upgrade in Solimar and the upcoming U.S. midterm election cycle, we remain highly optimistic about the long-term prospects for our business in 2022 and beyond. We continue to generate strong free cash flow. And the strength of our business model and balance sheet have positioned us well in the current environment.\nI believe we have the structure in place to continue driving long-term growth while scaling our business efficiently. And I'm cautiously optimistic about continued improvement in the future.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions."

A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section.\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind you that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements, which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties, in particular, our expectations around the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and results of operations in addition to potential supply chain disruptions that could disrupt advertising spend are all subject to change. Should any of these risks materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings.\nIn addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we also present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures combined with our GAAP results provides a more meaningful representation of the company's operational performance.\nI will now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\n\nJeffrey Terry Green\n\nFounder, Chairman, President & CEO, The Trade Desk, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris. Good morning, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Q4 2021 was another outstanding quarter for The Trade Desk and an exclamation point on a terrific year. Across the board, we exceeded all our goals for 2021, which culminated in crossing the $1 billion revenue mark, ending the year with $1.2 billion in annual revenue, an increase of 43% year-over-year.\nTotal platform spend was almost $6.2 billion. It's only 10 years ago, May of 2011, when we received our first penny of spend to think last year, we passed $6 billion in spend. It is both astonishing and inspiring. I say that because I truly believe that we are just getting started. With our innovation, our amazing team, our unrivaled customer service and a growing roster of global partnerships, I am convinced that we will continue to outperform in an addressable advertising market that is racing towards a $1 trillion TAM.\nOne aspect of our business in 2021 that was particularly encouraging was the pace at which we signed major customer agreements. As the year progressed, we signed an increasing number of long-term commitments with some of the largest brand advertisers in the world. Last year, the top 25 advertisers on our platform increased their spend on the platform more than 50% compared to the prior year. And that's before some of these long-term agreements have fully activated. Momentum is also growing due to increased awareness and understanding of our value among brand marketers and their agencies.\nI'd like to spend my time today looking back on the highlights of 2021 but also discuss the factors that are shaping 2022 into what I expect will be the most impactful year TTD has ever had. I believe this will provide color on why brand marketers are increasingly gravitating to our platform.\nLooking back on 2021, one of the highlights was the launch of our biggest product ever, Solimar. As you know, we launched Solimar on 7/7 after years of investment. But as with any major platform overhaul, there's always the question of exactly what the impact will be. The answer is that Solimar has been an upgrade to our business in every way. It helps advertisers and agencies embrace completely new ways of thinking about data, measurement, goal setting and campaign optimization. And I'm pleased to report that as of today, the majority of ad impressions on our platform are now bought via Solimar.\nAt the current pace, we expect to deprecate the legacy platform before the fourth quarter of this year. To accomplish a complete transition to the new platform within about a year is an impressive feat by anyone's standards, and it speaks to the value that advertisers are realizing with Solimar. Solimar was created to help advertisers make better data-driven decisions at every step of the marketing funnel, and in doing so, take full advantage of the power of the open Internet. We wanted to make setup easier and decisions more data-driven. We also wanted to make certain that our AI and machine learning product branded as [COA] was always on when the benefit was obvious.\nWith a better blend of human and machine, advertisers can apply the right data automatically. And Solimar can optimize everything from predictive clearing to audience targeting to price discovery. Every ad campaign becomes more effective. Every ad dollar is working as hard as it can. And as a result, the flywheel spins faster, activating even more campaign dollars.\nLet me share some data about how the move to Solimar is going. First, coadoption Solimar is now over 90%, nearly 50% higher than with the legacy platform. Now nearly all of our advertisers are getting richer, data-driven insights and recommendations on how to reach and measure their target audiences most effectively and across the full scope of channels to optimize performance. In fact, average channel usage for Solimar campaigns has also increased about 50%. With Solimar, advertisers get a better perspective on cross-channel performance and insight into how an omnichannel campaign can take a consumer through an integrated advertising experience. And finally, and probably one of the most important changes, for those advertisers that have switched to Solimar, the average number of data elements applied to each impression has more than doubled.\nMany of the amazing results we are seeing from Solimar are due to restructuring of our data marketplace and the courage of our data partners to try something new in the hopes of upgrading the entire open Internet. As a result, Solimar is a bit of a 2 for 1, a better decisioning engine and a better data marketplace.\nLet me spend a moment on the improved data marketplace as it represents a significant upgrade to how the entire industry currently thinks about data and data pricing. Until now, I would describe the marketplace for data in digital advertising as somewhat anemic. And that's largely because of the way that data has traditionally been priced across the web. And walled garden's data pricing is opaque with effectively 0 price discovery.\nIn the open web, historically, data pricing has been more fixed than variable, which leaves little room for price discovery or even value discovery. It's akin to a real estate agent charging the fixed dollar rate regardless of the value of the home that's being sold. In the case of data, that has meant that each data element could be too expensive relative to the value of the impression. This also then becomes an inhibitor to advertisers who want to apply a full scope of data to every impression.\nBut with Solimar and the new data marketplace, we have shifted our data pricing model away from fixed rates toward percentage of CPM. This would never have been possible without the support and commitment of the hundreds of data partners who participate on our platform and who were willing to make this change. This allows for much greater flexibility and data deployment based on both value and relevance. We have created a market where there's more accurate price discovery for data, which is more closely aligned to the value it creates instead of high fixed rates.\nAdditionally, there's another major data marketplace design change that will fully roll out in the first half of '22. This change will address the major obstacle to cure the open Internet data anemia. Currently, there is a disincentive to layer multiple data elements onto the same impression because the cost is prohibitive and price discovery has been a problem. With variable pricing now universal in our data marketplace, we can now add fractional pricing. This means we can offer, for example, a vast set of data options for customers that in total doesn't necessarily cost them more but activates more data sources and pay supplier based on precise value created for the advertiser. In doing so, data providers have the opportunity to make more money in aggregate. This creates incentive to use data whenever it adds value and rewards data companies for the value they create. We expect that this will create the most robust data marketplace ever on the open Internet. Not only will the open Internet benefit, but we will be able to layer in more data, significantly enriching each ad impression for the advertiser. In total, this increases the use of data.\nAs we enrich each impression, advertisers on our platform become more effective and they invest more. Already our data marketplace changes have been so successful that we have seen advertiser bid win rates increased significantly because they have been much more precise in understanding the value of each ad impression. Again, this means advertisers are inclined to spend more because they are achieving even better ROI, making the flywheel spin faster.\nLooking back on another highlight from this last year, we blaze new trails in the rapidly emerging world of shopper marketing, another greenfield that is open to us because of the use of data.\nAs of the fourth quarter, we are up and running with the Walmart DSP with select major advertisers. The initial results have been very encouraging. BIC is one of the early adopters. As you probably know, BIC is headquartered in France but is a global leader in consumer products such as ballpoint pens, lighters and grooming. And Walmart is a major retail partner for them. In December, BIC ran holiday campaigns for some key products, including men's and women's razors, using the new Walmart DSP. The results were even better than we hoped for. BIC achieved return on ad spend, or ROAS, of just under 500%. That means for every advertising dollar, they drove $5 in consumer purchases.\nThis data is significant for a few reasons. First, with closed loop measurement, BIC is able to get a very rapid assessment of ROAS. The shopper data available in the Walmart DSP makes it much easier for brands like BIC to make the connection between campaign spend and consumer purchase. And second, ROAS of 500% is well above the industry average. According to Nielsen, a good ROAS is around 270%. So to take an industry-standard benchmark and almost double it is pretty staggering.\nMatt DePalo is BIC's Senior Manager of Omnichannel Growth, and he recently spoke about the power of the Walmart DSP. To quote him directly, he said, \"I don't want to overstate it, but this is something the industry has been waiting for, for a very long time. And now we finally have it at our disposal. We have suspected that The Trade Desk would be a powerful complement to Walmart's capabilities, and this validated our suspicion.\"\nBIC represents the sentiment of many advertisers. They want retail data to help them improve and their ad spend in digital. They want to better understand how media moves people through the purchase journey. I firmly believe that 2022 will be the year that advertisers start to realize the power of shopper marketing. Walmart is leading the charge here.\nAmy Lanzi is the commerce practice lead at Publicis for North America. She recently spoke with The Current, our online news site, about how the Walmart DSP is capturing the attention of CMOs who previously weren't has hands-on with the retailers. To quote her directly, she said, \"It used to be that you would negotiate how you've got a better display in a physical store. Now it's a dynamic conversation that includes their digital shelves and how brands can reach Walmart shoppers who are outside the retailers ecosystem.\"\nIn the coming quarters, we'll have more to say about how we're partnering with other retailers in innovative ways to unlock the power of shopper marketing data for advertisers. As I mentioned, this is just one of the areas where brand marketing leaders are gaining a greater appreciation of the value of programmatic.\nWhen looking back on the amazing success and land grab year that was 2021, it is impossible to not spend some time talking about the rise of CTV. In 2021, CTV was once again the largest driver of spend on our platform. Last year, more than 15,000 advertisers spent on CTV on our platform, and we saw the number of advertisers that spent over $1 million in CTV almost double compared to 2020.\nAnd I highlight CTV again because it is such an important driver of the brand shift to programmatic more broadly. For most brands, TV is the largest element of their advertising campaigns. The TV team is often the power center of a brand marketing department. As TV digitizes, thanks to the massive consumer shift to streaming, advertisers are embracing the power of programmatic in their most significant channel. Once TV advertisers realize its potential to focus rapidly shifts to the value of programmatic in an omnichannel context, and this is what I mean when I said in the past that CTV is probably the most important driver of change across digital advertising.\nOf course, it is not just a consumer shift that's driving advertisers to embrace CTV. TV content companies are also evolving their models at warp speed, and we continue to partner with all of the major CTV providers worldwide. Each year, the inventory avails on our platform continue to rapidly increase.\nAnd as we enter this year's upfront season, I expect we'll continue to see large TV companies further prioritize CTV as a part of that process. Indeed, The Trade Desk has already been invited to participate in some of the digital upfront programs this year. And while we've talked a lot in recent quarters about partnerships with major TV content companies in North America and Europe, the same dynamic is happening now in Asia where viewers are also rapidly shifting to CTV or OTT.\nFor example, we recently launched [Gao], one of the fastest-growing streaming platforms in Japan. Regardless of location, major brand advertisers increasingly realize the vital role that CTV plays in reaching audiences that have left or were never present on linear TV.\nWe recently ran a campaign for one of Europe's top carmakers, Renault, in Spain, working with their agency, Omnicom. The campaign focused on a launch of a new SUV in Spain, and Renault wanted to reach as many potentially interested car buyers as possible. With CTV, Renault achieved a significant double-digit incremental reach over linear.\nWe're seeing the same phenomenon with brand advertisers around the world. They are embracing CTV as an essential element of their massive TV ad campaign. And because of the outsized effect that TV has on most marketing departments, this growing adoption spins the flywheel faster for us across all advertising channels.\nNow switching gears a bit. I'd like to talk about the future and why 2022 is set up to be our biggest year ever, not just in financial performance, but also in strategic leadership and increasing our market share. Yesterday, we announced another very big initiative, OpenPath. This is the biggest direct step we've made yet to improve the supply chain for our clients, us and the open Internet.\nLet me take a moment to explain what this is. OpenPath is a product that enables content owners from TV and across the Web to plug in to CTV directly. OpenPath is a direct pipeline to publish our inventory for any publisher that chooses to integrate directly with us. An inefficient supply chain is bad for advertisers and for publishers. We are very pleased to launch OpenPath with some of the largest journalistic publishers in the world, including The Washington Post, Conde Nast, Reuters, The Tribune and USA TODAY.\nOpenPath is especially helpful for larger publishers and content owners that want to do their own yield management. We are not competing with SSPs or becoming an ad network. We represent the advertisers in the auction. Our goal in creating this product is to provide a high bid directly to publishers and content owners who want to do their own yield management.\nOne of our core operating principles since our inception is the pursuit of a level playing field for digital advertising with transparency on all sides. We believe that's the best way to build trust in digital advertising, which will drive overall market growth. And we also believe that on a level playing field, everyone gets to compete fairly on the value they provide. As a demand side platform, we're confident that on a level playing field, we will continue to outperform and gain more market share of the growing TAM.\nWith this product launch, we also announced that we are no longer buying from Google so-called open bidding or OB product. You may recall that open bidding is one of the main focus areas of recent antitrust lawsuits against Google, including the one from the Texas State Attorney General's office. With this, and as part of our ongoing supply chain optimization initiatives, we will continue to prune supply paths that are opaque, unfair or inefficient. That said, we plan to continue to buy on Google's Ad Exchange.\nFor all the SSPs that provide yield optimization for publishers, we expect that this product and policy change will result in more spend for them.\nYou might be interested as to why we started with journalism in terms of our initial partners. Journalism has more at stake than perhaps any other market segment here. Journalism relies on advertising. And the ad model for newspapers of 30 years ago has evolved into something very different today. It's vital that we preserve the value exchange of advertising for journalism content because journalism is such an important factor in the free flow of trusted information in any functioning society. But OpenPath will scale to any publisher that wants a direct path to our demand.\nLet me just reiterate that this does not mean that The Trade Desk is getting into the SSP or the supply side business. This is not about that at all. We won't be getting into yield management or any of the various value propositions that a number of the great SSPs provide. OpenPath is simply a direct path into inventory. This is something that our advertising clients have been asking us for, for a long time, and they become more aware of the supply side inefficiencies over the past few months. The impact will be positive for SSPs that have invested in their publisher relationships and are offering value in terms of yield management from companies such as Magnite, (inaudible) and Index Exchange.\nAs with any maturing market, as it becomes more efficient, the companies that succeed will be the ones that provide clear value and differentiate themselves to customers.\nAs I said, we are launching OpenPath in partnership with some of the world's leading journalistic outlets. They have been incredibly enthusiastic about this initiative. Hopefully, you saw some of the press coverage yesterday. But just to quote a couple of them, Conde Nast said, \"We are pleased to be working with The Trade Desk on OpenPath to enable deeper conversations with our clients about inventory transparency and performance.\" The Washington Post said, \"We have long believed that a more streamlined supply chain benefits both advertisers and publishers.\" And McClatchy said, \"OpenPath aligns with our objective to build a transparent well-lit digital ad environment driven by journalism that strengthens the communities we serve.\" Those are just a few, but I could not be more excited about the early momentum for Openpath.\nOf course, another area I'm especially excited about for '22 is the progress the industry is making with UID 2. More major publishers around the world are committing to UID 2, and more advertisers are transacting on UID 2 on our platform.\nKG Media, Indonesia's biggest media network, is the latest publisher in Asia to announce its support of UID 2. KG boasts an extensive portfolio of publishing properties, including newspapers, TV networks and retail. They believe that UID 2 is not just a replacement but a significant upgrade to cookies as a common currency of the open Internet, creating a better experience for both consumers and advertisers.\nThat was certainly the experience for Coco Village, a manufacturer and retailer of high-end children's toys and furniture servicing the North American market. They wanted to secure an easy way to leverage their valuable first-party CRM data to find new audiences for their products. Working with UID 2, they were able to model new potential customer groups, drive incremental reach of almost 40% and a return on a spend of more than 1,000%.\nAdditionally, we believe many of the same publishers that are signing up for OpenPath will also sign up for UID 2. We expect that these 2 products will both improve the open Internet and will help to increase the adoption of the other.\nIn addition to publishers and advertisers who are adopting UID 2, important industry trade groups are also weighing in with their support. Perhaps one of the most important groups is the MMA because they represent the voice of the brand marketer and their Board comprises many of the world's leading CMOs. I was invited to join their Board last year precisely because brand marketers want to be fully engaged in new approaches to identity and measurement. The MMA views UID 2 as a solution that can solve for the identity needs of the open Internet. To quote their CEO, Greg Stewart, directly, \"Identity is the key to the future of marketing and especially important to marketers in taking full advantage of the larger reach and need for transparency to consumer consent at the open Web affords. UID 2 has a great potential to be a solution that the whole industry can work on collectively to craft a compliant and effective identity solution for everyone.\"\nTo finish, let me just summarize why I'm so bullish about '22 and our future. More than ever, the biggest brands in the world appreciate the value of data-driven advertising. And increasingly, they are embracing our platform.\nI've spent time today talking about some of the more compelling recent drivers of that growing interest. And over the years, we have built trust with those advertisers and their agencies that we can deliver premium value to their campaigns.\nThis business model is key in generating alpha in revenue and market share growth. We continue to have customer retention rates above 95%. Our engineering teams continue to lead the industry in innovation, charting new value opportunities for our advertisers. As a result, we are one of the few high-growth technology companies that consistently generate strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. Our profitability and positive cash generation allows us to make long-term investments that will ensure we continue to provide premium value. That includes Solimar, which is creating new value for advertisers by unleashing data and driving a greater return on ad spend, spinning the flywheel for advertiser campaigns. It's driving our leadership in CTV, the fastest-growing channel in digital advertising and a driver of new thinking across the marketing spectrum. It positions us to make a supply chain that is more efficient for our advertisers and agencies in 2022 with initiatives like OpenPath. It enables us to pioneer work in shopper marketing, a $100 billion market.\nYou'll see us forge partnerships with major retailers worldwide, including Walgreens. Just yesterday, they announced that advertisers will be able to leverage new audience data services on our platform based on anonymized Walgreens shopper data. It has also allowed us to become a leader in political advertising. 2022 will be an important midterm election year in the United States. We have spent years building an objective and independent platform open to registered candidates on all sides that can help drive discussions of substance in the political arena.\nIn 2022, we will make meaningful progress with partners and industry bodies to make measurement better, especially for CTV and all digital spend outside the United States. Our profitability and free cash flow will also allow us to invest for global growth.\n2/3 of global advertising spend is outside of the United States. This is a major focus for us. Once again, we saw strong growth in our international markets in the fourth quarter driven largely by CTV. In fact, our CTV share of spend more than doubled in Europe in the quarter. And we continue to open promising new markets such as Taiwan, India, Italy and the Nordics with impressive leaders who are making very rapid inroads. We are a global company, and we expect our international revenue to outpace North America over the long term because of the investments we're making in these markets.\nWe are very well positioned for 2022 and beyond. Our business has many growth drivers, as we've discussed today. And what I'm most excited about is the shift we're seeing among more and more senior brand marketers. In a variety of dimensions, marketers are becoming more familiar and enthusiastic about programmatic advertising. Whether it's the performance value of Solimar, the Holy Grail of retail data, the CTV revolution or new supply path models, they understand the power of data-driven advertising to help them differentiate and drive growth in their businesses. And that's the most rewarding thing of all.\nI could not be more excited about the opportunity in front of us and our growth prospects into 2022 and beyond.\nAnd with that, I'll pass the baton to Blake, who will give you more color on the quarter.\n\nBlake Jeffrey Grayson\n\nCFO, The Trade Desk, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We delivered strong results in the fourth quarter, capping off a great year for our business. Q4 revenue was $396 million, a 24% increase from a year ago. Excluding political spend related to the U.S. elections, which represented a high single-digit percentage share of our business in Q4 of 2020, revenue increased approximately 36% year-over-year. That represented a slight acceleration from the prior year, which is impressive considering we experienced a strong recovery at the end of 2020.\nFor 2021, we ended the year with almost $6.2 billion in spend on our platform and nearly $1.2 billion in revenue, representing 43% year-over-year revenue growth. We also ended the year with adjusted EBITDA of just over $500 million and generated nearly $320 million in free cash flow in 2021.\nWe are enthusiastic that the combination of our business strategy of being the default DSP for the open Internet where we only represent the buy side and avoid conflicts too often prevalent in our industry by those who own inventory, along with a proven business model that generates strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow, is producing solid and consistent growth as we continue our progression towards a total addressable market of around $1 trillion.\nWe have been encouraged to see advertisers accelerate their shift to data-driven advertising in 2021. Our results reflect the ongoing strength of programmatic advertising and the value that The Trade Desk provides thousands of agencies and brands as they work to connect with their customers across our platform every day.\nFor both the quarter and the full year, connected TV continued to be our fastest growing channel at scale around the world. As Jeff mentioned, Solimar is now over 50% adoption, and we are seeing promising results as customers on average are utilizing Solimar to leverage more data elements than they did previously.\nIn Q4, our partnership with Walmart officially kicked off. UID 2 had significant momentum. And as we have consistently stated, we have seen no material impact on our business from the iOS platform changes in 2021.\nIn addition to the strong top line performance in Q4, we generated $192 million in adjusted EBITDA or about 48% of revenue. When we outperformed on the top line, we often see that outperformance drop down to EBITDA, which it did again in Q4.\nEBITDA continued to benefit from temporarily lower-than-expected operating expense growth, partly driven by the continued virtual environment that we are still predominantly operating in. Even recognizing that, we are extremely proud of our continued ability to substantially grow our top line revenue while also producing meaningfully positive EBITDA.\nFrom a scaled channel perspective, CTV by a wide margin led our growth again during the quarter. For Q4, video, which includes CTV and mobile, each represented the largest percentage share of spend. Display, which also grew very nicely in Q4, and audio ended the year representing about 15% and 5% of our business, respectively.\nGeographically, North America represented 86%, and international represented 14% of our business for the quarter. Shanghai and Hong Kong drove spend growth in Northern APAC. And Australia and Singapore led our growth in Southern APAC. In terms of EMEA, our London and Paris offices led the way. CTV growth across EMEA was again quite strong in Q4 and still represents a fraction of the share of spend we see in North America.\nIn terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, nearly all of them exhibited healthy growth during the quarter. Shopping, which includes e-commerce, hobbies and interest in business were the strongest performers in Q4. We believe there is still the potential for share gain and improvement in most of our verticals.\nThe law and politics vertical decelerated materially year-over-year in Q4 as expected due to the comparison against the 2020 U.S. election cycle.\nOperating expenses were $421 million in Q4, up 97% from a year ago. As expected, the growth in operating expenses during the quarter was driven primarily by stock-based compensation. Specifically, $158 million in stock-based compensation expense related to a long-term CEO performance award that was recorded in G&A expense. The $158 million expense included a tranche of the grant that accelerated based on stock price achievement and relative benchmark performance thresholds during Q4. In Q4, excluding stock-based compensation, operating expenses were $216 million, up 23% year-over-year. For the full year, we gained significant operating leverage in both our platform operations and G&A areas as we scaled the business and improved our efficiency.\nIncome tax was a benefit of $35 million in the quarter, mainly due to the tax benefits associated with employee stock-based awards, the timing of which can be variable. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $208 million or $0.42 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was [$163] million, and free cash flow was $151 million in Q4. The strong cash generation during the quarter was driven predominantly by our operating results.\nI would like to remind you that the timing of cash collections and payments can significantly impact cash from operating activities and free cash flow results on a quarterly basis.\nDSOs exiting Q4 were 107 days, down 14 days from a year ago. DPOs were 91 days, down 10 days from a year ago.\nWe exited Q4 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Our balance sheet had $959 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. We have no debt on the balance sheet.\nTurning now to our outlook. The year has started out strong, and we estimate Q1 revenue to be at least $303 million, which would represent growth of 38% on a year-over-year basis, which is a slight acceleration over the prior year. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $91 million in Q1.\nTurning now to expenses. In 2022, we anticipate our stock-based compensation to rise from our normal run rate. This is being driven by approximately [$265] million of stock-based compensation expense we expect to include in 2022 related to the long-term CEO performance award. At the end of 2021, the performance award had [$616] million in unrecognized stock-based compensation, which is expected to be included in our G&A expense over approximately 4 years but could be accelerated if the threshold criteria is met earlier than expected. The total amount expensed is unrelated to whether any of the performance award thresholds are ever met. Only shares that have met the threshold criteria outlined in the performance plan are factored into our total shares outstanding.\nExcluding the performance grant for 2022, we expect total operating expense growth to increase on a year-over-year basis. Considering our ability to generate strong EBITDA and cash flow, we see significant opportunities to invest in our business with a massive available market in front of us that can generate long-term growth such as the generational shift to connected TV, the expanding retail data opportunity and the expectation that our international operations will grow faster than North America over the long term.\nTo help take advantage of those opportunities, we expect to increase our rate of hiring over pandemic-affected periods and will do so in a competitive hiring market. We also expect that return-to-work expenses will begin to revert to prepandemic levels, including live events, travel and other related activities. Understanding all of that, we do expect the operating expense structure of the company to be better than it was prior to the pandemic, and over the long term, expect sales and marketing and technology and development areas to represent a larger share of our investment.\nWe are proud of the fact that we are one of the few high-growth technology companies that can consistently generate strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow.\nWe expect 2022 capital expenditures and capitalized software investments to be at least $75 million. We expect data center and infrastructure spend to drive the majority of the growth year-over-year and represent a larger share of our expenditures relative to office facilities compared to the prior year.\nAnd finally, with regards to tax. Absent any changes to U.S. tax laws, we expect our full year 2022 tax rate to be about 25%. This is obviously impacted by any tax benefits associated with employee stock-based awards, the timing of which can be variable.\nIn closing, we are pleased with the momentum of our business and the strong start to the year. We are highly optimistic about the long-term prospects for our business in 2022 and beyond. With large growth drivers such as CTV, our international business, our retail data opportunity that just kicked off in Q4 with the Walmart DSP, the 2022 midterm elections in the U.S. and our recent platform upgrade in Solimar, I believe we have significant opportunities to grow our business. In addition, we are in a position to drive not only long-term growth, but also to scale our business efficiently and continue to improve in the years to come.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions."
